Friends, you are listening to WCSB 89.3 FM in Cleveland.

00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,200
Heya.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,300
Ahimsa.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:10,720
Ahimsa.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,280
Oye.

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:20,580
Ogas.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,560
Oye.

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,080
Oye.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,880
Play sex music.

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,620
Play sex music.

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:24,660
Oye.

12
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,420
Oye.

13
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:25,860
Oye.

14
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:26,700
Oye.

15
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:27,580
Oye.

16
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,120
Oye.

17
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:28,400


18
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:28,840
Oye.

19
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:28,980
Oye.

20
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:29,860
Oye.

21
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,740
WCSB Cleveland.

22
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,200
Wingweight Fuzzwood is now under surveillance.

23
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,040
Oye.

24
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:35,880
Oye.

25
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,300
WCSB Cleveland.

26
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,500
We play sex music.

27
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,180
Oye.

28
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:39,760
Oye.

29
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,280
Oye.

30
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:41,260
Oye.

31
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,020
Oye.

32
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:42,340
Oye.

33
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:42,420
Oye.

34
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:42,820
Oye.

35
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:43,220
Oye.

36
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:43,220


37
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:43,220


38
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:43,220


39
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:43,220


40
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:43,220


41
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,240
To catch a thief, follow the money.

42
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,380
That idea has served as a guide for crime fighters throughout the years.

43
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,740
Today, crime fighters also follow the money on the internet.

44
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,760
As business transactions on the internet have grown,

45
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,820
so have the internet.

46
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,020
The number of scams and schemes.

47
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:09,160
That's why the U.S. Postal Inspectors have joined in the effort to stamp out internet fraud.

48
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,420
For more information, including tips on how to avoid online schemes,

49
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:19,560
you can visit www.usps.com.

50
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,120
That's usps.com.

53
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:33,800
More details after the subgenius hour of slack.

54
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,740
Welcome to the U.S. Postal Inspectors.

55
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,400
Welcome to the U.S. Postal Inspectors.

56
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,140
Greetings from Hollywood, ladies and gentlemen.

57
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,720
Ordinarily, we think that American women are the most beautiful women in the world.

58
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,820
So many of them use toilets to help them stay that way.

59
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:55,820
But this time, I got my man to help them shoot toilets and made the dream come true.

60
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,500
And may your seventh toilet be so beautiful that it will make you feel like you're in a toilet.

61
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,340
So good, it surpasses the other six.

62
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,220
Curl up in a ball and cover your head with

63
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,320
the subgenius hour of slack.

64
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,380
God, please, because I want my Western Burger done right.

65
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,400
Oh, this is Timothy Larry reminding you that just as you need slack,

66
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,900
Bob needs your help.

67
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,200
Send in those pledges and praise Bob.

68
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,520
Good morning, good morning, good morning, good morning.

69
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,260
I look forward to talking.

70
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,260
I look forward to talking.

71
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,360
Congress is considered.

72
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,980
We need to continue.

73
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,000
Terrorists attacks on our own country.

74
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,340
We must also provide terrorists and extremists the tools they need to keep new attacks on our nation.

75
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,260
We need terror.

76
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,500
We need another attack.

77
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,600
The principle behind this program is clear.

78
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,280
Colleague Sheikh Mohammed rules.

79
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,180
Next week, I will return to New York where I might live.

80
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,880
We rededicate ourselves to terrorists.

81
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,060
Terrorists, terrorists, terrorists, terrorists, terrorists, terrorists, terrorists and extremists.

82
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,340
Sheikh, the American people, thank you for listening.

83
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:09,760
When you readinatorora, at the moment,iga3

84
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,640
So it was time again, once again.

85
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,080
Eh, Charleston, if you'll at the hint.

86
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,240
Over, and I remember.

87
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,460
Since he got a har complaining that maybe there are terrorists hiding in the corner of our house.

88
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:23,460


89
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:23,460


90
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:23,460


91
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:23,460


92
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:23,940
America may have warned you this week about theц.

93
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,000
Dangerous.

94
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,640
Ch warned.

95
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:27,940
We now look pleasant.

96
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:27,940


97
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,360
rice. I get chills.

98
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,720
But the human race, as we know it, has

99
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,760
run its course.

100
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,700
And it was a

101
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,740
crooked run where the lead

102
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,680
horse broke down in the middle of the last

103
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,620
furlong and grew

104
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,060
wings.

105
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,720
And never returned.

106
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,920
Oh, well, so much for that BS.

107
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,020
Anyway, it's Terror-Thon

108
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,700
again. Time to pledge

109
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,320
to your local favorite

110
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,640
terrorist group in this case.

111
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,760
The subgenius, our

112
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,960
out of slack, the Church of the Subgenius.

113
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,080
Yes, my friends!

114
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,040
Charleston is a laid-back

115
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,020
DJ,

116
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,280
but I'm fired up!

117
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,720
I'm fired up on leftover Halloween

118
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,600
candy and rock star energy

119
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,800
drinks, and we are going to hammer

120
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,820
you until you pledge!

121
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,620
Yes, you! Not the

122
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,620
generic you of all listeners, but the

123
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,820
you specifically. Nor the letter

124
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,740
you. We have to disclude also no one

125
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,640
named ooh may call in and

126
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,180
pledge anything except for their

127
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,160
total fealty to the Church of the

128
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,260
Subgenius. And you can do that

129
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,260
too! Friends, we're drawing the line

130
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,280
right here. Are you with Bob

131
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,080
or are you against him?

132
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,460
If there's no sand for you to draw a line

133
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,280
in, pull the sand out of your errant

134
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,300
pockets you've been walking around for a long time

135
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,440
probably looking for, well, not

136
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,100
work, looking for slack, haven't you?

137
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,300
Sometimes in the snow, sometimes

138
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,520
in the rain. You ain't gonna get

139
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,000
no slack here until you call

140
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,180
that number. 687

141
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,260
6900.

142
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:58,900
687

143
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,040
6900. Friends, you think

144
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,080
NPR pledge drives are

145
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,300
irritating? Oh, you haven't even

146
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,220
begun to understand

147
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,660
irritation yet.

148
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,160
We make the NPR

149
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,360
pledge drives look unobtrusive

150
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,260
by comparison because

151
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,040
we are not going to let up!

152
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,680
No, sir, ma'am!

153
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,080
We are going to hammer you

154
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,800
and bury you!

155
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,700
Because, friends, Bob,

156
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,820
I don't know about you, but

157
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,380
I love Bob. I'm not gonna

158
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,060
let Bob dry on the vine.

159
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,680
And I love WCSB, the station

160
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,560
that brings you the word of Bob.

161
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,380
I love

162
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,540
Bob myself. I love myself.

163
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,540
I love Bob, and I love Bob when he's

164
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,480
wet in the pants, and you'll be wet in the

165
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,380
pants if you send in a

166
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,960
donation or call in a

167
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,460
donation to 687 6900

168
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,440
at WCSB, which stands for

169
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,420
Wiley Caustic Snotbags.

170
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,420
No, it doesn't. It sounds...

171
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,080
Does it stand for anything? I don't know.

172
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,080
I don't know what it stands for, but you could talk

173
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,200
to Princess We Are

174
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,120
No Queen of All the UFOs herself!

175
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,400
She's in there right now taking those calls!

176
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,120
Friends, Bob

177
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,240
is... I don't know about you, but

178
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,680
Bob is my raison

179
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,140
d'etre.

180
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,980
And he raises my debt.

181
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,620
B.O.B.

182
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,320
is the reason to be,

183
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,260
baby.

184
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,660
And now...

185
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,200
Yeah, I know, you're going, well,

186
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,720
now all those religious, uh,

187
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,620
charlatans are always haranguing

188
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,580
us for money. Did you hear the news

189
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,200
about that meth-buying

190
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,680
gay sex preacher?

191
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,360
That Pastor Hager

192
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,160
or whatever kind of rhymes with swagger?

193
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,540
Uh, friends,

194
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,640
in that religion,

195
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,360
which has 30 million members,

196
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,380
when you get caught

197
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,960
buying meth and having

198
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,300
gay sex massages, why, they

199
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,520
fire you. In this religion,

200
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,620
I get a bonus if I

201
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,160
have enough energy to do something!

202
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,020
Something like that. So, friends,

203
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,180
when you don't pledge,

204
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,400
when you do not call

205
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,180
216-687-6900,

206
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,580
you are

207
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,060
torturing

208
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,020
Bob. You are mutilating

209
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,180
that man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

210
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,140
And do you know

211
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,560
what Bob did for you?

212
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,000
Yes? He cared nothing

213
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,200
for you. He ignored you!

214
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,200
Yes! And yet, are you

215
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,020
going to return the favor that same way? No!

216
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,880
Don't you want...

217
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,000
Don't you want to kill and mutilate Bob?

218
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,240
When you call and support this station,

219
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,020
you mutilate J.R. Bob Dobbs!

220
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:34,840
And you...

221
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,940
I see someone who's at the door here. Someone is

222
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,980
pounding at the door trying to get in, friends.

223
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,240
And, friends, you should

224
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,280
be pounding at this door with your

225
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,000
telephone calls. Pound those keys!

226
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,300
I'm going to, uh, do the

227
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,340
traditional thing of reading out the

228
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,380
pledge premiums of what

229
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,620
you actually get, because...

230
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,300
Because, I guess, just delivering you

231
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,540
this show isn't enough.

232
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,400
Oh, no! That's not enough. You have to get

233
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,260
a pledge premium, and they're actually

234
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,360
pretty cool premiums. I would like to

235
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,360
ask each and every one of you a very personal

236
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,440
question, if I may. How many of you

237
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,100
are suffering from empty pockets?

238
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,440
Well, if you are, there are lots of things worse

239
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,380
than empty pockets. There's a

240
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,200
syndrome known as the empty, empty,

241
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,280
empty skull. And we find

242
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,620
that many of you

243
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,460
have hollow places in your cranium.

244
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,360
All too many. And these

245
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,480
can be taken care of by simply donating

246
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,820
$5, $10,

247
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,240
$15, $25, or

248
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,720
$30 to Station WCSB

249
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,380
in Cleveland, your favorite

250
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,420
alternative station, the station that brings

251
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,800
you all of this crap

252
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,820
that you're listening to right now.

253
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,320
But I personally love it, and I'm sure there are plenty

254
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,280
of you out there who love it personally, too.

255
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,100
I mean, in more than a physical way. But

256
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,460
personally, personally have strong feelings

257
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,320
for not only this show, but

258
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,300
inanimate objects in your room, which

259
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,540
reminds me of a joke. Um, a doctor

260
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,040
is sitting agonizing...

261
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,940
Never mind. Please,

262
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,060
please call in and pledge tonight to

263
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,940
keep the hour of slack forcing

264
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,440
this stuff down your throat.

265
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,360
That's right, friends. You're paying

266
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,940
to help force the word

267
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,900
Bob down the ear holes of the

268
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,640
listeners of Northern Ohio.

269
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,500
And making the...

270
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,880
If this station had more money, why it could be

271
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,560
stronger? It could

272
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,960
go down those ear holes all that

273
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,240
much more forcefully.

274
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,040
And now listen to this. Listen to

275
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,960
what you get. If you were to pledge,

276
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,920
if you were one of these big spenders and actually

277
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,200
pledge $30 and up,

278
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,800
the subgenius premium

279
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,900
is the Arise

280
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,180
DVD. Yes, our

281
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,220
great DVD as seen

282
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,360
on night flight all through the 80s.

283
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,240
Only they showed the censored

284
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,200
version and called it Love That

285
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,740
Bob. The 2005

286
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,320
re-edited, newly

287
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,960
uncensored

288
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,020
director's cut of Arise and

289
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,080
several other shorts and extras.

290
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,140
It was yours!

291
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,900
This DVD-R is yours for only...

292
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,800
the $30 pledge to this station at

293
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,340
216-687-

294
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,060
6900.

295
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,340
How could I forget

296
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,960
such a name? Now, if you

297
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,140
eschewed the word of Bob

298
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,040
and wanted to prove you didn't love him,

299
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,880
you could get a WCSB

300
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,980
long-sleeved logo shirt in black

301
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,160
or with a

302
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,240
white logo or a gray

303
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,020
shirt with a black logo or a

304
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,180
WCSB umbrella to keep

305
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,240
the rain of manure off of

306
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,840
your per-balled pants.

307
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,180
And of a sweatshirt

308
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,120
with the embroidered logo and

309
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,820
the hooded zippered sweatshirt.

310
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,200
These are all the things you get for $30 and above

311
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,180
premium, friend. But I know that

312
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,260
that may be more than you have in your

313
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,900
pockets. Oh, that's more than many of our

314
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,900
friends have, but yet they can all

315
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,500
contribute something for $5.

316
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,100
For only $5, now,

317
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,220
friends, most shows don't give you a premium

318
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,140
for $5, but for $5 you

319
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,380
get the subgenius pamphlet,

320
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,280
which is a 16-page

321
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,900
book. A book!

322
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,520
For only, and friends,

323
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,840
it'll take you days of

324
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,980
extra meditation in the Holy Chamber,

325
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,780
the throne room, to

326
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,260
read through that thing.

327
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,800
That's for a $5 pledge, because I know that

328
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,740
some of you are just pathetic

329
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,840
and only have $5.

330
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,100
But yet, who does Bob love most?

331
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,740
The little old lady who could only

332
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,600
give her last $5 or the

333
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,680
rich man who gave him

334
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,920
$10,000 when he could have given him $10 million.

335
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,760
Friends, Bob loves that rich

336
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,500
man the most.

337
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,500
Yes, we know that many of you are the same

338
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,340
as the elderly in our nation. You're a little

339
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,340
bit of an addled brain that you're making, trying to

340
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,360
make difficult decisions. Do you want food?

341
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,740
Oh, but I was wrong. Or do you want medication?

342
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,260
I was wrong. I said that for $5

343
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,340
you get the pamphlet, friends. That's not

344
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,380
all you get. You get the pamphlet

345
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,440
for any donation to this

346
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,560
station. For $5 you also

347
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,340
get the Dobbs head

348
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,320
decal. That's right, the glimmering,

349
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,980
glowing face of Bob in pure

350
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,120
black and white dot patterns on a

351
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,200
vinyl... It's shiny.

352
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,400
Four by... Four and a half by four and a half inch

353
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:57,640
sticker. It's beautiful.

354
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,960
You can pray to it. You can have

355
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,960
sex with it. You can do anything

356
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,140
you want.

357
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,740
You can have private moments.

358
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,020
For $10 you get the

359
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,060
giant bumper sticker that says

360
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,940
I'm mad too, Bob.

361
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,860
And has a picture of the

362
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,840
mad Bob on it. For the

363
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,700
$15 pledge,

364
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,240
friends, you get

365
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,940
the triple X rated

366
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,840
hour of slack number nine.

367
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,020
The newly released triple X rated

368
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,980
only played on the internet

369
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,020
outlets. You'd never hear it on the

370
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,060
station because this station

371
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,620
has taste and goodness.

372
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,480
But this CD,

373
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,180
which is a full res CD

374
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,760
with 30 different tracks

375
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,960
of filth!

376
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,440
It's so horrible.

377
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,780
Not because it's sexual especially.

378
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,220
It's just dirty.

379
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,120
And for $20 you

380
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,160
get not only that and the pamphlet,

381
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,240
X rated,

382
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,980
hour of slack number nine, plus

383
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,000
the pamphlet, you also get

384
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,140
X rated subgenius show number 10

385
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,960
which no one has heard yet.

386
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,980
Because it's

387
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,140
it'll kill you. It's so filthy.

388
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,060
It is. It has killed before.

389
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,160
And we're thinking once again about all

390
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,240
those poor people out there who can hardly afford

391
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,260
to roll two fingers together

392
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,140
or perhaps smoke their own eyebrows.

393
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,900
The idea of food or medication

394
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,740
shouldn't be a problem because this station,

395
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,080
WCSB, is both your

396
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,940
supernal food and your

397
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,140
fine medication. And if it isn't,

398
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,940
the church of the subgenius

399
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,200
certainly is. And think

400
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,080
of it that way, friends. You will not only

401
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,940
eat, you will breathe, you will drink,

402
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,020
you will believe, and you will feel

403
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,040
a whole hell of a lot better.

404
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,300
How many of you out there

405
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,080
listening to the radio or on

406
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,300
drugs? Well, we've got an ashtray

407
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,080
for you for the $15 premium

408
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,120
and WCSB clear glass with

409
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,580
black WCSB logo

410
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,340
ashtray for $15

411
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,180
premium. Or you can get the subgenius

412
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,980
two-filth CD

413
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,380
set or for $20.

414
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,040
Your $20

415
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,080
pledge, friends.

416
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,620
What were we giving them for $20?

417
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,040
$20 gets you

418
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,060
a brand new... No, wait, that's the wrong

419
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,100
thing. Okay,

420
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,920
for $32, you get a

421
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,120
deviated septum. For $48,

422
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,960
you get a sharpened skull,

423
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,140
a very, very highly

424
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,700
honed crystal

425
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,160
sharpened skull. Friends, you could be talking to Princess

426
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,720
We Are The Queen of UFOs.

427
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,880
You get a dismissive attitude

428
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,000
and a lack of confidence. So just

429
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,280
think of it, friends. All the things you can or can't

430
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,060
do, these aren't important. Just pledge

431
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,320
now to this station!

432
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:35,960
Hi.

433
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,300
Have your friends

434
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,200
tried to kill you? Taken your muzzle?

435
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,180
Estued your stumpers or stopped

436
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:43,780
your medication?

437
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,080
Estued your stumpers?

438
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,380
Wait, no, wait.

439
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,100
Estued your sloppers.

440
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,240
I'm sorry, I was reading the wrong paper here.

441
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,180
Okay, it's the $35

442
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,280
pledge gets you absolutely nothing but a

443
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,940
$30 pledge not only gets you a rise.

444
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,220
No, that gets you a rise. A rise. And a pamphlet.

445
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,360
And a pamphlet. And a $25 pledge is one

446
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,240
that gets you both X-rated shows,

447
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,500
friends. Both X-rated CDs

448
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,380
of the Hour of Slack, X-rated number

449
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,200
9 and number 10 for a $25

450
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,300
pledge. Premium. And also

451
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,360
there's so many other WCS Belias

452
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,300
things that you can get. Inquire.

453
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,260
If you're confused or perhaps flatulent

454
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,240
or maybe the matrices in your head

455
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,300
have been devolved, just ask a question.

456
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,980
Princess We Are Doe is not only

457
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,900
happy to answer your questions but give you

458
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,080
flat comical answers. And she

459
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,980
may hang up on you. But she may not.

460
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,120
We need the money so she may not.

461
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,280
And friends, it's like if you don't

462
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,180
immediately get a hold of her the first

463
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,280
20 or 30 rings, that means she's busy

464
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,080
with a giant donator like

465
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,900
Dr. Dark. He's a

466
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,320
he's the man

467
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,700
who said when a chimpanzee

468
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,340
gets sexually aroused, that's

469
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,340
what you call a bonoboner.

470
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,100
And friends, that's why

471
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,880
people like him must die.

472
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:54,980


473
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,560
But let's think about the

474
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,400
bonobuses that we're going to

475
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,820
bonobonuses that we're going to be getting

476
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,020
by just being able to listen to the station

477
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,700
for the rest of eternity. When we score meth and

478
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,920
have gay sex, we get a bonus.

479
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,280
Some people call it hell.

480
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,460
We call it WCSB.

481
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,180
Praise WCSB. Praise WCSB.

482
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,740
This show you might call the

483
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,420
WCS Beliathon.

484
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,720
As you're driving down

485
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,880
Payne or Forestville Avenue or some of the

486
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,800
other discharge areas that

487
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,660
lead in and out of the beautiful city,

488
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,800
you'll notice high above Rhodes Tower

489
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,140
the emblazoned

490
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,300
engram, or no, that's not engrammatic,

491
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,500
the emblazoned symbol

492
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,400
and logo of the station itself.

493
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,940
WCSB, like a beacon in the night.

494
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,200
And this is truly

495
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,440
a cultural beacon.

496
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,640
Friends, you can have that WCSB

497
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,520
logo on your baseball

498
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,400
cap. Carnally.

499
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,900
Or you can have that logo

500
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,340
on shot glasses.

501
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,020
For a $25 premium,

502
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,960
a clear glass shot glass

503
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,620
with the WCSB logo

504
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,540
wrapped around. You can have a lighter

505
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,720
to light up your foul

506
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,980
drugs. Chicken fried or

507
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,820
cigarettes. And there's only

508
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,620
three of those lighters available and only

509
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,080
five of those shot glasses available.

510
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,000
And or

511
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,940
the subgenius

512
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,120
filth-a-thon

513
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,780
CD set of stuff that was

514
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,500
too hot for the

515
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,740
hour of slack on WCSB or any

516
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,840
of the broadcast stations that carry this show.

517
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,860
But first, let's run our fingers

518
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,280
over some of these fine, fine, fine

519
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,240
items they can get their

520
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,360
hands on themselves after the

521
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,460
pledge drive is over and finally exhumated.

522
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,680
Just think

523
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,320
of one of those beautiful Dobbshead vinyl

524
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,980
decals, decal stickers,

525
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,180
and the subgenius pamphlet for only

526
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,820
$5. Only five.

527
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,440
If you count on your fingers, there's your little finger,

528
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,220
there's your middle finger, there's your big finger, there's

529
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,780
the index finger. That's $5

530
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,200
out of your wallet that you

531
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,660
normally would use on crack coke.

532
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,760
Or some other stupid drug that

533
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,680
makes you worse. Why not

534
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,320
contribute now to something that

535
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,780
is easily...

536
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,600
You don't even have to have a premium.

537
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,780
If this is all too confusing, just call

538
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,900
687-6900

539
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,680
in the 216

540
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,600
area code. Once again, that's 687-6900.

541
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,880
And tell

542
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,880
Princess Wee you'd like

543
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,800
to pledge and she'll tell you what to do.

544
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,700
She'll give you that address, P.O. Box

545
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,860
931848 in Cleveland, Ohio

546
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,640
44101. For

547
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,660
you listening by internet and playing that back.

548
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,800
That's right, you can send that check. Just

549
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,300
send a check or money order

550
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,700
with a little note that it's for

551
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,040
the hour slack to

552
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,380
WCSB slash

553
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,500
CSU Foundation at

554
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,840
P.O. Box 931848.

555
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:41,680
You're all

556
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,000
soon to be getting wonderful, beautiful WC...

557
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,560
If you ask for them, WCSB

558
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,020
car bumper stickers.

559
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,840
The car bunkles are free!

560
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,380
T-shirts,

561
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,680
sweatshirts, a tiny little nose,

562
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,860
braiders, a number

563
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,740
of items that you're going to find in the home

564
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,700
or outside of your home if you're lucky enough to

565
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,720
call the police on time. Friends, you cannot

566
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,720
get anything like this show or

567
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,860
any of these shows on any normal

568
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,540
healthy station.

569
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,880
Only on a station like this

570
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,820
and they only survive because of your

571
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,980
pledges. Friends, here's

572
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,380
a quote by

573
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,800
Professor Dave DeLuco

574
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,680
of the new

575
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,840
subgenius book, The Cyclopedicon

576
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,820
and he says,

577
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,720
in this book, this is an actual

578
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,180
published book from Avalon Books,

579
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,600
the new book that's out, The Bobliographer

580
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,440
and it says here, quote,

581
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,460
To my knowledge and best intelligence,

582
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,600
the hour of slack is the direct product

583
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,580
of a scientific and

584
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,700
mystical experiment. The mission

585
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,700
of the hour of slack, according to Mr.

586
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,480
DeLuco here, as participants

587
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,520
are allowed to know it, is stacking

588
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,660
extra audio information in the

589
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,840
listener's inner ear so it's never forgotten.

590
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,780
A barrage of talk radio, rapid

591
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,720
fire verbal cuts, direct memory radio,

592
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,560
theater and ethos inducing music

593
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,620
seizes the inner ear and holds

594
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,760
it captive until the message is

595
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,680
complete and lodged in sconce

596
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,720
in the brain. And there's a

597
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,780
picture of Lonesome Cowboy Dave right

598
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,580
here with St. Paul Craster

599
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,200
in this very studio of WCSB.

600
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,220
Now what else

601
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,320
choice do you have but to call

602
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,820
687-6900

603
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,740
and get that in? Friends, I don't

604
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,660
care about your soul, I don't care

605
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,580
about your slack, all I care about

606
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,720
right this minute is your money because

607
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,520
that saves your soul,

608
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,420
that saves your slack.

609
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,460
Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

610
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,900
Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

611
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,540
We don't care how you look, we don't care how you

612
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,360
feel, we don't care how you smell, we don't care

613
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,880
about your interior design.

614
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,160
We only care that you deliver

615
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,500
that political capital in

616
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,540
the form of small George Washingtons,

617
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,540
Benjamin Franklins, or Adolf

618
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,540
Hitlers. We don't care who's on the bill, we just

619
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,400
care that it's U.S. money and it

620
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,820
comes to support this station

621
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,420
and the hour of slack. Now friends, it's election

622
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,300
day coming up and you've got

623
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,200
your choice. You can vote for Hitler or

624
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,420
you can vote for Jesus. I think I know

625
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,960
who you're going to vote for.

626
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,080
Oh my God, here's a call from

627
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,020
David Buckner in Canada!

628
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,880
This person from

629
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,100
Canada is actually the guy who

630
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,760
first got the hour of slack

631
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,240
onto the internet, you might

632
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,280
say. He helped us keep

633
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,960
it on the internet. Praise

634
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,460
Reverend David Buckner.

635
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,180
He plays the

636
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,020
hour of slack up there on

637
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,400
the internet.

638
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,180
Of Toronto,

639
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,240
Canada, and

640
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,500
his own show, which is

641
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,080
great.

642
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,860
Praise Eric Wolf for bringing us this

643
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,460
information. Friends,

644
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,540
you can talk to the gods

645
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,920
themselves when you call this number.

646
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,740
You can talk to UFO Space

647
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,920
Princess I.

648
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,540
The gods may not talk

649
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,520
back to you. The gods may appear

650
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,840
disinterested at first, but after a little

651
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,400
time, especially after delivering

652
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,660
or phoning in or giving your

653
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,460
credit card information so that we may

654
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,580
take your donation, you will actually

655
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,560
see illaquid liquid results

656
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,520
pouring down as if mana from

657
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,480
heaven. Mama from

658
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,740
heaven. Not mama mana. I want

659
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,520
mama from heaven.

660
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,140
Then you're going to have your

661
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,220
mana and your money. I want,

662
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,160
well, no, I want your money, friends.

663
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,440
Not from my pocket. And Bob,

664
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,740
in a way, it'll go into Bob's

665
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,400
pocket by way of WCSB.

666
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,180
WCSB. WCSB.

667
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,260
Bob, whatever. Might as well be one and the same.

668
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,280
Yeah, Bob. Like in

669
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,580
Satan. Of one. It's all about the same.

670
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,420
In line. Six and one, half nine hundred

671
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,160
of the other. Why not?

672
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,200
Ling-lang. You did sign

673
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,200
the application. You

674
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,560
read the small print.

675
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,100
You took the fire drill.

676
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,380
You kissed the fundament.

677
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,140
You waited

678
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,200
for execution.

679
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,100
You swallowed the blindfold.

680
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,640
You delivered the painful

681
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,840
armor. You

682
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,920
begged for it. You said, Bob,

683
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,340
kill me!

684
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,560
And did we hold back?

685
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,620
No. So this is the time for you

686
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,860
to just let go. Unbelt

687
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,640
yourself. Unzip your

688
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,520
lip. Pull out that wallet.

689
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,580
Bend over and let Bob in,

690
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,520
baby. Let Bob in deep into

691
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,500
your heart. Friends, you may not

692
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,660
know this, but this is not only a liberal station.

693
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,620
It is an arcane replica of

694
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,620
a station from the past. And not only that,

695
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,100
it's very, very, very tolerant.

696
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,380
We need more stations like WCSB.

697
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,260
I'm not wearing any pants right now.

698
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,020
No, we don't. We only need WCSB to

699
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,840
control the world!

700
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,340
It should be the only station!

701
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,040
I forgot that again. I keep forgetting this.

702
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,220
We don't need competition. We need your money,

703
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,720
friends. So we're talking points right under here on number 1340.

704
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,520
Now, I have a news

705
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,540
speaking of Dr. Dark.

706
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,080
This is from the Dr. Dark News

707
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,920
service.

708
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,140
We brought this in even

709
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,160
before we knew he was pledging.

710
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:50,540
Owlswell

711
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,260
that ends well. From Sherman,

712
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,080
New York, this news says, a

713
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,080
pagan was arrested on suspicion of

714
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,280
carrying a concealed pet after

715
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,220
Brushwood Campground Police found

716
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,540
him outdoors naked

717
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,180
and he told them he had a fool

718
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,780
in his rectum,

719
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,120
authorities said. The pagan

720
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,120
was lying on a tree stump masturbating

721
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,000
beside a nature path near the hot tub

722
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,520
Thursday, camp police said.

723
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,000
John Sheehan of Pittsburgh

724
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,700
was initially arrested on

725
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,020
suspicion of indecent pet smuggling,

726
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,020
but when asked whether he was carrying anything

727
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,320
police should know about,

728
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,540
Sheehan mentioned the fool,

729
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,820
said Sherman Detective Corporal

730
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,620
Don Hornigan.

731
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,900
You can't get much more concealed than that,

732
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,880
Hornigan said.

733
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,900
Officers drew their crease-grease guns

734
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,900
and fire tenders were called to the scene.

735
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,260
Sheehan

736
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,740
was removed

737
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,920
a six-inch muffled

738
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,860
owl wrapped in

739
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,680
black electrical tape

740
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,640
from his neither area

741
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,820
without incident. Sheehan, who was

742
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,660
paroled from Naked Bob's Campground

743
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,640
last week, was then booked into jail

744
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,580
on suspicion of Brushwood Campground

745
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,660
pet violations, indecent exposure

746
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,800
and one felony count of possessing

747
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,520
concealed wildlife.

748
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,720
When you're talking about an owl

749
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,840
or a nice prick and you're

750
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,000
dealing with someone who's fresh out of

751
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,460
Naked Bob's Campground,

752
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,880
it's a weepin'. That's a stinky

753
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,200
owl, Hornigan said.

754
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,940
It was not immediately clear what Sheehan

755
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,820
was on parole for.

756
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,500
A person answering the phone at the jail,

757
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,000
Friday night, did not know whether

758
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,760
Sheehan had a liar.

759
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,160
Friends, whether your fool

760
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,380
is a muffled owl or an awful mole,

761
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,120
it matters not to us.

762
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,520
We're all part of the same celibate

763
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,520
zoo. We all have the same organs.

764
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,000
We all salute the same ways.

765
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,960
And some of us are downright

766
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,240
improprietous. So send

767
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,120
anything you can now except for

768
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,420
what is it that we won't take exactly,

769
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,360
Reverend? We'll take anything,

770
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,380
friends, as long as it's

771
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:49,760
money.

772
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,180
Not in some sort.

773
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,480
And did you know that you

774
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,640
don't have to just mail that check-in

775
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,080
or you could also,

776
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,340
after talking to Princess

777
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,640
Wee or Lonesome

778
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,360
Cowboy Dave or Dr. Sinister

779
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,260
or whoever are here at

780
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,360
687-6900, you could

781
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,540
go online

782
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,440
at the link found

783
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,620
via WCSB.org

784
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,860
and pay by credit card

785
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,240
after

786
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,440
alerting us about that. Or, get

787
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,440
this, you could come right

788
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,780
here into this magical

789
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,860
place, this technical

790
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,080
marvel called WCSB

791
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,180
Studio. This tears to house.

792
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:31,420
Starting

793
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,520
from November

794
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,980
17th to Sunday, which is

795
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,140
Friday, to September 19th.

796
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,600
You can just wander in,

797
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,900
pay your pledge, pick up

798
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,020
that premium, pick up that

799
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,100
Bob bumper sticker, that Bob

800
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,640
which is a $10 pledge,

801
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,640
the Bob X-rated

802
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,240
CD for $15.

803
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,880
Or two of them for $25.

804
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,820
Or that DVD for $30.

805
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,500
Or any of the great

806
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,140
fantabuloid WCSB

807
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,240
logo t-shirts and ashtrays,

808
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,140
lighters, shot glasses, syringes,

809
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,640
speculums,

810
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,300
you name it, they've got

811
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,080
it with a fine, fine

812
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,840
WCSB logo on it. Just

813
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,400
shining and glimmering.

814
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,140
Let's take a look at this one right here. It's an indigiform

815
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,320
Paleolithic skull imported all the way

816
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,140
from the Amazon. It's making me

817
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,240
big. It's able, it's actually,

818
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,240
capable of dividing the

819
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,200
future and providing valuable

820
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,220
information to the smaller members of your

821
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,980
family and the people with the larger

822
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,320
craniums. It says right here on the back

823
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,240
and it comes all the way, like I said, from Brazil

824
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,360
and it's got the WCSB logo

825
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,600
on the back. It's got

826
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,160
an icon of Bob.

827
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,200
Friends, you just can't go

828
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,100
wrong with this pledge drive this week and

829
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,320
WCSB is known for beautiful pledge

830
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,740
drives. I sound like the

831
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,380
seriously

832
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,100
smashed up lady on

833
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,040
WKSU. I'm sorry. I didn't

834
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,420
mean to say that, but she's, I'm sorry.

835
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,020
I don't know. I don't,

836
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,220
I know nothing of these other earth stations,

837
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,920
Dave. I never, you know,

838
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,840
I don't know of any other station

839
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,960
in Cleveland. It's the only one I

840
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,320
ever listened to. But this is an exciting, entertaining

841
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,880
pledge drive. Other people are

842
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,720
expecting some form of musical entertainment.

843
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,780
Oh sure, some people get music, some people get

844
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,760
irritating collages. I've got

845
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,920
the best of all previous

846
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,000
pledge drive rants queued

847
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,820
up here, ready to go. If I suddenly

848
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,740
got tired or was inclined to shut up,

849
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,840
but I can't, I can't because you're

850
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,780
not calling. Princess, we just want to

851
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,760
Princess, will you tell him? I have a special

852
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,720
sizzling hot announcement to make

853
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,580
here. Rocknar just called

854
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,740
and he pledged a

855
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,420
$30 pledge

856
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,840
and he challenges all

857
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,800
Radio 2.0 listeners

858
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,520
to contribute what they can.

859
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,000
Match that pledge. WCSB, maximize

860
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,020
that pledge. Can you be like Rocknar?

861
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,860
This is something Rocknar might be interested

862
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,800
in for, uh, if he wants to make a video.

863
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,680
Like a second pledge, there's, uh, I believe

864
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,880
Crowdy McCrowd is offering his soul

865
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,800
as a premium. And we know

866
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,700
that Rocknar is a trafficker in human souls.

867
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,820
That's right. And this is

868
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,840
why he asked for no premium. He has

869
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,000
plenty going for him. As a trafficker

870
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,800
in souls, he doesn't need

871
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,120
the trivial, menial little ashtray

872
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,840
that you can bang over your parents'

873
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,700
heads. Friends, act like

874
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,800
Rocknar and we'll treat you as

875
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,280
an equal.

876
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,520
He needs the neutron bomb

877
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,480
and he needs your support.

878
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,980
Uh, he needs...

879
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,860
No, wait. Rocknar

880
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,900
doesn't need your support.

881
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,060
We need to be Rocknar's

882
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,360
jockstrap. Supporting us.

883
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,620
We don't need... We need the bra

884
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,880
of you, the listener,

885
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,480
supporting this station.

886
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,840
Lift and separate with your pledge.

887
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,820
Separate us from poverty.

888
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,720
Lift us, uh,

889
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,400
like, like a

890
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,140
wild religious

891
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,820
fervor in your mind

892
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,560
coursing through your veins.

893
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,600
Lift us up and you too

894
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,740
will be lifted up. Just like

895
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,880
Jim Jones lifted up his people.

896
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,760
Just like David Koresh

897
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,780
could lift them up. Just like the

898
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,920
solar temple people were lifted up.

899
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,840
Friends in Heaven's Gate, are we gonna

900
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,780
let them beat us? No! Pledge that

901
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,720
money. Send that money in. Drink

902
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,860
the Kool-Aid, children. Drink

903
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,820
the Kool-Aid. How about this for an

904
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,700
offer, ladies and gentlemen? Wanna help out

905
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,420
WCSB? Wanna help out

906
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,840
the subgenius ministry hour of

907
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,720
Slack Radio Show? Wanna really help?

908
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,760
If you pledge $1,000

909
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,460
right now, the lovely

910
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,560
princess, Wee Ardo, will

911
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,700
provide, as a premium, one

912
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,780
of her many brassieres. I don't know if she

913
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,720
has many, but I know for $1,000

914
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,600
she'll take her clothes off

915
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,500
for me, baby! So

916
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,700
send that money in!

917
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,580
And there's lots of other things

918
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,680
we've got here. Sitting on the table, it looks like

919
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,320
I'm at the Quality Value Network

920
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,420
and all the incredible offers

921
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,540
we have here. Let's just hope that

922
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,460
those balls and waxes keep on floating.

923
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,380
It's time to remember that

924
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,540
Germany is not the

925
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,780
place we want to be right now.

926
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,040
I don't know where I...

927
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,460
I think I'm reading the wrong paper.

928
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,840
I'm reading the wrong paper, but...

929
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,400
Oh yeah, okay. I thought I had the

930
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,520
travel thing here. I told you, Dave, when I

931
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,340
was in Germany a couple of years ago

932
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,660
after the last election,

933
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,440
the Germans

934
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,600
were saying,

935
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,220
we're kind of worried about the

936
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,660
fascism in America.

937
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,560
They have experience, and we

938
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,700
always ask for...

939
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,440
I don't really talk that way. We always

940
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,540
ask for experience when we're

941
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,340
looking for help. We go to an

942
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,400
elder member of our family, someone

943
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,640
perhaps all croggly and crony,

944
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,620
and we say, with your vast

945
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,520
experience, can you tell me this or that?

946
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,720
With our vast experience, we

947
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,640
can tell you that you can do no finer,

948
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,920
no better thing than to pledge!

949
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,820
That's so true, friends.

950
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,660
What you do now is

951
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,300
the greatest... This is the

952
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,020
greatest thing you will ever do

953
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,740
when you call that number, 687-6900

954
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,800
in the Cleveland

955
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,760
216 area code.

956
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,980
You know, people used to mock

957
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,380
Cleveland and laugh. It's just a joke.

958
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,400
It's like, oh, don't

959
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,580
mess up or you'll be transferred to Cleveland.

960
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,600
Ha ha ha! You laugh track

961
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,620
because it was so wretched.

962
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,760
Well, friends, for some

963
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,540
of us, some of us find

964
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,480
a heaven of

965
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,340
slack. Well, not

966
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,280
necessarily Cleveland, but Cleveland Heights!

967
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,160
Everywhere I live.

968
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,100
The Slacker Mansion.

969
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,400
They're high on the highest

970
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,720
hill in Cleveland Heights.

971
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,340
You might say I was the highest man in Cleveland

972
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,420
Heights, friend. And Her Highness Princess

973
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,380
Wee is even higher. We're

974
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,340
trying to keep Her Highness stable

975
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,040
and steady.

976
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,040
So can't you help?

977
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,320
Can't you see fit?

978
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,500
Can't you deign

979
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,220
or lower yourself

980
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,420
to call that number,

981
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,280
687-6900? You could be

982
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,980
talking to Dr. Sinister right now.

983
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,300
Did you... Can you even

984
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,480
believe that?

985
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,200
There are so many of you

986
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,400
out there who have spent

987
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,160
your finest hours

988
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,040
on the throne of

989
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,280
excremeditation.

990
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,500
Don't be

991
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,420
a part of this doobie.

992
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,260
Don't be.

993
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,100
You could do it! Pledge now.

994
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,120
You can do more than

995
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,080
evacuate yourselves. You

996
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,340
can keep the flow coming.

997
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,480
Coming by

998
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,240
many pledging.

999
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,180
Five, ten, fifteen,

1000
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,180
twenty-five or thirty dollars to

1001
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,320
WCSB and the radio

1002
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,360
hour of slack. We're not proud.

1003
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,900
We'll take five thousand dollars.

1004
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,320
You don't have to feel bad about that.

1005
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,160
If that's all you can do,

1006
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,940
five grand, hey, look,

1007
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,320
you know, every little bit counts.

1008
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,620
Those pennies add up.

1009
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,940
Those thousand dollar checks add up.

1010
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,200
Even, rather, quite a bit

1011
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:48,620
faster.

1012
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,260
I know that you've got

1013
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,280
needs like beer,

1014
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,540
cigarettes,

1015
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,140
Hootie and the Blowfish

1016
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,540
Best Of CDs.

1017
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,200
That's what you're probably going to spend your money on.

1018
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,060
Because you can get

1019
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,300
WCSB for free, right?

1020
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:07,760
Sure.

1021
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,220
Why don't I help the

1022
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,340
cigarette companies

1023
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,500
and the beer companies

1024
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,360
more than I help

1025
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,120
the thing that gives me free pleasure

1026
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,960
all this time?

1027
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,120
Whoa, this is terrible.

1028
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,160
Blind eye, I just turned a blind eye

1029
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,280
however they get by,

1030
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,580
however they get by.

1031
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:28,180
You are stabbing Bob in the heart

1032
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,980
with your penknife

1033
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,380
when you do that, friends.

1034
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,220
Wait, maybe I shouldn't say that because some people

1035
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,100
want, that's exactly what they want to do.

1036
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,560
The more you pledge, the deeper

1037
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,820
that penknife goes into Bob's heart.

1038
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,840
And we can guarantee it.

1039
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,340
Yeah, so come on, 687-6900.

1040
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,900
Join the crowd

1041
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,420
and the lynch mob and kill Bob,

1042
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:48,840
man.

1043
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,660
I said some of you have needs.

1044
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,280
We know some of you have knees.

1045
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,820
We know some of you have elbows and collarbones

1046
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,220
and that's why we want every rich

1047
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,380
Republican living in chagrin

1048
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,380
in the areas where there's

1049
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,400
lots and lots of money.

1050
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,820
Don't just sit there on your ponce

1051
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,720
drinking your martinis and your mojitos

1052
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,060
and whatever else you do.

1053
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,980
Get on the phone right now and contribute

1054
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:14,080
to the world around you by dialing

1055
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,980
687-6900 and pledging

1056
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,780
5, 10, 15,

1057
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,040
25 or $30 to the

1058
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,340
hour of slack and

1059
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,580
WCSB in Cleveland.

1060
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,980
The station that keeps you on top of things

1061
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,660
and well underground.

1062
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,780
And friends, you know, you tend people

1063
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,840
we always tend to think, well, college stations,

1064
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,500
that's all a bunch of liberals, right?

1065
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,900
Well, now, friends, we're patriots, psychotic

1066
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,860
and narco-materialists and we love

1067
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,800
our Republican brothers and sisters

1068
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,880
when they give us their money.

1069
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,000
Yes. When they give

1070
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,800
unto Bob that which is

1071
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,820
truly Bob's, that which is his

1072
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,280
due. Friends,

1073
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,380
by his stripes,

1074
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,900
he was healed. But you

1075
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,860
don't have stripes. All you've got

1076
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,760
is money and that's the only way you can heal yourself

1077
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,880
is divest yourself of that

1078
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,820
which has enslaved you. You are a

1079
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,540
slave to that filthy

1080
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,840
lucre and that job. Free yourself,

1081
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,380
baby. Let it go.

1082
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,000
Put that wallet on a diet and you won't

1083
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,920
die yet. Just think of it

1084
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,900
that way, friends. You are buying salvation

1085
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,220
when you merely pledge.

1086
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,540
$30 gets you that

1087
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,900
subgenius arise video and

1088
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,720
actually, if you are familiar enough with our

1089
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,720
catalog, you could perfectly welcome to request

1090
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,860
another video. You may be aroused, too, by

1091
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,560
the alliance. Oh, you would

1092
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,660
if you're doing it right.

1093
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,780
Friends, for $25

1094
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,700
you get two X-rated

1095
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,680
hour of slack CDs that could never

1096
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,660
ever, ever be played on any

1097
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,440
radio station anywhere because

1098
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,240
the depth of their depravity.

1099
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,040
And I know you want that.

1100
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,580
We all do. You're depraved,

1101
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,780
friends. You're very, very, very

1102
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,560
out of line with everything around

1103
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,540
you. In fact, you're so out of sync

1104
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,340
with the reality that you see about you,

1105
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,660
you're about ready to jump out of that window, aren't you?

1106
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,480
Aren't you now? No exit. But it

1107
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,580
is no exit. The only way

1108
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,580
out, the only way

1109
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,600
that you can possibly survive in this

1110
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,180
world except for continue

1111
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,200
eating and breathing is to pledge

1112
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,420
$5, $10, $15,

1113
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,320
$25 or $30.

1114
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,560
Whip it out. 687-6900.

1115
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,040
Whip it out indeed.

1116
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,540
That is that number. It's a magic number.

1117
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,440
You know that the station must,

1118
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,560
must have been given a choice by the phone

1119
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,440
company when they asked for phone numbers

1120
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,600
for their pledge line. And I know that

1121
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,340
they saw that 6900

1122
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,560
there. You know, that has kind

1123
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,280
of a catch to it for some reason.

1124
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,600
Some fifth grade sort of

1125
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,400
related reason.

1126
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,240
687-6900

1127
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,500
in Cleveland. That's the beautiful

1128
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,220
216 area code.

1129
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,600
Friends, we're also

1130
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,460
not snobs. We are some

1131
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,660
other word that may remind you of

1132
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,360
a snob like blores or zans.

1133
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,960
Or des or something like that.

1134
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,460
But glorps. We've often been called glorps.

1135
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,380
But we not only

1136
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,500
appeal, but we I appeal

1137
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,060
to everyone from

1138
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,520
fifth graders to fifth colonists

1139
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,480
and any other number you can

1140
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,600
think of. So please, I'm begging

1141
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,040
you. Please.

1142
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,540
Friends, we're flopped over

1143
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,500
on our backs on this big stinky

1144
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,360
mattress and our legs are spread

1145
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,480
wide. What more do you want?

1146
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,640
We're offering ourselves up.

1147
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,480
Can't you give us

1148
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,160
a little tip?

1149
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,680
Friends, and you can come by the station

1150
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,360
during the open house Friday

1151
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,880
November 17th through Sunday.

1152
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,580
Well, from 3 to 8 p.m.

1153
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,060
Can't show up anytime.

1154
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,520
And from 12 to 4 on Sunday

1155
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,600
on November the 19th.

1156
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,080
That's coming up on Kennedy Day.

1157
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,300
What?

1158
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,840
Bob came

1159
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,640
and did something with all of us, friends.

1160
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,760
By the way, the music in the background

1161
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,460
was all by yours truly, Reverend

1162
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,200
Stang.

1163
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,100
And we're going to look to God.

1164
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,520
That's yours?

1165
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,880
Yes. Now it's mine.

1166
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,860
You didn't know that I knew how to

1167
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,380
play the lute, did you?

1168
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,840
I knew you were a luteist, but I didn't know

1169
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,840
you were a flautist. I'm a loutist

1170
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,520
actually. You are a loutist.

1171
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,760
A loutist, yes. That's related

1172
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,760
to sort of like between an artist

1173
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,820
and a lout. I'm a blow

1174
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,860
twister looking for fame and

1175
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,700
fortune. I'm a young man

1176
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,640
in search of my own inner self.

1177
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,540
What will I do? I'm not an artist.

1178
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,720
I'm not an 85-year-old alcoholic. No, no, no.

1179
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,360
I'm a young man or woman

1180
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,440
walking around town or

1181
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,980
perhaps taking a bus.

1182
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,760
What shall I win? Will I? How can I?

1183
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,660
There are no answers to these

1184
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,800
questions, my friends.

1185
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,720
Look at this fine pledge that's been brought in.

1186
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,200
Eat lus, you pledge.

1187
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,740
This boy pledged or girl or

1188
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,220
thing, Jay Krasnow.

1189
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,680
Now, there's

1190
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,320
nothing Krasnow

1191
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,860
about Jay Krasnow

1192
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,260
who bought the...

1193
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,120
2001 antique

1194
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,460
WCSB

1195
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,180
shirt

1196
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,840
with small pocket logo.

1197
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,600
And I think there may be a couple of those

1198
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,280
left still. Maybe.

1199
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,640
And some of these actually have the buttocks

1200
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,180
literally cut right out of them.

1201
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,760
These are beautiful pieces of furniture.

1202
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,780
Some very, very strange items

1203
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,160
imported from the Middle East.

1204
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,640
We don't know how they get their way

1205
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,720
here, but we know that we're glad to have them.

1206
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,600
We're glad to present them to you if you

1207
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,400
pledge for more.

1208
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:48,400
We'll see you next time.

1209
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,600
We'll see you next time.

1210
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,800
We'll see you next time.

1211
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,000
Next they want $30 for

1212
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,080
ordainment. Next thing they want

1213
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,480
$18 for their

1214
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,400
new book or $20 for

1215
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,440
their video. But you can get it

1216
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,540
for even $30 from this radio

1217
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,200
station and you'll be doing

1218
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,520
good or evil depending on how

1219
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,360
you look at it. How about this

1220
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,380
beautiful inflated blue tortoise

1221
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,400
necklace or a stack of horn pig?

1222
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,580
Or how about these needs and election

1223
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,340
blowers? You're not going to find

1224
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,320
beautiful premiums like this

1225
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,240
anywhere else because they don't exist.

1226
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,400
Even here. We're just talking

1227
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,540
about the vague items that we

1228
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,340
could offer you had we

1229
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,900
the experiment or the mercy.

1230
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:29,440
Who are the overlords of the

1231
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,580
UFO? We're asking

1232
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,400
you. You can answer that question.

1233
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,360
Call the queen of the UFOs

1234
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,240
at 687-6900.

1235
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,420
Friends, do you realize

1236
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,600
that one of the main

1237
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,760
reasons that the church of the subgenius

1238
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,580
moved its headquarters from

1239
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:47,380
Dallas to Cleveland was because

1240
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:49,460
of this station?

1241
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,680
Which is the only station

1242
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,460
in the universe that has

1243
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,300
carried the hour of slack for

1244
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,640
over 18 years

1245
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,320
or something now at

1246
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,960
9 o'clock on Sunday nights forever.

1247
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,640
No other station anywhere

1248
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,360
in the world has ever dared

1249
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,280
or been able to carry this show

1250
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,380
so completely and forever. I run into

1251
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,560
people who go, Reverend Stagg, I used

1252
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,380
to listen to your show when I was just

1253
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,420
a young teenager.

1254
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,920
And of course I always say,

1255
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,540
it's still on, man.

1256
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,400
But

1257
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,460
friends, you could be part

1258
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,400
of this world.

1259
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,360
Perhaps you could be part of this.

1260
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,480
Reverend Stagg, let's

1261
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,520
talk about, if we can for a brief

1262
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,640
moment here, I know we've been haranguing the audience

1263
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,480
out here, trying to get them to pledge them.

1264
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,360
Let's just explain them

1265
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,360
in the most simple, direct terms

1266
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,520
we can, why they're going to make out big

1267
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,520
by making a pledge to this station

1268
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,560
and this show.

1269
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,440
Well, it works like this, friends. The luck

1270
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,000
plane, which is

1271
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,200
how Bob gets so much,

1272
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,360
you can learn to

1273
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,760
surf the luck plane too.

1274
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,200
When you give money to this station,

1275
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,320
you'll get a lot of real

1276
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,400
good sex. It's just as simple

1277
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,320
as that. I know that seems

1278
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,300
like kind of a big promise

1279
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,060
to make, but

1280
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,400
the fact is, when you call

1281
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,000
and pledge your money, 687-6900,

1282
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,320
you will

1283
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,140
have fabulous sex.

1284
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,620
Maybe even with somebody else.

1285
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,600
And that's not even really important.

1286
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,120
Yes.

1287
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,620
Yes, yes, yes.

1288
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,540
Pastor David Epley knew.

1289
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,080
That's who said,

1290
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,500
ah, yes, originally.

1291
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,240
Now they'll, and almost in a case,

1292
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,160
they'll get a subgenius pamphlet, which will

1293
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,140
explain perhaps some of the arcane

1294
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:34,740
dogma we've been trying to espouse.

1295
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:37,040
That's right. It was written in 1980, and yet

1296
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,400
some people haven't read the subgenius pamphlet

1297
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,240
number one, but that goes out with every

1298
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,040
pledge to the hour slot, even a

1299
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,140
$5 pledge.

1300
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,640
Don't you need to know?

1301
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,400
Of course. It costs more posted.

1302
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,440
Much than $5 to send you that thing,

1303
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,100
but that's how much we care

1304
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,360
about you.

1305
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,300
Postage, pastage, it's nothing

1306
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,540
to us. We want to get the message across.

1307
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,360
That's right.

1308
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,600
And if we have to use

1309
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,240
embedded subliminals deep inside the

1310
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,180
background music that you can't really

1311
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,360
hear, but keep echoing in your

1312
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,220
brain all night while you sleep, well, that's

1313
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,220
what we'll do. You can call tomorrow

1314
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:15,080
and pledge to some other show.

1315
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,860
If you're too scared now,

1316
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:17,800
what's the matter, chicken?

1317
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:18,960
Oh, freak.

1318
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,320
Afraid your mom

1319
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,640
might find out that you pledged

1320
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,960
to WCSB?

1321
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,360
Come on, man. Don't you want to be

1322
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,480
cool? Yeah, don't you

1323
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,460
want to be really hip?

1324
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,680
Don't you want to be down

1325
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,920
with the down with

1326
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,560
fang? Everybody's doing it, man.

1327
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,380
Everybody

1328
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,480
has done it. Actually, I wish.

1329
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:42,800
If everybody was calling

1330
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,220
687-6900-pledging to the hour

1331
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,000
slack at WCSB, well, I guess

1332
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,820
we wouldn't have to worry about

1333
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:49,280
George.

1334
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,480
W. Bush! Because he

1335
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,460
never would have gotten, he would never have been

1336
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,700
governor of Texas. He wouldn't

1337
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,240
have been allowed in Texas

1338
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,360
if this station had had more

1339
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,360
pledges earlier.

1340
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,320
They never would have let him out of Connecticut.

1341
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,480
Friends, you

1342
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,140
could have stopped

1343
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,460
the horror of today's world and

1344
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,440
made this an earthly paradise if you had

1345
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,440
called and pledged last year. Are you

1346
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,980
going to let that chance go by again?

1347
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,680
Friends, there's no need for Marxism

1348
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,880
or Pupar values.

1349
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,660
Or trying to re-increase your cranial

1350
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:23,720
surface. Everything you want

1351
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,640
in a paradise can be found right here

1352
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,360
in this small, little, tiny religion.

1353
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,580
Take it like a pill or live

1354
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,540
it like a drill. The surface

1355
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:33,660
is clean and awaiting

1356
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,420
you. Just pledge right now

1357
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,480
687-6900.

1358
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:39,580
Is that a hard number to remember?

1359
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,700
Is that a hard number to forget?

1360
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,140
I think not.

1361
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,620
Take the red pill and the blue pill

1362
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:47,300
and then take five more

1363
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,600
of each, man.

1364
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,700
Go for it! Go the distance,

1365
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:52,140
man!

1366
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,040
Call and pledge, dude!

1367
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:57,960
It's like

1368
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,740
a thousand years of like the

1369
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,740
perfect evolution that made for the

1370
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,800
giant brain with like a solid

1371
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,780
diamond in the center. And you

1372
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,860
can get to that diamond. We can cut it

1373
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,900
open. We can get to it

1374
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,840
if we just have the tools

1375
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,880
and you can give us those tools.

1376
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:15,720
Now, can't you? We're just

1377
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,420
asking the small, small

1378
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:18,060
donations.

1379
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,960
$8,000? That'll go a long

1380
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,960
way towards helping fix the transmitter.

1381
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,980
We will. In fact, if you send

1382
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,860
in $7,000, forget about

1383
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:29,720
brassieres or taking evolutionary

1384
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,440
as a pill, we will send you

1385
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,920
the entire fully completed

1386
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,460
diagram of the evolutionary

1387
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,620
scale as it began and

1388
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:38,740
will end.

1389
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,960
From Yeti to Common Slug.

1390
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:43,720
Come on, man!

1391
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,660
Get with the new creationist

1392
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:46,000
science.

1393
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,460
Join or die.

1394
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:51,960
Join

1395
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,280
or die.

1396
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:55,480
Join

1397
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:58,840
or die.

1398
00:48:58,900 --> 00:48:58,900


1399
00:48:58,980 --> 00:48:59,980
Join or die.

1400
00:48:59,980 --> 00:48:59,980


1401
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,100
Join us, humans.

1402
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,000
Even a human can help.

1403
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,720
You don't have to be ashamed.

1404
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,780
Humans don't have to hide in the

1405
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,220
closet anymore. Come on out.

1406
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,780
Admit you're a human. Sure, you may not be

1407
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,140
a full-fledged subgenius

1408
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,340
by virtue of not having ever

1409
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:17,220
been ordained by Bob

1410
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,220
officially, but you can

1411
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:19,540
come.

1412
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,460
Come so close if you can

1413
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,240
just help Bob's

1414
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,340
called ministers.

1415
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,460
Dave and I have been preaching

1416
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:29,020
here at these microphones

1417
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,380
for, I don't even

1418
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:32,160
know how long.

1419
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:35,400
But we remember you,

1420
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,200
each and every one of you,

1421
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:39,240
by your scent, by the

1422
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,300
whiff reading that we can do because we're

1423
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,960
in the spirit. We're clairvoyant.

1424
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,120
We have third nostrils that Bob

1425
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,540
opened up in a secret ceremony

1426
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:49,320
behind us in the

1427
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,800
cave in Malaysia,

1428
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,740
in the Himalayas

1429
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,800
with the Yetis

1430
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,880
clapping and watching. Friends,

1431
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,280
and that's why we know

1432
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:00,560
what's in your heart. We do.

1433
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,960
And what's in your mind. You'll pay to know what

1434
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,140
you really think, so call

1435
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,140
687-6900.

1436
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,020
Bob said it. I believed

1437
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,080
it. You smoked it and heard

1438
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,000
it and listened to it, so get on it

1439
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:13,220
baby.

1440
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,880
Friends, some of you I'd like you to right now,

1441
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,000
I'd like you to get close to the window, look out the

1442
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,780
window now, I would like you

1443
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:22,980
to begin feeling your face right now.

1444
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,940
Take your hands, both your index fingers

1445
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:27,000
and feel your face. Feel your

1446
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,820
ears, your eyes, your neck.

1447
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,880
Now I want you to take one hand

1448
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,780
and feel your other hand.

1449
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,760
Then feel your feet, your

1450
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,980
twitter blades, your shoulder

1451
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,720
softenings, the other parts, the muscular

1452
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,600
parts of your body, and then

1453
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,000
ask yourself, are you different?

1454
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,840
Are you different than the

1455
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,660
other small children and elderly

1456
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,780
ladies around you? Do you have

1457
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,540
different needs than they do?

1458
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,700
Well, if you do, if you

1459
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,880
notice the most minuscule,

1460
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,820
the tiniest little difference

1461
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,740
between you and your peers, you

1462
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,680
are cooked if you do not pledge

1463
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,780
to this show and pledge to the station.

1464
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:05,020
I can't even notice the difference between them and their penises,

1465
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,260
much less their peers.

1466
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,100
It's all distinct and random.

1467
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,820
Wait, I'm getting a signal. I'm in the spirit, I'm in

1468
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,960
discernment. I'm going into discernment.

1469
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,100
I'm feeling a

1470
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,780
strong surge in my

1471
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:18,520
loins. It's coming from the direction of

1472
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,440
of, uh, it's somewhere

1473
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,520
southeast of here. North Carolina.

1474
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,480
Yes. Yeah. Yeah, it's coming

1475
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,420
from Raleigh. I'm seeing

1476
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:28,500
something in my mind. It's like a store.

1477
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,720
Wards. I'm getting smoky already. It's Wards.

1478
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,740
Montgomery, no, no, not

1479
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:34,320
Wards. Sears, Target,

1480
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:35,060
something.

1481
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,720
But I know that money

1482
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,740
is coming from this source.

1483
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:42,340
Oh, Stan, look, look, look, right in front of you.

1484
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,240
I know that I'm going to be mailing in a rise

1485
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,240
2005 to this person.

1486
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,660
Oh my God, it's true!

1487
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,600
Harold Sears in Gorman, Raleigh

1488
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,920
North Carolina, in fact,

1489
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:54,940
bledged $55

1490
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:57,020
and I know that he's good for it.

1491
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:58,860
Because I saw that in the

1492
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,680
spirit. That may be all

1493
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,860
he's good for, friends, just like so many

1494
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:04,360
of you and I of us.

1495
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,880
You may only be good for one thing, and that

1496
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,520
is feeding us donuts.

1497
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:10,980
But if you think of it the right way,

1498
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,980
or if you even think of it the wrong way,

1499
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,960
it doesn't matter. If you have any

1500
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,320
brain to think with at all,

1501
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,060
please use it.

1502
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,680
Take your left hand and pick up

1503
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,620
the phone. Take your right hand and

1504
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,680
begin dialing the digits. No, not

1505
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,580
those digits. Those

1506
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:29,420
digits! 687-6900

1507
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,540
and pledge

1508
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:31,240
right now.

1509
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,660
Or, you know, within a few minutes he's okay too, I guess.

1510
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:35,940
Are we going to be here for another...

1511
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:38,580
Another ten minutes, if they'll allow us.

1512
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:40,380
I hope they allow us to come back.

1513
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,520
The security guys are already out.

1514
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,500
We're not seeing all that much action.

1515
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,640
That bank of phones is all...

1516
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:47,920
Not a single one lit up right now.

1517
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,480
Well, there was a big...

1518
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,300
I was short about a half an hour ago. I don't know.

1519
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:52,420
I thought they were supposed to... Oh, sure. We've had

1520
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,480
three or four precious, beloved

1521
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,700
listeners call in.

1522
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,320
Mr. Montgomery Ward's there,

1523
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:00,100
and Dr. Light

1524
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,380
with his light lute

1525
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:04,140
juice called in, and

1526
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:05,840
a few of our friends.

1527
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,740
We did get a crank call from Dick Cheney

1528
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,480
claiming he was going to

1529
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,300
pledge the $7,000. He does that

1530
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:12,860
every year.

1531
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,520
He thinks

1532
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,580
he's the dick.

1533
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:17,740
You know.

1534
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:21,520
And his name isn't even really Dick Cheney,

1535
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,460
but he's going, oh, I'm Dick Cheney,

1536
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,880
therefore I'm the dick.

1537
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:27,540
Well, he may be a dick, but he ain't Bob.

1538
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:28,900
That's right.

1539
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,500
There's only... You know, there's a lot of

1540
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,520
Bobs out in the world, but there's only one Bob.

1541
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,160
You know what I'm saying?

1542
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,360
And we've...

1543
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,960
And listen to these followers.

1544
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,520
These are the folks answering

1545
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,260
the phones right now. They're so excited.

1546
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,520
You can hear them in the background. I turned up

1547
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,260
the mic in the other room there.

1548
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:49,340
The phones. They're...

1549
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:50,440
Quite a celebration.

1550
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:53,600
We are in the spirit here at the

1551
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,520
station. Won't you be part of this wondrous

1552
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:55,980
outreach?

1553
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,700
Oh, man, this is great.

1554
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,340
Praise Bob. Praise Bob.

1555
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,360
Praise St.

1556
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:05,900
Otis.

1557
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,340
And praise Princess We Are

1558
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:11,280
Dull for taking your

1559
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,540
absurd and almost repugnant

1560
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:15,680
calls. I don't know, friends, if I can...

1561
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,200
If we don't get five more

1562
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,220
pledges in the next five minutes,

1563
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,120
I'm going to walk towards that

1564
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,640
window, Mark, not an exit.

1565
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,220
I'm going to look languidly down on

1566
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,100
the people below as if I could touch them

1567
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,160
with my fingers. I'm going to

1568
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,780
stare vacuously into space,

1569
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:33,220
and then I'm going to step one foot

1570
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,160
right out of that door, Mark,

1571
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:35,940
not a door.

1572
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:38,320
As long as you don't urinate.

1573
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,160
I thought that was what you were going to do,

1574
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,660
Dave, like last time.

1575
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,120
I can't urinate now? What the hell kind

1576
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,380
of a free country is this?

1577
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,760
Well, now, I heard that they were going to...

1578
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,080
The household security people

1579
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,020
were trying to set it up to where we're

1580
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:55,120
not allowed to leave or enter the

1581
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,240
country without a special new permission.

1582
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,140
Passport's not good enough

1583
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:01,360
anymore. There's Indo and Exo passports

1584
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,120
now. There's so many different names

1585
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,920
to remember, friends. You don't have to remember

1586
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,260
funny names if you call 687-6900.

1587
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:09,240
You will be

1588
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,840
one of those funny names yourself.

1589
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,160
And the next time one of the surveillance

1590
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,200
police officers of the new states

1591
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,120
of corporate America asks,

1592
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,460
asks you for your ID, say,

1593
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,920
that's my id, baby, and it talks like

1594
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,060
my ego, and it means I love

1595
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,700
Bob. That's right, friends.

1596
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,940
Bob can just tap his finger against

1597
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:28,900
your pocket and know everything about

1598
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:31,020
you. And so can the conspiracy.

1599
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,880
So which one do you want

1600
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,160
to put sticking his hands in your pockets?

1601
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:36,880
The conspiracy

1602
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,880
devil man or J.R. Bob

1603
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,320
Dobbs? Or maybe

1604
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,540
Mrs. Dobbs?

1605
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:44,960
Connie? Who do you want

1606
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,600
playing pocket pool with your

1607
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,840
horses? Think of it that way, friends.

1608
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:51,060
Think about that. It's a vast forest

1609
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:52,860
out there, and there's plenty of trees,

1610
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,000
but if you can't see the

1611
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,820
forest from the trees, you're no

1612
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,560
freaking good to me.

1613
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:00,940
I'm leaving, man.

1614
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:03,040
Hey, J. We don't get

1615
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,000
that shit. Okay, man. I'm

1616
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,180
just gonna turn, I just turn on the background

1617
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:09,000
tape. I'll just turn

1618
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,100
on the pledge drive tapes from before.

1619
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:12,480
Look at that.

1620
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:13,280
Yeah, yeah.

1621
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,900
Well, okay, okay. I'm gonna

1622
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,820
turn that off. We're gonna, because you,

1623
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,700
there's still a chance to

1624
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,880
call 687-6900.

1625
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:30,760
You could

1626
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,900
do it. The seconds are

1627
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:34,740
sliding by. The deadline

1628
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:36,900
is approaching. The countdown is

1629
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,880
in progress. The balloon

1630
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:39,820
is going up.

1631
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,340
X-Day is coming.

1632
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:44,980
I'm cooler than you

1633
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:45,700
are.

1634
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,400
I'm weightier

1635
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,200
than you are.

1636
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,000
I'm more formless

1637
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,900
and diseased than the

1638
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:57,220
saints. I have

1639
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:58,740
three purple

1640
00:56:58,740 --> 00:56:59,580
girlfriends.

1641
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,060
So I'm reading a set list here

1642
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:05,080
again. Friends... Now look at

1643
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,540
this beloved donator.

1644
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:09,360
He not only donated blood, but $10.

1645
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,060
And does he, he doesn't even want a premium.

1646
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,080
All he wants is a program

1647
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,020
guide so he can learn about the

1648
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:16,680
other fabulous shows on

1649
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,680
CSB, such as Radio

1650
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,660
Synesthesia, coming up next

1651
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:22,400
every Sunday night at 10 o'clock.

1652
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:23,900
Praise Troy.

1653
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:27,200
Praise Troy. And praise Helen of Troy.

1654
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,860
Helen of, uh...

1655
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,180
I saw

1656
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:33,200
the movie of that not too long ago.

1657
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:35,200
And you

1658
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,220
played Paris Hilton. It was stiff.

1659
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,460
It was stiff, yeah.

1660
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:40,300
It had some marvelous

1661
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,180
panoramic scenes that were

1662
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:45,380
all special effects. But you know, everything's

1663
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:47,100
just a special effect. When are we gonna get that?

1664
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:47,920
When are we gonna get real, friends?

1665
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:51,260
When are we gonna get real?

1666
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:53,040
You got

1667
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,820
two more minutes to get real in.

1668
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:56,420
And then

1669
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:58,960
any call you make is gonna go into

1670
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,760
the earhole pockets

1671
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,200
of Dr. Sinister.

1672
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:04,940
Now that's almost as

1673
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:05,960
good as Bob.

1674
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:08,980
Do you understand

1675
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:11,280
infinity? Do you understand

1676
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,000
the crushing and crunching of

1677
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,040
time into four, five, six,

1678
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:15,960
seven dimensions?

1679
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,960
If you can, you can see that little pink

1680
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,760
finger twisting around the clock

1681
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,560
saying that you have

1682
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,500
two, that's two

1683
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,420
minutes to call.

1684
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,040
120 seconds to answer

1685
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,840
your life's delirium.

1686
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,120
The thing that brought you here

1687
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,400
out of that slab

1688
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,280
and a wound that dropped

1689
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,680
in the face.

1690
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,440
Why are you here

1691
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,820
if not to pledge

1692
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:44,140
to us?

1693
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:46,180
Alright, well look.

1694
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,720
We've got work to do.

1695
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:50,480
I've gotta go work on my history

1696
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,600
of the subgenius online course

1697
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,440
I'm doing with MaybeLogic.org.

1698
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:56,840
My hysterical piece.

1699
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:57,640
Oh, what was it again?

1700
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:01,860
Oh, this thing I'm doing on MaybeLogic.org.

1701
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:03,060
It's an online

1702
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,360
academy of...

1703
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,340
You just have to look at it.

1704
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,000
You don't care.

1705
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,980
I know, but he's such a...

1706
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,000
You are a brilliant man and you've given

1707
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,800
so much and yet they want to pledge

1708
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,800
so little. What can I say?

1709
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,100
Actually, friends, we love those

1710
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,460
of you who've pledged

1711
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:23,260
and we detest and despise

1712
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:24,880
everyone who didn't pledge.

1713
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,920
We look down on you like

1714
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,300
you were a dog.

1715
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:30,680
Like you were some kind of dirty dog.

1716
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,180
Like a blower than a primate

1717
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:34,980
as Jim Jones said as he

1718
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:36,860
seemed not to understand that humans

1719
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:38,820
are primates. In fact,

1720
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,020
when we leave tonight, the guy that I

1721
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:42,560
usually see and say hi to

1722
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,800
that is sweeping up down by the

1723
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,100
bottom, as you mean there,

1724
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,740
he usually takes care of the floors around there

1725
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:50,780
and he is always very friendly. If I

1726
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:53,020
hear that that guy didn't

1727
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:55,180
pledge at least five lousy

1728
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:56,580
bucks, he's got a job staying.

1729
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,800
You know, and most of us don't really have

1730
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,600
real jobs, you know, just come around

1731
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,760
and you get enough gas money, oh, you go up to the

1732
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,880
station, you know. You think I'm

1733
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,740
going to talk to him? You think I'm going to say hi like I

1734
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:08,920
usually do? Say, hey, bud, what's going on?

1735
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:09,960
You catch a brown today?

1736
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:12,300
You know what I'm going to say to him? I'm going to say

1737
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:14,860
beep you because I'm not allowed

1738
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:16,920
to really say it and I'm going to shoot him

1739
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,840
a bird or two and I'm

1740
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,620
going to storm past him and say, if you don't want to

1741
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:22,500
pledge and put your money where your mouth is,

1742
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,840
your mouth smells like

1743
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:26,320
pooey.

1744
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:26,920
Pooey, yeah.

1745
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,280
Pooey. Okay, we've got to get out of here.

1746
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,080
Friends, this is

1747
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,600
WCSB 89.3

1748
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,140
FM in Cleveland, Ohio.

1749
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,140
An inappropriate... I better take

1750
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:40,140
this inappropriate song off because

1751
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:42,160
people thought it had cuss words in it

1752
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,900
even though we were just singing in

1753
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,640
Romanian and, well, okay.

1754
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:47,400
Stay tuned.

1755
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:49,800
Price Bob.

1756
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:51,980
Thank you

1757
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:53,780
for your pledges.

1758
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,520
Now, fork it over, baby.

1759
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:57,420
You humanist!

1760
01:00:57,580 --> 01:01:00,100
You subgenius!

1761
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,660
So, friends,

1762
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:03,820
you know, the money isn't just for the hour of slack.

1763
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:05,580
It's for the totality that is

1764
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:07,680
this station. It isn't just for us

1765
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,760
mutants. It's for your

1766
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,660
very mind, your very soul.

1767
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,840
And you wouldn't believe how close your

1768
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,380
soul is to being sold out.

1769
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:16,620
Dear

1770
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:18,400
brother or sister, between your job

1771
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,460
and the drugs and the lies, listen, you need

1772
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:22,420
every bit of slack you can hang on to.

1773
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,520
But we have a special form of slack

1774
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,080
in store for you tonight.

1775
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:28,480
Not stored in souls anywhere,

1776
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,160
folks.

1777
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:32,180
And the type of slack you're going to be getting

1778
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:34,320
is guilt. Guilt.

1779
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,200
Tonight, we're going to whip us up some guilt.

1780
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,220
And some of you are saying, oh, it's pledge time.

1781
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:40,500
Reverend Stang's going to rant all night about

1782
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,640
money. And you'd better

1783
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,900
be afraid that that's true,

1784
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,260
little Bobby, little Gimme Bob out there.

1785
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,980
At this level, our salesman

1786
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:50,880
can see the top of the ladder and is well

1787
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:51,620
on his way there.

1788
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:00,980
One of the good old boys

1789
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,880
are here tonight. We'd like to welcome you down to

1790
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,100
the television mission. Don't forget

1791
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:06,780
if all you can do is sit at home, then

1792
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:08,320
try to keep yourselves awake

1793
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:10,460
and dial the phone.

1794
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:11,720
Call in for pledges.

1795
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:14,800
Yes, answering the phones this evening.

1796
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:16,200
Beautiful, Dr. Zafon.

1797
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:17,500
Beautiful Reverend...

1798
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:20,880
Cecilia.
