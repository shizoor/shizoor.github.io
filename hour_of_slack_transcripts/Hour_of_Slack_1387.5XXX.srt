1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,160
I come from Thebes, and the women of Thebes are warm-blooded, passionate, and we know what we want.

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:10,740
What?

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,380
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:16,880
Bob.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:17,520
Bob.

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,320
Bob.

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,300
Bob.

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,380
The secret is obvious.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,240
Bob.

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:21,660
Bob.

11
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,000
Bob.

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,440
Bob.

13
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:22,600
Bob.

14
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,680
People that know me call me Kook, and I like it.

15
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,720
My real name is Shelley L. Dankert.

16
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:35,800
I've reached a point in my life, I'm 41, and I achieved this about two years ago, where I don't give a fuck what you think of me.

17
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,280
I really don't care.

18
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,680
If you're not in my life on a daily basis, kiss my ass.

19
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,860
I don't give a shit what you think of me, and my God, is that a good feeling or what?

20
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,960
It really is.

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,980
And so that's how I live my life.

22
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,120
Sorry to those of you who think I'm a nice girl.

23
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,580
I'm not.

24
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,680
I'm a bitch.

25
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,660
I swear, and I don't give a fuck who hears it.

26
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,000
I don't have children.

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,760
I live alone.

28
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh my God, people don't know.

29
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,740
Kiss my ass, you fucking bastard.

30
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,780
Kiss my ass.

31
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,960
You want to really do it?

32
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,020
Here, take a look, assholes.

33
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:10,840
Look at that.

34
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,080
Look.

35
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:13,880
Eat me.

36
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,960
You suppose you'd like to share that with your friends?

37
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,980
Thank you so much.

38
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,720
What part of that do you not get?

39
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,880
You're dumber than shit.

40
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,000
You ignorant fucks.

41
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,620
I'll be happy to find you in my bedroom in the middle of the night.

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,700
You assholes.

43
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,040
Come on over.

44
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,660
I've got chips over here, because that's what I had for supper tonight with my, um,

45
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,700
ah, what do you call it, cheese dip.

46
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,000
God, I'm sick and tired of this shit.

47
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,140
I'm talking to all you namby-pamby pussies.

48
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,260
You want to call me unhinged?

49
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,400
I am.

50
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,600
You'd be right.

51
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,240
I'll fucking kill you, and I'll enjoy doing it.

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,520
Fuck you.

53
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,400
You goddamn motherfuckers.

54
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,820
Go to hell.

55
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:56,980
Shut up.

56
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,080
Shut your fucking mouths.

57
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,860
Get the hell away from me, you worthless bastards.

58
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,440
You're too fucking stupid to live.

59
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,980
So fuck off.

60
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,000
Dr. Legume did that.

61
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:16,140
He took that viral butthurt drunk lady's video and removed all the politics from it to turn it into an online dating profile.

62
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,140
He even added her photo and made it talk.

63
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,880
His YouTube channel is Dr. Legume.

64
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,580
That's D-R Legume with one word.

65
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:26,960
And, uh...

66
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,940
The title of the video is Shelly Dankert Online Dating Video.

67
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,300
Reminds me of quite a few people I know.

68
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:43,480
Anyway, friends, obviously this is one of our internet-only shows composed of audio that would be pointless if rendered fuckless and shitless.

69
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,800
And definitely not to be mailed to our beloved broadcast stations.

70
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:56,960
In this case, aside from that Legume work and the Lemur titles, it's all from 50 Next Day with rants by Dr. Legume.

71
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:11,700
Dr. Philo Drummond, Reverend Pockets, Reverend Suds Bashaw, and with a ton of excellent doctor music jams and improv singing by Reverend Angry Larry, Fat Mandy, and especially Priestess Pisces.

72
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:20,520
So, Mr. Drummond said that he would like to talk to you.

73
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,640
I don't know why I need this, but there's...

74
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,840
anaphylactic up here.

75
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,060
What? Again?

76
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,920
What song?

77
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,100
I'm going to read you some things I wrote.

78
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,120
Or co-wrote.

79
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,740
Now I'm also going to tell you that this

80
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,020
reading, some of these

81
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,480
pieces of this reading,

82
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,680
has some salty language in it.

83
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,980
So if you're a child, or you have the mind

84
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,020
of a child, or you're a child in the audience

85
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,280
you may want to leave.

86
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,540
You know, it seems like

87
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,520
everybody is trying to put

88
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,460
everyone else in some kind of group

89
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,160
these days.

90
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,800
And being a contrarian myself,

91
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,900
I'm physically unable

92
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,960
to even join a group.

93
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,540
Plus, joining a group

94
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,540
would be against my religion.

95
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,520
Why is it

96
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,980
that everyone wants to put

97
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,540
us

98
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,520
into a group?

99
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,480
This is the kind of stuff

100
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:23,920
that just

101
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,240
pisses us off.

102
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,320
This is the kind of stuff

103
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,520
that makes us hate them.

104
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,780
And since we're so pissed off,

105
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,180
I'm going to go ahead and

106
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,280
read you

107
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,140
this general official statement

108
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,480
of hate and pissed

109
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,320
off-edness.

110
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,560
Our hate is pure.

111
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,680
And as such, it's a beautiful

112
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,620
thing because we hate

113
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,100
all freaks, geeks,

114
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,580

00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,960
Polacks, cooks,

00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,740

00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,940
Thank you.

167
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,600
Thank you.

Thank you.

177
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,160
Alright, ladies and gentlemen,

178
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,020
I do have a rancher who is waiting in the wings.

179
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,760
She is super awesome.

180
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,440
She has done a lot this year to help us out

181
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,580
and she has been

182
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,480
my personal superhero

183
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,560
but she has something important she'd like to share

184
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,980
please give a hand for

185
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,540
Pockets

186
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,780
Thanks for waiting

187
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,080
but you know I've been thinking

188
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,100
so I think it's really important

189
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,480
stuff I've been thinking about

190
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,720
maybe we can not be here next year

191
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,600
be in our air conditioned saucers

192
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,260
that would be great

193
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,260
but you know I went home and I just kept thinking to myself

194
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,300
you know why are we still here

195
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,540
what did we do wrong

196
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,780
we should not be sweating

197
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,960
we should be gone, we should be on our saucers

198
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:37,720
1998

199
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,800
is coming gone according to the con

200
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,560
we've all paid

201
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,360
every single one of us

202
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,280
we've paid our 10, 20, 30, 35 dollars

203
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,440
some of us have even

204
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,620
paid Bob multiple times

205
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,360
most of us are broke

206
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,140
we don't have a pot to piss

207
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:55,300
in

208
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,340
but yet for each and every single one of us

209
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,260
there's been that moment

210
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,580
where we gladly hand over

211
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,860
a small wrinkled wad of sin money to Bob

212
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,640
we give it to him

213
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,540
it gives us our slack

214
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,800
and then every year

215
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,080
here we are

216
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,560
we travel

217
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,360
we sit

218
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,180
we gather

219
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:11,780
we party

220
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,540
and we wait

221
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,900
and this year just like every year

222
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,240
nothing happened

223
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,740
I'm a little pissed off at you Bob

224
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,060
but what can you do

225
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,820
so

226
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,120
hey guys!

227
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,120


228
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:25,280
anyway

229
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,960
come today

230
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,420
tomorrow

231
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,020
the next day

232
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,940
we're gonna travel home

233
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,360
most of us are gonna feel good

234
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,640
we're gonna be slacked out

235
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,760
you know that post-X Day vibe we all go home with

236
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,220
but there'll still be that disappointment

237
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,640
that just you fucked us again Bob

238
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,580
so what do we need to do you know

239
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,560
I look at Bob

240
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,520
and I shake my fist in the air

241
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,280
and I get so mad

242
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,880
and I say damn you Dobbs

243
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,960
are you laughing at me?

244
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,120
fuck yeah he's laughing at me

245
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,120


246
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,680
but that's what I paid him for

247
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,540
sometimes I wonder am I the joke?

248
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,240
am I the one getting fucked?

249
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,720
fuck me the joke's on me

250
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,640
it's alright

251
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,400
sometimes

252
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,760
I tell myself Bob he's just a piece of clip art

253
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,400
fuck him

254
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,720
and with that I get even angrier

255
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,280
even if Dobbs is a lie

256
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,760
I remember something

257
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,640
the conspiracy is real

258
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:21,820
oh yeah

259
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,260
the con is more real than ever

260
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,300
the pinks they are pinker than ever

261
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,180
once I pull myself together

262
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,840
and I stop laughing at the fact that absolutely nothing is funny anymore

263
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:40,280
I realize that you know maybe Bob's is real

264
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,800
the Dobbs is not a lie

265
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,140
we just haven't been ready yet

266
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:50,680
I realize that there's all these horrible disgusting pinks that want to control us

267
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,680
they want to profit off of us

268
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,860
they want our freedoms

269
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,060
they want our homes

270
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,180
they want our vehicles

271
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,540
they want our uteruses

272
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,620
and they want your semen

273
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,000
and they want all of our money

274
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,640
sure Dobbs wants your money

275
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,740
$35 of it

276
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,700
and yeah Bob totally wants you to get screwed

277
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,400
but for pleasure

278
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,820
and even though I get so angry in my moments of just hysterical pinkness

279
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,040
and I lose my faith

280
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,340
it only lasts for a second

281
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,380
and I look around at all these hidden gifts

282
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,040
all these gifts that Bob is here

283
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,920
signs

284
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,820
proof

285
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,480
hard evidence

286
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,940
that Bob is real

287
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,300
and proof that our exes are coming

288
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,680
for example

289
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,720
have you ever just been riding in your car

290
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,900
sitting at your desk

291
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,180
and you just feel that warm breeze of an inverted queef

292
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,540
just blow through your pube mullet

293
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,940
and under the pants of your legs

294
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:50,960
you know just enough to where it just subtly caresses your genitalia

295
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,080
or you know tingles your balls

296
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,400
in that way that it's just too exciting to admit

297
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,260
that you got that feeling from a correctly timed fart

298
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,120
you all know the one

299
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,440
you know

300
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,300
great Bob

301
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,040
there's these instances that normals take for granted

302
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,560
they don't get it

303
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,160
they're embarrassed

304
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,820
they're ashamed of their amazing fart

305
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,200
oh how can I enjoy that so much

306
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,900
it's disgusting

307
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,100
fucking pinks I hate them

308
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,800
it takes real yetis to embrace these rarities

309
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,940
these proofs of that

310
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,960
Bob himself

311
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,880
I mean you know

312
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,560
the pinks just will never get it

313
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,820
that's why we're different than them

314
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,240
sigh

315
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,740
so you know

316
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,760
I guess what I'm trying to say is look around and open your eyes

317
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,280
and that third nostril and pay attention

318
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,920
when you find yourself enjoying these guilty pleasures

319
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,480
really just remember realize and tell yourself

320
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,580
this is slack

321
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,120
absolutely

322
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,620
when you fart just know next year 7am

323
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,020
our saucers are coming

324
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,100
so it's good to know that we're not wasting our time waiting

325
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,540
gathering here every year

326
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,020
you know it's great to know that our X day is coming

327
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,200
so I think knowing that it's really time for us to marinate on what we're doing wrong

328
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,620
what could we be doing that is stopping these pleasure saucers from scooping us up

329
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,440
and sweeping us off to planet X

330
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,940
it can only be one thing

331
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,520
we are not slacking hard enough

332
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,960
we're just not doing a good enough job

333
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,300
and I don't mean sitting on your couch in a pile of snack wrappers

334
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,400
staring at a tower made out of empty booze bottles

335
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,860
we are doing just fine at that I assure you

336
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:28,620
sigh

337
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,900
we're just not trying hard enough

338
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,960
you know we gotta stop the man from bringing us down

339
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,700
stuff's gonna happen

340
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,240
our important things are gonna break

341
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:42,040
some big corporation is gonna rip you off for that last $12.34 in your bank account

342
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,340
somebody on the internet is going to say something so vile

343
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,940
you just cannot continue for another minute without saying it

344
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,580
and setting them straight

345
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,020
but you know instead of going all crazy head and anti-slack

346
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,880
just blow it off

347
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,080
just laugh and know you're better

348
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,500
you're a subgenius

349
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,120
and that sum of bitch is gonna burn on 1 7 am

350
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,720
sigh

351
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,840
you know a good example I think my last example is

352
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,520
you know I was watching TV not too long ago

353
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,420
and between the continuous news and things we can't do anymore

354
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,160
and the total brainwashing lies

355
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,700
I saw a commercial

356
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,380
this commercial I lost sleep

357
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,580
it drove me insane

358
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,680
there were a bunch of whiny pink women complaining about

359
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,000
oh no

360
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,440
what happens when you have that itch that you just can't scratch

361
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,920
you know that itch on your coochie

362
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,640
lord knows can't scratch it

363
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,380
you have to walk around and suffer all day

364
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,960
and before my very eyes

365
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,900
this woman dressed in a cute everyday outfit

366
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,760
she sees her reflection in the store shop window

367
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,220
and in the reflection she changes

368
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,640
she's dressed like a rape victim

369
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,180
it's ridiculous

370
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,520
hunched over

371
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,460
hair in her face

372
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,600
hoodie pulled over to hide her identity

373
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,580
because her vagina itches really is it that bad

374
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,840
so what I'm telling you guys is seriously don't be rape victims

375
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,580
just don't

376
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,380
scratch that crotch itch

377
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,420
and feel the flow of slack that comes with it when you get that relief

378
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,200
who cares if the pinks might gasp and say oh my god they're miscreant just itch their genitals

379
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,620
just fucking scratch that itch

380
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,340
scratch it feel better

381
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,520
when we in a whole can learn to scratch that itch without any worries

382
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,260
then they will come

383
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,240
it will be our moment

384
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,660
the con will burn

385
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,880
the planet will explode

386
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,620
and there will be sex and acceptable genitalia scratching for all

387
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,140
it'll be amazing

388
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,760
so I stand here tonight friends and I beg you

389
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,260
scratch that itch

390
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,500
scratch it for lawns that mow themselves

391
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,400
vehicles that never break or rely on astronomically priced fuel

392
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,400
the stench of burning 1 percenters

393
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,680
scratch it for an army of wiener dogs pooping on everybody's lawn except for yours

394
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,160
scratch it for a digital model of Jabba the Hutt in Star Wars that actually resembles the one in Return of the Jedi

395
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,100
cats that are only friendly when you're in the mood

396
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,040
scratch it for always being able to trust that fart

397
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,480
scratch it for laundry that folds itself

398
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,380
scratch it for eggs that lay chicken nuggets of solid gold

399
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:17,380


400
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,120
scratch it for chicken that grows bacon for skin

401
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,180
definitely scratch it for beds made entirely from living titties

402
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,000
scratch it for slack

403
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,560
and when you can embrace those little treasures

404
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,440
our 7am will come

405
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,060
praise Bob

406
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,460
that's the emergency gesture

407
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:49,580
where we have to get out of this song as quickly as possible

408
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,460
you see somebody doing this

409
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,740
that means they're really desperate

410
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,900
they can't wait to get it

411
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,840
they can't wait for the song to be over

412
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,860
they start doing this

413
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,640
it's only done under great duress

414
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,440
if we wanna try to put our engine to sleep

415
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:46,440


416
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:46,440


417
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:46,440


418
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:46,440


419
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:03,360
I can't stress this enough to the up-and-coming and potential preachers out there.

420
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,800
You really don't have to fake a Southern accent.

421
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,100
First off, we can tell it's fake.

422
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,900
And the other thing is, it's offensive to Southerners.

423
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,600
We're not, Southerners aren't the only ignorant, racist assholes.

424
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,080
Every part of the world, every kind of person,

425
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,960
half of them are ignorant, dipshit, asshole, pinnates,

426
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,540
and half of them are probably fine, as long as you leave them alone.

427
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:43,580
So, no, you don't have to pretend to be as redneck, illiterate, in order to preach.

428
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,420
Just because some of us,

429
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:51,200
famous preachers like Jimmy Swagger, Jim Baker, myself,

430
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,080
happen to be half-literate rednecks,

431
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,500
trying to, the priest says Pisces here,

432
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,140
you know, trying our best to imitate Dr. Howell.

433
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,860
You know, that doesn't mean everybody has to pretend to sound,

434
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,200
I've heard subgenius, beginning subgenius preachers

435
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,100
that sounded like Billy Graham,

436
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,800
but they didn't even know who they were sounding.

437
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,160
They were sounding like a takeoff,

438
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,760
like a Saturday Night Live character they'd seen

439
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,700
pretending to be Billy Graham.

440
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,680
That's the opposite of subgenius preaching.

441
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,260
Who was it, Pockets, was it Pockets that said

442
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,880
we needed to be able to scratch our nuts any time we wanted?

443
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,120
I've been practicing that.

444
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,400
I've been working on that.

445
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,620
So that means if you've got a redneck Brooklyn accent,

446
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,960
or a horrible incomprehension,

447
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,000
or a sensible British accent, or whatever,

448
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,220
it doesn't matter.

449
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:54,060
What does matter is speaking loudly and clearly.

450
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,320
And scratching your nuts.

451
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,560
Your nuts.

452
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,700
Even when they're up here.

453
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:04,560
Whatever you have to scratch, go ahead and do it.

454
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,600
Not necessarily in the convenience store

455
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,720
while the policeman's standing next to you.

456
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,180
Why not?

457
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,160
Because the policeman may arrest you.

458
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:13,620
But.

459
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,440
It's not illegal.

460
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,320
Scratch my crotch yet.

461
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,000
I'm not so sure about that.

462
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,260
There's a, the law can be defined many different ways

463
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,380
depending on who the lawyer's playing golf with.

464
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,360
No, it's illegal for you to scratch my crotch.

465
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,480
Right.

466
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,920
It's silly to argue about what's legal and what's not.

467
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,080
Because if they want to get you, they will get you.

468
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,460
Well, we should take a.

469
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,340
It doesn't matter whether.

470
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,780
We've got this audience here and we should take Pockets advice.

471
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,520
So let's make, let's everybody practice.

472
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,060
Hold on.

473
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,640
We need to practice here folks.

474
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,120
I'm going to count to three and I want everyone to, you know,

475
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,280
Pockets was saying, you know,

476
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,060
you need to be able to scratch your crotch in public.

477
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,080
So everybody out there, I'm going to count to three

478
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,800
and I want you all to scratch your crotch.

479
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,180
Are you ready?

480
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,540
Hey, turn that camera around and point at those people.

481
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,500
I want you all to do it on the count of three.

482
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,900
One, two, three.

483
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,620
Scratch your crotch.

484
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,540
Grab your dicks.

485
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:15,880
Very good.

486
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:15,880


487
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:15,880


488
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:15,880


489
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:15,880


490
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:15,880


491
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,300
Very good.

492
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,360
No, no, no, no.

493
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,620
You're not all doing it.

494
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,080
That's not scratching.

495
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,800
You're out of here.

496
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,020
You, you're out of here.

497
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,420
You.

498
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:23,860
Hey, you.

499
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,800
All right, let's try it again.

500
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,180
Out, out, out.

501
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,740
I don't care whether you don't have a crotch.

502
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,120
Oh, they say, well, I can't scratch my crotch.

503
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,900
I'm handicapped.

504
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,140
I don't have a crotch.

505
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,060
I only exist from the belly button up.

506
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,220
I'm sorry.

507
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:44,200
That doesn't, Bob doesn't care about your disabilities or what's relative to what.

508
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,880
Did you say that?

509
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:45,880


510
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,560
Did you scratch your crotch for Bob or not?

511
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,660
That's all there is to it.

512
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,440
Did you put that money in the collection plate?

513
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,280
That is all that counts.

514
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:59,460
It is not slack by dreams or words or faith.

515
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,120
It says not slack by faith.

516
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,460
It is slack by works.

517
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,980
Slack by works, I'm telling you.

518
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:15,880
Now, we originally put that cloth there, which Susie, Susie put the bloody hand in.

519
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,440
I don't know if you can see the hand prints on that, by the way.

520
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:24,260
We originally had that set there so that we could scratch our nuts without embarrassing

521
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:24,960
the audience.

522
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:31,520
But then Reverend Pockets did a whole sermon about how we should just go ahead and scratch

523
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,240
our nuts no matter who's looking.

524
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,180
And I've been working at that.

525
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,720
I don't know if anybody's noticed, but I've been going out of my way to scream when they

526
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:40,720


527
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,260
Meanwhile, Dr. Drummond and Dr. Howell go about the tricky business of regulating the

528
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:45,620
conventional medicine.

529
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,220
I'm going to show you a little bit of the conventional air flow of the fan without revealing

530
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,280
Dr. Howell's feet, as Dr. Howell is very sensitive about his feet.

531
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,500
And please don't look at them when he comes by.

532
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,680
It is improper for the audience to look at your feet.

533
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,960
I thought everybody knew that.

534
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:04,700
But if we have to roll up our plastic foot shield for Dr. Drummond, I will make that

535
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,620
sacrifice, too.

536
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,020
It's not something I've ever had to worry about.

537
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,940
I haven't had my shoes off since I was about three years old.

538
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,080
Is there any way we can, like, have film music?

539
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,280
You can grow on your feet, don't you?

540
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,100
Film music and background music on this show so that we don't have to talk or anything?

541
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:19,520
No.

542
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:23,660
When we tried to do background music the first day, it was just too loud.

543
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,540
Who said?

544
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,660
It was difficult to deal with.

545
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,680
Who said so?

546
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:32,540
A person in the audience who can hear and judge such things.

547
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,440
Paternoster.

548
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,180
Is this a special cookie?

549
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,620
I have no doubt that it is.

550
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,860
Maybe it's just one sitting in a sweet spot.

551
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,380
Is that a frop-loaded cookie?

552
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,960
I'll bet you it's as froppy as the day is long.

553
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:43,720
You want half?

554
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,780
I'll take half.

555
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,000
I'll divide and you choose.

556
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,160
Is that a Gary Gaborgfran cookie?

557
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:53,320
No, it sort of wipes away the taste of the octopus.

558
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,500
Now Dr. Drummond will imbibe the cookie.

559
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:01,480
It won't make any difference even if it was solid LSD.

560
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,160
You wouldn't notice any difference.

561
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:03,900
Yeah, you would.

562
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,940
His head turns colors.

563
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,020
I think it is solid LSD.

564
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,140
It tastes like it.

565
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,380
Dr. Philodrummond is now eating a cookie.

566
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,580
It's a cookie made of solid LSD.

567
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,480
That's all it is.

568
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,500
A well-crafted confection.

569
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,880
There's no sugar or flour.

570
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,620
It's got that telltale LSD flavor.

571
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,180
Yeah.

572
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,920
That's enough to kill an elephant.

573
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,880
Is that enough to get a hand on?

574
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,600
I can take five.

575
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,380
This is enough to flip you out.

576
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,100
Or am I going to have to talk you down later?

577
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,060
I'm thinking they have some Owlsley stuff in there.

578
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,380
How long does it take for this to come on?

579
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,260
In that quantity, I would think.

580
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,060
When do we start?

581
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,360
When do we get to the point where we're worrying, where we're not worried?

582
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:43,360


583
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,040
We're not getting high enough, fast enough, so we take the other half.

584
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:51,420
And then it turns out that was only five minutes before the first half really kicked in like crazy.

585
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:58,780
And then it started kicking in, and you immediately think, gosh, I wish I hadn't taken that other half so readily.

586
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,340
That happened to me only once.

587
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,960
How many times has that happened to you?

588
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,780
It happened to me once, the one and only time I ever had.

589
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,680
Don't leave me, Philo.

590
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,460
Keep me here, man.

591
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,980
It generally happens every time I have it in halves.

592
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,880
Dang, I'm having flashes, man.

593
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,000
It's trippy, dude.

594
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,460
This whole halving, that's a bad idea.

595
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,480
You should just take the whole thing and forget about the half.

596
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,920
Anybody got any Thorazine out there?

597
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,000
This half issue is...

598
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,140
Actually, that's what happened to me.

599
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,340
I was having muscle cramps.

600
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,980
We were finishing up the Book of the Subgenius on a deadline.

601
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,060
I hadn't slept in a long time.

602
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,760
I had to drive all the way across town.

603
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,600
And Dr. X said, there's this new pill called Quaalude.

604
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,060
Here's two of them.

605
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,480
These are real weak, though, so you should take both of them.

606
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,980
Well, I'm not stupid.

607
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,800
Or that stupid.

608
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,540
But I'm this stupid.

609
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,260
I took a half and drove to his house.

610
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,860
And I never felt it.

611
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,420
It was like half an hour gone by and I'm still having leg cramps.

612
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,320
I took the other half.

613
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,000
That's when the first half hit.

614
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,040
And I instantly dropped everything I was holding in my hand

615
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:08,600
and started making up stories about invisible people.

616
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,120
And I woke up in jail.

617
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:12,900
Yes, friend.

618
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,200
That's what it is.

619
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:20,140
That was the first and last time that I ever touched any drugs of any kind.

620
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:24,840
I've never ever since then touched any false drugs whatsoever.

621
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,800
Oh, I'm glad you said false drugs.

622
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,080
Is there anybody in here that took Quaaludes and actually successfully drove?

623
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,640
I don't know anybody that ever did that.

624
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,880
I know people that did Quaaludes and had a distinctive look to their car.

625
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,800
We called them Quaidents back then.

626
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,360
There's something attractive about it.

627
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,960
It's a weird, it's one of those kind of like a parasite.

628
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:51,240
You take the drug and it makes you want to drive but you can't drive.

629
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,200
Yeah.

630
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,600
I always give you a hint here, Dr. Drummond.

631
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,320
If the car that's got dents in it, the Quaid car,

632
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,880
if it's being driven by a good looking young woman,

633
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,400
it's a whole different thing.

634
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,300
Come get me, crow. Come get me.

635
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:06,860
You know that one?

636
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:07,280
Yeah.

637
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:07,940
Yeah, I do.

638
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,620
All right.

639
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,120
I think we're doing good on time.

640
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,780
We're having a lot of fun.

641
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:18,960
So we're, you know, the Aminas, I don't think I got to kick my ass for spending more time up here.

642
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,880
They're in Seattle right now.

643
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,220
All right.

644
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,200
All right.

645
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,800
They're on their way here.

646
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,080
Okay.

647
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,580
Very good.

648
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,000
Very good.

649
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:34,400
So that's fine because we got plenty more material here, especially for an environment like this.

650
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,580
You know, here's a chance where we all, we get together.

651
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:42,060
We see people that we haven't seen maybe in a year, maybe in several years.

652
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,060
You know, circumstances come up.

653
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,160
People miss X days.

654
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,020
Families come and go.

655
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,160
Money comes and goes.

656
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:54,320
And sometimes it can be a while between now and the time that you see your dear Yeti friend.

657
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:02,700
And this song, this song is about that, that kind of friendship, that time that you see each other.

658
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,420
Well, and then you got to go.

659
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,080
I really miss you.

660
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,780
Until I see you.

661
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:27,340
Then I wish you go away.

662
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,600
I really miss you.

663
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,240
But then I see you.

664
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,920
And soon I wonder how long you'll stay.

665
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,660
You're going to open your mouth.

666
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,140
Something stupid come out.

667
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,060
And it's time for me to go.

668
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,360
And it's time for me to say so long.

669
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,300
I really miss you.

670
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,700
Until I see you.

671
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,980
Then I wish you were gone.

672
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,860
You said let's go out drinking.

673
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,400
Don't know what I was thinking.

674
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,700
It always ends up a bad time.

675
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,200
You start out with a bitching.

676
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,580
Something about your kitchen.

677
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,800
And soon enough I'm losing my mind.

678
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,580
Yeah, no matter how hard I try.

679
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,660
I can't fake interest in your life.

680
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,640
That's why I really miss you.

681
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,200
Until I see you.

682
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,820
Then I wish you go away.

683
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,760
I really miss you.

684
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,200
But then I see you.

685
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,880
And soon I wonder how long you'll stay.

686
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,260
You've gone fucking around.

687
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,080
Almost got us kicked out.

688
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,240
From my favorite place to play my songs.

689
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,160
I really miss you.

690
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,560
Until I see you.

691
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,820
Then I wish you were gone.

692
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,880
You're boring and you don't care.

693
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,200
Your story's going nowhere.

694
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,220
Besides, I think I've heard this before.

695
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,780
Yeah, no one's even listening.

696
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,420
But still you keep insisting.

697
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,100
On being really hard to ignore.

698
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,260
Yeah, no matter how I do as a friend.

699
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,460
Could you please just skip to the end?

700
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,420
Again, I really miss you.

701
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,900
Until I see you.

702
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,220
Then I wish you were gone.

703
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,080
Now you're in everybody's business.

704
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,660
With your ill-informed opinions.

705
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,980
Whatever it is, your way is best.

706
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,520
Of course, facts are out of season.

707
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,020
And you're immune to reason.

708
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,380
And all you ever give me is stares.

709
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:09,260
Oh yes, now I really think I've had quite enough.

710
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,520
I just let the machine pick up.

711
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,500
I really miss you.

712
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,120
Until I see you.

713
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,500
Then I wish you were gone.

714
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,760
I really miss you.

715
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,200
But then I see you.

716
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,840
And soon I wonder how long you'll stay.

717
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,360
You ever hear yourself talk?

718
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,880
It's more than a thought.

719
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,060
The things you say are patently wrong.

720
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,040
You only talk about.

721
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,080
You shit you wish you could do.

722
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:41,140
If you shut down your computer and put away your bong.

723
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,720
You never pick up the tab.

724
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,220
Or make anyone laugh.

725
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,280
The order of your body is best described as strong.

726
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,200
I really miss you.

727
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,680
Until I see you.

728
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,960
Then I wish you were gone.

729
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,600
Wish you were gone.

730
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,160
I really miss you.

731
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,640
Until I see you.

732
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,280
Then I wish you were gone.

733
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,980
Wow, wow, wow.

734
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,340
That one was St. Andrew the Impaled.

735
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,760
Live at 50 next day.

736
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,900
Accompanied by himself.

737
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:11,560
You can find Andrew the Impaled by googling said name.

738
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,680
He really does impale himself too.

739
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,560
We'll hear some of that in the next X-Rite Net Only episode.

740
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:25,240
We had enough cuss filled material for two of these special types of shows.

741
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,860
The gang game a little close.

742
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,500
Alright.

743
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,600
It looks like there's actually going to be jamming.

744
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,060
I see musicians getting up here which would be fun.

745
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,320
I'm going to take my chances.

746
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,080
Do you have any other old doctors who...

747
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,300
No?

748
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,080
Fucking old doctors!

749
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,980
You could try.

750
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,820
But I can tell you that you probably would...

751
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,660
Yeah.

752
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,020
Go ahead and try.

753
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,640
Hi.

754
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,300
Hi.

755
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,640
Speaking as one of the old timers.

756
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,540
Been there, done that.

757
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,880
We're already fucked.

758
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,320
You don't need to go to the trouble.

759
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,980
There's a long, long line.

760
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,340
They're so fucking deep.

761
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,280
Go around the block and join the rest.

762
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,260
.

763
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:19,700
.

764
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,160
.

765
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:23,740
.

766
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,860
.

767
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:24,920
.

768
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,660
.

769
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,160
.

770
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,680
.

771
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:26,680


772
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:26,760
.

773
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:26,760


774
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:30,860
.

775
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:30,880
.

776
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:30,880


777
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,180
.

778
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:31,180


779
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:31,180


780
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:31,200
.

781
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:31,200


782
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:31,360
.

783
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,380
.

784
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:31,380


785
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:31,380


786
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:31,380


787
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:31,380


788
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:41,260
. . .

789
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:41,260


790
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:41,260


791
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:41,260


792
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,920
. . . . . . . . burada N-e learned enough.

793
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,140
.

794
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:43,380
05.

795
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:43,380


796
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:43,380


797
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,420
. . . . Obyi?

798
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:45,580
.

799
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,220
.

800
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,300
Futhermore.

801
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:47,760
No, that's the Forget-Tomorrow.

802
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,580
grass like in your home backpack.

803
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:49,960
.

804
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,140
.

805
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:56,140
Long hair, blue eyes, and a nice tiny.

806
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:03,060
So Bob, being the precocious nine-year-old that he was, said,

807
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:08,100
Connie, darling, tell me about love.

808
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,400
And he put on a little bit of Rick James.

809
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:24,300
Connie didn't really dig Rick James, but it didn't really matter.

810
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:30,100
But Connie knew exactly what she was after.

811
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,680
She sat him down on the couch and said,

812
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,140
Why don't you change this record?

813
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,040
I'm more of a Dick Dale kind of girl.

814
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,320
With the emphasis on Dick as she said it.

815
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,280
While Bob was precocious as a nine-year-old,

816
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,700
I mean, he really didn't get the hint, you know.

817
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:07,660
But, you know, Connie tried anyway.

818
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,380
And while he was trying to get the hint,

819
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,060
while the Dick Dale record laid,

820
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,180
Connie plotted to get laid.

821
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:20,900
And dogs really didn't get it

822
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,400
until Connie put her hand in his pants.

823
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,080
Well, Bob jumped up and was a little bit startled.

824
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,720
I mean, yeah, he's nine years old,

825
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:41,180
but there's this beautiful girl and she's got her hand.

826
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,060
And he's got her hand in his pants.

827
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:51,140
And, well, you know, he started feeling a little bit funny.

828
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,320
A little tingle down below.

829
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,760
And it reminded him of when he watched Charo.

830
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,360
So, well, Connie started rubbing around

831
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,900
and, well, he was like,

832
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:11,960


833
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:11,960


834
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:11,960


835
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:11,960


836
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:11,960


837
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:11,960


838
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:11,960


839
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,900
sure enough, before Bob even knew it,

840
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,980
she had unbuttoned his pants

841
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:22,060
and got them down about, you know, mid-five.

842
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,240
Bob was getting a little nervous

843
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,520
and his palms were starting to sweat.

844
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,700
And, well, he really didn't know what to do.

845
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:39,200
I mean, he's nine years old, for fuck's sake.

846
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,220
I mean, he's nine years old, for fuck's sake.

847
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,460
Well, you know, he's nine years old together.

848
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:55,800
There we go, right?

849
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,980
transition, uh, I love Jack.

850
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:58,980


851
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:58,980


852
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:59,900
He's only seven years older.

853
00:39:59,900 --> 00:39:59,920
Look.

854
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:01,680


855
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:01,680


856
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:01,880
I'm about to kill him!

857
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,620
I'm fucking, I'm fucking, I'm fucking, I'm fucking, I'm fucking, I'm fucking, I'm fucking, I'm fucking corpse.

858
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:04,960
I'm running out of notes here.

859
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,520
I don't know what I've got on me.

860
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,040
I've only listened to the onlyockable tracks on 993.com in two weeks.

861
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,680
Yeah, and the last of them are called XO's Melody Tutorials.

862
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:12,360
.96.

863
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:17,540
Connie then put her face in his crotch.

864
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,720
And Bob exclaimed loudly,

865
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,220
Why are you licking my pee-pee?

866
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,600
And things began to get weird after that.

867
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:48,660
So she's down in his lap with her mouth on his nine-year-old cock.

868
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:56,400
As I said, he was a little bit precocious as a nine-year-old.

869
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:05,580
And as she's moving her mouth up and down,

870
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:13,440
and up, and down, and up, and down, and up, and down on his cock,

871
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,060
things got a little bit more than tingly.

872
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,840
But I happen to be fun.

873
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:21,860
Snatch.

874
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:29,540
Connie realized really quick that Bob really wasn't experienced.

875
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:32,820
And...

876
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,160
she was gonna have to drive this car.

877
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,700
Good thing was that she knew how to drive stick.

878
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,760
Connie climbed...

879
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,960
straddle Bob...

880
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:02,180
and slid herself down...

881
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,760
on Bob's lap.

882
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,260
That's nasty. That sounds nasty.

883
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,720
And you know what happened next?

884
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:20,180
Because Bob is a subgenius. In fact, he is THE subgenius.

885
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:26,660
And he's a true overman. And he is a yeti.

886
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,900
Connie quickly found out what happens.

887
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,920
When an overman loses his virginity.

888
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:42,100
She started out slow, of course. You know, not wanting to make things too rushed.

889
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,620
Because after all, the first time is always a little rushed anyway.

890
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,020
But that happened in other little snatches.

891
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,300
Before the big ones.

892
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,780
And as she was rhythmically...

893
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:59,140
to the tune of that Dick Dale record...

894
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,800
grinding and sliding and...

895
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:02,800


896
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,740
grinding and sliding...

897
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,980
two will be grinding at the tail, and one will be smashed.

898
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,540
She found out...

899
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,400
that Bob suddenly grew...

900
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,240
three more...

901
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,340
canines!

902
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,660
That the smash is imminent.

903
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,600
The snatch is at hand.

904
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:28,260
The snatch will come with any little help.

905
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,800
And that's what she was thinking.

906
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:32,800


907
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:32,800


908
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,920
But that did not come.

909
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,380
And the swords did.

910
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,580
And the

911
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,020
fred door slipped.

912
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:48,860
Well, it could but wheels...

913
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,380
just did not play.

914
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:05,680
All I know is that there might be

915
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,840
Things I've never seen before

916
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,560
The sun is starting to ruffle outside

917
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,840
The sky is turning black

918
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,800
And the wind is starting to thrust it back

919
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,520
And there was a sound in the distance that sounded

920
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,060
Like an oncoming freight train

921
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,640
All the birds stopped singing

922
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,100
Church bells were ringing

923
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:57,000
And the wind blew with great ferocity

924
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:05,120
And in a small town

925
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,820
In southern Texas

926
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:15,800
Miles away from the Gulf of Mexico

927
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:22,300
A hurricane of epic proportions formed

928
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,840
And Bob

929
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:32,380
Bob started singing

930
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,720
That was pretty good

931
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,400
And that

932
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,300
Is how Bob lost his virginity

933
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,440
Without further ado

934
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,560
I'd like to present

935
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,100
Reverend Suds Peshaw

936
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,420
Who has some words for you

937
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,880
Friends it's obvious

938
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:02,800
That I'm not the only one

939
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:02,800


940
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:02,800


941
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:02,800


942
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:02,800


943
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:02,800


944
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:06,320
Bob's teaching is very important to all of us

945
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,300
I mean hell

946
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:11,380
If not for those teachings none of us would even be here at this moment

947
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,220
But you know

948
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:17,040
It seems that a few folks have been

949
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,000
Getting some mixed signals

950
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,840
Here as of late

951
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,420
A few of them

952
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,260
Just seem to have turned away from the path of slack

953
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,760
And a few of them

954
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,800
Have even plunged into the depths of the earth

955
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,960
And have listened to shoelace eating jack fuck lotusy

956
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,480
And started following

957
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,740
The wrong Bob

958
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,940
I'm sure you've seen these around

959
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,260
The multitude of

960
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,760
False Bob images

961
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,400
That are cluttering up all our lives

962
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,680
Trying to drive us from the warmth

963
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,120
Of the one true holy pipe life

964
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,360
Friends

965
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,680
Do not

966
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,780
Be fooled by cheap imitations

967
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,720
Even a cheap imitation

968
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,860
Like saccharine

969
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:09,440
Has been shown to cause cancer in lab rats

970
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,860
Imagine what a cheap imitation

971
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,320
Of Bob could do

972
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,080
Even the massive array

973
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,460
Of reproductions

974
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,000
From within our own church

975
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,060
Could never hold the slackful might

976
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:24,020
Of the one true Dobson

977
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,080
Now you're

978
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,080
Probably wondering to yourself

979
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,180
Just how are we able to tell

980
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,020
These false idols from

981
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,860
The one true Dobson

982
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:34,780
From the real world

983
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,300
Visual aid

984
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,700
It's quite simple really

985
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,420
And I've even brought you visual aid

986
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,100
To help demonstrate

987
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,320
And it's so simple

988
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,080
That any of you out there

989
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,880
Have the capacity to understand this

990
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,700
You just

991
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,340
Look

992
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,400
For

993
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:58,740
The R

994
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,640
That's right friends

995
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:02,680
The C

996
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,700
The sacred R

997
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,780
More powerful

998
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,420
Than his pipe

999
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:10,660
More important than his slackful grin

1000
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:12,020
More valuable

1001
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,840
Than the total sum of the dots

1002
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,000
Riddled across his face

1003
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,100
Friends

1004
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:20,640
Let you know one of the many

1005
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,020
Secrets of this church

1006
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,080
That it's so obvious

1007
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,400
That nobody seems to grasp

1008
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,520
This sacred R

1009
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,240
Is the true secret

1010
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,400
Of Bob's power

1011
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,160
Slack may be the ultimate outcome

1012
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,420
But the might of the sacred R

1013
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,980
Cannot be denied

1014
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,040
For without that R

1015
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,440
Bob is powerless

1016
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,360
Yes friends

1017
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,640
Without that symbol our sacred

1018
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,680
Salesman is nothing more than some

1019
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,480
Random piece of clip art

1020
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,480
That any poe bucker

1021
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,680
Fucker could use

1022
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,660
Without it

1023
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,220
He's a mug

1024
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:00,020
That you can use to advertise

1025
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,480
Argyle socks

1026
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,760
Without it

1027
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,200
He could appear in a smears ad

1028
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,960
For pink leisure suits

1029
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,460
Or worse

1030
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:11,140
Or worse

1031
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:13,820
They could actually remove

1032
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,400
His pipe

1033
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,320
And furthermore

1034
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,220
He was stolen to

1035
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,980
Sell pink sardons right Stang

1036
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:29,960
Yeah

1037
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,440
This ad actually happened but look how that

1038
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:32,840
Turned out

1039
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,160
The heads of the company were convicted of fraud

1040
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,420
In the false Bob image

1041
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:39,620
And allegedly disappeared somewhere in the Caribbean

1042
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:42,240
Even the owner's own mother

1043
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,120
Went to the slammer for this

1044
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,700
That is true

1045
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,480
Slack power radiating from that

1046
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,280
Sacred R

1047
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,300
This R has so many meanings

1048
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,380
Especially if you're a pirate

1049
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:55,040
Arrrr

1050
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,440
It stands for the righteousness

1051
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,060
Of subgenious rage

1052
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:01,400
It stands for the ridicule

1053
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,720
Of the guinea bobs

1054
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,700
Who think they can take our sails

1055
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,960
To a whole new level

1056
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:10,800
It stands for Ragnarok

1057
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,320
That's right friends

1058
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,580
It grants us the power

1059
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:16,440
Not to dominate the lesser species

1060
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,220
But to decimate every last

1061
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,560
Stink in one of them

1062
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,700
But most important of all

1063
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:25,060
Friends

1064
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,880
It stands for registered

1065
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:29,240
Trademark

1066
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,180
For with that R

1067
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,200
He's R Bob

1068
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,660
Praise Bob

1069
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:37,700
Yeah

1070
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:38,520
Yeah

1071
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,460
Oh

1072
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,300
R

1073
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,200
R

1074
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,520
R

1075
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,360
R

1076
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,500
R

1077
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,760
R

1078
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,120
R

1079
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:53,400
R

1080
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:59,620
R we got men

1081
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:01,260
We are

1082
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,680
We are drunk

1083
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,480
R R

1084
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,180

R R we are a

1089
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:15,760


1090

R We must repeat

1094
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:28,180
R. Frohtis Suds Peshaw at X-Day Drill number seventeen

1095
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,400
Also know as 15 X-Day

1096
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,600
All the music from tonight's show it from

1097
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:39,180
from the X-Day stage as well, mostly by the ever-changing jam band, heard in the background,

1098
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,600
called Several Fisted Tales of Connie.

1099
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:48,780
I think for most of what we're hearing tonight, the musicians were Reverend Angry Larry on

1100
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:56,020
guitar and vocals, Suds Bashaw on guitar, Bishop Stick on bass, Dr. Sinister or Senator

1101
00:51:56,020 --> 00:52:01,840
Speck on drums, Trademark Gunderson of Evolution Control Committee on samplers, keyboards,

1102
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:09,860
keyboards, and thimble-tron, and Dr. Drummond on sax, Reverend Hazel of the Windmills on

1103
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:14,560
flute, and there were other people, but I'm not going to look at every videotape to figure

1104
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:21,940
out who, but the vocals, as in this upcoming song, are mostly by Priestess Pisces, joined

1105
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:26,300
in this particular case by Reverend Fat Man D, Price Bob.

1106
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:31,820
This jam of beats motivates you.

1107
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,420
It can give you a sexual feeling.

1108
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,640
A girl can be turned on by the beats.

1109
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:06,840
And here goes the circuit of beats.

1110
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,440
It's a little bit of confusion.

1111
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,580
It's the jowls of our hearts.

1112
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:13,120
A little confusion.

1113
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,600
Oh, hey, that's a sequence of four beats.

1114
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,860
It's a feeling of defeat.

1115
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,360
It motivates you to turn on the music of some of the players.

1116
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:29,700
Oh, yeah, see, we're loud on the beats.

1117
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,600
Oh, yeah, see, we're loud on the beats.

1118
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,060
It landmarks what the Chinese call the

1119
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:45,060


1120
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:45,080
The ticket is a one-track windmill of whyMusic.

1121
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:45,080


1122
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:59,560
through two rounds.

1123
00:53:59,560 --> 00:53:59,560


1124
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:25,720
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah

1125
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,260
Yeah, it's right there, yeah

1126
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:36,940
Ooh, ah, yeah

1127
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,140
It's right there, yeah

1128
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:41,400
It's right there, yeah

1129
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:47,900
It's right there, ooh, ooh, ah

1130
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:54,900
Ooh, ah, yeah

1131
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:59,200
Yeah, yeah

1132
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:03,720
Oh, yes, ooh

1133
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:08,220
Yes, yes, yes

1134
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:13,080
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

1135
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:18,200
When you were passing that prop stick

1136
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,540
I didn't know you'd be passing my stick

1137
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:25,400
My stick's prop stick

1138
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:30,040
So, skiffing

1139
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:35,120
Bulbous, round, bulbous, bulbous

1140
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:39,180
Bulbous, round, bulbous, bulbous

1141
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:42,140
I don't know if I can, uh, suck that, uh

1142
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,460
I don't know if I can suck that hard enough

1143
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:55,860
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah

1144
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:59,940
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah

1145
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:04,920
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah

1146
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,380
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah

1147
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:06,960
I don't know if I can, uh, suck that, uh

1148
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,320
Yeah, just like that

1149
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:13,400
I don't know if I can, uh, suck that, uh

1150
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,060
I don't know if I can, but I can

1151
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:18,460
Oh, boy, darlin', you know

1152
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:20,660
But you got it wrong

1153
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:26,460
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah

1154
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:27,360
I don't know if I can, but I can, uh, suck that, uh

1155
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:27,420
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah

1156
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:27,420


1157
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:30,240
Ooh, ha, uh, ooh, htill, for me, all that

1158
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,680
I'm getting orgasm on the fucking moon

1159
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:49,800
Just like that, just like that, just like that, baby

1160
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:03,000
Just a little more

1161
00:58:32,040 --> 00:59:00,180
Just a little more

1162
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:27,760
Just a little more

1163
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,560
That was great, babe.

1164
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,520
I'm a bit raw.

1165
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,880
Fucking high.

1166
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,860
That is so fucking high.

1167
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:45,600
I gotta put this away.

1168
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:46,620
I'm too high.

1169
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,180
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up

1170
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:52,040
for the amazing

1171
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,960
newly married

1172
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,540
sex god and goddesses.

1173
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,460
The one and unfortunately

1174
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:00,220
only Mr. and Mrs.

1175
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,300
Mrs. Sodson Pisces

1176
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:02,820
Pasha!

1177
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,160
Without whom, none of this would be necessary.

1178
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,640
You've been listening

1179
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,580

Praise Bob!

1194
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,120
Friends,

1195
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,520
we're glad you listened to this show

1196
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,580
and we're even more glad that some

1197
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:57,680
listeners have donated enough to help us

1198
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,820
keep on going for another couple of months.

1199
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,000
Not just this show, but

1200
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,080
subgenius.com and all the other

1201
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:04,880
archive sites.

1202
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,420
But if you truly love Bob

1203
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:10,280
and want some of that slackback

1204
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,960
to rebound to you,

1205
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,820
you should go to subgenius.com

1206
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:16,420
front page or especially

1207
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:18,340
the radio page or the catalog

1208
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:19,400
store pages

1209
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:22,340
and help out financially as best

1210
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:24,240
you can. Now, we

1211
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,300
know what it's like to be on the brink of

1212
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:28,240
total poverty and we don't want any

1213
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,100
subgeniuses to make their own situation.

1214
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,440
It's worse. But some of you

1215
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:33,760
still have jobs.

1216
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,320
Even five bucks makes a

1217
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,340
big difference, even if it's only

1218
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:40,660
once a month from enough of you.

1219
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:42,340
Fifty bucks makes an even

1220
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:43,020
bigger difference.

1221
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,380
All we're saying is that

1222
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:48,340
blow jobs could

1223
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:49,760
go the way of Steve jobs

1224
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,520
if you don't pay dogs.

1225
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,260
We also take checks

1226
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:55,440
and money orders to

let there be slack.
