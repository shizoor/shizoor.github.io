All things dull and ugly, all creatures short and squat.
All things rude and nasty, the Lord God made the lot.
Each little snake that poisons, each little wasp that stings.
He made their brutish venom, he made their horrid wings.
All things sick and cancerous, all evil great and small.
All things foul and dangerous.
The Lord God made them all.
Each nasty little hornet, each beastly little squid.
Who made the spiky urchin, who made the shots, he did.
All things scabbed and ulcerous, all pox both great and small.
Putrid, foul and gangrenous, the Lord God made them all.
Amen.
Amen.
, send compassion from above to raise them all today.
In the fullness of thy power, shed thy glorious beams.
Upon the earth and all thereon, where life in shadow seems.
Let the light of God blaze forth to cut men free from pain.
Raise them up and clothe them with your love.

Congratulations to God with thy mighty, I am name.

Smile to Texas. Smile to Texas. Smile to Texas. Smile to Texas. Smile to Texas. Smile to Texas.
These people are not some kind of UFO organization speaking for 10,000 scientists out there. These are
a couple of very far out people who are not even accepted in the UFO movement.
And if that is the case, why are we shooting at them?
I think
they're saying that people tell you the God's truth.
And I still transfixed. As a matter of fact, I was scared,
very badly frightened. I don't know what they are. I don't claim to know.
I'm not sure I even want to know, but I know that they do exist. They call themselves preachers.
They're not. They just call themselves that. They go all year long acting just exactly what a Christian
ought to and they'll take off about two weeks out of the year and go hide somewhere and sin.

Well, you're listening to the subgenius

Dear listeners, your regular

he's out working.
It's funny, most shows, their

when they go on vacation or whatnot.
Ours doesn't appear when he's
out working, and he is out

it's your friend

there's a song here by
the great John Bartles

are so universal,

I quit football too
I did not come this country
To be treated like fools

This is three cars ahead of me and this is a three car light.
And the first one, look, the first one hadn't even moved.
It's already been green for 20, look at that.
It's 109 degrees.
The first one is such a, ah, the way these people are.
As for you, you yourself involved, oh.
You shouldn't even be allowed on the road.
I can't believe.
Sit there for 20 seconds while the lights are out.
I went through it red.
It's just, you know, they're all so sound asleep, Doug.
You wonder what the f*** are they doing.
What's wrong?
It's the wind.
I can't see it.
Oh, no.
It's like the whole world moves around you in a trance-like state.
Unheeding, unfeeling, unseeing, unthinking.
The whole thing stops.
You insensate me.
Me too.

That's what 99% of the population, that's all they do.
They don't create anything.
They don't think.
They don't have interesting conversations.
They don't even talk to each other.
The whole thing is just absolutely ridiculous, Doug.
I'm just, you know, American culture is really,
starting to get my case bad.
I hear you're doing wonderful things with adipoidal tissue.
They're just all so self-involved.
I mean, I thought Brazilians were self-involved, but at least when things like traffic and
stuff like that, dangerous and self-involved as they are, at least they're awake, you know.
They're dangerous because they drive so fast, so speedily and so sportily, but at least
they're running at 95% when they do this.
People here drive on about 12%, man.
You can tell, especially in the mornings.
They got their little coffee cup, the one with the big wide flat bottom so it won't fall over.
And you know, they're just drinking coffee or doing their damn makeup or hair in the mirror.
You get behind them and they're not paying any attention to the traffic.
All they're looking at is the taillights of the guy in front of them.
That's all, that's as far as they can see.

Of all the vexations and problems which afflict the show from time to time, none is as deadly

These pestiferous individuals who persist in contacting the show and causing the lights
on the board to flash, distracting the doctors as they attempt to do their work, never give
up or even consider the fact that their puerile spoutings and spewings may be of no slight
interest to the great minds and brilliant intellects of the doctors of the air.
Yet, they persist.
In attempting to contact us.
What's your phone number?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Just you and me.
Hi girls.
Let me get a hold of myself.
We haven't given out the phone number once, but that's the way the show is, of course.
So we're going down to the...
Okay girls, the lineup is up.
Brother, I've had some tough nuts to crack in my time.
Thanks.

Oh, well, mister, you scare me, too.
You don't look like me.
You don't act like me.
You hate me.
Well, you know what?
I'm not so crazy about you, either.
Do you think you could rub some of this powder on my lips?
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
Well, I've got some.














Indeed, my son, it is all ugalabuga here.
That is what these callers have brought to us.

We're following our readings from the Long's Hat,
gateway to the dimensions,
allegedly by Dr. Hakeem Bay.
You would not be listening to this radio broadcast
had you not already penetrated halfway to the ICS.
You have been searching for us without knowing it,
following oblique references in crudely Xeroxed marginal publications
and crackpot mystical pamphlets,
mail-order cult courses in chaos magic,
a paper trail and a coded series of rumors
spread at street level through circles involved
into the illicit distribution of certain controlled substances
and the propagation of the virus.
Of certain acts of insurrection against the planetary work machine
and the consensus reality.
Or perhaps through various obscure mimeograph technical papers
on the edges of chaos science.
Through pirate computer networks
or even through pure synchronicity
and the pursuit of dreams.
In any case, we now know something about you.
You.
You.


Your interests, deeds and desires,
your works and days,
and we know your address.
Otherwise, you wouldn't be hearing this.
During the 1970s and 80s,
the chaos, so-called,
began to emerge as a new scientific paradigm
on a level of importance with relativity and quantum mechanics.
It was born out of the mixing of matter,
macro dtistematics,
ена and conophoroboeja
and a wonderful name for pollution says








on the national site of E3uk,

��
paradigm. The slogan, order out of chaos, summed up the gist of this new science, whether it studied
the weird fractional dimensional shapes underlying swirls of cigarette smoke or the distribution of
colors in marble paper. Ordov's dealt with harder matters such as heart fibrillation, particle beams,
or population frameworks. However, by the late 1980s, it began to appear as if this chaos movement had split apart
into two opposite and hostile worldviews, one placing emphasis on chaos itself, the other on order.
According to the later sect, the determinists, chaos was the enemy, randomicity a force to be overcome or denied.
The opposing faction, however, experienced chaos as benevolent, the necessary matrix out of which arises
spontaneously an infinity of variegated forms, a pleroma rather than an abyss, a principle of continual
creation, unstructured, fecund, beautiful, a spirit of wildness. Chaos as hell. Easy to predict
what would happen if chaos was a part of the chaos. Chaos as hell. Chaos as hell. Chaos as hell. Chaos as hell.
Which of these two schools of thought would receive vast funding and support from governments and
multinationals and intelligence agencies? And by the end of the decade, quantum chaos had been forced
underground, virtually censored by lack of money for research, literally censored by prestigious
scientific journals which published only papers by determinists. So even when the leading theoreticians
of quantum chaos were not able to find a way to solve the chaos, they were able to solve it.
When the chaos began to be fired from university and corporate positions, they were still able to pursue certain goals.
Even when they began to suffer political pressures as well and sought refuge and space among the mutants and marginals, still they persevered.
Up until the crash of 1987, the alternative network amounted to little more than a nebulous weave of bent pals and computer infersions.
The whole earth of nostalgia, futurologists, anarchists, food cranks, neo-pagans and cultists, self-publishing punk poets, armchair schizophrenics, survivalists, and male artists.
The crash, however, opened vast but hard to see cracks in the social and economic control structures of America.
Gradually, the marginals and mutants began to be destroyed.
The world began to fill up these fissures with the webs of their own networking.
They created a genuine black economy, as well as a shifting and insubstantial autonomous zone, impossible to map, but real enough in its various manifestations.
The orphaned scientists of quantum chaos theory fell into this invisible anti-empire like a catalyst.
Or perhaps it was the end.
Or perhaps it was the other way around.
In either case, something crystallized.
To explain the precipitation of this jewel, we must move on to specific causes, cases, people, and stories.
The Moorish Orthodox Church of America is an offshoot of the Moorish Science Temple, the world's first Islamic heretical sect.
Founded by a black circus magician named Nobel Drew Ali, the first Muslim to have ever been a Muslim.
The church was founded in Newark, New Jersey in 1913.
In the 1950s, some white jazz musicians and poets held passports, so to speak, in the MST.
And they founded the Moorish Orthodox Church, which also traced its spiritual ancestry to various wandering bishops loosely affiliated with the old Catholic Church and schisms of Syrian Orthodoxy.
In the 1960s, the church acquired a new direction.
From the psychedelic movement.
And for a while maintained a presence at Timothy Leary's commune in Millbrook, New York.
At the same time, the discovery of Sufism led certain of its members to undertake journeys to the East.
One known by the Moorish name, Wali Fard, traveled for years in India for the purpose of

property for insane Muslims.
At the age ofytic

Import時
When history forced him to return to America in 1978,
he was able to launder his savings
by purchasing about 200 acres of land
in the New Jersey Pine Barrens.
Around the turn of the decade,
he moved into an old rod and gun club on the property
along with several runaway boys from Paramus, New Jersey,
and an anarchist lesbian couple from Brooklyn
and founded the Moorish Science Ashram.
Through the early to mid-'80s,
the commune's fortunes fluctuated,
sometimes nearly flickering out.
Bard self-published a series of Xeroxed visionary recitals
and chaos science.
After the crash, a number of destitute moors and sympathizers
began turning up at the ashram seeking refuge.
Among these were two young chaos scientists
recently fired,
fired from Princeton on charges of seditious nonsense,
a brother and sister, Frank and Althea Dobbs.
The Dobbs twins spent their early childhood
on a UFO cult commune in rural Texas,
founded by their father,
a retired insurance salesman
who was murdered by rogue disciples
during a revival in California.
One might say the siblings had a head start in chaos,
and the ashram's modus vivendi suited them admirably.
The Pine Barrens have often been called
a perfect place for a UFO landing.
They settled into an old Airstream trailer
and constructed a rude laboratory
in a rebuilt barn hidden deep in the pines.
Illegal sources of income were available
from their agricultural projects,
and the amorphous community took shape
around the startling breakthroughs
with the Ashram.

The Dobbs twins were the first to make a new project

The project was made by the Dobbs twins
during the years around the end of the decade.
As undergraduates at the University of Texas,
the siblings had produced a series of equations,
which they felt certain contained the seeds
of a new science they called cognitive chaos.
Their dismissal from Princeton followed their attempt
to submit these theorems along with the theoretical,
philosophical system built upon them,
as a joint PhD thesis.
On the assumption that brain activity can be modeled
as a fractal universe, an auteur topology interfacing
with both random and determined forces,
the twins' theorems showed that consciousness itself
could be presented as a set of strange attractors,
or patterns of chaos, around which specific neuronal activity
would organize itself.
By a bizarre synthesis of Mandelbrot and Cantor,
they solved the problem of n-dimensional attractors,
many of which they were able to generate
on Princeton's powerful computers
before their hasty departure.
Two more scientists already resuscitated the scientists,


and the two of them,
the students of Ong's Hat, joined with Fard and the twins
in founding the Institute for Chaos Studies.
By sheer chance, their work provided the perfect counterparts
to the Dobbs research.
Harold Acton, an expatriate British computer and reality hacker,
had already linked 64 second-hand personal computers
into a vast ad hoc system, based on his own
I Ching-oriented speculations.
And Martine Kalikak, a native of the Barrens from nearby Chatsworth,
had set up a machine shop.
Martine had long since proven herself a bricoleuse,
an electronics buff and backlot inventor of great genius and artistry.
With the arrival of the Dobbs twins,
she discovered her true metier in the realization of various devices
for the implementation of their proposed
experiments.
The synergy level at the ICS exceeded all expectations.
Contacts with other underground experts in various related fields
were maintained by black modem,
as well as personal visits to the ashram.
The spiritual rhythms permeating the place proved ideal.
Periods of dazed and lazy contemplation and applied hedonics,
alternating with peak bursts of energy,
and the
self-overcoming activity and focused attention.
At this hodgepodge of Moorish science,
Tantra, Sufism, Ishmaelic esotericism, alchemy and psychopharmacology,
biofeedback, brain machine meditation techniques, etc.,
it all seemed to harmonize in unexpectedly fruitful ways
with the pure science of the ICS.
Under these conditions, progress proved amazingly swift,
stunning even the institute's founders.
Within a year, major advances had been made in all the fields predicted by the equations.
Then followed a slight lull, while software programming and hardware machining
caught up with the initial breakthroughs.
Somewhat more than three years after the founding,
there occurred THE breakthrough,
the discovery which served to reorient our entire project in a new direction.
The Gate.
The accident occurred while we were in the first stages of developing the fourth generation egg,
The Gate.
At the time, we had no idea of its full potential.
However, all of us, except for the very youngest who were evacuated,
had by then been trained in elementary self-directed regeneration.
A few tests proved that with care and effort,
we could resist at least the initial onslaught of radiation sickness.
We decided to stick it out at least until the authorities,
rather than the dump, proved too hot to endure.
The Gate.
Once the Gate was discovered,
we realized the situation had been saved.
The opening, and actual interdimensional travel,
can only be effected by a fully trained cognitive chaotic.
So, the first priority was to complete the course for all of our members.
A technique for carrying young children was developed,
and it was discovered that all inanimate matter within the egg
is also carried across with the operator.
Little by little,
we carted our entire establishment,
including most of the buildings across the topological abyss.
Unlike Baudelaire, who pleaded,
anywhere so long as it is out of this world,
we knew where we were going.
Ong's hat had indeed vanished from New Jersey,
except for the hidden laboratory deep in the backwoods
where the Gate, quote, exists.
On the other side of the Gate,
we found a pine barren similar to ours,
but in a world which apparently never developed human life.
Of course, we have since visited a number of other worlds,
but we decided to colonize this one,
our first Newfoundland.
We still live in the same scattering of leather gray shacks
and Airstream trailers,
recycled chicken coops and mail order yurts,
only a bit more spread out and considerably more relaxed.
We're still dependent on your world for many things,
from coffee to books to computers,
and in fact we have no intention of cutting ourselves off from anchorites
and merely scarpering off into dream world.
We intend to spread the word.
The colonization of new worlds,
even an infinity of them,
can never act as a panacea for the ills of consensus reality
only as a palliative.
We have always taken our diseases with us to each new frontier.
Everywhere we go, we exterminate Aborigines
and battle with our weapons of law and order
against the chaos of reality.
But this time, we believe,
the affair will go differently,
because this time, the journey outward
can only be made simultaneously with the journey inward.
And because this bootleg
strap trick can only be attained by a consciousness
which has overcome itself,
liberated itself from self-sickness
and realizing itself.
Not that we think ourselves saints
or try to behave morally
or imagine ourselves a super race
absolved from good and evil.
Simply, we like to consider ourselves awake
when we're awake,
sleeping when we sleep.
We enjoy good health.
We have learned that desire demands the other
just as it demands the self.
We see no end to growth while life lasts,
no cessation of unfolding
of the continual outpouring of form from chaos.
We're moving on, nomads and monads of the dimensions.
Sometimes we feel almost satisfied,
at other times, terrified.
Meanwhile, our agents of chaos remain behind
to set up ICS courses
and distribute Moorish Orthodox literature
and subgenius propaganda
to subvert and evade our enemies.
We haven't spoken yet of our enemies.
Indeed, there remains much we have not said.
This lecture,
disguised as a sort of New Age vacation tape,
must fall silent at this point,
satisfied that it has embedded within itself
enough clues for its intended listeners
who are already halfway to Ong's hat in any case,
but not enough for those of little faith to follow.
Chaos never died.

This is again Radio Yellow.
Must breach oxygen switch.
Rocket going out of control. Off trajectory.
Must lose consciousness.
Must breach oxygen.
Passing out.
Gravity too strong.
Can't take it.
Must stay awake.
Give me a minute, Mr. Fireball.
Ahhhhhhh!
That is a shocking one.
Well, what about that, Mr. Fireball?
Get that cat out of here.
Smoke filled the refrigerator.
Dr. Fireball laid behind the bar.
Come here, son. Let me feel the bumps on your head.
The CAT scan will solve the mystery of the bump.
What's going on?
Okay, here we go.
As Dr. Fireball and Cat in hand,
the doctors begin the surgery.
They don't call me Fireball for nothing.
We'll get that bump off your head, Bill.
Oh, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
That's what's called a bump.
That electric cat's going crazy.
The show comes out of the stomach.
This is some of that sidekick surgery.
That bump has caused you, hippest love child,
to clean you off the patient.
Wow, I'd like to be cleaned off like that.
Interesting.
What kind of phrenologist are you?
Situation normal.
All phrenology done.
I wouldn't do this except if I knew where to stay.
Hold still, Philo.
An attitude of peace and harmony.
I'll say this to Philo.

It's true I may smile owing to my sincere faith in Bob.
Though I lost my career and I cry in my beer,
this show is my only real job.
What was it?
Never surpassed.
They say it can fly thousands of miles on its wings.
Wings as big as you can tell.
Metal implements out of the patient?
They built little metal implements in agriculture
and in starting their civilization.
I know.
I hope you're being stern.
I hope you're happy.
I'm a hooker barter for the love child.
Be comfortably seated or prone prior to inhaling the vapors

The sounds of KPFA fade into the distance as...
As we must know.
Well, most of this...
Excuse me.
Again.
Half hour was your good friend and mine, Reverend Stang,
reading the Hakeem Bae piece,
which I believe he also was using.
Mr. Philip Glass.
Mishima, I think.
And then Nina Hagen.
Sorry, go ahead.
And then more KPFA show.
In fact, that's what you'll be hearing once I've finished speaking,
is more KPFA show.
While you're getting your pens and pencils ready
to write down that address like you always do every week
and mean to send something,
if you've seen the latest issue of Mondo 2000,
you probably have.
I don't think it's come out yet, but we got our copy.
There's a long interview and many pieces of artwork
from St. Paul Mavridis.
And just, they ask him at one point,
who is Bob?
What is Bob?
And he says it better than I.
When he says,
J.R. Bob Dobbs is a mystery
enfolded by an enigma,
bound by a puzzle,
wrapped in a strip of bacon,
surrounded by creamy nougat
and a rich milk chocolate coating,
held together with a toothpick,
served on a greasy paper napkin.
And he also goes on to say that since he found subgenius,
he owes a lot more money than he used to
and he has to work harder than ever.
Well, that's not everyone's case.
He's a special individual.
Now, that address, as always, is
Church of the Subgenius,
or just write to Bob, it's easier,
at Post Office Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.
Texas 75214.
14306 in Dallas, Texas.
75214.
Thank you, praise Bob, and good night.
Okay, we all did that.
That's a real cheap-time effect
where we all get 60 cents each time we do it.
Okay, now Hal is riding up the hill
on a giant white Charger.
You know, and I did want everybody to remember
that after 14 years,
the link to the spacecraft is lost.
Today, NASA lost contract with the Pioneer 12 spaceship
orbiting Venus as the craft began a slow,
fiery plunge into the planet's atmosphere
14 years after starting a mission.



It plunged like an impatient lover
beneath the outer mantle of the albedo.
Initial indications are that it's gone or damaged,
and this is happening while we speak.
The radio signal was lost, possibly forever,
after the spacecraft made its closest approach to Venus.
This is Phineas Narkos' I Have a Dream's Venus.
Mr. Dyer said,
engineers will try to regain contact with Pioneer 12
and will not be absolutely certain until it was...
There it is.
There it is.
There it is.
No, I'm afraid, as we speak,
the 810-pound spacecraft,
which was built by the Houston Aircraft Company,
built in Segundo, California,
was meant to study Venus for 243 days.
The planet Venus?
It would only operate for two or three years.
We never dreamed it would last this long.
Commander Wellman here has just landed on Venus.
But as we speak,
the friction from the spacecraft's entry into the atmosphere
had been expected to melt its radio equipment.
Even if contact is briefly restored,
much of the spacecraft will burn and vaporize
as we speak.
He means that Commander Wellman has been to Venus.
And now, as we're doing this show,
no, to Venus, the planet Venus.
A little tiny space adventure.
The planet Venus?
Yeah.
I knew it.
This operation was connected to something.
Dang.
But the planet Venus?
Come on, Hell, we gotta get out of here.
See, I mean, I think it's a good thing.
But, really, for now,

we're gonna have to fucking distribute something to this show.
How odd.
This is the last time in the past 8.5 hours
that 8.5 people have told me
that they had a dream about an 8.5 earthquake.
Huh.
Well, dog my cats.
I guess it takes all kinds.
What a world.
Kinda makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Kinda makes you.
No.
In the small isolated community of River Falls after dark, Jack Flynn is trapped in an enormous
spider web stretching across the road.
His teenage daughter, Carol Flynn, sets out with a high school friend, Mike Simpson, to
find her missing father.
In a series of caves some miles out of town, the two youngsters discover and barely escape
the mandibles of an enormous spider.
That's the one where they bring it back to the high school and put it in the gym or something.
Yes, as a result of their find, the spider is cornered and knocked out with DDT, then
returned to the high school auditorium by science teacher Ed Kemmerer to await a scientific
inquiry by men from the state university.
It's huge.
And then they have a brand-new...
Reverend Howe, look at its... its...
Don't look at that.
That's obscene.
But the monstrous creature revives unexpectedly during the rehearsal of the spider web.


It's a cool swing band.
Yeah, it's playing right now.
Revivified by the pulsations of the rock and roll teenagers, the unholy thing goes scrambling
out, washing...
Scroogey, scroogey, scroogey, scroogey...
...the janitor, Mr. whatever-his-name-is from, uh, from, uh, Green Acres, you know, that
guy.
He plays the old janitor and the...
Well, actually, it was Mr. Green Jeans, but in the flash of green was the janitor's
death.
That Hal thought it was the guy from the...


...the Zoller or Zoller or Z...
Yeah, I know.
...Z-Caucus or something.
Yeah, no, yeah.
