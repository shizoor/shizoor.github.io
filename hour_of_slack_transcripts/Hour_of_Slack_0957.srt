1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,260
Alright, Bob is my only hope. Back off and give him some room to think.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:04,640
Listen.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:05,940
Alright, on one.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,080
Going up in five, four, three, two, one.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,820
The Sogenius Power of Swamp.

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,820
We'll meet again at midnight.

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,780
You are lucky, friends, that I'm busy.

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,600
Busy with secret projects.

9
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:39,560
Because when I can't assemble Hour of Slack number 957,

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,700
that means you get to hear another new and unbelievable

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,640
Reverend Susie the Floozy Show

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,500
from the great station W.

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,440
R. E. K. in Atlanta.

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,900
Yes, once again, W.

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,880
R. E. K. saves the ears of the listeners

16
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,380
in all Hour of Slack time slots.

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,300
With the legendary Bob's Slack Time Funhouse,

18
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,420
which is alternately altered by the Lymphnode Institute,

19
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,800
or as in this glorious case by the beautiful,

20
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,680
brilliant,

21
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,340
scintillating,

22
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,200
and quite mad,

23
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,660
Reverend Susie the Floozy.

24
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,820
Ah, yes.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,320
This, then,

26
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:39,660
is her 2004 Apocalypse Show.

27
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,380
Praise Bob.

28
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,540
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

29
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:08,600
Oh, yes, спаси 힘들ccjj,

30
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:08,960


31
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,480
But help me follyme.

32
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:09,480


33
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:09,480


34
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:09,480


35
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,340
We'll, go the way,

36
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:10,620
but what's to come Sal.

37
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:14,060
If God can another man to rule Braum!

38
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,180
So, well,

39
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:17,400
love God!

40
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,360
killed so many in this.

41
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:18,360


42
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:18,360


43
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,560
generation after generation.

44
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,880
Satan in a day he will never forget When the king hurls him into a bottomless pit

45
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,420
So keep your eyes on the Lord don't follow human ways

46
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,240
It's written in the Word these are the...

47
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,800
FINAL DAYS

48
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,020
FINAL DAYS

49
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,000
CHANGE YOUR WAYS

50
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,380
FINAL DAYS

51
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,380
The final days is what my song's about

52
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,920
Words so intense I might have to shove

53
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,460
Some might play hard and say I'm wack

54
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,740
But I'm talking about truth

55
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,380
Not egomaniac and ass-fuckers they listen

56
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,760
They won't be dissin'

57
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,000
Cause writing final days is a serious mission

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,600
Just so they learn I will stand stern

59
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,020
I hope my words make you start to churn

60
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,440
I'm concerned with the life that you're living now

61
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,900
Your ego's so bad that you can't even bow

62
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,320
So the song's about to end

63
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,780
Your time is running thin and now that my time is over

64
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,540
It's time for two for three

65
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,420
Begin to do this job is my only request

66
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,960
A basic rap exam puts MCs to test

67
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,600
Spread these words like a fire ablaze

68
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,300
Cause I'm telling you we're living in the...

69
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,840
FINAL DAYS

70
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,420
FINAL DAYS

71
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,000
CHANGE YOUR WAYS

72
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,460
FINAL DAYS

73
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,360
GET BUSY

74
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,400
FOR THIS AND THAT

75
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,500
FINAL DAYS

76
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:57,980
CAN'T

77
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,020
GO

78
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,820
CAN'T

79
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,560
GO

80
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
CAN'T

81
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,700
GO

82
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,800
FINAL DAYS

83
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,400
FINAL DAYS

84
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,220
Teleportation

85
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,900
These people have come from the future to visit us

86
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,480
Using the Earth Union's time machine

87
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,960
We've been sent back here to warn you all

88
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,560
We wish to change incidents that are about to take place here

89
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,680
Things that have caused catastrophe

90
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,440
In the 23rd century

91
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,880
We came here to warn you all about your country's gloomy future

92
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,440
Because in the century that we come from

93
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,440
There's no longer a Japan

94
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,380
How could that possibly be?

95
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,160
And why?

96
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,940
What's the reason for it?

97
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,020
You wanna make an omelette, you gotta break some eggs

98
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,940
See that the humans remain entertained until the end

99
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,720
The Book of Revelations tells us

100
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,220
To watch for the seven signs of evil

101
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:57,780
By

102
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,980
Sign of Evil Number Four

103
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,600
We continue in our sign of evil countdown

104
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,300
Here's Vanessa with...

105
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,020
How are things going here?

106
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,260
Doesn't look so hot

107
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,740
We'll be broadcasting in a few minutes

108
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,140
The mobile unit is also getting ready

109
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,100
Good, keep it up

110
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,740
The world's depending on us

111
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,300
Okay

112
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,680
The one question that I heard asked more than any other

113
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,480
The question is, man going to destroy himself?

114
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,880
Are we coming to the end of the world?

115
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,300
Oh God, no

116
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,600
Is today the fifth?

117
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:24,880
What?

118
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,040
The aliens are here!

119
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,020
The aliens are here!

120
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,540
The aliens are here!

121
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,900
Is God outraged with all of this?

122
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,260
I don't know

123
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,680
And he hears the rattling sabers and sees the spewing rockets

124
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,540
He sees the atomic bombs that are buried beneath the sandia mountains

125
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,400
Close to Albuquerque, New Mexico with enough detonating force

126
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,100
And destructive force to completely destroy the entire world

127
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,240
He sees the lethal snout, so...

128
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,420
Atomic submarines that plow their way through the waves of the mighty oceans

129
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,020
Levetians of the deep that could completely destroy mankind

130
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,900
With just the push of a button

131
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,660
He sees that

132
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:07,740
He sees the mighty Saturn missile belching its black smoke in flame of fire

133
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,300
Taking its cargo of flesh to the moon

134
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,040
He sees it

135
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:17,480
He also knows that madmen, in spite of their front of civilization and intellectualism

136
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,240
And getting along and peaceful coexistence

137
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,540
That have but one desire and that's to destroy and take over this entire world

138
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,200
He sees this

139
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,020
He knows this

140
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,920
Meanwhile, far below the earth's surface

141
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,760
I don't know why you don't do something from up here

142
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,360
Well I've tried, I've tried everything

143
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,740
They won't listen to me up here

144
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,660
I've sent my prophets Ezekiel, Hezekiah

145
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,520
You know what a good apocalypse costs

146
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,320
I know that

147
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,200
And you tried that earthquake in Los Angeles last year

148
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,700
Oh no no, don't blame me for that

149
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,320
That was San Andreas' fault

150
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,400
That shows the endless connection how one crime succeeds another

151
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,620
For he says the land is full of bloody crimes

152
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,700
And the city is full of violence

153
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,320
Therefore, God says, I will bring the basis

154
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,340
The worst of heathen gentile people

155
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,720
And they are going to conquer you

156
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,540
And drive you out and move into your houses

157
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,800
And your holy places will be defiled

158
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,700
Destruction comes, God says

159
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,340
Oh good God, we're doomed

160
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:19,920
No!

161
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,480
We're out of Jonah!

162
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,120
One could go on and on with reports of this nature

163
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,200
Week after week we get letters to our office

164
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,300
And it'll say, Brother Smith, it saved my life

165
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,180
You don't realize where I was headed

166
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,040
A farmer awakened one morning

167
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:41,380
And the clock struck one, two, three, seven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen

168
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,180
His wife said, honey wake up

169
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,280
He said, what time is it?

170
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,040
She said, I don't know

171
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,160
But it's later than it's ever been before

172
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,180
It's funny because it's true

173
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,220
World leaders are indeed pesky!

174
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,540
They're pessimistic!

175
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,280
They should be!

176
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,180
Is he still on the line, Gary?

177
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,080
I think we do have a guy still there

178
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,480
Is he really?

179
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,120
Listen, since we've got him holding on the line

180
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,280
Why don't we just find out what this Pessimist Club is all about?

181
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,360
How long has the Pessimist Club been around?

182
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,740
Oh, about ten years

183
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,080
But I'm pretty sure we're going to fold any day now

184
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,780
I mean, assuming we're not all killed by the earthquake first

185
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,700
Oh, boy, you really are a pessimist

186
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,460
Thank you

187
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,860
I try, but of course it never really does any good

188
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,560
Oh, of course

189
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,980
So just what do you do at a Pessimist Club meeting?

190
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,480
We make our predictions for the next six months

191
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,640
Oh, and what are they?

192
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:28,020
Well, we feel pretty sure that there will be complete and total peace throughout the entire world

193
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,180
Gee, that doesn't sound very pessimistic

194
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,420
Well, no, not for those who will survive the Earth's collision with the sun

195
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,860
Goodbye, Mr. Negative!

196
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,820
I've been hearing something on the streets the last couple of weeks

197
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,320
Weird stuff

198
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,640
Some sort of epidemic of violence, what they've been saying

199
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,760
I was talking to one old boy

200
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,120
He told me they got some sort of cold up there

201
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,460
End of the world, man

202
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,040
That's the kind of stuff

203
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,880
Take three, The Last Days of Isaac

204
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,080
This is my 33rd year

205
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,500
The year that I am to die

206
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,020
The days are pressing in on me

207
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:23,640
I feel their wild immediacy

208
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,880
And in the air, expectancy

209
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,980
Fulfillment of a prophecy

210
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,660
The last days of Isaac

211
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:50,660
All the last sweet days of Isaac

212
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,700
Etched with burning sunlight

213
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:04,020
On the inside of my eye

214
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:10,820
Will I burst into oblivion?

215
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,920
Burn in Armageddon

216
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:31,140
Will I, flaming ashes light the sky?

217
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,260
Oh, where will I be?

218
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,820
Where will I be?

219
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,320
What is out there between us?

220
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:41,320


221
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,500
Where will I be?

222
00:10:45,640 --> 00:11:03,280
Where, You will every day be?

223
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,700
Will the world ever part from me BCRhai?

224
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:05,260
Nothing can be真

225
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,380
I'll stand up on my feet

226
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:06,920
Mike Indeed

227
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,800
Mike Smart

228
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,140
You have multiple setbacks

229
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:08,200
Mike nah

230
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,800
All right

231
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,080
Everyone is crying out for deliverance.

232
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,300
Now many times you will see the president standing there in the Rose Garden with two

233
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,380
of these smiling men from the East on each side.

234
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,680
One has got a tablecloth on his head and he poses a smile and then they put there in the

235
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,680
newspaper, uh, peace.

236
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,220
I've got no problem with the peace treaties that they sign.

237
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,740
I have problem with the people who signed the peace treaty.

238
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,380
Uh, that's, that's reality.

239
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,220
George, you should be ashamed of yourself.

240
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:36,800
And how.

241
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,500
Recently, another 400 scientists, scholars, businessmen, and political leaders met in

242
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,180
Texas to ponder the problems facing mankind.

243
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,080
They said it is a gloomy world indeed.

244
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:52,280
The energy crisis, famine, the financial problems of New York City, drug abuse, and other unrelated

245
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,820
problems are all portents of the present darkness.

246
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:01,580
And the Bible says, I am the God of hell fire and I bring you fire.

247
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,780
Sudden destruction cometh upon them and they shall not escape.

248
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,200
That's what the Bible says here.

249
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,300
There shall be famine, pestilences in different places.

250
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,080
And I don't have to tell you these things.

251
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,440
You know if there ever is a time that Bible prophecy is confirmed right before our eyes

252
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:18,660
have met.

253
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,560
Plagues, pestilences, and things like that.

254
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:28,040
Yeah, now the boss says this is a very bad thing for the country, see, because this contract

255
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,600
starts after the war.

256
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:36,760
And the boss has got an idea with all this Nazi and Jap money that, uh, he's going to

257
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:36,760


258
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,400
take away.

259
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,840
Well, I haven't got it quite straight, but anyway, the boss says it's a bad thing for

260
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,240
the country.

261
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,020
So far you've told me what the boss has found out.

262
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,120
What did you find out?

263
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,400
I don't need the terrorists.

264
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,480
Boy, you're hotter than a firecracker on the 5th of July.

265
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,600
Who is it?

266
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,840
All right, listen up everyone.

267
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,160
I want you to calmly file towards the exit.

268
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,180
That's it.

269
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:58,980
That's it.

270
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,360
Nobody runs.

271
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:00,940
Just walk.

272
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,140
Single file.

273
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,460
That's it.

274
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,740
Now if we just stay calm, no one's going to hear us.

275
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:06,740


276
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:06,740


277
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:06,740


278
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:06,740


279
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:06,740


280
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,480
Nobody's going to be harmed by the huge bomb that's going to explode any minute.

281
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,560
It's a cookbook.

282
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,180
It's a cookbook.

283
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,900
The world is getting out of hand.

284
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,420
All what's removed from me.

285
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,720
I'm not going to be harmed.

286
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:36,720


287
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:36,720


288
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:36,720


289
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:44,140
Someone else, some nameless face controls my destiny.

290
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:49,820
Is it the man who's doing research or the man who's out in space?

291
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,500
And there's something that's controlling me, some silent nameless face.

292
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:01,660
Is he an IBM computer or an electronic brain?

293
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,720
And if I cannot find him, where do I find him?

294
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:06,720


295
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,800
I don't win.

296
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,040
Yes?

297
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,720
Excuse me, I believe I left a pipe and some books.

298
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,880
Oh, they're right here.

299
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,920
This is my lucky pipe and I didn't want to leave it behind.

300
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,680
I understand you're going away.

301
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,740
That's right, I've got to start banking right now.

302
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,160
You're a blithering coward.

303
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,300
Bitch, I'll f*** your ass up.

304
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,640
Is all the Shire discussing my departure?

305
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,520
Oh, no, no, no, don't worry about that.

306
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,680
You are miserable because you don't know how to say goodbye.

307
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,900
But danger has come sooner than you expected and now you are making up your mind to go at once.

308
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:53,940
The secret won't keep for long, of course, but at present it is, I think, known only to us conspirators.

309
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,000
And we're not going to let you escape so easily.

310
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,180
But I must go. It cannot be helped.

311
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,240
It is wretched for us all, but please help me and don't hinder me.

312
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:02,980
You don't understand.

313
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,180
You're lying.

314
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,440
Maybe he's not.

315
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,480
I know.

316
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,100
Look at his face, he's lying.

317
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,940
All right, Bob is my only hope.

318
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,660
Back off and give him some room to think.

319
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,440
All right, this place is going up.

320
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,900
Well, if I'm going out, I'm going out happy.

321
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:22,300
Before we're all blown to bits, mind if I pull the underwear out of my crack?

322
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,020
The man's got to go comfortable.

323
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,100
All right, but that's it.

324
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,160
God, I hate that guy.

325
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,680
I don't believe it.

326
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,440
You're on the truth or not?

327
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,480
Hold up, didn't the police mention it? Say anything about it?

328
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,820
Bob, no.

329
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,200
No.

330
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:36,740
No.

331
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,800
What did he look like?

332
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,460
Looked like what?

333
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,020
He looked like a man, of course. What do you suppose?

334
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:43,680
Uh-huh.

335
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,000
Oh, yes, yes.

336
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,780
He looked like a man.

337
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,980
Yeah, yes, I know.

338
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,260
Yes, he looked like a man.

339
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,580
He's a queer bunny.

340
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,940
Nobody believed me.

341
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,940
Even my colleagues wouldn't believe me.

342
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:02,980
Poor man.

343
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,300
Poor man.

344
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,820
He's insane, that's what he is.

345
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,860
He believes it. He must be insane.

346
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,640
Fools!

347
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,380
Can't they understand me?

348
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,300
Tell me something.

349
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,780
Am I mad?

350
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,520
Tell me!

351
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,560
We have no alternative.

352
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,760
We must use all our nuclear weapons.

353
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,060
May I suggest we join in prayer?

354
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,940
I can't see how prayers will help.

355
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,340
Oh yes, we can at least save our souls.

356
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,280
We must either attack them now or surrender to them.

357
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:34,280


358
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,380
Some more trouble.

359
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,000
The military men want to use all our nuclear weapons

360
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,840
and then resist them to the bitter end.

361
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,000
We'll be wiped out by the radioactivity.

362
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,660
We have a tiger at the front door and a wolf at the back.

363
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,980
What is that supposed to mean?

364
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,140
But there is another way of thinking about it.

365
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:57,140
Perhaps we are clearly at a time of great potential crisis.

366
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,740
We have the means of destroying the planet,

367
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,080
which we've never had before in the history of man.

368
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,100
A plan that will destroy King Ghidorah.

369
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,800
We wish to borrow from you on Earth the monsters Godzilla and Rodan.

370
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,160
Are you serious?

371
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,320
Of course. Deadly serious.

372
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,160
Will you help us?

373
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,480
Well, your request is unusual.

374
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,140
We don't know how to answer that.

375
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,000
First place, we don't even know where Godzilla and Rodan are.

376
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,300
Please, cut me some slack here, will you?

377
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,740
I'll give you anything you want.

378
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:31,800
Excellent.

379
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,240
Meanwhile...

380
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,180
My God.

381
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,500
What is that?

382
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,420
What?

383
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,740
Can you be specific? There's not much time.

384
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,860
Yes, we know.

385
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,900
What do the tests indicate?

386
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,600
The tape recorder here is being moved by magnetic waves generated over there.

387
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:53,160
If we can shield it, if we can intercept the waves, it'll stop.

388
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,560
Can you solve the problem in such a short time?

389
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,160
The odds are long, but we're making our final tests.

390
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:04,400
ungen

391
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,240
A permanent one.

392
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,140
Yeah.

393
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,980
Let's go.

394
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:27,540
Yeah.

395
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:34,260
We're going there.

396
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,180
There's gust of lead coming up sunset.

397
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,820
Oh, God, I've been misinformed.

398
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:39,920
Increasing.

399
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,600
Captain?

400
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,320
Yes?

401
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,520
What is it?

402
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,780
Radioactivity stronger.

403
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,880
Uh-oh.

404
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:46,960
Uh-oh.

405
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,380
Hiroshima.

00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,660

00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,740
Erisberg.

00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,560
Selma Hill.

409
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,200
Hiroshima.

410
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,880
Hiroshima.

411
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,800
It's in the air for you and me.

412
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,960
Radioactivity.

413
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,680
Discovered by Madame Curie.

414
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,100
Chain reaction and mutation.

415
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,300
Contaminated population.

416
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,020
Radioactivity.

417
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,680
It's in the air for you and me.

418
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,200
Radioactivity.

419
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,180
It's in the air for you and me.

420
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,780
Radioactivity.

421
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,300
Radioactivity.

422
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,600
Radioactivity.

423
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,940
Chernobyl.

424
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:32,560
Chernobyl.

425
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,180

Stop radio activity

It's in the air for you and me

444
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,720
Free your chest, Dave!

445
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,900
Free your chest, Dave!

446
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,020
I'm sure you didn't make a mistake on those tests.

447
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,520
Hey, what's the matter with you?

448
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,360
I got a headache.

449
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,840
I never had a headache in my life. I've got one now.

450
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,880
Maybe you got a fever.

451
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,780
I haven't got a fever. I've got a headache.

452
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,280
I don't know, Jack. The tests are all right.

453
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,140
Matter of fact, I think I got the figures right here.

454
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,240
Yeah, you see, the oxygen content is...

455
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,460
Look, I don't care about the figures.

456
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,240
Why have I got a headache?

457
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,060
Why have I got a headache?

458
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,560
They're using magnetic waves.

459
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,100
That's where we have a chance.

460
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,600
If we are able to sever those waves, we can save the Earth.

461
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,640
Did you felt electricity in the air?

462
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,680
Oh, no!

463
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,600
Is this... Is this gonna...

464
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,620
Is this gonna set off the doomsday machine?

465
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,380
Say, George, that was quick thinking!

466
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,040
You crazy bitch!

467
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,160
Time is getting short. I better get on with my speech.

468
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,160
Bladen, put him down.

469
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,720
I'm going to get him into camps.

470
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,820
All American citizens are to report to one of these death camps right away.

471
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,200
Did I say death camps? I meant happy camps,

472
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,220
where you will eat the finest meals, have access to fabulous doctors,

473
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,480
and be able to exercise regularly.

474
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,120
That's why I brought the

475
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,240
And I guess there could be a spectrum issue.

476
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:01,240


477
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,440
Break down, in effect.

Welcome.

00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,140
Welcome to your last day on earth.

To your last day on earth.

492
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,160
Welcome.

I feel good

I feel very happy

00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,860
I feel very sad

Very sad.

I am going to die.

507
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,860
The old last day on.

508
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:10,500
I am going to die.

509
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,180
I am going to break down.

510
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,620
Feel something.

I had a legendary twitch in Nagasaki.

Uh-huh.

525
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,820
I want to tell you a secret.

526
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,920
I dropped my panties to see you butt naked all saddled up.

527
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,920
Hit number one is losing her panties.

528
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,240
Oh!

529
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,980
I know, yes I know, I'm alive.

530
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,920
As long as I can taste my own sweet words.

531
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:50,900
Well, as long as I can smell my own sweet soul.

532
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,860
Sweet soul.

533
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:58,260
As long as I can see the flesh and blood that's me.

534
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:03,360
Now alive, yes alive, and I'm whole.

535
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,620
Electronic eye.

536
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,100
Somewhere in the dark.

537
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:10,540
In the sky.

538
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,920
Obdipotent or seeing.

539
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,160
Deny me, not my being.

540
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,360
Passing through the valley of the shadow of death.

541
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:27,040
I will sing to keep my soul alive.

542
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,540
As long as I have breath.

543
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:39,340
Today, though I walk through the valley.

544
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,100
Of death.

545
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,740
Of the shadow of death.

546
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,860
I know there's no respite for me.

547
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,040
The one that never dies has left.

548
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,660
I've never been so exhausted.

549
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,980
I think I'll go to bedlam.

550
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,440
I'm walking through the mud.

551
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,400
Deep, deep in blood.

552
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,620
And I just realized where I'm heading.

553
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,880
I don't want to measure down.

554
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,340
Setting my place in the ground.

555
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,640
It's even less necessary.

556
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,960
I'm wearing this suit.

557
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,100
I'm tired of feathers.

558
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,140
I'm a fallen angel.

559
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,160
They can never bury.

560
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,480
I'm knocked, knocked, knocked, knocked.

561
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,420
And I'm dazzled by you.

562
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,360
I'm the way you see me.

563
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,500
This can happen for the rest of my life.

564
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,560
I'm the one who's under the sun.

565
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,300
I'm the one who regrets.

566
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,860
I'm the one who breaks out.

567
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,180
Baby.

568
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,800
I'm on a one-way trip down Zenfors.

569
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,920
On a one-way trip down Zenfors.

570
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,060
If I had a soul, I'd go to hell.

571
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,620
I've never been to human hell.

572
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,940
I'm not long for a cable morning.

573
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,920
It's an eternal toll to fell.

574
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:29,180
That two-headed dog's been chewing my leg off for seven hundred years.

575
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,860
I sleep whilst I'm on feet on my back.

576
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,860
Poachers in my eyes may give.

577
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,120
I'm on a one-way trip down Zenfors.

578
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,280
I'm going to wreck the rest of the world.

579
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,420
I'm wearing this suit.

580
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:39,840
I'm tired of feathers.

581
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,460
I'm bored in my wrist.

582
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,560
I throw away my hijab,

583
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,800
Till I find my first lady.

584
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,100
I've no clue.

585
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,820
Could this be all or nothing.

586
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,300
I're sitting by a single male.

587
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,600
Even if it's all to no use.

588
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:48,600


589
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:48,680


590
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:48,860
Too many chances to get there.

591
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,340
Yeah!

592
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,360
Will your brains be dropped?

593
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,420
Lord.

594
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,160
You carried on a bargain through your Honeymilk.

595
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,320
Yeah.

596
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:53,880
Oh, Jesus.

597
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,500
Och would i regret.

598
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:54,500


599
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,240
He's a deadana up drinking sometime.

600
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:01,580
And I don't know what time of the night he'd buy one pack of free lookin bitches.

601
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:01,840
Sure enough.

602
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:01,840


603
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,800
Bei, to some magari ouais.

604
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,840
My kids are already fed up of shit.

605
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,300
Woo-hoo!

606
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,540
Woo-hoo!

607
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,660
Woo-hoo!

608
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,740
Woo-hoo!

609
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,260
Sing it!

610
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,020
I'm on a one-way trip to San Francisco

611
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,340
To rent a nice little ferry

612
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,440
I'm wearing this suit, I'm tired and fast

613
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,600
I'm going into Lincoln, Neverbury

614
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,380
I'm knock, knock, knock, knock, knock on the fence

615
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,120
I'm not doing no good, I've seen this before

616
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,860
I'm on this roadside, don't worry, man

617
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,480
Blow your brains out, baby!

618
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,280
I'm on a one-way trip to San Francisco

619
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,560
To rent a nice little ferry

620
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,720
I'm wearing this suit, I'm tired and fast

621
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,800
I'm going into Lincoln, Neverbury

622
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,620
I'm knock, knock, knock, knock on the fence

623
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,020
I'm on this roadside, don't worry, man

624
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,780
Blow your brains out, baby!

625
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,440
Blow your brains out, baby!

626
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:18,440


627
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:19,840
Woo!

628
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,280
Woo!

629
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:24,940
Woo!

630
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:26,880


631
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,160
Woo!

632
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,460
Woo!

633
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:27,480
Woo!

634
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:27,480


635
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,260
Woo!

636
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:28,580
Woo!

637
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:34,740
Woo!

638
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,120
Woo!

639
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:40,660
Woo!

640
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:42,840
Woo!

641
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,520
Woo!

642
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,180
Woo!

643
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:44,900
Woo!

644
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,660
Woo!

645
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:45,660


646
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,100
Woo!

647
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:46,100


648
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:46,260
Woo!

649
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:46,520
Woo!

650
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,380
Woo!

651
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,180
What do you know about that?

652
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,580
Godzilla.

653
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,680
Cool.

654
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,460
Cool.

655
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,000
Yeah.

656
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,980
That's great.

657
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:14,980


658
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,680
We saw the voices

659
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,440
So much fear

660
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,520
Cause a demon

661
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,900
To appear

662
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,980
Whisper changes

663
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,620
In hearts and minds

664
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,120
Will be forgotten

665
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,180
Most every time

666
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,480
Greed within us

667
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,080
Thus travels through

668
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,440
My feelings are old now

669
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,920
So nothing new

670
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,360
Must go on now

671
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,820
Without the rain

672
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:14,960
Without the rain

673
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,640
To shed away

674
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,880
Mortal pain

675
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,580
Mortal pain

676
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:26,460
Through and through

677
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:30,160
My feelings old now

678
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,500
Nothing new

679
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,320
Yet I am still

680
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,180
My eyes what I used to see

681
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,180
Why I can now tell

682
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,800
A truth that's ordinary

683
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,020
In reality

684
00:37:59,020 --> 00:37:59,440
It'sοι

685
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,860
I know

686
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,820
I haven't even gotten

687
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:03,820


688
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:03,820


689
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:03,820


690
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,280
So that moment

691
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:04,940
What are you planning

692
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,120
How I'll know

693
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,380
I'll be surprised

694
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:05,680
I'll know

695
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,600
What the only thing

696
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:14,720
I've met

697
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:14,960
Is life

698
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,120
Thank you.

699
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,640
Thank you.

700
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:23,420
Thank you.

701
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,580
Thank you.

702
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,840
Thank you.

703
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:07,140
Thank you.

704
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:27,920
Thank you.

705
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,600
Thank you.

706
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,960
Thank you.

707
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,780
Thank you.

708
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:31,380
Thank you.

709
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:46,940
Thank you.

710
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,760
Thank you.

711
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,740
soil.

712
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:07,180
Thank you.

713
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,540
Thank you.

714
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

715
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,820
Gentlemen, we have tried every force known to us.

716
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:21,860
We can't kill him.

717
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:23,860
We have failed.

718
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,180
What are you going to do now?

719
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,380
Just wait.

720
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:28,960
Till he goes away.

721
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,780
This is a news bulletin from the WGBS radio newsroom.

722
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,420
A tape-recorded press release has just been delivered to this station as well as several others in the city

723
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:43,760
from an unidentified group who claim to have kidnapped an experimental nuclear reactor.

724
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,560
Holy hell!

725
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,180
The terrorists claim it is hidden somewhere in the Wilton District

726
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:49,120
and that the area should be evacuated immediately.

727
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,820
Here is part of the tape we received.

728
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:57,220
If $10 million in gold bullion is not delivered by jet to a ship 200 miles due east of Washington,

729
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,780
we are going to overload the reactor and flush fallout into the atmosphere that won't disappear for years.

730
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,580
Either you're with us or you're with the terrorists.

731
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,020
And you're either with us or against us.

732
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,180
It means that we have to move quickly.

733
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:14,940
Move in a way that...

734
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,180
is effective and sometimes lethal.

735
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:19,660
Right!

736
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,540
Let's get cleaned up.

737
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,060
Find a drink before the bar is closed.

738
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,280
We're on the hunt.

739
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,900
Dutch, it's all about that stuff.

740
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:30,420
God, Dutch, how are you?

741
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,920
Nancy and I are hooked on heroin.

742
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,000
Well, thank you, Dutch.

743
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,400
It'll be too late by then, won't it, Reverend Staines?

744
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,680
If you want a picture of the future,

745
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:44,000
imagine a pipe smoking in a human face forever.

746
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:44,840
Ha ha ha!

747
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:45,080
Peace.

748
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:46,760
Godzilla!

749
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:49,220
At last!

750
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:13,120
Abort firings! Abort firings!

751
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,760
Interception will fragment the...

752
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:16,540
...the nuclear war.

753
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:16,540


754
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:16,540


755
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:17,160
...the nuclear war.

756
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:17,480
...the nuclear war.

757
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:17,480


758
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,820
Three billion human lives ended.

759
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:25,140
The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war Judgment Day.

760
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,380
They lived only to face a new nightmare.

761
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,680
The war against the machines.

762
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,000
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

763
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,400
Somebody's dying, I see it on the color TV.

764
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,880
Somebody's dying, I can see him...

765
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,280
...in his last agony.

766
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,860
Does anybody know this boy?

767
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,300
Can someone tell me who he could be?

768
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:02,300
Hey Ma, hey Ma Jumpin' Jesus, he looks like me.

769
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:09,360
I see him lying there and moaning on the color TV.

770
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,860
The camera's zooming in on him.

771
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:15,620
Come see up close and fuk pen him.

772
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,440
Now say to that kid,

773
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:18,440


774
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,200
He's gone?

775
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:27,020
Can you not feel thispassin' for a twentyPercent or more?

776
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:34,420
But he's gone and he does not look like a man.

777
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:34,500
He didn't care, now he's both drunk and a thief.

778
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:34,520
He's gone takes a block up and might be drinking.

779
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:34,520


780
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:34,520


781
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:34,520


782
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:34,520


783
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,340
You just said on full balance your certainzzo in cá covenant that you are looking for scissors.

784
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:39,980
I'm thinking of walnutooo and honey.

785
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:39,980


786
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:39,980


787
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,000
What a crazy man.

788
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,320
We있!

789
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,840
My eyes are blurring as I'm sweating hard to see his ID

790
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:02,480
Can't hear my breathing and there's something cold creeping up on me

791
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:10,180
I look at him and I'm afraid someone tell me who he could be

792
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,800
Hey mom, you can stop your fixin' supper

793
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,520
I think it's me

794
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,380
I knew where to hide to keep from getting evacuated out of here

795
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:39,400
in one of the science labs at the high school

796
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,160
But that was for a moment

797
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,160
Then when a Geiger counter there started going crazy

798
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,080
I realized there was a radiation leak somewhere

799
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,540
I took the Geiger counter and it led me here

800
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:47,760
Now let's see

801
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:51,020
Yeah, it's coming from inside here, alright

802
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:52,580
There's a broken skylight

803
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:53,700
Wonder what...wow!

804
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,300
The last man, baby

805
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,980
Um, Joe?

806
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:00,340
If there's any chance of averting this war, you better tell me about it and tell me about it right now

807
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:04,320
Cause if we don't find a solution to this thing, happiness in this world ain't gonna be worth a hell of being, ya hear?

808
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:08,620
I would have done everything in my power to kill the American people

809
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:09,960
I got big news for you, kid.

810
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,600
I want you to know something

811
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,760
When I say I'm gonna do something, I'm gonna do it

812
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,960
One bottle being enough

813
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,180
Let's be realistic

814
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:21,440
The radiation leak must be wrecking the controls on his bionic limbs

815
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,820
I gotta get in and help him

816
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,340
Sir, a disaster! What is it?

817
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,600
We've lost control of the monsters!

818
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,760
No you fools, I need you back!

819
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,040
Hey!

820
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,340
They cut me off! They got my truck!

821
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:39,280
How are things going here?

822
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,140
The licking our first trucks have taken is something terrible

823
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,580
It doesn't look so hot

824
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:44,480
Good, keep it up

825
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:44,820
Okay

826
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:46,880
Sir, this is Caving Inn at Sector 15

827
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,280
Move all defensive units into Sector 15

828
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,940
And clean it up, immediately

829
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,380
Emergency, emergency

830
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,220
The hydrogen oxide plant has been damaged

831
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:06,140
Eight ships obliterated by a mysterious blinding flash of fire

832
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,320
No survivors found

833
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:12,780
Radio reports from stricken ships give same message

834
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,740
Terrible sea of fire engulfs all

835
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:18,240
Staggering death toll

836
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,500
Signed, Steve Martin

837
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,340
You got it, thanks

838
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:24,600
The back motor of the ship adjusts

839
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,980
Holding it, uh, just enough to keep it from falling

840
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:30,520
Get this started, get this started

841
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,600
It's very, very, very, very terrible

842
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,780
Move, get out of the way, please!

843
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,780
It's running, bursting into flames

844
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,520
And it's falling on the mooring mast

845
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,880
And all the folks that read it

846
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,580
This is terrible

847
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:44,060
This is one of the worst disasters in the world

848
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,320
They always say it's like

849
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:50,240
100,000, 400, 500 feet into the sky

850
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,120
And it's a terrific drag, ladies and gentlemen

851
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,820
It's smoking, it's flames now

852
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,340
And the tremors rising to the ground

853
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:59,440
It's not quite to the mooring mast

854
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,160
All the humanity and all the passengers

855
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,500
Screaming around it

856
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,920
I told you

857
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,520
I can't talk to people

858
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,180
This place is wrong here

859
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:11,860
It's, it's, it's, oh

860
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,060
I, I can't talk, ladies and gentlemen

861
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,080
This is horrible

862
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:21,020
Listen to the monsters and their cries of horror and sudden death

863
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,580
They're going to attack

864
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:29,560
The monsters will fight?

865
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:31,820
They know their enemies by natural instinct

866
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,180
Now the key locks must pay

867
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,600
We will pay

868
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,860
Thank you, George

869
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:38,520
Go back

870
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:39,960
Go back

871
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:50,820
If you don't give up

872
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:53,160
Things will get a lot worse for you

873
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,400
Toby climbs through the broken skylight into the warehouse

874
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,360
And sees Steve along with the two terrorists and the scientist running around yelling wildly

875
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,120
Get out of there!

876
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,960
He's headed for the band!

877
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,180
No, he's headed for the wall!

878
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:05,700
He's plugging out the door!

879
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,880
He's got it right in front of the reactor!

880
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:08,440
Hey, you!

881
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,020
What do you think you're doing in here, you little...

882
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,260
Oh, no you don't

883
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:16,520
That's it, Carl!

884
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:17,560
Give it to him good!

885
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:20,780
Freeze!

886
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:21,240
Police!

887
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:32,440
Dr. Yoshida's machine has been destroyed by the fire dragon

888
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:33,560
What now?

889
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,500
Do we attack?

890
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:39,180
The great fire dragon will burn all of Tokyo within a few hours

891
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,680
When will they learn?

892
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:49,860
Terrific explosion

893
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:53,760
The terrible amount of hydrogen gas

894
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,720
It's on the galley by here

895
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,140
In it

896
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:58,800
Just like the tail surface broke into flames first

897
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,740
Then there was a terrific explosion

898
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:03,540
And then followed by the burning of the nose

899
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,500
And the cracking nose into the ground

900
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,980
And everybody turned back and straightened their

901
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:10,080
Seats to get out from underneath us

902
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,220
Because it was over the twinkle at the time of first in the flames

903
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:16,060
Now whether it's how armed the people were witnessing it

904
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,060
We do not know

905
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:19,280
But as it exploded they raced fast

906
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:24,220
And now it's smoking a terrific black smoke floating up into the sky

907
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:28,380
The flames are still leaping maybe 30, 40 feet from the ground

908
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:30,440
Yeah, they were volcanoes

909
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:33,440
And what we're seeing are the original volcanoes in place

910
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,240
Molten lava

911
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,880
The lava's very, very hot

912
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,320
About 2300 degrees

913
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,740
And it's supercharged with steam and gases

914
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,420
And they kind of shot out at about 35 miles an hour or something

915
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,200
That's really hot, isn't it?

916
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:56,380
Yeah, it looks like we're watching fireworks, doesn't it?

917
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:56,780
But we're not

918
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:59,360
That's what's coming out of the center of the Earth

919
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:01,420
Wow

920
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,420
Where are all the dogs?

921
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:05,400
There are no dogs

922
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,540
There's nothing living on Earth

923
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:09,600
Not even dinosaurs and three-star monsters

924
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,300
Nothing

925
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,500
There's nothing but land and volcanoes

926
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:16,400
And the molten lava coming out and shooting up at 2300 degrees

927
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,220
Hey, woohoo

928
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:18,720
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm back again

929
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,580
I raced down to the burning ship

930
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:24,900
And just as I walked up to the ship over a fine little trick of iron

931
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,040
I met a man coming out

932
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,180
Dave, Dave, he couldn't find his way

933
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:31,220
I grabbed ahold of him

934
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:33,200
He burned terribly in the hand

935
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,240
And he burned terribly in the face

936
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,580
As I bounced, all his hair turned off

937
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,300
But he's walking and talking

938
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,240
Plainly and distinctly

939
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,880
And he told me he'd jump

940
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,940
I suppose these things happen

941
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:48,740
Oh!

942
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,500
He's been out in the sun too long

943
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,960
Look at the size of that blister

944
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:54,600
Police!

945
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:55,900
What happened here?

946
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,360
Oh, pardon the mess, officer

947
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,240
My maid only comes in once a week, you see

948
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:03,740
That's veryearly

949
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,700
I have one more waterspout

950
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:16,820
You can get me another, sir

951
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:16,820


952
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:16,980
I know this love is slightly more curious

953
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:17,220
Than our archduke's

954
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:17,220


955
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:17,220


956
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:17,840
Let this putl the right name So like it's not the last

957
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,020
manifestation of the lethal-bombing

958
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:20,900
It's about to start

959
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,840
To kill you

960
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:27,240
Let's begin

961
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:30,640
What I'm saying is maybe you're worth a lot more than six million dollars.

962
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:31,260
Oh, we are.

963
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:40,760
Wait, Edmunds, what kind of radio show is this?

964
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:44,900
This has been a test of the subgenius early warning system.

965
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,620
This was only a test.

966
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:52,400
If it had actually been our sweet prophesied ex-day Armageddon,

967
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:57,160
you would have been advised to tune to J.R. Bob Dobbs for help

968
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:01,760
by sending out a quick letter to the Subgenius Foundation

969
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:11,460
at P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

970
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:20,900
or check out the website for more detailed nude information at www.subgenius.com

971
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:22,300
And you?

972
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,320
You had better do it fast, Seekers,

973
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:30,340
because July 5th is zooming up on us for yet another drunken chicken run with apocalyptic destiny.

974
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:35,240
And you know, I got a feeling in my bones and yours

975
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:40,120
that this is the year that, yes, it's all gonna burn.

976
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,820
Yes, this is it.

977
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,140
And the good news gospel of this ministry

978
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:52,320
is that you can buy your way onto the escape vessels of the sex connoisseurs.

979
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,240
Yes!

980
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:57,640
Oh, but you gotta have the right stuff, Seekers.

981
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:01,320
You gotta have that subgenius membership card in hand

982
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:04,560
when you're standing in that line for the pleasure saucers.

983
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:09,760
Even if you're only booked for a sky kennel in the cargo hold.

984
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,900
So don't say you weren't warned.

985
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:20,180
And you've had the privilege of getting an advance tip-off of things to come.

986
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,240
Ha ha ha ha!

987
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,720
See you on the saucers, Seekers.

988
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:29,120
Boy, you're hotter than a firecracker on the 5th of July.

989
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,560
Oh, yeah.

990
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,180
Fulfillment of a prophecy

991
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:43,660
The last days of Isaac

992
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:50,840
Oh, the last sweet days of Isaac

993
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:51,260
Yeah!

994
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,760
Ha ha ha ha!

995
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:54,800
It's like on the night of the final day

996
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:54,800


997
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:54,840
As the moon من'.

998
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,200
Fulfüsiged with burning sunlight

999
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:04,720
On the inside of my eye

1000
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:10,980
Will I burst into oblivion

1001
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:18,080
Burn in Armageddon

1002
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,360
Andestäby paon

1003
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:31,540
Flaming ashes light the sky

1004
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:37,420
Where will I be?

1005
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:45,620
Where will I be? Where will I be?

1006
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:51,000
When darkness descends on me

1007
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,140
Where will I be? Where will I be?

1008
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:10,700
Hey, Bob is my only hope. Back off and give him some room to think.
