I thought I'd hit the ground

Back in the ground, baby

69
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,620
On my own, baby

00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,060
But you still shoot me down, baby

71
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,820
Back in the ground, back in the ground

72
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,940
The same way you shoot me down, baby

73
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,880
You'll be going just the same

74
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,280
Three times the pain

75
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,500
And you're all set to play

76
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,720

On the yard, there stands a mother

Here comes the end of the tunnel

126
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,380
I'm afraid to say

127
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,960
Please don't you tell me

128
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,880
I ordered the Kabul train

129
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,220
to send the people back

130
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:11,680
for you

131
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:19,000
ultra-violence, much better we entice thee to give of thine dang and pretty poly of thine like own

132
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:27,640
free will. Surely thou canst phone in real scory-like and lay upon this malinky milk station

133
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:34,900
a Sammy donation or pledge, as it were, so as to keep our rots goverating and our fuzzy warbles

134
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:42,520
playing horror show shooms, angel trumpets, and devil trombones on the like airwaves forever and

135
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:49,740
ever. Slushy the Cali-Vonnie-Cal of the other stations, those grumpy commercial Cal stations

136
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:57,360
that play only like gloopy teeny pop-veshes and grasny-grazy bandas and groupas and all

137
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:04,400
repetitive to make it worse. Don't make us screech and croak for your pretty poly.

138
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:14,900
Can you spare some cutter, me brothers? 216-687-6900.

139
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:03,280
And dear friends, the subgenius premium, that is anything you pledge will get you this,

140
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:12,560
well, anything over five bucks. How's that? The subgenius pamphlet number one. Even if you

141
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:18,560
might possibly have one of those already, don't you need a cleaner, nicer one to photocopy for

142
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:31,000
all your droogies? Oh, my brothers. But were thou to pledge $50 or more,

143
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,480
your premium will be not just that pamphlet.

144
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:43,160
Yes, the WCSB type premiums I'm about to enumerate. But the subgenius gold card. Yes, I managed

145
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:47,700
to locate the dwindling stack. There really aren't very many of them, but it's like the

146
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:53,960
subgenius minister's card, but in plastic, like a credit card, all gold and orangey and

147
00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:01,660
red, ready, ready for you to perform marriages and so forth. Well, it's not really a subgenius

148
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,780
membership, but it looks like one.

149
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:10,360
And it looks better than the, actually, I like the old school cards better, but hey,

150
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:15,100
somebody posted a photo of one of those things on Facebook and all of a sudden we're all,

151
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:23,640
everybody wants one. But you know what I want? If I were pledging to the station,

152
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:31,700
along with that subgenius pamphlet, when you call 687-6900 in the United States in the area code of

153
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:32,660
216.

154
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:42,260
I pledge $25 and get me a bunch of WCSB frequency modulated Schwarz beer, which is actually

155
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:49,320
a very dark beer. You can get a twin pack with just two bottles of it or an engraved

156
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,220
pint glass. And one bottle of this incredibly, it's actually really strong. It's like 10%,

157
00:21:54,220 --> 00:22:01,800
I think. They were serving it at the Halloween masquerade ball and I took advantage of it

158
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,880
and it'll take advantage of you if you let it creep up on you.

159
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:13,720
on you. I didn't. But you know how it can be. Why, if you're a bit more of a humble persuasion

160
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:23,180
and can only afford a $15 donation, you can get a choice of a WCSB pint glass, a WCSB Pangea coffee

161
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:34,100
mug. Yes, a coffee mug made in Pangea. WCSB coffee beans. I'm not sure about that one.

162
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:43,660
Two WCSB ashtrays or a felt vintage pennant for you penitents to whip yourselves with. A WCSB

163
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:51,360
felt pennant, like something you'd see on the wall of a college dorm room or something. $20

164
00:22:52,220 --> 00:23:00,160
can get you a WCSB white travel mug or a WCSB black and blue pom-pom hat, whatever that is,

165
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,080
or a WCSB scarf. And friends, you can see these things.

166
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:12,560
You can get these premiums much better than I can if you go to WCSB.org and follow the Radiothon

167
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:18,820
links. You may have to use your eyes to look right and left and maybe even use your finger

168
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:26,080
to scroll down. I'm not sure, but it must be there somewhere. $25 gets you a WCSB t-shirt,

169
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:32,380
unisex. Actually, there's several different versions. There's a women's skull shirt and a

170
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,720
men's skull shirt.

171
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:41,660
No extra large left, unfortunately. Or a half pound of coffee and a WCSB Pangea coffee mug.

172
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:50,340
Mm-hmm. And like I say, several different, there's a softball t-shirt and the new 2014 WCSB design.

173
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:58,960
$30 premium, big bubble umbrella for WCSB with a blue logo. My family has one of those big umbrellas.

174
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,720
$35 premium, a WCSB silver lunch.

175
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:11,140
Pallet. No, I would be coveting one of those. Or the pom-pom hat and scarf combo.

176
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:22,020
The $50 premium gets you a zip-up scribble hoodie in forest green with a white cursive logo.

177
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:32,360
And WCSB, or not and, but or WCSB set of four pint glasses. But get this. Then there's the

178
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,080
limited number gift certificate.

179
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:40,500
And they go all over the place. For instance, for $15, there's the happy dog, the jukebox, which is a bar.

180
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:47,820
Now that's class. Sweet spot gelato, taco, tantos, $10 certificate.

181
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:53,760
Wilbert's Music and Food for $20. You get the gift certificate for $15 or so.

182
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,840
From A.J. Rocco's or B. Oh, no. B.A. Sweetie's gone and the beet jar's gone already.

183
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,280
My mind's eye. And now that's class.

184
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:19,380
And so forth. $25 pledge at to WCSB, which by the way, the number being 216-687-6900 is eminently callable right now.

185
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:27,280
Don't you want to talk to Charleston or Joe or Brother Love or Princess We?

186
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,720
They're waiting for your calls for those gifts.

187
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,680
But here's the coolest gifts.

188
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:38,880
Get up to the $60 and $100 and $140 pledges.

189
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:45,580
For instance, the $140 pledge gets you a Beachland Ballroom Seamster Pass.

190
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,940
You can just live at the Beachland Ballroom.

191
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,940
And this is our greatest and fullest pledge premium.

192
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,440
The biggest thing WCSB offers.

193
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,880
Drumroll, please.

194
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,780
Drumroll, please. It's from the Starwood Festival.

195
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,000
For a $250 pledge, you get two...

196
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:08,600
adult weekend passes, which is worth $270, friends.

197
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,880
So you're safe. This is the cheapest way you'll ever be able to go to Starwood.

198
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:20,420
Yes, Starwood Festival, which happens the week after the world ends, X Day Festival,

199
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,880
July 10th through Monday the 13th.

200
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:30,040
If the world ends, I, Reverend Stang, personally will make sure that you get to attend Starwood on my escape vessel.

201
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,820
Because we will save the Wisteria Campground.

202
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:33,740
And...

203
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:34,940
I'm a local.

204
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,620
I live in the heart of the San Francisco region, near Athens in southeast Ohio.

205
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,680
If you've never been to a Starwood...

206
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:41,620
well...

207
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,420
I've heard people say the same thing about it as they say to Burning Man.

208
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,040
I wouldn't be caught dead there!

209
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:53,180
But those are idiots who say that, who've never been there, and think they know what it is.

210
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,080
And they don't.

211
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,760
If I had a chance, I'd go to Burning Man every day.

212
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:58,660
And...

213
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,940
if I had a chance, I'd go to Starwood every hour.

214
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,740
and there's a million reasons for it

215
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,740
because at that outdoor festival

216
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,540
you would get to enjoy everything from giant puppets

217
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,840
yes, giant puppets I said

218
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,300
to concerts on four stages

219
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,040
and these concerts are all kinds

220
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,840
rock and roll to folk music, world music

221
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,280
and a lot of drumming

222
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,900
classes, workshops and ceremonies

223
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,140
a subgenius revival

224
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,560
I always do my best preaching at Starwood

225
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,220
and there's nightly drumming and free range creativity

226
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,720
and I think you know what that means

227
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,160
don't you boys and girls

228
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,860
that means shirtlessness

229
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,020
among the part of people who normally

230
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,720
don't go shirtless in some cases

231
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,600
and all kinds of other fun stuff

232
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,600
multimedia shows in the puffer dome

233
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,020
which has to be seen to be described

234
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,240
or believed or anything

235
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,460
and it all ends at a gigantic huge bonfire

236
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,420
on Saturday night

237
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,780
and any free thinker or

238
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,200
any free thinker or

239
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,040
religious nut

240
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,860
would love this special gift

241
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,460
that's right

242
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,880
free weekend passes to Starwood

243
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,960
for only two passes

244
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,760
for only a $250 pledge

245
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,820
that's the cheapest way

246
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,980
you can get to this week long festival

247
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,720
in July

248
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,720
I'll certainly be there

249
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,840
Princess, we will be there

250
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,300
even like I say

251
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,340
even if the world ends

252
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,100
at any time

253
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,940
at X Day Festival

254
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,600
just prior to Starwood

255
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,560
we will guarantee you

256
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,340
a Starwood experience nonetheless

257
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,400
I should probably

258
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,660
promise Burning Man too

259
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,240
but I can't really do that

260
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,800
yes dear friends

261
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,760
I forgot to mention while we were

262
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,580
live on the air that

263
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,460
those of you who happen to hear

264
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,640
this show by internet

265
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:54,900
the

266
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,220
pledge drive or

267
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,080
radiothon will continue through the next few days

268
00:28:59,100 --> 00:28:59,580
through Sunday

269
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,900
November 16th

270
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:02,640
and

271
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,660
you can

272
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,700
donate if you want to

273
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,660
if you go to wcsb.org

274
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,480
and click on the big word radiothon

275
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,180
it will

276
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,300
show you how to donate

277
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:15,820
also

278
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,480
there is a button

279
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,720
on the home page of

280
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,020
subgenius.com

281
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,160
and also on the

282
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,660
hour of slack page

283
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,080
which by the way has logs and copies of all the shows that we have on the website

284
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,080


285
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:33,900
and you can donate there

286
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,100
we would actually be real happy

287
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,400
if you donated directly to the church

288
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,500
and

289
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,600
to WCSB

290
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,620
the address of WCSB

291
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,900
if you want to send a check

292
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,040
you would make that to

293
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,380
WCSB

294
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,520
slash CSU

295
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,120
foundation

296
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,440

WCSB.org

299
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,060


300
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,060


301
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,060


302
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,060


303
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,060


304
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,060


305
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,760
848

306
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,380
that's

307
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,640
931

308
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,380
848

309
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,040
in Cleveland

310
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,700
Ohio

311
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,700
44101

312
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,000
dash

313
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,480
8656

314
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,540
and thank you and praise Bob

315
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,320
and now back to wherever

316
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,600
I inserted this

317
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,720
now let's see

318
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,780
before something else happens

319
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,520
I should mention

320
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,060
who is the pastor of the church

321
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:29,060


322
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,740
who has called in so far

323
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,820
and pledged

324
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,180
friends

325
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,220
you know

326
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,220
Dr.

327
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,580
yeah you all know Dr.

328
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:37,900
Dark

329
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,500
you go to his

330
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,060
you go to his drive-in

331
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:40,420
every

332
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,300
X day

333
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:43,760
Dr.

334
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,700
Dark's drive-in

335
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,180
he was

336
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,120
as a generous

337
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:48,620
pledger

338
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,420
it's his

339
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,920
what a 64th

340
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,580
birthday today

341
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,360
so he pledged

342
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,380
63 64

343
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,120

344
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,100

00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,320
so it's he's on the

346
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:56,860
cuff

347
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,580
the cusp

348
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,040
the cusp

349
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,040


350
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,480
of his

351
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,480
birthday

352
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,260
yes

353
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,160
and by the way

354
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,940
incidentally friends

355
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,120
Dr. Dark will be

356
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,360
an unusual sort of guest star

357
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,020
on the next

358
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,160
canned hour of slack

359
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,020
which was recorded

360
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,160
at 7 a.m.

361
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,100
July 5th

362
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,240
of what the conspiracy

363
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,720
calls the year 2014

364
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,660
last summer

365
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,940
he has been with us

366
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,920
at every time

367
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,340
we've ever gone to meet

368
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,160
the saucers

369
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,340
which has been a total

370
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,800
of 19 times

371
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,700
boy howdy

372
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,020
20th of July

373
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,140
and we're going to

374
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:29,600
be the charm

375
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,200
no doubt

376
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,320
but the next show

377
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,860
is the 7 a.m.

378
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,640
recording and the

379
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,180
great Dr.

380
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,060
Dark will drive

381
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,820
you as crazy as he

382
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,120
just about drove me

383
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,620
that morning with his

384
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,440
his subgenius

385
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,160
superpower which I think

386
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,260
we discussed last week

387
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,920
which is well you'll

388
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,860
see you'll see

389
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,900
yeah it's more of a

390
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,980
super villain power

391
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,020
if you ask me

392
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,280
Dr. Dark

393
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,520
superpower so and

394
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,620
also who else oh

395
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,000
I'm not sure

396
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,000


397
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,000


398
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,000


399
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,000


400
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,000


401
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,000


402
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,200
I didn't realize

403
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,040
a lot of people

404
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,080
like me

405
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:19,380
and I think

406
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:19,580
I'm going to

407
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:20,560
I'm going to

408
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,200
be a little

409
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:22,580
bit more

410
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:22,580


411
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:22,580


412
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:22,580


413
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,400
a little more

414
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:24,440
more

415
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,640
a little more

416
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:28,720
more

417
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:28,740
more

418
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:28,760
more

419
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:28,780
more

420
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:28,800
more

421
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:28,820
more

422
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:28,840
more

423
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:28,860
more

424
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:28,880
more

425
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:28,900
more

426
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:28,920
more

427
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:28,940
more

428
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:28,960
more

429
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:28,980
more

430
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,080
to the African Abstract Hour.

431
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,880
I was asked if there was a limit on those gold cards.

432
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,700
We changed it.

433
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,040
Okay, so there is a limit on those, huh?

434
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,560
Well, I have a feeling we're not going to get enough $50 pledgers

435
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,860
to max out those gold cards.

436
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,600
If we do get that many, heck, I'll borrow money from the station

437
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,560
and have more of them made.

438
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,040
Anyway, I wouldn't worry about that too much.

439
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,740
It must be 20 or 30 of those things.

440
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,660
I doubt if we'll get that.

441
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,720
But see, that is what you get.

442
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,440
Oh, and what else have we got here?

443
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:04,220
Could it be Lone Slump, Adi Naki, Cowboy Dave already?

444
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,960
It's the naughtiest eye bag you ever dreamed of

445
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,060
because tonight I'm going to sell hot and nude, buddy.

446
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,660
I'm going to move some product tonight.

447
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:21,420
I'm talking about giveaways for honoring the memory of Lonesome Planet WCSB

448
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,600
where the commensurate arguments are all made.

449
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:27,700
Commensurate?

450
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,320
I thought I was.

451
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,740
The commensurate arguments.

452
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,580
Commensurate, commensurate, commensurate.

453
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,760
Yeah, yeah.

454
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:39,380
By the way, Lonesome, Cowboy Dave,

455
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:45,940
I pronounced your name incorrect, Nadsat, as Adi Naki, Cowboy Dave.

456
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,880
Adi Naki being the Nadsat for Lonesome.

457
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,740
Isn't that funny?

458
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:57,080
Oh, I read the classic again for like my ninth time.

459
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,600
Last week, A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess.

460
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,560
And watch the movie again.

461
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:07,000
And you know how it creeps a little Malenki way into your Rasoodoc

462
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,560
where you can't stop gover-eating that way.

463
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:15,360
I think it's a high-tech logic because you're crasting some pretty poly and all that stuff.

464
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,800
Well, that's what we're trying to do.

465
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:21,960
We're trying to craft some pretty poly from our listeners who are our sleuthiers.

466
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:22,800
Can you spare some cutter me, brother?

467
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,580
I did get to use that line.

468
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,700
Can you spare us?

469
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,860
Some cutter me, brothers.

470
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:33,160
It's no world for an old man in his land.

471
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:41,240
Men spinning around the moon and no attention paid to earthly law and order no more.

472
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,560
Ah, do me in, you young bastards.

473
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:50,040
Oh, and what's so stinking about it?

474
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:54,380
I saw that movie when I was 18 and it got stuck in my head.

475
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,680
And I can see why Anthony Burgess...

476
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,840
Burgess has since disavowed that novel because due to the movie,

477
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,900
most people think it glorifies violence.

478
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:09,720
Yes, and many people do not know that Anthony Burgess,

479
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:15,800
also the idea for all the, what you call it, speak in there,

480
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:22,980
the rucified words was the premise that the Soviets were beaming subliminal messages in Russian.

481
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:26,480
At the same time, we were already...

482
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,040
No.

483
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,000
The first came out, supposedly.

484
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,280
Right.

485
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:34,100
Beaming subliminal messages towards the East, so to speak.

486
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:40,200
And very few people realize that, but it was one of the four words in prologuey things there.

487
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,400
Yeah, I read that too.

488
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,260
I also read that he wrote Clockwork Orange in three weeks.

489
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:52,660
It's kind of a knockoff and he thinks it's terrible.

490
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:57,380
Whereas everybody else thinks it's one of the best novels in the English language.

491
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,080
Although it's only halfway in the English language.

492
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:05,680
Very, very, very predictive in many ways.

493
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,620
No kidding.

494
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:10,380
It was written in, what, 1960 or something?

495
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,100
And predicted the world around 1990 of the Wilding Youth Games.

496
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:18,400
And a lot of times they started showing it again and stuff

497
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,760
when all the Wilding Youth Games were happening in the mid-90s.

498
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,540
Believe me, they're tall-talking some old...

499
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:26,920
Oh, yeah.

500
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,640
Some starry old...

501
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,660
VAC over in Collinwood right now.

502
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:32,840
Yeah.

503
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,120
It's past the social demarcation limit.

504
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,340
And that means that there's no further use for it in the news brain.

505
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,620
It's just been...

506
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:50,240
Well, anyway, friends, that's why you need to spend every last tiny bit of dang and cutter

507
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:57,680
you can muster up on beautiful WCSB by calling 216-687-7000.

508
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,580
6-9-0-0.

509
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,660
6-8-7.

510
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:12,840
You owe us nothing to listen to these beautiful autocratic monograms

511
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,460
that come out every Saturday.

512
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,300
Right.

513
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,360
Yeah.

514
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:22,100
And for this, all we ask is a small pittance of your listening hood.

515
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,500
It's a part of your brain that's not really fully functional at all times.

516
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,680
When you turn on the radio, you're like, oh, my God.

517
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:27,680


518
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:27,680


519
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:27,680


520
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:27,680


521
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:27,680


522
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:27,680


523
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:27,680


524
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:27,680


525
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:27,680


526
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:27,680


527
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:27,680


528
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,340
They don't do that anymore, do they?

529
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,320
Or do they still do that?

530
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,500
Sure, they still do that.

531
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:44,080
And in fact, you can't hear it clearly as it could be had we a new board, a studio soundboard.

532
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:52,040
I'm looking at this rugged, loyal old board, but it is kind of old and bored.

533
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,000
And we need an exciting new soundboard.

534
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,680
Also, did you know that that house...

535
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:01,300
Halloween masquerade ball that WCSP puts on is free.

536
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,620
All those rock bands and the crazy looking people and stuff.

537
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:15,440
Which actually, I put the pictures on subgenius.com, but I can't tell the audience how to get to it.

538
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,640
I guess if you look at our events page, I may have put a link there.

539
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,200
I can't remember.

540
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:26,020
Anyway, we did get some pictures and so did WCSB and everything was crazy and hideous and funny.

541
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,280
But it...

542
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,880
We can't keep doing that for nothing, folks.

543
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,760
The college doesn't...

544
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,220
Cleveland State doesn't pay for everything.

545
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,800
The government doesn't pay for nothing.

546
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,000
So we need your hip.

547
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,760
We need your hip, hip cats.

548
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:50,280
If a station like WCSB were to go down, say perhaps to Mexico or in part of either one of the other plants,

549
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,580
near the equator anyway, it would have to be...

550
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,260
And that would mean necessarily...

551
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:05,200
People just haven't done their duty by calling 667-5900 and pledging right now because they're listening to it.

552
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:11,280
That little clicky metal device that we have installed when we're about six years old that we don't know about.

553
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,160
It won't work if you don't listen to this station.

554
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,380
And if you don't listen to this station...

555
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,000
I said that wrong, didn't I?

556
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,880
I don't know, but it doesn't matter.

557
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,120
It came out fine.

558
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,400
And the point is...

559
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,220
They better get on their stick and off of their duff.

560
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:36,840
I see Princess Wee writing something down, but Brother Love and Charleston are just pacing around,

561
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,500
ready to get in a fistfight out of boredom.

562
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,400
So y'all need to get off that...

563
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,680
Your doofus or duff or tuckuses or whatever those...

564
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,180
Your nay-nays.

565
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,080
And don't be a naysayer.

566
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,120
Be a yaysayer.

567
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,200
Say yay, Bob.

568
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,380
Yay, subgenius.

569
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,340
Yay, Hour of Slack.

570
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:06,600
And yay, WCSB, which has been playing the Hour of Slack at 9 o'clock Sunday nights since, I think, 1989?

571
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:16,740
We were on that other college station for a while.

572
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,620
And the Case Western station.

573
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,080
And...

574
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,280
But then I think Brother Mike Cole got us on.

575
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,520
To WCSB.

576
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,920
And they stuck it at 9 o'clock at night.

577
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:36,140
And pretty soon, I just couldn't stay in Texas and just mail those cassettes in.

578
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:43,400
I had to move up here, marry the Starwood Festival, and...

579
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,360
And lift them stamps in the cold.

580
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,240
Right.

581
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,220
And, uh...

582
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,360
Jungle Jim.

583
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,920
Oh, the Jungle Jim thing.

584
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,320
I'm not going to play that tonight unless that was...

585
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,200
I mentioned that to you earlier.

586
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,480
That's a last resort if there's no callers at all.

587
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,480
We'll just play an old radio play about Jungle Jim.

588
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:08,600
Which happens to have Bob and Connie as characters in it.

589
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,660
Well, I was going to ask one teeny tiny small little teeny small question.

590
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,600
And that would be...

591
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,640
How much...

592
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:22,200
You know, we need to support our station, but it's not like you're going to get nothing.

593
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,700
There's all kinds of cool stuff that you get back.

594
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,880
Or not get back.

595
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,380
What's the word?

596
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:26,500
What's the word?

597
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,860
You are reimbursed or not?

598
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,320
No, not reimbursed.

599
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:30,780
No.

600
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,940
What is it?

601
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,600
What is the...

602
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,760
The premiums.

603
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,900
Well, we did go into all the premiums of which there are like the coffee mugs and T-shirts

604
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,340
and hoodies and giant umbrellas and...

605
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:53,360
Did you hear that one of the premiums for $250, you not only get to keep your ears,

606
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,860
but you get to go to Starwood twice.

607
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:02,360
Or two people go to Starwood Festival, which normally costs more than $250 for two people.

608
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:03,540
So...

609
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,000
Oh, my God.

610
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,580
Yeah, yeah.

611
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,800
That's like...

612
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,880
That's like for $250, you can finally lose your virginity, geeks.

613
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,920
That's what we're offering you.

614
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,080
I don't know if I've spelled that out fully enough.

615
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,820
Actually, I shouldn't say that.

616
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,220
That's not guaranteed.

617
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:24,740
It's just your virginity as a monster lover or as one of those...

618
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,000
Right.

619
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,700
Dave, how long have you been doing stuff on this station?

620
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,600
Oh, I thought you were going to say things with monsters.

621
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:38,180
Well, you talked about the first telethon in 1989 that you were on.

622
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,880
I was on there.

623
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:48,420
Well, I know you were here when I first came to Cleveland in the early 90s.

624
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,680
Princess Wee said, there's this crazy show on ESO Swamp Radio.

625
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,440
And there's these crazy guys.

626
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,700
They did this crazy comedy.

627
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,440
And they're crazy.

628
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,760
And you should go be on that show.

629
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,260
And she set it up.

630
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,000
I think it was her.

631
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:02,500
Yeah.

632
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,000
And I walked in.

633
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,580
And it was a marriage made in hell.

634
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:10,700
I'm sorry.

635
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,500
But that's worth a cup.

636
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,500
That's worth a WCSB cup.

637
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,700
I don't know how many times I've reached into my seat and pulled out a WCSB cup.

638
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,880
And just looked at it and went like, WCSB 89.3.

639
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,380
Can you believe it?

640
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,580
You know, I was like reading it and stuff like that.

641
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:32,960
I think it's a very powerful emotional experience for those of you.

642
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,420
This is beyond what public radio.

643
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,760
I mean, just think of the amounts of money they generate for playing classical music.

644
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Why would you hear a fair such as this?

645
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:47,120
Which calms the spirit and opens up new swords in the forehead.

646
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,980
He said, or she said.

647
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,560
That was very poetical.

648
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,400
Yeah.

649
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:54,780
Yeah.

650
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,400
Say that with confidence because I didn't really hear anything you said.

651
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:01,960
Princess, we came in and handed me this pledge thing.

652
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,740
Apparently, Reverend Fight C.

653
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:09,980
Taj, I can tell from this pledge sheet, has moved for one thing.

654
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,060
To Kansas.

655
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,140
And Reverend Fight C.

656
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:20,080
Taj is going to have him a subgenius gold card in his pocky pock pretty soon.

657
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:23,000
I've got to remember to write these names down.

658
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,340
And because I'm.

659
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,680
The one who has to mail off the gold cards, not the station.

660
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:34,900
And he's getting a WCSB unisex zip up scribble hoodie for a screen with white cursive logo.

661
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,780
Those are really cool.

662
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,000
Everybody knows that.

663
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:47,860
And he is going to send in a money order or a check rather than coming to WCSB open house Friday, November 21st, 4 to 8 p.m.

664
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,700
or Sunday, November 23rd.

665
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,460
Yes, we'll be here.

666
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,420
We have to be here one of those days.

667
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:54,980
Maybe.

668
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:55,300
Maybe twice.

669
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:00,280
We'll be pounding out the spunk for the overall mench, but you don't really exist anymore, do you?

670
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,160
You know what I mean?

671
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,580
Behem bahore de kapai.

672
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:04,760
Yeah, yeah.

673
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,340
The WCSB open house.

674
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,780
Dave, those are strange parties.

675
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,300
I wish you could come to one.

676
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:17,100
You meet the listeners and they look just like you would think from listening to them.

677
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,780
That's the amazing thing.

678
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,300
You meet the listener and they go, oh, I'm listener A.

679
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,860
And you go, I thought you would.

680
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:24,880
That's you look just like.

681
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:25,700
I thought you'd look.

682
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,100
Well, many of them must be extremely overweight then if they look like.

683
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:36,180
Actually, yes, there are many cases in which I could say.

684
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:43,840
Yeah, but see, we don't know who most of them what most of them sound like unless they call in to the talk shows.

685
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:48,080
Not this one, but the subsequent show synesthesia.

686
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:53,320
It used to be an insult to say, hey, man, you've got a great body for radio.

687
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,460
Well, you've got a great.

688
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:54,800
Right.

689
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:54,880
Right.

690
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:55,280
For radio.

691
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:59,680
And people don't realize that anymore because you can't really.

692
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,260
Most faces are not so emboldened lately.

693
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,280
They're usually like really hazy, roosty, ghost like.

694
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,440
But anyway, you know, more the point.

695
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:12,280
They always they want to go beyond the super subscription rates.

696
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:18,100
You can just plug in anything they can find in a frying pan at six, eight, seven.

697
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,420
Sixty nine hundred.

698
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:23,440
That's two and six for those who listen to me.

699
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,540
Four, four, zero and three.

700
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:28,640
Three zero codes at this time or the parts of the country.

701
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:29,740
Oh, Princess.

702
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,100
We has brought me up.

703
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,800
She brought me brought me a note that says gold cards.

704
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,780
The subgenius gold cards are drawing donations like flies.

705
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:46,780
Because here's Reverend Sigmund Void of Cleveland with made his fifty dollar donation.

706
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:47,960
Yeah.

707
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,880
You know, we're going to have to make our own copies of these addresses.

708
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,620
OK.

709
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,440
Because it's going to be.

710
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,320
It's going to be up to me to send those cards out.

711
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:56,620
OK.

712
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:57,580
No.

713
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,260
No.

714
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:00,880
Groovy, man.

715
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:01,500
Groovy.

716
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,860
Praise Reverend Sigmund.

717
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:05,860
Was that Void?

718
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:06,660
Sigmund Void.

719
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:07,840
Sigmund Void.

720
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:14,360
And and friends, you could have your name called out on the radio, but you have to do it in the next 15 minutes.

721
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:16,940
We won't.

722
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:19,700
We promise we won't say anything funny for the next 15 minutes.

723
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,820
We're just going to say this number.

724
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:21,860
Two one six.

725
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:22,640
Six, eight, seven.

726
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:23,420
Sixty nine hundred.

727
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,260
Over and over and over.

728
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:24,420
Over and over.

729
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:24,660
Over and over again.

730
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:34,820
Well, perhaps there might be a little bit of air to explain, you know, what's going to happen later after around one in the morning when the world explodes.

731
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,680
I guess we're not supposed to talk about it yet.

732
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:38,140
No.

733
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:46,420
If I were if I expected to live tomorrow, ensure the sun will rise again, as it usually does.

734
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,700
I would certainly send any kind of contribution that I could possibly come up with.

735
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,500
Like, what's what's the minimum?

736
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:54,100
Twenty five.

737
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:54,680
Fifteen.

738
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:56,180
Oh, no, I'm afraid there.

739
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,320
I don't think we've been told a minimum.

740
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:03,220
I've given a minimum of five dollars if they want a one dollar subgenius pamphlet.

741
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,860
Those things cost more than a dollar to print these days.

742
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:15,260
I know that's especially if you have like those old mimeograph machines, like once again with the pig ears on each side.

743
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,800
So there's more easy manipulation.

744
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:23,420
I actually had a hand cranked mimeograph machine when I was a teenager.

745
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:27,340
So I could print my sci fi fantasy scene.

746
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,240
So that's a nerd pedigree, dude.

747
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:36,200
I was a nerd before it was super uncool.

748
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,640
And you still are before it's super uncool.

749
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:40,060
Cool.

750
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:40,780
Yeah.

751
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:54,080
Oh, I'm I could I keep some of my nerdly interests off of the show because I don't want to gross out the the people who play cooler video games.

752
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:54,400
Yeah, well, you know, I have more nerds than me.

753
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:59,100
But let's let's not talk about the let's not get lost in the doctrine friends.

754
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,080
Let's talk about something that blesses our heart.

755
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:04,360
Your money helping this station.

756
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:10,580
This is the only time we get to act like a regular religion and money grub.

757
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,600
Do you understand that?

758
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:12,040
No.

759
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:20,620
If I could, were we, for instance, buying airtime in the deep south and ripping off illiterate little old ladies?

760
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,080
We'd be talking about money.

761
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,140
Send money to Bob.

762
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:24,960
Bob, send money for your subgenius membership.

763
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,320
It's thus and such much money.

764
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,100
Quick, send it.

765
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:30,920
We're a prosperity ministry, a prosperity ministry.

766
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:37,200
You'll get back what you put in tenfold, a thousand times over, and Bob will bless your heart.

767
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,480
Well, we don't get to do that except for the station.

768
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,060
We can't do it for Bob.

769
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,700
We can't do it for ourselves.

770
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:45,000
We have to do it for the station.

771
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:50,280
So, friends, make us feel better about that.

772
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,620
Make us feel better about that fact.

773
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:54,680
Go ahead and give some money to the station.

774
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:03,900
Dave nor I will ever see a penny of it except in the form of getting to see you listeners in person more often,

775
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:10,420
seeing you at Starwood, seeing people wear those lovely T-shirts, and we'll be looking at a shiny—

776
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,740
Knowing that somebody cares about us, Reverend Ivan Sangus,

777
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:20,060
there's so many Americans out there wondering what their next meal might bring them,

778
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:23,120
and they only have one hope, and that one hope is—

779
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,380
is WCSB.

780
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:32,540
If they could, they would give all they could, but so few of them have very little left to remain them.

781
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:37,300
They are—let's see if I can remember correctly.

782
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,100
See this name?

783
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,300
No, that's not—I'm afraid it's not a name.

784
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:45,700
Fight C. Taj, Dr. Dark, Reverend Diaz, Reverend Void.

785
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:50,160
Those were the names that I had intended to say originally.

786
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,940
I think everything has been updated.

787
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:55,940
As about five minutes ago, I—

788
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,820
Look at those phone lines light up!

789
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:58,580
Oh, my God!

790
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,060
Oh, the callers!

791
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,900
Actually, that is not true.

792
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,940
It looks like Charles is putting on his coat.

793
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:04,560
It's a—

794
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:06,700
Oh, well.

795
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:07,780
He's red, though.

796
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:12,240
He's fixing to leave because there's just no calls coming in.

797
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:18,300
Friends, don't you want to talk in person to these fabulous, famous DJs?

798
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:22,840
Princess Wee and Brother Love and Charleston Okafor?

799
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,700
Lonesome Cowboy Dave?

800
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,900
Well, you can't talk to him.

801
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,160
He can only talk to me, and I can only talk to him.

802
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,760
In fact, we're not allowed to talk to anybody but each other.

803
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:39,760
Friends, don't you want to feel the power of WCSB and your internia and your externia

804
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:50,440
right below the navel as they sit in Zebediah 10-5-7-42-39 girls who come before a—oh,

805
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,040
I'm sorry.

806
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:52,920
Please.

807
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:53,260
Please.

808
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,580
This is a slack ministry, friends.

809
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,440
This is a slack ministry and a prosperity ministry.

810
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:00,260
What's better than money?

811
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:00,740
Slack.

812
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:05,040
Slack will get you through times of no money better than money will get you through times

813
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:05,680
of no slack.

814
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:14,580
To paraphrase the fabulous furry freak brothers, copyright 1970, Gilbert Shelton, Paul Mavridis,

815
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:15,160
Dave Sheridan.

816
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,480
Dave Sheridan of Cleveland, by the way.

817
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:20,880
Paul Mavridis of Akron, by the way.

818
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,700
Gilbert Shelton of Austin.

819
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,580
By the way.

820
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,460
But he also went to Cleveland Institute.

821
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:26,900
Oh yeah?

822
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:27,780
Yup.

823
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,140
Gilbert Shelton did?

824
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,120
Yeah.

825
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:35,220
Did you know that I've personally met Gilbert Shelton, the cartoonist, and jammed

826
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:35,740
with him?

827
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:40,460
And he looked at us like, why are you guys playing terrible music?

828
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,040
Why don't you play good music?

829
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:43,900
But he didn't understand the—

830
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:51,580
You should have just told him, why are you drawing funny characters instead of you should

831
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:52,300
be drawing—

832
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,360
They were fun characters.

833
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,280
They were fun.

834
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,020
Like Hitler's architecture drawing.

835
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:57,440
These are just so beautiful.

836
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:01,000
I think the Führer was at least a great architectural drawing guy.

837
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,140
The Führer?

838
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,340
Despite his other flaws.

839
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,400
But, you know, we all have some wagons to do.

840
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:12,160
I saw a movie of Hitler riding a Tyrannosaurus today and meeting Sarah Palin.

841
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:13,980
He's a top—

842
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:16,520
Honest to God, I saw this in a movie.

843
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:20,300
It's a trailer for Iron Sky 2.

844
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,280
The first movie—

845
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:26,760
And they took the propaganda photos of Hitler as a Teutonic Knight or what was it, in the

846
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,500
Birth of a Nation, where the guy's riding there with his Ku Klux Klan uniform on and

847
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,220
he gets that from there or something?

848
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:40,140
Well, he looks kind of old and unnaturally preserved, and he's talking to Sarah Palin,

849
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:42,000
who's the President of the United States.

850
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,240
I'm not kidding.

851
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:49,260
This trailer opens with Sarah Palin looking out the window of the White House and watching

852
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:52,900
a nuclear bomb explode in the distance.

853
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:57,880
She then immediately jumps into the helicopter that's ready for her and they take off and

854
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,300
fly her to the North Pole.

855
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:05,920
She goes down a special elevator to the inside of the Hollow Earth and who meets her at the

856
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:12,000
doorway but Hitler riding a Tyrannosaurus with a sort of a futuristic Atlantis-looking

857
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:18,020
city in the background and the sun at the core of the Hollow Earth shining in the inverted

858
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:18,560
sky.

859
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:27,380
Sarah Palin meets Hitler in Iron Sky 2, which I think comes out in a year and a half, because

860
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:28,280
they're still making it.

861
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,740
That series is made in Finland.

862
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:36,340
That's a Finnish series, the Iron Sky movies about Nazis on the moon.

863
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:38,300
A Finnish television service?

864
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:42,000
No, it's a movie, a series of movies now that there's two of them.

865
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:42,280
A series of movies?

866
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,180
Yeah, Iron Sky.

867
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:48,660
If I ever see you again in person, I'll have to show it to you because you'd love it.

868
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,180
It's hilarious.

869
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,900
Many Finnish films are.

870
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:52,980
Many Finnish films are.

871
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:59,320
I was going to tell you a Finnish swear word that's popular in these parts.

872
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:02,660
Your friend over there in Germany...

873
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:06,740
No, that would be Large Some Cowboy the Large in Finland.

874
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:07,440
The Large Man.

875
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,940
Man, we haven't played any of his stuff in a while.

876
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:13,160
Ever since I met him, I haven't played any Large stuff.

877
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,960
But he hasn't said much Large stuff either, so we'll see.

878
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,000
We'll work it out.

879
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:22,880
Call him Bustahosa when you see him because that means Poo Poo Pants.

880
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,000
Oh, yeah, Bustahosa.

881
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:24,520
What is that?

882
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:25,340
Bustahosa?

883
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:26,900
Bustahosa.

884
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:28,120
Bustahosa.

885
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:29,280
Yeah.

886
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,200
Okay, Bustahosa Poo Poo Pants.

887
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:34,780
And Bustahosa means...

888
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:37,620
We need some more collages or reruns.

889
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,860
Oh my gosh, it's like five minutes left for people to call 216-687-6900.

890
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,940
Did you tell them about the Angry Fish that we were going to give them or any of the other

891
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:48,680
primes?

892
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:55,560
For your $5,000 pledge, we will send you by slow mail an Angry Fish.

893
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:00,480
He'll be really angry after three weeks of delivery time.

894
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,960
216-687-6900.

895
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:05,960
That's 6900.

896
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:08,600
Or you could just maybe get a little bag of prawns.

897
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:09,620
It would have worked better.

898
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:17,380
Now, friends, you can always come to the station itself near downtown Cleveland on Friday,

899
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:25,820
November 21st, afternoon, or Sunday, November 23rd, noon, noon to four.

900
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:27,680
I don't know which one we'll be at.

901
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:33,800
We always have dinar with Ms. Star Sistar on Friday evenings, but we always have show

902
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:34,780
on Sunday evenings.

903
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,580
So we don't know.

904
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:39,380
Maybe we'll have to be a part of both.

905
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,400
They'd beat us if we don't...

906
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:47,780
If station volunteers don't come to do these fun things.

907
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,400
I've seen the scars.

908
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,960
You've shown me the weapons you've got from...

909
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:52,720
Yeah, we have to.

910
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:53,980
They call it a form of hazing.

911
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:58,640
Even after all the whiskers you've got, you've been a station member for 29 years or something

912
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,160
like that.

913
00:56:59,300 --> 00:56:59,820
Oh, yeah.

914
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:00,620
I still...

915
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:07,100
They go a little easier on us than some, but I can't push my luck.

916
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:13,500
Yeah, but I think the big jokes you made about your colostomy bag and some of the other...

917
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,400
That's not funny.

918
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,040
It's not a joke.

919
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:17,760
It's not funny.

920
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:17,760


921
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:20,300
I didn't say it was funny or a joke.

922
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,800
I said the joke...

923
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,580
Yeah, maybe I did.

924
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:29,100
But I meant them making fun of you for carrying it around and not really using it.

925
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,740
Are you talking about my one testicle?

926
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,120
It is huge.

927
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,500
No, I was...

928
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:35,840
I kind of...

929
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:38,900
I'm not really using it for what it's supposed to be used for, no.

930
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:41,200
I don't do other men's testicles unless I'm forced to.

931
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,420
I'm rid of habeas corpus.

932
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:44,840
I'm crying out loud.

933
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:45,740
We're all warriors.

934
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,040
We should know better than that.

935
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:58,000
Well, it looks like Dr. Sinister is coming in to start setting up for his setup of the listeners to...

936
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,800
So you did feel the temperature in the room drop?

937
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:01,620
Yeah, it kind of...

938
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:02,740
It is cold in here.

939
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,340
Yeah, well, Dr. Sinister...

940
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:05,380
Is that what it is?

941
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:08,320
He just sucks the life and heat out of everything.

942
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:08,700
What are you doing, man?

943
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:09,680
What are you doing, Dr. Sinister?

944
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,800
Why are you controlling the environment like that?

945
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,040
He can't hear you.

946
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:15,240
Oh.

947
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,480
Now I can.

948
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:17,020
Oh.

949
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:19,520
Well, I just wonder why you can...

950
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:23,480
How and why you can control the environment, and what do you expect to prove with these...

951
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,300
I didn't say I could control the environment.

952
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,420
...wieldy little prowling experiments who are taking part in your love.

953
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:29,000
I can't say that...

954
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:31,220
I didn't say I control the environment.

955
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:38,480
If I had control over it, I would bring rainbows and sunshine and warmth to every living soul

956
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:42,900
on earth or ever and whenever I entered the room, but as it turns out, I just have this

957
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:46,180
unfortunate trait where the temperature drops.

958
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:46,640
Oh.

959
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:47,020
I'm sorry.

960
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:47,020


961
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:47,020


962
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:47,020


963
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:47,020


964
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:47,020


965
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:47,020


966
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:47,020


967
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:47,020


968
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:47,020


969
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:47,020


970
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:47,020


971
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:47,020


972
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:47,580
I got one in my nose.

973
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:47,580


974
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:47,580


975
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:47,580


976
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:47,580


977
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:47,600
And I'm the last person here who has noticed that.

978
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:47,600


979
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:47,600


980
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:47,600


981
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:47,600


982
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:47,600


983
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,360
I think it's probably getting darker and it gets dark.

984
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,060
That's creepy.

985
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:51,020
Well that'd be...

986
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:55,300
Barometrically speaking, that could be a good, good sign.

987
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:58,580
Like, as far as looking for a portent for the future.

988
00:58:58,580 --> 00:58:59,340
Like we were to look for a portent.

989
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:03,940
They said in Heisenberg when he used to walk in a room, the clocks would go backwards.

990
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:10,240
So that must be, you are able to, turn off street lights and make people's braking systems

991
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,820
and go off and stuff like that.

992
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,600
And it's probably like a Carrie-like character or something.

993
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,260
Nobody knows about it.

994
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,700
Well, I do know one thing.

995
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:21,720
The show's over.

996
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,040
Thank you for calling, Dave.

997
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:29,040
And thank you all seven or eight pledgers.

998
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,960
I mean, seven or 800 pledgers that we got.

999
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:38,100
And I'm going to switch to the canned old Pledge Drive shows.

1000
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,240
As fresh as Harvest Day.

1001
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,100
Yeah.

1002
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,220
Praise God.

1003
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:44,720
Thanks, Dave.

1004
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,040
Bye.

1005
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,340
They're here.

1006
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:52,080
A minute.

1007
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,320
It's showtime.

1008
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:57,200
Time for the subgenius hour and a half.

1009
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,800
The show that dare not even exist.

1010
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:05,260
Join us now as we rocket away out of normal time into showtime.

1011
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:10,100
It's mysterious, evil, spooky, eerie, creepy, wacky.

1012
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:15,800
The subgenius hour of black.

1013
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,280
And here we got brains the whole operation.

1014
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:22,160
Faster signal goes up.

1015
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:22,840
Here's the satellite.

1016
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,620
We bump it out all over the world.

1017
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:26,220
Pretty fancy, huh?

1018
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,400
Not too familiar with it, myself.

1019
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:32,240
You're buying time.

1020
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:33,160
Time, friends.

1021
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:38,100
Because Mr. Moneybags, he's paying a salary.

1022
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:38,500
Hey.

1023
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:41,180
Salary.

1024
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:46,060
He throws in 100 bucks a week and consequently I can't preach against drinking because his

1025
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:47,300
icebox is full of beer.

1026
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,420
I hope he's talking about you, my friend.

1027
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,840
Pay us not to preach about beer.

1028
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,020
I can't preach against cigarettes because they all smoke.

1029
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:54,500
For me.

1030
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:58,460
I have to let them out for 15 minutes between Sunday school and worship service so they

1031
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:01,240
can go out and light up a Chesterfield or something or the end of it.

1032
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,200
And what kind did Jesus smoke, friends?

1033
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,280
It's time to open your heart.

1034
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:07,760
Close your mind.

1035
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:09,020
Unzip your lips.

1036
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,160
And bend over.

1037
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:14,160
Because you're about to receive the word of Bob.

1038
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:17,620
And pull out that wallet, friends, because it is pledge drive time.

1039
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:19,040
Praise Bob.

1040
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,200
It's either the last pledge drive for a while or the last hour of slack.

1041
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:25,840
This could be your last chance, folks.

1042
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,040
I thought you boys understood.

1043
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:28,060
It's business.

1044
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:29,100
That's all it is.

1045
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,540
You still don't get it, do you, boys?

1046
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:35,760
There ain't no countries anymore.

1047
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:37,180
No more good guys.

1048
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,860
They're running the whole show.

1049
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:40,140
They own everything.

1050
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:40,140


1051
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:41,140
The whole damn planet.

1052
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,180
They can do whatever they want.

1053
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,060
What's wrong with having a good for a change?

1054
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,460
And they're going to let us have a good if we just help them.

1055
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:48,780
They're going to leave us alone.

1056
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:50,100
Let's make some money.

1057
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:52,860
You can have a little taste of that good life, too.

1058
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,080
Now, I know you want it.

1059
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:55,220
Hell, everybody does.

1060
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:58,580
He's going to make a million dollars.

1061
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:04,160
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

1062
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:04,140


1063
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:04,140


1064
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:04,140


1065
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:04,140


1066
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:04,140


1067
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:04,140
