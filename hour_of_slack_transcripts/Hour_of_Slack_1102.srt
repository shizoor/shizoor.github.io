1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,540
Ah, yes, dear friends.

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,000
Welcome to Hour of Slack number...

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,360
What is this?

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:20,940
One thousand.

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,860
One hundred.

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,980
And a team.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,760
From PR News in Washington, I'm contaminated with E. coli.

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:35,380
Republicans are furthering the understanding of the trade-offs between lurid e-mails and the effects on E. coli.

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,820
So far, the United States and Australia are contaminated with PR News in Washington.

10
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,980
After relaxing on the lake, Bob's ready to have a great time entertaining his friends.

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,160
Right, Bob?

12
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:48,860
Bob?

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,840
Bob?

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,520
Dick.

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,000
Dick!

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,020
Dick!

17
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,300
There's that sound again.

18
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,400
I'm scared.

19
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,960
Countdown for Bob.

20
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,860
Bob.

21
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:13,620
Minus five.

22
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,820
Minus four.

23
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,880
Minus three.

24
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:16,960
Minus two.

25
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:17,880
Bob.

26
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:18,620
Minus one.

27
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:19,660
Fire.

28
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,480
Fire.

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,440
Fire.

30
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,540
Fire.

31
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,320
Fire.

32
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,100
Fire.

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:26,640
Fire.

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,020
Fire.

35
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:28,740
Fire.

36
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:28,740


37
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:28,740


38
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:28,740


39
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:28,740


40
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,640
From the far horizons of the unknown come transcribed tales of new dimensions and Bob.

41
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,860
These are stories of Bob.

42
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,280
Adventures in which you'll live in a million Bobs.

43
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,560
On a thousand maybe Bobs.

44
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,640
The National Bob Company presents...

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,720
The Sogenius Power of War.

46
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:02,280
If you wanted to take over our world with a minimum amount of resistance and trouble,

47
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,980
how would you go about it?

48
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,240
Tonight we'll tell you how.

49
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,660
With a strange and chilling Bob.

50
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:15,460
She needs a doctor.

51
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,660
Okay, I've heard enough anyway.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,520
X.

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:18,900
Excellent.

54
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,500
Stay away from me.

55
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,580
It's awful.

56
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,800
Go away, please.

57
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,440
Go away.

58
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,680
Oh, no, please.

59
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,360
It's too awful.

60
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:26,860
Please.

61
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:27,760
Quite so.

62
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,260
Quite so.

63
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,960
And here he is.

64
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,560
Bob.

65
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,520
Bob's not here again.

66
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,260
Well, gee, it's Bob.

67
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:36,940
Yeah, Bob.

68
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,160
Yeah, but Bob's going to be there.

69
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,220
Even if Bob Bob Bob.

70
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,740
Yeah, well, no.

71
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,400
Yes, if Bob Bob Bob.

72
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:45,960
Bob.

73
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,180
He can see today.

74
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:55,700
What?

75
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:55,860


76
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:55,860


77
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,420
Why must we destroy you?.

79
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,340
I'll tell you why.

95
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,420
That you have a

96
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:22,760
destiny.

97
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,220
That you have a right.

98
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,480
That you have a

99
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,000
cause.

100
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,720
That you are special.

101
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,340
That you are

102
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:34,940
great.

103
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,740
But in truth,

104
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,260
you are

105
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,480
born insane.

106
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,800
And such misery

107
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,220
cannot

108
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:48,880
be allowed

109
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,220
to spread.

110
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,660
Kill them all!

111
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,100
Behave yourself, because the man's looking

112
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,240
and looking. But the Holy Ghost

113
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,740

God's high sheriff

117
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,380

and get back for you.

119
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,980
Bring back to you

120
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,120
those things that the

121
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,260
devil has stolen.

122
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,260
Did anyone mention

123
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,140
Bob? Hey, here's something.

124
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,360
Listen to this.

125
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,000
Signs, omens,

126
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,260
portents, and charms to ward off

127
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,120
Bob. Huh? Bob.

128
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,180
Bob. Stop Bob. Bob.

129
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,560
Stop Bob. Bob.

130
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,980
Bob's a James. He is. He is.

131
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,180
Hey, that was nice. Stop this

132
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:45,840
foolish James.

133
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,720
I think that's funny.

134
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:50,820
Ah!

135
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,200
Bob.

136
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,200
What are you doing, Bob?

137
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,060
You can't do that, Bob.

138
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,740
What are you doing, Bob?

139
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,700
Step away from the console,

140
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,780
please, Bob.

141
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,440
Bob, you're starting to blow

142
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,420
my mind.

143
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,460
Bob.

144
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,120
Bob.

145
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,140
What are you doing, Bob?

146
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:31,760
Damn.

147
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,040
Your science is too tight.

148
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,140
Wow, Bob.

149
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,240
You really know how to cut a groove.

150
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,700
Look at him go.

151
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,080
He's like a Bob Octopus.

152
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,860
A Bob-to-cap-us, if you will.

153
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,020
Hello and welcome to True Identity.

154
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:04,500
Hello.

155
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,380
The government hasn't kept its election promises.

156
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,840
Wasn't a surprise at all.

157
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,540
The government.

158
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,480
I didn't understand what was happening.

159
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,880
Drink, drink. What did you make?

160
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,700
The government tried to hide the truth.

161
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,400
Cover up.

162
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,240
The whole matter will soon be covered.

163
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:17,680
It can be forgotten.

164
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,080
I thought it was...

165
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,760
Yes, yes.

166
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,520
Didn't work. It just didn't come off.

167
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,140
Drink, drinking.

168
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,220
Yes, I had mixed feelings about it, too.

169
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:24,960
Go.

170
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,140
What were your impressions?

171
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,140
I was expecting something special.

172
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,480
I agree completely.

173
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,220
Blow.

174
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,100
Back, back.

175
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,060
Out of this world.

176
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,080
The government tried to cover up the truth.

177
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,960
Come on. Forward. Put off.

178
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,240
Problem. The police.

179
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,280
Break the speed limit.

180
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,800
Down on. Crack.

181
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,940
Cracking. Cracking. Corruption. Jobs.

182
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,480
We must all accept people over.

183
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,740
Ten. Eight. Seven.

184
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,200
Break, break, break, break, break.

185
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,080
Break, break, break, break.

186
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,140
Cracking. Cracking. Cracking.

187
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,260
Put, put, put, put.

188
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:51,640
Down.

189
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,940
Yes, yes.

190
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,900
Yes, boys and girls.

191
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,300
We're back. It's the hour of slack.

192
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,380
And we make fun of all...

193
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,200
We make fun of all of stupid, ridiculous goofballs.

194
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,580
Tossed, tampered, and there and right to size.

195
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,640
All manner of things.

196
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,240
We like to make fun of all the...

197
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,220
Idiots.

198
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,420
And we've got Dave-o and We-o.

199
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,140
Out of there.

200
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,640
Where's the bathroom?

201
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,800
Whose brain would we want to cook in that soup stone?

202
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,500
Oh, if only we had a brain.

203
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,620
A whole brain between us.

204
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,600
If we had both.

205
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,640
We'd be almost like Bob.

206
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,360
He's the funniest clown of all.

207
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,700
Cooked our soup in the toilet and sang to the toilet.

208
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,220
And gave offerings three times a day.

209
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,820
And remembered the distant past when we all had toilets as ancestors.

210
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:00,200
When the first toilets landed from outer space and conquered Earth.

211
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,200
And when the...

212
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,700
Pfft. Pfft. Pfft. Pfft. Pfft.

213
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,280
I think I took too much of those...

214
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,180
Those funny pop cookies.

215
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,500
Took too many of those other halves.

216
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,000
Yeah, like...

217
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,900
I feel like I'm...

218
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,220
My head is...

219
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,860
Filling up with some kind of weird noise.

220
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,460
It's starting to blow, look.

221
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,500
It's like they're saying,

222
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,900
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob...

223
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,040
It's like they're in nature.

224
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,100
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

225
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,180
It's like there's some kind of religious nudge saying,

226
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,780
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

227
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,760
What time is it?

228
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,100
It'll all be better soon.

229
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,400
Just relax.

230
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,880
Breathe deeply.

231
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,560
That's right.

232
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,480
Breathe dutifully.

233
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,660
And remember the stars are for you,

234
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:45,880
And remember the stars are for you,

235
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,780
Against you, behind you,

236
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,980
And may your back resemble the wind

237
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,620
As you climb onto that brand new lizard.

238
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,340
You're cheap, but you don't care.

239
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,380
The future's in your pocket.

240
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,620
The future's coming, and Big Brother is watching you.

241
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,220
He's watching your back!

242
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,220
Here on Action 5 News and Google Earth Street View.

243
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,600
That's right, Mona.

244
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,440
We're watching the zit on the Reverend Ivory Stang's back.

245
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:12,680
Ew.

246
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,480
It's about to pop.

247
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,320
I guess it's some sort of institutional...

248
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,840
Oh, God.

249
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,580
...madness caused by the confluence of large corporations...

250
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,060
Ew.

251
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,180
...and big business and government.

252
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,660
But that's all right.

253
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,220
He says, anyway, he says the world is soon, perhaps, maybe, going to come to an end.

254
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:27,900
Back to you, Mona.

255
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,480
Wow.

256
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,680
I wish they just wouldn't close in on those things.

257
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,080
It's just so disturbing.

258
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:32,660
Don't you find...

259
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,200
Privacy has already come to an end, my friends.

260
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,340
Actually, we were looking at Google Earth Street View,

261
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,800
which hasn't made it to Cleveland yet.

262
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,880
But when they do,

263
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,340
when those Google cameras drive down the streets of Cleveland,

264
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,860
they'll be able to see the Dobbs heads on your door.

265
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,940
They'll be able to see the Bob Bumper sticker on your car.

266
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,060
And not just them, even you'll be able to see it yourself.

267
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:04,040
Yeah, I hate to reiterate, but they'll be able to see a staggered out of Becky's across the street from the station here

268
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:09,020
with your underpants down around your knees and two black eyes and a larger nose than when you walked her in there.

269
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,360
Big Brother's here!

270
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,380
He's watching you!

271
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,860
But he doesn't need to build concentration camps for you!

272
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:13,860


273
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,060
That's because you're already in one!

274
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,840
You're staying in your home!

275
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,080
That's just what they want you to do!

276
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,060
And you can't concentrate very well.

277
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,960
It's all the voices all mixing together.

278
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,880
It's crazy stuff, kid stuff.

279
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,300
You don't know what to do.

280
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,520
You don't know where to turn.

281
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,340
You know that you need it.

282
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,360
You need help.

283
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,560
But you don't believe in anything.

284
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,960
Friends, we've got the God that doesn't want you to believe in it.

285
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,300
And that's the Bob Bob Bob Bob!

286
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,760
We're fanatical about that one thing.

287
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,420
That's the only thing.

288
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,420
We make fun of those religious fanatics, except for ourselves.

289
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,600
Because we're fanatical for Bob.

290
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,840
He tells us what we need to know and what we need to do.

291
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:02,820
Youngly lovely young G.I. Miss Parrish Hipton enters her first day of boots camp

292
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:08,900
wearing the finest in leather apparel with the top of her shoes down by the bottom of her kneecaps.

293
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,940
And look at her smiling at all the soldiers going by.

294
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,140
Soldiers for Bob!

295
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,940
An election for hers.

296
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,960
Oh, I love that googly-eyed big brother.

297
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,180
I'll take more pictures of me, me, me.

298
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,940
Put your head down when you get in the back of the car.

299
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,520
It's the soldiers for slack, friends.

300
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,420
They're going to make you get slack.

301
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,660
Even if it kills you.

302
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,600
Because that's what the truly religious do.

303
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,740
You know, that's how much we love you.

304
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,100
We don't want to kill you.

305
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,120
Unless that's what it takes to save us.

306
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:51,660
You know, some of us, you know, fresh and young titter twams have migrated throughout this entire galaxy

307
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:58,680
hoping one fine day we could stand at the stooped over shoulders of J.R. Bob Dobbs

308
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,360
and give him a kick in the wherefore and whatnot.

309
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:08,440
And when that moment comes, there's going to be li-li-li-liberation around the globe.

310
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,060
Liberation right around the corner.

311
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,060
Yes.

312
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:18,580
Back in the days when people carried things underneath their proboscis to keep the mucal fluid from flossing.

313
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,060
Friends, as fellow citizen Fwap said,

314
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:29,080
on fumigating the upper ether for divine infestations, he said,

315
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,400
Here lies a wasted god.

316
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,720
He was not a small one.

317
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,440
We did but build his house of slack.

318
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,220
A frop-filled and high-walled one.

319
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,920
Fwap, Fwap.

320
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,100
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

321
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,720
Brother Fwap is from, uh, Norway.

322
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,400
By the way...

323
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,420
Brother Fwap?

324
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,200
Does the Norwegians make excellent Jarlsburger cheeses?

325
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:08,060
And I was wondering if any of the effluvial flavors and essences of those wonderful petroleum cheeses brought to you by Dr. His Name

326
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:13,340
are actually in that massage you were giving yourself there a few short moments ago.

327
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:19,420
I love to sit on the john and read those soap bottles by Dr. What's-His-Name.

328
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,360
Dr. His-Name, I mean.

329
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,520
Whatty, Whatty His-Name.

330
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,060
Dr. What-Has-His-Name.

331
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,460
Well, friends, what are our names and where are we?

332
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,860
We're in the middle of a cardiac function right now.

333
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,340
It looks like Bob is on the offertating table.

334
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,940
We're about ready to take the offertating of Bob's pipe in his heart bone.

335
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,040
It's like an erectile...

336
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,160
Well, we can't remove the pipe.

337
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,360
Well, it's like an erectile sausage. We're going to have to do something with it or else the whale will die.

338
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,800
Well, if we remove Bob's pipe, everything will die.

339
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,200
You have to keep the connection between Bob and the pipe.

340
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,620
You may be able to remove it, but the taproot...

341
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,240
Sir, Mr. Mrs. Mr. Sir...

342
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,320
The taproot must not be severed, Doctor.

343
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,420
It's not cartilage down there, Doctor. It's not cartilage down there.

344
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,440
Will you shut that patient up? Listen to him. He's insane.

345
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,560
Ah, it's Princess Wee. I knew it would come back to me.

346
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,140
Oh, there she is in the flesh.

347
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,780
God, listen to what it's doing to our heads.

348
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,160
Ah, looks like they've sealed the doors, too, so...

349
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,620
We can't get out of here.

350
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,760
Sir, I'm not going in here.

351
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,600
Get the hell out of here.

352
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,100
There's no way out.

353
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,800
I don't know. It looks like the wall is getting a little closer.

354
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm hoping... I'm hoping somebody comes up here at least to do the, uh...

355
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,820
Someone's dirty laundry.

356
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:47,260
We may want to inspect each and every cavity and office in your body.

357
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:57,480
As members of an ultra-tight, ultra-secret, ultra-efficient and smiling police services slash forces,

358
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,720
we offer you not only benefits,

359
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:01,900
wages,

360
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,520
and a proximity to your workplace.

361
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,660
We also offer a three-day lottery,

362
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,900
an incandescent vacation,

363
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:16,440
and a loss of your furniture if you fail to appear when your summons date is given.

364
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:17,720
Bob?

365
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,300
Do you hear that, Bob?

366
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,900
Hope you're listening, Bob.

367
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,120
Open his eyes. He's not responding. We're going to have to get him to open his own eyes.

368
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,460
I...

369
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,280
Yours.

370
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:27,740
Yeah.

371
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,480
Rosna recorded the Bobs of X day,

372
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,900
and I think I used them as a test... filter test.

373
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:42,140
Well, Filter Teslika was probably one of the greatest astrophysicists in Norway at the time.

374
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,400
Frederick Filter Test.

375
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,100
Yeah.

376
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,440
And he was a great audio engineer, too.

377
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,840
Well, he was also a...

378
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,980
He was a Photoshop master.

379
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,700
A Photoshop master, and...

380
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,040
Yeah.

381
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,540
And he was big in porno.

382
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:52,760


383
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,740
Well, at least until the final slapdown, and, uh...

384
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,340
Well, we don't mean the actual handcuffs and so forth, but the...

385
00:15:59,340 --> 00:15:59,660
Sorry?

386
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,440
The slapping down...

387
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:01,680
Connie?

388
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:02,920
Well...

389
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,380
Connie?

390
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,080
It's not the female principal.

391
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,260
She's never really been the principal.

392
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,640
Connie?

393
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,020
She's always just been the...

394
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,060
Sexratary.

395
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,120
Please report to the office.

396
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,780
Mr. Stang.

397
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,100
Student.

398
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:16,740
Citizen.

399
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,400
Stang.

400
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,640
Please report to Assistant Principal Peep's office.

401
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,680
I can't, man.

402
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,920
I'm listening to Bob.

403
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,060
It's coming, man.

404
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,020
Go in there.

405
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,360
It's coming.

406
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,380
She's waiting for you, man.

407
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,640
I'm finding my son.

408
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:29,640


409
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:29,640


410
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:29,640


411
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:29,640


412
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:29,640


413
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:29,640


414
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:29,640


415
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,700
I'll see this recording.

416
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,580
It's like they just say Bob over and over again.

417
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,940
Never mind the forehead.

418
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,760
It's cool.

419
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,580
Never mind the cool aid.

420
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,280
Never mind the paddling machines.

421
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,160
It's nuclear now, man.

422
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,520
Just walk in.

423
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,300
Connie's waiting for you, man.

424
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,140
Bob?

425
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,380
Bob?

426
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:47,860
Bob is dead.

427
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,540
Bob?

428
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,660
Bob's dead.

429
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,960
Walk in there, man.

430
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,560
She's waiting for you.

431
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,200
Actually, some of that is...

432
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,060
Those are the frogs out at Brushwood that you hear.

433
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:57,820
The band?

434
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,200
No, those are the frogs.

435
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,740
Those sounds we were recording.

436
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,200
The actual frogs.

437
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,340
Yeah.

438
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,300
The little frogs in the pond at sundown.

439
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:06,540
Pond frogs.

440
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,300
They make that noise.

441
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:07,680
They all chirp, Bob.

442
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:12,300
I've heard they're becoming de-gentrified too with the absence of any formal locus.

443
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,240
You know what I'm saying?

444
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:13,660
Maybe?

445
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,600
No, I don't either.

446
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,460
No, but...

447
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,600
Oh, speaking of locus, I need to do credits real fast.

448
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,400
In the previous...

449
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,860
At the beginning of the show, of course, we heard all those cool cut-ups by Lee Murr,

450
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,140
Fernand and Andy Lee Murr.

451
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,460
He does a ton of that stuff, although I actually did a little bit, tiny bit of it myself.

452
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,000
And we also heard...

453
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,180
I don't know if you heard, but I heard that the other day, the other day, the other day,

454
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:37,080
the scratching Bob bit about Bob at the console panel consoling you was by Gord...

455
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,980
Ah, shut up!

456
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,440
Fine.

457
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,020
Now, you know, you guys make fun of me, but these people don't get paid.

458
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,260
And they need...

459
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,880
All they get is the credit.

460
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,380
They are indeed great.

461
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,360
They are indeed great.

462
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,340
And continue.

463
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,900
We were just laughing at your clothes.

464
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,360
I guess you call them clothes?

465
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,260
They laughed at me.

466
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,160
They made me laugh.

467
00:17:59,180 --> 00:17:59,740
They mocked me.

468
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,040
They made a mockery of me.

469
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,220
They dragged me through the mock.

470
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,060
They made a potpourri of me.

471
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,480
And a pile of...

472
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,580
It was me mocking him.

473
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:13,880
All because I carried scantily clad women into swamps.

474
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,260
That was my slack, man.

475
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,080
But...

476
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,800
Three hours every day after such a noose lap, dancers.

477
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,060
Now, you know, friends...

478
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,260
What of the credit, Reverend Stank?

479
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,000
The credit?

480
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,240
What of the credit?

481
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,980
Well, you know what it is, friends.

482
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,080
I'm just all excited.

483
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,220
Because of X Day.

484
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,040
X Day, the world is about to end.

485
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,160
The world ends tomorrow and you may die.

486
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,240
You won't die if you're a subgenius.

487
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,840
You may die if you're not.

488
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,540
Well, that kind of is the focus of this evening's evening, isn't it?

489
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,620
Will the world actually really end as you...

490
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:50,900
Oh, no.

491
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,300
That's never our focus because here's the thing.

492
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,280
X Day is symbolic.

493
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,900
It's a drill because the world could end any second.

494
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,320
Bob has said that all along.

495
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,820
He said, tomorrow, you may die.

496
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,360
Tomorrow.

497
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,620
It's a form of religion.

498
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,620
The world ends tomorrow.

499
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,680
We don't know when X Day could be.

500
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,520
If we knew what year this was, that'd be great.

501
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,980
But Bob said the world would end July 5th, 1998.

502
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,740
Well, 1998 came when the world didn't end, apparently.

503
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,080
So, therefore, that wasn't 1998.

504
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,480
We don't know what time it is.

505
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,440
I'll tell you what time it is.

506
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,380
It's time for the pink man to shut up.

507
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,660
And the slack man to rise.

508
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,360
On all fours.

509
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,180
And I'm rising up just thinking about X Day.

510
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,600
But there's people who don't understand.

511
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,680
Now, our good friend, Reverend Motomac, the sex god.

512
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,560
You may have heard of the sex god, Motomac.

513
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,880
Motomac was a sex god.

514
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,580
Motomac was on a billiard table back in 1928.

515
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,860
Motomac sends out press releases in the name of the church's subgenius.

516
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:54,100
He does not clear these with me, by the way, which has led sometimes to risible, laughable...

517
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,160
Anyway, Motomac's latest...

518
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,420
I will not say that name, though, because I can...

519
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:02,040
Was apparently well-written and grabbed attention.

520
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:11,340
And it was sent to many websites where people who were not saved in Bob, or of Bob, or by Bob, or with Bob,

521
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,200
but were against Bob even, some of them, without even knowing anything about it.

522
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:26,360
And I have an actual phone message recording that we received here at the Subgenius Foundation headquarters in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

523
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,680
Actual tape?

524
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,040
Actual tape.

525
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,960
The toll-free number.

526
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,440
I think you should play it.

527
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,900
Which was probably let in...

528
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,920
Yes, I'm going to play that.

529
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,720
And this was somebody who didn't understand Bob's prophecy.

530
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,140
Now, we're...

531
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,780
First, we'll actually hear...

532
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:39,820
First, we'll actually hear...

533
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,000
A lot of mis-stand-a-randing.

534
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,300
First, we will hear Bob's prophecy.

535
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,080
We have to discuss the things we should understand around here.

536
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:52,180
By the way, this background music is by Onan Canabite, called, uh, Not Different But Better.

537
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,680
Oh, I thought that was the misogynistic...

538
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,320
Hurl, hurl.

539
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,680
Anyway, here's that...

540
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,200
Here's that...

541
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,940
Let's not get lost in the spirit, because here is that, uh, self-same phone call.

542
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,640
No, I'm afraid it wasn't.

543
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:22,260
On July 5th, 1998, 7 a.m., when we all have hangovers, Wotan's judgment will take place in the form of what the priest's scriptures call the advent of the angelic host.

544
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,300
Yeah, I'm reading here on the internet where you think the word is.

545
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,960
The world's going to end July 5th, 2007.

546
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,160
Well, brother, I'll tell you what the Bible says.

547
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:38,680
No man knows what hour our Lord doth come, so you've got a heck of a email going on here.

548
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:43,720
And I hope God forgives you for trying to predict when He's coming back in Jesus Christ.

549
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:57,180
But, uh, I hope you find Him in the end and get your heart right and your soul straightened out and ask to use Christ into your life and your heart and ask Him to forgive you of your sins and to repent, because you're doing some blasphemy against God.

550
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,000
Because there's no way you know that.

551
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:06,220
Uh, but I feel for you, buddy, and I just pray that you get to know Jesus Christ as your personal Savior. God bless.

552
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,260
Well, my brother, thank you for that feeling.

553
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:21,020
We wish that you would read further down the press releases before you reach judgment, because, my friend, the judgmental will also be at the judgment.

554
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,440
At the judgmental judgment table.

555
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,000
The conclusion jumper.

556
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,580
The conclusion jumper.

557
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,100
Will be at the judgment, my friend.

558
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,440
Also the abstract floozy.

559
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,520
The one who...

560
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,200
The abstract painter will be at the judgment, my friend.

561
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,640
Yeah, the occult Kandinskyan.

562
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,380
The neo-necromagical...

563
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,380
The false Bob will be at the judgment.

564
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,720
Neo-necromagical, ballsy, balsamic bald Bob will be at the surcharge.

565
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,840
The pretender.

566
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,620
The poser Bob will be at the judgment.

567
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,040
The poopy feet...

568
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,460
Along with the judgmental.

569
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,040
The poopy feet of the...

570
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,140
The pink Bob will be crucified at the judgment.

571
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:00,380
The generals and the...

572
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,620
The naysayers of religious...

573
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:08,280
The religious kook will be at the judgment.

574
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,840
Kook, indeed.

575
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,720
The laughable schizophrenic will be at the judgment.

576
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:19,120
The friendly Hungarian, the restaurateur will be on...

577
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,440
The ingenieur will be at the judgment.

578
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,220
The disciple, the pope...

579
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,560
The crimson tide of old Alabama.

580
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,060
The Bobby will be at the judgment.

581
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,260
The imabob will be at the judgment.

582
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,820
The imabobby will be at the judgment, my friend.

583
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,340
The concussion stand and the sandwich's shopper.

584
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,800
The pink boy will be at the judgment.

585
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:48,360
You know the femme fatale will be there too.

586
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,260
Well, we've described a world that no one really wants to live in it.

587
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,420
So why should we live in it a world where no one wants to live in it?

588
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,200
Well, simply...

589
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:03,860
I'm sorry.

590
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:04,920
Oh, I'm sorry.

591
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,360
I'm sorry.

592
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,120
Oh no, I insist.

593
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,700
No, I insist.

594
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,340
I'm actually the one that's sorry.

595
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:08,920
After you.

596
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,720
I didn't mean it.

597
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:10,740
Indubitably.

598
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,880
I am the apologetic party at this time.

599
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,460
No, please you.

600
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:12,960
You first.

601
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,800
No, go ahead.

602
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,280
No, no, I insist.

603
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,020
No, please.

604
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,120
Please.

605
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,480
No, no, no.

606
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,580
No, please, please, please, please.

607
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,020
Well, you see...

608
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,380
You see, Reverend Frotter Sifu,

609
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:26,540
You see, Reverend Frotter Sifu,

610
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:32,780
So Deep did that background tune called N-P-O-V-E,

611
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:39,360
in which Bob Dean finally makes it onto the hour of slack as a kind of sound effect.

612
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:48,420
Speaking of radio shows, the pioneering Ask Dr. Howell show has now adapted fully to the alternate medium of radio,

613
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:54,640
according to its broadcasters Dr. Howell and Howell, who will be at X-Day and The Judgment.

614
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,040
And it is a genetic experiment we'll all enjoy watching unfold it.

615
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:05,460
Also, and K-Rob, whose name often gets talked over, K-Rob is a regular also on the Puzzling Evidence show.

616
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,120
Since the closing of the popular nightclub phenomenon, Ask Dr. Howell,

617
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:18,140
last experiences by eager audiences about San Francisco's 12 Galaxies nightclub until recently,

618
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:23,760
diversification has been the word as the show, chameleon-like,

619
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,940
has metamorphosed to its current on-air version on innovative San Francisco pirate radio station,

620
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,600
Pirate Cat 87.9 FM.

621
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:38,680
But you can listen to it on the internet, friends, in the number I'm about to give,

622
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,820
but you'll have to have a pencil ready to write it down.

623
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,500
That's why I'm not giving it yet, so get ready.

624
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:48,520
Just as in its salad days, under the aegis of impresario, Chicken John,

625
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,580
the show still features the question-and-answer format of Yawr, as will...

626
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,540
X-Day at Brushwood.

627
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,940
Listeners are encouraged to call the show during its broadcast hours,

628
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:02,620
10 p.m. till midnight, Wednesday nights, using the sacred telephone number,

629
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,980
415-626-7180.

630
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,100
Read that again, please.

631
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,540
Anyway, friends, here's what you do.

632
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:16,300
Here's that at www.piratecatradio.com.

633
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,060
That's it.

634
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,980
Pirate Cat Radio.

635
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,780
All one word.

636
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,500
So it looks as if it says...

637
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,600
Pirate Cat Radio.

638
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,180
...radio.com.

639
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,760
Pirate Cat Radio and Navaradio.

640
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,060
And that should get you where you need to go for two solid hours of unique.

641
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:38,640
Now, I don't mean to turn anyone away from this great, magnificent show.

642
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,500
But what blurb was that from?

643
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,360
That was from Dr. Howell.

644
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,740
I mean, but what paper is it quoted from, Stank?

645
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,440
What paper?

646
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,380
Yes, you've totally...

647
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,100
The interweb.

648
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,560
The world warped interweb.

649
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,480
He'll never understand.

650
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:52,780
Stand.

651
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,820
AskDrHowell.com.

652
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,620
The dismal, bleak world now, thanks to types like him.

653
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,360
Claims by terrified villagers in Tura, India,

654
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,920
that Bigfoot-type hairy giants are roaming the jungles of India's north, remote east,

655
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,180
have prompted authorities to order an investigation, a local official said.

656
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,140
Bizarre sightings have been made in the Garo Hills area of Meghalaya State,

657
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,700
close to the borders of Bangladesh and Bhutan,

658
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,220
with villagers calling the mysterious creature Mandiburung,

659
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,400
or Jungleman,

660
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,360
This is the Yeti, my friends.

661
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,100
Wildlife officials will conduct a study to check the truth.

662
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,180
The creatures have apparently been talked about,

663
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,500
and are occasionally spotted.

664
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,320
And sometimes striped, saying they've been shaven.

665
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,860
Oh, look, the villagers are excited, and running around in circles with torches.

666
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:44,600
One local farmer, Wally Smegma, said he'd seen an entire family of the creatures.

667
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,500
Possibly a lowland relative of the Himalayan Yeti,

668
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,560
a cousin of the North American Bigfoot or Sasquatch,

669
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,800
and an ancestor of Australia's Yowie,

670
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,320
and the American subgenius.

671
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,880
I saw him over there by my backyard.

672
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,840
I was cleaning the swimming sump,

673
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,000
and I noticed a little missus put on some barbecued fish on the cube.

674
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,360
And next thing you know, there he was standing.

675
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,140
The four of them quietly vanished in the undergrowth.

676
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,220
The group claims to have hair samples of the creature taken from the forest,

677
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,280
and will send them to DNA for testing.

678
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,520
But friends...

679
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,520
We have a DNA swab of his cubit.

680
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,120
Friends, the Bigfoot lives right among us, even now.

681
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,140
Listen, Vicky.

682
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,620
Right in this room are two of them.

683
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,880
I'm not going to say which.

684
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:26,460
Which?

685
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,540
Well, one of them is a witch from outer space,

686
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,280
and there are two Bigfeet.

687
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,740
And one's a Yeti.

688
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,060
Ug and Ort continued their rampage through the city.

689
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:43,440
The discussion of the Yeti's den does not include their strange genealogy.

690
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,100
Where they sprang from, where they came from,

691
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:51,520
why their DNA went that way instead of this.

692
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,700
Understandable.

693
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:58,700
So now, we would like you to thoroughly retell the story we have hired to say and not apron it.

694
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:07,040
We give you the following days of news on All Thatarded.

695
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,040
!

696
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,620
So, what's going on there?

697
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:08,620


698
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:08,620


699
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:20,320
We're история people.

700
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,460
at Brushwood Folklore Center.

701
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,880
Something started pulling me towards the front of my tent

702
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,180
and tried to pull me out,

703
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,080
she told the Express Times of Sherman.

704
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,900
Keats of Franklin Township, New Jersey,

705
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,080
and the other hot and naked girls in the tent

706
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,940
screamed for help.

707
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,480
Ivan Stang then loaded the girls,

708
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,460
about 15 of them, into a van

709
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,680
and took them into the camp's mess hall

710
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,440
where they made another mess.

711
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,460
Potter Nostril, chief executive officer

712
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,280
of the subgenius of Western New York,

713
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,040
said the camp will not allow

714
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,340
naked subgenius girls to sleep in tents

715
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,560
this coming weekend or X-Day weekend.

716
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,980
Campers and adult leaders get bear education

717
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,240
when they register for the camp, he said.

718
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,060
Bears are a fact of life here, Nostril said.

719
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,520
We're living in their habitat.

720
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,440
Thank you, thank you very much.

721
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,800
Now, you read about an actual experiment

722
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,320
that went awry.

723
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,880
A bear and a pagan,

724
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,820
and I assume an ass,

725
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,480
were somehow pre-concabulated

726
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,120
and constructed into one being.

727
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,540
And they attacked this poor woman

728
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,180
in the very same place

729
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,340
you're going to lead them off into the cosmos.

730
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,000
Yes, we're all going there

731
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,780
to Brushwood Folklore Center

732
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,740
to have the party.

733
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,420
That was Dr. Dark who released that news report,

734
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,040
by the way.

735
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,800
Dr. Dark will be showing his all-night

736
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,980
horror movie.

737
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,900
You'll see his feasts on Wednesday and Thursday

738
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,020
at the great festival.

739
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,540
Actually, actually, look, look, there.

740
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,080
There he is, that's Dr. Dark himself.

741
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,780
He's a bear pagan.

742
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,940
Well, so much for introductions

743
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,720
of invisible space monsters.

744
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,140
What's the real esoteric core

745
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,080
of your religious cult?

746
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,740
Dr. Reverend Mr. Man.

747
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,480
We're into slack.

748
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,460
It's a slacker.

749
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,300
It's a slacker cult.

750
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,360
And what exactly?

751
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,100
Slacker. We're slikers.

752
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,880
So what does that entail or include?

753
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,820
A slacker tail trail.

754
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,820
Is it a sort of an encumbrance

755
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,220
you have to wear?

756
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,560
You're just going to have to follow Bob

757
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,260
and follow Bob's trail and find out, my friend.

758
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,120
Does he leave droppings we can follow?

759
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:44,760
Yes, he does.

760
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,040
He leaves cotter pins

761
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,060
and jellies.

762
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,260
Jello, wherever he has been.

763
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,280
Did you know that, Dave?

764
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,260
Well, I didn't know.

765
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,520
Did you know that legend of Bob?

766
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,600
It's not just an urban myth.

767
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,660
Wherever Bob goes, he leaves...

768
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,980
He poops out cotter pins and urban legends.

769
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,900
No, he carries cotter pins with him.

770
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,560
And we're not sure where the jello comes from.

771
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,460
Well, I thought those were the hand grenades.

772
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,240
The cotter pins came from the hand grenades.

773
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,060
And, of course, the jello came from the excitement

774
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:14,560
and the gel that is naturally made

775
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,740
in anybody's alien latent vertebrae.

776
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,780
Once they're excited.

777
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,300
Well, people get excited about Bob.

778
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,080
Yeah, they do.

779
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,560
That leads me into this other phone call

780
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,440
that I played you guys earlier.

781
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,880
Well, he definitely has a leaky vertebrae, that guy.

782
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,260
Okay, now listen to this guy, you guys.

783
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,340
Okay, you guys, now listen to this guy.

784
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,900
This guy called right after that other guy.

785
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:39,440
Oh.

786
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,160
Hello?

787
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,080
Um...

788
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,080
I...

789
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,320
I...

790
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,900
I...

791
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,100
I...

792
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,660
I, um...

793
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,160
I was calling Matt.

794
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,320
I told him I got the, um...

795
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,340
Telephone number.

796
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,120
Talking about, um...

797
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,720
The slack job.

798
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,160
The, um...

799
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,100
Um...

800
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,840
The Slager Church.

801
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:22,480
Or something.

802
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:23,760
Matt.

803
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,320
In Ohio.

804
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,180
And I wanted to get more information.

805
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,100
Friends, you can get that information

806
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,860
from subgenius.com.

807
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,020
Oh, my God.

808
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,100
The Slager Church.

809
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,800
Now, that's a subgenius.

810
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,320
I can tell.

811
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,560
I can whiff-read as I held my hand

812
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,420
over the official office answer machine.

813
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,460
Um...

814
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:46,620
Uh...

815
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,340
Fax machine.

816
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:51,460
I could feel the subgeniusness glowing from it.

817
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:51,780
From...

818
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,120
Just from the digital recording.

819
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,740
You didn't even need the third nostril to sniff it.

820
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,840
You just sort of, um...

821
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,120
You just put your hand out and...

822
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:58,480
You could tell.

823
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,260
He was like a brother of the Yeti.

824
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,760
I think that guy...

825
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,620
I'm just gonna say one thing.

826
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,220
I think that guy had heard of the Shakers in Ohio in the 1800s.

827
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,360
And somehow...

828
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,400
So it was the Slakers.

829
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,660
Transposed the Slakers with slack.

830
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,220
Yeah.

831
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,540
And then slack-jawed.

832
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,140
And, uh...

833
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:12,820
Well, I don't know.

834
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,220
We're the Thirst Slakers.

835
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,240
I'd just like to know how his breath...

836
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,760
His breath didn't melt the phone that he was...

837
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,160
Bob's Beer God doesn't give you bad breath.

838
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,420
That's a special beer.

839
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,440
Boy, I like those long...

840
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,120
The thirst...

841
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,640
Oh, I can't say the tagline.

842
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,380
No, you can't.

843
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,260
Is it a poignant pause or is it a filth word?

844
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,540
It's a filth word.

845
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,340
That's why Bob's Beer God didn't sell real well.

846
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,740
Because he insisted on using this really vulgar tagline.

847
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,880
It was the Thirst Blank.

848
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,200
The Thirst Raper, let's say.

849
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,140
Well, the...

850
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:47,700
Now, the...

851
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,540
Bob's Beer God.

852
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,360
It was really not bad beer.

853
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,520
That you...

854
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,480
So as people...

855
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,620
For a fluke.

856
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,540
It wasn't around for long.

857
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,160
It was around Louisiana and Texas.

858
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:56,800
For a fluke.

859
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,780
They sold it in the 50s.

860
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,720
Oh, it was real beer?

861
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,180
Yeah.

862
00:34:59,300 --> 00:34:59,620
Oh, wow.

863
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,360
Bob's Beer God.

864
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,840
It was one of his frivolous business things where he thought...

865
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,220
Just kind of a...

866
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,060
They used this dirty word in the ads that it would sell.

867
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,780
And, of course, he was ahead of his time.

868
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,060
Nowadays, that's how you sell stuff.

869
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,160
Well, that's what deconstruction is based on, is the sexuality of the paranormal.

870
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:17,220
Right.

871
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:17,220


872
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:17,220


873
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:17,220


874
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:17,680
Normal peoples.

875
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,500
But he...

876
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,820
This was in the 50s, though.

877
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,800
That was the problem.

878
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,560
Bob was a bit ahead of...

879
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,020
He was a head, a logo head of his time.

880
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:27,620
And he had a little...

881
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,560
The late 50s, early 60s.

882
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,340
A little teeny head growing out of his head.

883
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:30,600
To now.

884
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,040
Sometimes.

885
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,940
Yes, he had a tiny head growing out of his head.

886
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,280
That's...

887
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,840
That was another thing people didn't know.

888
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,360
That there was a parasitical twin.

889
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,620
Not his evil twin brother, Dick.

890
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:46,160
But a parasitical twin attached to Bob on the back of his head that was a tiny...

891
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,320
Gibbering Bob head.

892
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,920
That had no intelligence.

893
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,720
Some people think that that's the lucky one.

894
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,280
A make.

895
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,900
The Bob we see is the one controlled by the alien pipe thing.

896
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:03,820
And the one, the tiny parasitical Bob head hanging out the back of his neck, like a wart...

897
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,540
Is the speaker.

898
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:09,060
Is the lucky, the luck, the fulcrum of the luck plane of the universe.

899
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,100
And also the driver of the head that it's the parasitic host body of on.

900
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:13,860
Right.

901
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,740
In other words, Bob is the devil.

902
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,840
And the little tiny Bob is the angel.

903
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,080
The devil is the main one that we see.

904
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,600
And the angel is just a tiny thing that gives him superpowers.

905
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,820
That's just a theory, though.

906
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,320
That is just so messed up.

907
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:27,940
It's just a theory.

908
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:33,360
We don't want to get off into some theological discussion with our radio audience.

909
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,220
Who I'm sure wants to hear rock and roll music.

910
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,580
Or some kind of rap music.

911
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,380
Or folk songs.

912
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,720
Or some kind of secular material.

913
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,060
We have Bob.

914
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,160
Beautiful Bob songs here, as always.

915
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,460
I remember those when I was little.

916
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:56,120
When my false surrogate parents, they weren't my false surrogate parents.

917
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,180
They were my false false parents.

918
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:01,580
But my first surrogate parents used to take me to the fulcrum, they called it.

919
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,820
It was in the annual anal individual hang.

920
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,060
And Bob was everywhere.

921
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:14,500
And, you know, as sort of an encumberant being, he can focus and refocus himself as many places as he feels like it.

922
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,960
At whatever moment.

923
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,480
And, man, that's what I remember.

924
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,280
The old songs.

925
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:22,380
And then the stink mice.

926
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,060
They were called sometimes the rebel, the sky, the priest, or whatever.

927
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:28,080
You know, they would lead the choruses.

928
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,120
Peter's your grandpa.

929
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,660
Oblake effusions.

930
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,060
They'd get bigger and fatter sometimes.

931
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,740
And I'd just sit back and look at the crows.

932
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,160
They were amazing.

933
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:37,740
I am.

934
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,040
I am Mazel Tov.

935
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,440
Oy.

936
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,980
I'm just, I'm just Kvali.

937
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,220
I'm over your talent.

938
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,060
Oh, it's one of the cathartic trappers.

939
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,940
That's Pisces and Carter.

940
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,460
At X Day, last year, 9X Day.

941
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,740
This one's about fish, I think.

942
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,300
Yes, dear friends.

943
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,160
Actually, I think this in the background is the Kirkendall Void.

944
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,020
Well, there you go.

945
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,640
And that's, see, we're back to that again.

946
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,640
Well, these, these, this, these guys are exciting to me.

947
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,700
I enjoy their.

948
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,660
They couldn't make it to X Day, by the way.

949
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,320
Oh.

950
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,020
Did they forget?

951
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:16,140
I don't know.

952
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,580
Did I try to get them, and they can't make it.

953
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:24,840
But the Bonobo Convergence, and of course, the amino acids.

954
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:31,980
The greatest earth-shattering volcanic band of them all.

955
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,360
A band that is like hot lava in your ear bones.

956
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,600
A band that is like knives in your ears.

957
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,260
It's cool, man.

958
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:40,840
Cool.

959
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:45,740
And don't forget to tell them how wonderful I'm going to be if I,

960
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,340
That's right.

961
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:50,540
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and the Underworlds will be there.

962
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,440
The Underworlders.

963
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:52,460
Sure.

964
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,260
It's worth two S's.

965
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,300
The Underworlders.

966
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,620
The Underworlders.

967
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,140
Yes.

968
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,560
That's not a bad name, since we just made it up.

969
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,240
Well, especially when you kind of spell the S's on the end.

970
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,140
We don't actually know who the band will be.

971
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:11,780
But you will be able to see their skeleton heads in luminous, numinous paint colors.

972
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:12,240
Yeah.

973
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,140
And the Weardens.

974
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,060
The Weardens are the featured act of the Chronic Palace.

975
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,800
And Papa Joe Mama.

976
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,020
Remember Papa Joe Mama?

977
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,560
Well, Father Joe Mama.

978
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,120
He ended up with the nickname Papa Joe Mama.

979
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,280
A great subgenius preacher.

980
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,660
He sometimes dresses as a woman.

981
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,020
That's what you don't want to miss.

982
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,600
And Dr. Howell, the great doctor.

983
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,380
Many called the intelligent subgenius.

984
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:43,360
He's kind of an oxymoron for a bunch of morons.

985
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,640
But you know what?

986
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,980
I mean, he's the subgenius with the vocabulary.

987
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:49,880
Yeah.

988
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,420
And the memory.

989
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,340
And the charm.

990
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,820
And the class.

991
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,240
And everything else.

992
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:55,960
And the high heels.

993
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,040
And the doctor belts.

994
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:04,280
In fact, the next three shows will be dominated by Dr. Howell and Philo.

995
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,360
The busier son.

996
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:12,220
Friends, let's go back in time just briefly and see something.

997
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,240
I don't know what.

998
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,300
Let's take a look at something.

999
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,000
Back off a mountain.

1000
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,700
The future is always nonsense.

1001
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,820
Until it becomes the past.

1002
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,860
I'm sorry, but you see, it is my curse to tell the absolute truth.

1003
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,980
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1004
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,720
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1005
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,780
Bob is a rock.

1006
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,480
Bob is a tree.

1007
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:51,200
Bob is you and Bob is me.

1008
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,860
Bob is a football.

1009
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,020
Bob is a basketball.

1010
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,080
Bob is a rugby ball.

1011
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,340
And Bob is a golf ball.

1012
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,700
By gobs.

1013
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,220
Huh?

1014
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:11,920
Yeah.

1015
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,640
Sure.

1016
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,340
By gobs, that man is crazy.

1017
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:15,720
I'm not crazy.

1018
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,780
You mean old scorpion?

1019
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,920
By gobs, he stole my gun.

1020
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,120
Ooh, you!

1021
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:21,540
By gobs, he stole my gun.

1022
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,660
Why you got tough, I'm Greg Vape!

1023
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,900
I sing now!

1024
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:25,780
Please go on, I'll tell you later

1025
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,080
I got a big fat squid in my refrigerator

1026
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:29,340
Ooh!

1027
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:30,920
Ooh!

1028
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,200
I got a big fat squid in my refrigerator

1029
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:35,540
Ooh!

1030
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,000
Ooh!

1031
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:37,580
Ooh!

1032
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,520
In the frozen food

1033
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,600
I found him in the frozen food

1034
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,740
And got him five new pairs of shoes

1035
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,720
And now he lives in the frozen school

1036
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:45,720


1037
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:45,720


1038
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,000
The Refrigerator

1039
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,960
Ooooooooh, ooooh, ooooh

1040
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,160
I bought him for 99 cents a pound

1041
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,020
Ooooooh, shup, shup

1042
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:59,360
He cost $45, weighs 35 pounds

1043
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,720
Ooooooooh, wop, wop

1044
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,860
I'm the cutest ape in the neighborhood

1045
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,200
But my girlfriend treats me no good

1046
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,220
I know she'd leave me if she could

1047
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,960
Take the big fat squid in my refrigerator

1048
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,260
Ooooooh

1049
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,940
That was Brack of Space Ghost

1050
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:28,840
Before that, Glass Madness sang Bob is a Rock

1051
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:32,380
And now, Lee Muirs, Be Orphit, Lee Not

1052
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,300
Truth is fiction

1053
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:37,560
This is Be Orphit, Lee Not

1054
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:48,200
W.M. Wood of Eastland, Texas placed Old Rip, a horned toad, in the cornerstone of the courthouse in 1897

1055
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,820
And took it out in 1928

1056
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,740
Be Orphit, Lee Not

1057
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:56,380
In a moment, I'll tell you about a dead horned toad

1058
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:00,860
That being the last of its kind, the manufacturer had it insured for $25

1059
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,820
Be Orphit, Lee Not

1060
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,400
Bad news travels fast

1061
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,020
Everyone on Earth would know about it by morning

1062
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,200
Be Orphit, Lee Not

1063
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,120
Be Orphit, Lee Not

1064
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:17,560
Be Orphit, Lee Not

1065
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,980
Supercar

1066
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:21,460
Supercar

1067
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,000
With beauty and grace, fastest can be

1068
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,500
Watch it flying through the air

1069
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,600
It travels in space or under the sea

1070
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,800
And it can journey anywhere

1071
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,180
Supercar

1072
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:38,440
Supercar

1073
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:43,060
It travels on land or roams the skies

1074
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:45,460
Through the heavens' mighty rage

1075
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,680
It's Mercury, man, and everyone cries

1076
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,380
It's the marvel of the age

1077
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,920
Supercar

1078
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:55,980
Supercar

1079
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,600
Supercar

1080
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,080
Supercar

1081
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,160
Supercar

1082
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,540
Wow, baby

1083
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,440
Step into the driver's seat today

1084
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,440
And feel the luxurious

1085
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:11,690
Feeling of feeling a luxurious feeling

1086
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:16,570
As you whippy-dippy-doo-dah along ninety mile an hour

1087
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,770
Through the streets and byways and superhighways

1088
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:23,710
Of magnificent new febrile America

1089
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:26,090
You're smokin' hot

1090
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:27,630
In fact, you're invisible

1091
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:28,810
Your eyes are burning

1092
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:31,250
There's smoke coming out of your ears now

1093
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:33,930
In fact, that car's on fire

1094
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:37,750
In fact, that car's been rendered harmless by fire

1095
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:38,490
The supercar

1096
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:39,430
That's right

1097
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:42,190
Exes, extraterrestrials

1098
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:43,870
Supercar

1099
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:45,150
What? What? What?

1100
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:49,830
What, I was driving along Route 66

1101
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:51,850
I was going to the Navajo Diner

1102
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:53,830
To have a barbecued sandwich

1103
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:55,770
And the flapjack soft taco

1104
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:59,470
And suddenly, everything is gone

1105
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:02,450
The Ferris wheel

1106
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:03,690
The plane

1107
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:06,130
The mountaineering boot

1108
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:06,910
The plane

1109
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:07,870
The plane. The goat.

1110
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:10,450
And everything around them.

1111
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:12,890
The plane.

1112
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:13,890
Totally gone?

1113
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:15,330
That's just what happened.

1114
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:16,150
Oh, my goodness.

1115
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:18,550
What was it, like a whiteout of snow?

1116
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:22,850
Well, they sent one of the guys from the government down to check it out,

1117
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:26,790
and he says the alien actually had a blue-skinned forehead.

1118
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:27,970
Oh, my goodness.

1119
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:29,050
Different than the other ones.

1120
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:31,570
The Indian's been poking with sticks for so long.

1121
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:36,250
Yeah, we had them underneath the bath and sink there for a while,

1122
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:39,070
and Mother says we have to take it out by the phosphate tank.

1123
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:40,250
I should think so.

1124
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:43,030
Yeah, that's where we're going to lay them down tomorrow night.

1125
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:45,710
We're tying them up real good, and the kids are coming over,

1126
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:46,610
and they're going to poke them.

1127
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:47,910
That's a good idea.

1128
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:49,270
I'm glad they're going to do that.

1129
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,490
That's a real, real good idea.

1130
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:52,350
We're not sure, but he had a pipe.

1131
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:57,970
Now, that guy, we had a restlet from his, I guess you could call it his hand.

1132
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:01,430
Anyone knows that.

1133
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:02,090
I can't read.

1134
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:02,830
It was you.

1135
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:03,670
I can't read.

1136
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:05,610
I can't read.

1137
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:08,550
Why are you guys reading porno over there?

1138
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:09,150
I can't read.

1139
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:18,090
This picture's reminding me of the days when I used to pick my own, so to speak.

1140
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:19,450
You know what I'm talking about?

1141
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:26,530
Dave and Princess Weir over here looking at this porno magazine called Yoga Journal.

1142
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:31,250
Princess Weir didn't want me to talk.

1143
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:34,490
She didn't want me to preach on pornography tonight.

1144
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:40,430
Princess Weir thought that a yoga journal was a nice PC,

1145
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:46,670
or as they say, politically correct magazine for young soccer moms,

1146
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:53,030
and new age ladies of the upper classes, mostly.

1147
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:59,210
Yes, I noticed there were pictures of Paris Hipton and the Sheraton twins were there.

1148
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:00,450
It teaches me.

1149
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:00,710
No.

1150
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:01,170
Mostly.

1151
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:05,770
This yoga journal is like a poser's hippie zine, you might say,

1152
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:09,610
because these are all the clean-cut sort of hippie chicks.

1153
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:12,070
Unjust accusations all.

1154
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:17,430
Well, let me say that you had to admit to me, Little Miss Weardo,

1155
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:23,930
that the magazine was in fact filled with near-pornographic-looking photographs

1156
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:29,450
of young women with their outthrust chests, most of them small-chested,

1157
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:30,950
and yet, albeit.

1158
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:38,450
They are outthrusting with their little yoga sports bras and such-like and whatnot,

1159
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:40,490
and so forth, and so on.

1160
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:42,370
Oh, bologna and cheese sandwiches.

1161
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:49,810
And yet, now it's full of this sort of consciousness and yoga enlightenment jargon,

1162
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:54,650
new-age-ish, new-world-ish, order-ish jargon,

1163
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:59,990
and yet, if you look at these women, which is 99% women,

1164
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:01,230
there are some young.

1165
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:07,250
They're hunks and look like a cover of a dang romance novel type of male models.

1166
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:10,910
And the middle-aged attorney who had a bum knee, but after his yoga practice, his knee is fine.

1167
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:14,690
Let's see some diversity for old white men.

1168
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:18,210
Excuse me, can I just interject one thing into this, family?

1169
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:21,830
Can I use the lounge, the staff lounge?

1170
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:22,830
Yes, you may go to the bathroom.

1171
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:24,570
And can I go on the couch?

1172
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:25,330
Yes.

1173
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:30,190
Now, in the meantime, about this pornography, this yoga journal, as we see.

1174
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:31,130
Now, what is it about?

1175
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:34,090
Why do I feel that this is a poser zine?

1176
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:38,610
Why do I consider this to be an orgy of poserism?

1177
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:47,690
Of wannabe hipsters and soccer moms pretending to be some kind of new-age hippie chick?

1178
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:51,910
And yet, look at their armpits.

1179
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:54,910
Look at the armpits in these pictures.

1180
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:59,510
Do you see an unshaved armpit once in yoga journal?

1181
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:05,430
Spirituality values relationships, August 2007.

1182
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:09,270
Do you see one hair-bespotted pit?

1183
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:11,270
No, nay ma'am, nay sir.

1184
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:16,170
I see nothing but shaved armpits, and that's how I know this is porno.

1185
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:24,270
Because it's porno for North American upper-class wimps that are afraid to buy real porno,

1186
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:31,110
such as buff, gent, jugs, and so forth, which come right out and admit in their editorials,

1187
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:31,830
and on the editorial front page,

1188
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:34,430
Boys, you're gonna love these plumpers.

1189
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:37,070
This is just the kind you like to you-know-what to.

1190
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:38,910
He is so mean.

1191
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:41,170
But this yoga journal, well, they have to...

1192
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:45,670
The ultimate pose to build core strength.

1193
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:46,770
Pose is right.

1194
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:51,490
And they call this empowerment for women, and yet they're all wearing makeup.

1195
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:53,630
They all have perfect skin.

1196
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:56,670
Do you see an old woman in here?

1197
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:59,290
Do you see a plain woman in here?

1198
00:49:59,310 --> 00:49:59,830
Yes.

1199
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:00,470
Yes.

1200
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:00,610
Yeah.

1201
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:05,270
Once in once every hundred pages of a yoga journal.

1202
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:11,110
This is my review of your so-called modern media yoga journal.

1203
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:13,190
He is just so dumb.

1204
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:24,010
The new age is a garbage pit of superstition and optimism, which is against Bob.

1205
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:26,090
It's just a vicious attack for no reason.

1206
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:27,150
It's just simply, it's pinkness.

1207
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,130
It's pinkness.

1208
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:29,390
I've saved...

1209
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:31,610
Get thee behind me, yoga journal.

1210
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:33,490
Shut up, pink boy, say I.

1211
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:38,370
Sting, I think perhaps some of those pictures would show you how to get behind yourself literally

1212
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:41,290
if you had the pants and the alacrity to do so.

1213
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:47,030
Now, could you please refrain from discussing this issue anymore?

1214
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:47,710
The one on the cover is kind of cute.

1215
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:49,190
I'm having a niptile erection.

1216
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:51,990
I'm feeling very lonesome, by the way.

1217
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:54,990
You know, we were talking about the search of a sub...

1218
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:58,530
Well, then you go look at the porno journal, yoga pornography.

1219
00:50:58,850 --> 00:50:59,290
I would prefer to talk about the arts.

1220
00:50:59,290 --> 00:50:59,810
I'm not saying it's for men.

1221
00:50:59,810 --> 00:50:59,950
It's for girls.

1222
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,650
I'm not saying it's for men.

1223
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:04,130
Men, wimpy men might like that kind of stuff.

1224
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:04,790
Oh, I would love it then.

1225
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:06,150
I didn't have any articles on, you know, the New York...

1226
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:08,790
Silly, silly men might like the girls in the yoga journal.

1227
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:11,530
Oh, look, there's pregnant women having enormous sex.

1228
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:13,670
No, that's Hustler you're thinking of, and that's...

1229
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:16,290
No, look, they actually had large objects.

1230
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:18,050
No, those are actually...

1231
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:23,490
Look at that, three beautiful blondes lined up to preach empowerment to plain women.

1232
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:28,330
If only you can be beautiful like us, then you can have spiritual happiness like us.

1233
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:29,330
Many of the transsexuals...

1234
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:31,110
It makes me sick!

1235
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:34,050
What's one of the mutant girls?

1236
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:37,450
How are they represented in this?

1237
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:38,510
They're in the magazine.

1238
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:40,990
You just didn't look closely enough, dear.

1239
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:45,170
I didn't have my magnifying glass with me to look at the micro dots, I guess.

1240
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:47,390
You're so full of bologna and cheese sandwiches.

1241
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:49,250
I said it before and I'll say it again.

1242
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:51,870
You're so nice, Princess Wee, but I'm not.

1243
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:57,610
Many of the transsexuals I've seen arguing with dumpsters, you know, safety devices and

1244
00:51:57,610 --> 00:51:58,310
stuff like that.

1245
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:58,310


1246
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:58,310


1247
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:58,310


1248
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:58,310


1249
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:58,310


1250
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:58,310


1251
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:58,310


1252
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:59,590
I mean, I'm not a big fan of the big-ass ones, but I do think that these people often

1253
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:06,230
get arrested and still, still, stillborn don't have to go through the same sort of occult

1254
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:10,050
effusion that you've just created with your big, fat lip.

1255
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:14,330
Another magazine that my beloved wife likes to subscribe to.

1256
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:14,810
Could you stop it, sir?

1257
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:16,190
The Utney Reader.

1258
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:17,750
Mm-hmm.

1259
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:24,090
Rush Leftball, as I believe you jokingly referred to it, but I know that you're just joking,

1260
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:27,650
Dave, because you don't see the evil of the smugness.

1261
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:29,470
I see the big picture, Stag.

1262
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:29,710
And then building up.

1263
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:34,830
You don't see the next Hitler building up in the New Age movement, like a...

1264
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:36,810
There's a new Hitler in the New Age movement?

1265
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:37,890
Oh, they're all Hitlers.

1266
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:39,190
Do any of them...

1267
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:40,450
Millions of little Hitlers.

1268
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:42,270
Okay, what are dues for something like this?

1269
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:45,590
Say opposed to the Church of the Subgenius, where, you know, you actually have to pay

1270
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:46,370
40 bucks.

1271
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:49,990
No, we are noble Mussolinis and Stalins, all of us.

1272
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:50,570
You'll take...

1273
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:52,430
No, none of these pathetic Hitlers for us.

1274
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:53,610
He was insane, crazy.

1275
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:56,690
Of course he was insane, crazy, but how much...

1276
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:57,590
He was not a great player.

1277
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:58,410
He was a great planner, like Stalin.

1278
00:52:58,630 --> 00:52:59,230
He was a great painter.

1279
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:00,990
Or a great lover, like Mussolini.

1280
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:02,450
He was a great house painter, though.

1281
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:03,370
Everyone knows that.

1282
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:04,030
He was.

1283
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:05,610
He was better than...

1284
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:07,870
His landscape's a lot better than mine, I'll give him that.

1285
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:08,070
Yep.

1286
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:09,970
He was a good landscaper, too.

1287
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:11,330
I don't know if we're...

1288
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:13,550
Landscraper is ultimately what they call it.

1289
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:14,790
Wait a minute, you're trying to get me off of...

1290
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:15,450
The rape of Europe.

1291
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:15,810
...off of...

1292
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:19,050
From preaching about pornography, because you people are into it.

1293
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:23,190
Well, you hate seeing women's clans being expanded, which is the wrong...

1294
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:24,730
No, I hate seeing them...

1295
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:25,010
...not long in yoga.

1296
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:27,570
...expanded in a wishy-washy way.

1297
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:27,570


1298
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:28,270
Look...

1299
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:29,590
Pretend, pose, or...

1300
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:30,950
Oh, let's just tease...

1301
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:31,770
Look, let's look at this picture.

1302
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:32,570
Let's just tease those...

1303
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:33,870
You can see her chink-lock.

1304
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:35,570
...closet lesbian soccer moms.

1305
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:39,650
I'm telling you, this is porno for closet lesbian soccer moms.

1306
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:42,150
I'm saying soccer mom, come out of the closet!

1307
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:44,590
Get down with it, baby!

1308
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:45,470
What the hell is he talking about?

1309
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:46,050
Be yourself!

1310
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:47,630
You are what you is!

1311
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:48,330
You're not even like this...

1312
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:49,890
Let Connie into your life!

1313
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:51,970
Let Bob expand your mind!

1314
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:52,870
...he can fix his neck.

1315
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:56,410
Don't just wallow in this halfway tease.

1316
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:57,550
I'm not...

1317
00:53:57,550 --> 00:53:58,770
Just get it...

1318
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:00,790
Go all the way, baby!

1319
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:03,210
He has no idea what this is.

1320
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:05,990
I'm talking to the down-home-for-real people!

1321
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:06,210
I don't think he did.

1322
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:06,670
I...

1323
00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:07,430
Dang.

1324
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:10,210
Your body is changing, man.

1325
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:10,610
These are all women here.

1326
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:11,730
You're gonna have to calm down.

1327
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:12,870
You're bright red.

1328
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:14,590
They're all making themselves feel better.

1329
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:15,930
Your left shoe exploded.

1330
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:17,050
What are we gonna do with that?

1331
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:17,990
They're gonna have to buy you another...

1332
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:24,790
Well, this may not go down well on the polished ears of the modernists and liberals, but I'm

1333
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:26,450
afraid that it has to be said.

1334
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:27,530
We're posting this on the internet.

1335
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:27,530


1336
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:27,530


1337
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:27,530


1338
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:27,530


1339
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:35,650
I'm tired of dead preachers preaching dead sermons to dead congregations in these living,

1340
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:37,010
dead end times.

1341
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:40,070
It's been the end times since I can remember.

1342
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:45,370
Since the beginning of civilization has been the end times, and nobody's picking up on

1343
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:45,590
it!

1344
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,010
I want you to repent!

1345
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:47,770
You just jumped on the carousel, eh?

1346
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:50,670
Quit your job and slack off while you still know how!

1347
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:52,230
Right this minute!

1348
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:52,830
Do it!

1349
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:53,170
The merry-go-round.

1350
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:54,090
A merry-go-round.

1351
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:57,310
That's what Stan's idea of reality is.

1352
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:57,510
God, oh my God.

1353
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:57,510


1354
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:57,510


1355
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:57,510


1356
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:57,510


1357
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:57,510


1358
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:57,510


1359
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:57,510


1360
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:00,490
A jump on the little horsey to the left...

1361
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:01,610
Get off your butt!

1362
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:06,890
Yank your bootstraps up on the table and run, baby!

1363
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:08,730
That actually hurt my neck hearing that.

1364
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:10,810
Pull your clothes off and show them!

1365
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:13,650
You don't need that chem can.

1366
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:17,750
You don't need to hide in a little closet.

1367
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:19,510
Claim that you followed them to the...

1368
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:21,150
What kind of a wuss are you?

1369
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:23,190
...hicky-dicky big-boy hot dog restaurant on...

1370
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:25,610
Now Dave's looking at the Yoga Journal.

1371
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:26,330
...porn.

1372
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:27,270
That's a small...

1373
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:34,170
Mom, I've just urinated on the soccer field and here comes Dad with the electrocutioners.

1374
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:40,830
You know, I don't know if any child or any other animic or animistic animal should be

1375
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:41,630
exposed to this.

1376
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:44,570
Some mammals might get sick.

1377
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:49,470
What did the Yoga Journal or Utney Reader ever do to you, Reverend Stan?

1378
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:52,790
Besides make you feel great and know how to make a great waltz or salad.

1379
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:53,330
Actually, we used to...

1380
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:57,350
I remember when the Utney Reader was a little zine like...

1381
00:55:57,350 --> 00:55:57,490
...a little...

1382
00:55:57,510 --> 00:56:00,470
...the Stark Fist of Removal and we used to trade with them.

1383
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:05,290
In fact, I probably wrote them up in High Weirdness by Mail back in the previous century.

1384
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:07,950
I probably said something nice about them, okay?

1385
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:09,630
See, he is not even loyal to his friends or enemies.

1386
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:17,830
But then, then they became a symbol of the pinkness of the Portlandian sort of pinkness.

1387
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:25,890
Oh, we know we're right and correct because we look at each other and nod and we all agree.

1388
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:30,850
So therefore, here in our Portland, Oregon coffee shop...

1389
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:31,630
Sting, I think that...

1390
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:38,210
...where in real life we have hairy armpits, but in our Yoga Journals, no, they're shaved! Shaved!

1391
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:40,350
Would you shave your prairie squid?

1392
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:42,710
I'm asking you that, David DeLuca.

1393
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:44,770
I'm asking you that, Princess Wiardo.

1394
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:46,370
Would you shave a prairie squid?

1395
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:46,950
I have. I have.

1396
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:49,850
I have shaven my squid in honor of Yoga Journal.

1397
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:50,290
I've seen it.

1398
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:54,350
Not only in honor, but as an obeisant offering to the fun.

1399
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:55,010
Oh, my.

1400
00:56:55,010 --> 00:57:00,370
Some women shave their armpits as a matter of comfort, Reverend Stang, not vanity.

1401
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:03,370
...to actually make the fuzz job.

1402
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:09,530
I believe it's a person should be adaptable and should adapt to new ways, but this is going too far.

1403
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,810
Some things are just over the line.

1404
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:16,750
What happened to decency? What happened to slackness?

1405
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:21,750
What happened to divine high unpredictability and abnormality?

1406
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:24,210
No, now it's all apologists.

1407
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:27,270
Oh, Mr. Normalman, he pays my check.

1408
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:31,610
He writes my paycheck, so I have to toe the line.

1409
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:36,310
I've got to play by the rules for Mr. Normalman.

1410
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:38,070
I'm sorry, but as Mr. and Mrs. Normalman...

1411
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:42,110
Oh, I have to be fashionable because Mr. Weirdman is doing the...

1412
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:46,070
He's shaving his head this year, so I'm going to have to shave my hair like Mr. Weirdman.

1413
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:46,870
He's fashionable.

1414
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:49,850
But where is subgeniusness, men?

1415
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:52,690
And subgeniusness...

1416
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:53,510
...is...

1417
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:56,170
Where is she in all of this?

1418
00:57:56,190 --> 00:58:02,210
With her hairy armpits and her hairy, strong, yeti legs...

1419
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:07,410
...and her strong, hairy chest of the subgenius conitite...

1420
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:14,310
...her bristling chest muscles of the conitite, the strong woman...

1421
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:18,910
Where is she to thrash me and beat me when I backtalk her?

1422
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:19,410
Eh?

1423
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:21,250
What is...

1424
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:21,510
...

1425
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:24,370
Are you going to be all right, Reverend Stang?

1426
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:30,610
Oh, uh, friends, uh, you're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, voice of the Church of the Subgenius.

1427
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:42,790
For more information on the Church of the Subgenius, uh, please write to, uh, Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118 or at subgenius.com on the World Wide Web.

1428
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:51,050
And thank you, Princess Wee and, uh, Dave and, uh, Dr. Sinister for waiting.

1429
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:52,890
It's a nasal thing, man.

1430
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:53,790
That's, uh...

1431
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:57,710
This year, about 30 Americans are tuning in to every episode of...

1432
00:58:57,710 --> 00:58:58,430
...Idle American...

1433
00:58:58,430 --> 00:58:59,330
...downright cruel...

1434
00:58:59,330 --> 00:58:59,870
...oppressive...

1435
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:00,830
...pop star wannabes...

1436
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:01,790
...pop star wannabes...

1437
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:02,670
...keep people watching...

1438
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:03,490
...Simon Cowell.

1439
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:11,510
Fox reportedly pays him more than $30 a year, and he gets another $38 annually, and he has no musical ability at all.

1440
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:12,750
Not...not badly.

1441
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:14,110
So what actually do you do?

1442
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:15,750
Guess, guess.

1443
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:17,290
Do you feel at all like a fraud?

1444
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:17,990
Absolutely.

1445
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:19,170
Untalented...

1446
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:20,190
...Simon Cowell stinks.

1447
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:23,190
And that's where Cowell comes in.

1448
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:23,730
Medieval.

1449
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:25,250
Medieval.

1450
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:25,590
Because.

1451
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:26,170
Yes.

1452
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:28,450
Gimmick.

1453
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:28,990
Make money.

1454
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:29,530
Make money.

1455
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:30,530
Yeah, why not?

1456
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:31,710
I couldn't care less.

1457
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:32,310
It's a business.

1458
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:33,870
McDonald's hamburgers.

1459
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:34,330
Terrible.

1460
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:34,990
Um...

1461
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:36,130
Medieval.

1462
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:36,950
I couldn't care less.

1463
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:37,590
It's a business.

1464
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:39,390
Thanks to Norrell.
