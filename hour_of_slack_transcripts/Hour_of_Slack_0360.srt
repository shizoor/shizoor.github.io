1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
Welcome to Difficult Listening Hour.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,460
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo!

3
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,280
And now, the subgenius hour.

4
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,420
Oh, God, it reeks.

5
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,980
And it's so impulsive if...

6
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,440
Atomic batteries to power.

7
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,040
Turbines to speed.

8
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,160
You're ready to move us.

9
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,700
I hear people talking bad about the way

10
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:29,980
they're living.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,620
They have to live here in this country.

12
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,180
Harping on the wars we fight.

13
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,380
Grappling about the way things ought to be.

14
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,040
I don't mind them switching sides

15
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,760
and standing up for things they believe in.

16
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,980
When they're running down a country man,

17
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,440
they're walking on the back side of me.

18
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,640
Hello.

19
00:01:59,680 --> 00:01:59,840
Hello.

20
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,680
Hello.

21
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:00,720
Vinnie.

22
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,160
What?

23
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,600
I told you to quit bothering me.

24
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,600
Well, I won't ask you something.

25
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,040
What?

26
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,220
What's that big old green truck doing out there

27
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,160
in front of the showroom?

28
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,800
Well, that ain't none of your business.

29
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,280
He did it.

30
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,700
You don't supposed to be parking on the street like that.

31
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,900
That ain't none of your business.

32
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,020
Don't worry about it.

33
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,460
Goddamn it.

34
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,160
Now, I've noticed...

35
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,020
Vinnie, I'm gonna tell...

36
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,120
I'm gonna tell the police to have them move that old truck.

37
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,640
You tell them that, then please do, will you?

38
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,680
Well, Pete, don't...

39
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,020
Now, I've noticed...

40
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,600
You should come see my new house this weekend.

41
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,980
Ain't you got nothing else to do?

42
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,880
What'd you come see my new house this weekend?

43
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,020
Where's your new house at?

44
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,180
You lied to me the other day, too, about something.

45
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:35,860
What?

46
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,280
You said you had tomatoes out of your garden.

47
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,820
You ain't done it.

48
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,980
I have.

49
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,420
What'd you lie to me for?

50
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,360
This fruit stand's my garden.

51
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,320
Huh?

52
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,840
Fruit stand's my garden.

53
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,840
Well, you got one on me there.

54
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,280
Yeah.

55
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:49,780
Goodbye.

56
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:50,800
Vinnie.

57
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,240
Now, what motive?

58
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,100
Vinnie, we...

59
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,520
I asked you, God, not to bother me.

60
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,680
I won't ask you something.

61
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,120
That's what you say every time you call.

62
00:02:59,380 --> 00:02:59,820
You said...

63
00:02:59,820 --> 00:02:59,960
You said...

64
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,420
You said...

65
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:00,560
No.

66
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,000
It ain't none of your business.

67
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,460
It's my love.

68
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,980
Well, Barney wanted me to keep an eye out for you.

69
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,200
What?

70
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,880
Barney, well, now, kid...

71
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,120
Vinnie.

72
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,640
Now, what motive?

73
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,960
Barney wanted me to look out...

74
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,800
Look, quit bothering me.

75
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,840
Listen, why don't you quit bothering me?

76
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,700
Where are you going to eat today?

77
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,840
None of your business.

78
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,200
I saw you the other day out there across the hospital,

79
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,020
got the little cafe.

80
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,620
Yeah, well, why don't you...

81
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,640
Why don't you let me know who you are and so forth?

82
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,980
You eat out there a lot.

83
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,080
None of your business.

84
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,800
Well, I saw you eating out there a little day.

85
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,220
Yeah.

86
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,420
Listen, listen.

87
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,500
Now, why ain't the hell can't you leave me alone?

88
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,160
They got pretty good food in there.

89
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,380
I don't know.

90
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,580
Why don't you go try it?

91
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,220
Well, I've eaten in there a time or two,

92
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,520
but it's been a long time ago.

93
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,220
Well, listen, quit bothering me, will you?

94
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,340
I don't want to hear from you,

95
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,740
and I don't give a damn about you.

96
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:48,820
What?

97
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,880
I hope that I see you.

98
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,000
You shouldn't have been drinking a beer out there.

99
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,560
I hope I can see you.

100
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,860
I drink beer when I get ready or everything else.

101
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,140
You don't want to drink a beer?

102
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,800
I do whatever I damn please.

103
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,180
It's nobody's business of mine.

104
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,240
It's the boss' business.

105
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,600
Damn, the boss and you, too.

106
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,960
Well, I wouldn't want to see you get fired, man.

107
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,100
Tell them that I'm been fired.

108
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,520
I've already told you.

109
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,920
It ain't none of your business if I do.

110
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,880
I work when I please.

111
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,400
I don't have to work all the time.

112
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,940
Well, do you drink beer every day and then?

113
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,960
No, hell no.

114
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,480
Well, you don't need to be drinking beer at dinner now.

115
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,020
You're kidding me.

116
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,680
Oh, yes, dear friends.

117
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,640
Oh, I love to hear that.

118
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:29,940
Oh, I love to hear that.

119
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:37,400
We're going to be doing a recording of poor old Benny getting harassed by Arnie.

120
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:45,460
And we'll be hearing other excerpts from that famous tape.

121
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,340
Because tonight we're going to, on the hour of slack on this religious broadcast,

122
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:58,640
we'll be listening to some of the subgenius preaching from the Subgenius World Convention in Chicago.

123
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,920
Oh, about three weeks.

124
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,240
Two weeks ago.

125
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:10,520
But also tonight I thought we would indulge in a short study in poebuckers through song and prank call.

126
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:20,280
The word poebucker may need some explaining to some of you people new to our religion.

127
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,400
Poebucker generally means a person with very low values.

128
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,400
Usually an ignorant type of person.

129
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,720
The common.

130
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,860
Image is of a person in a pickup truck.

131
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:40,740
Or a person, the kind of person with a pickup truck up on blocks in their front yard for five years.

132
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:47,400
I mean, it doesn't always mean poor, but just means trash.

133
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,520
Don't get me wrong.

134
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,800
I'm not saying anybody with a pickup truck.

135
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,400
You see, there's a lot of subgeniuses with pickup trucks.

136
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,760
There are many rich poebuckers for that matter.

137
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,600
A lot of subgeniuses.

138
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,920
Part poebucker.

139
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:08,860
I probably wouldn't talk the way I do if I wasn't that way somewhat myself, dear friends.

140
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,920
The term actually, many people figured what it meant.

141
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,980
Oh, that means a subgenius who's poor in bucks.

142
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,000
It's not.

143
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:22,060
It's a term that's a corruption of an African language word.

144
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,800
Booker or bookra.

145
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,340
Which meant boogeyman or demon.

146
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,920
And the African...

147
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:37,900
The African slaves brought to America, some of them called white people bookers or buckra.

148
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,820
And white trash, therefore, were called poor buckra or poebuckers.

149
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,340
Which is how my dad's family used to pronounce it.

150
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:58,200
And these famous telephone experiments would have to be a big part of any study of the rich texture of poebucker life.

151
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,900
The tapes of Arnie.

152
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,980
His many calls to Benny.

153
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,400
Benny Garrick.

154
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,560
At Al White Motors.

155
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:15,520
Now, and Al White Motors is in Tallahoma, Tennessee, I believe.

156
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,500
Near Nashville.

157
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,780
Benny was harassed by these calls for like three years.

158
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,260
And he recently died.

159
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,560
In fact, Benny died just in July.

160
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,640
We have a copy.

161
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,620
Of his obituary from the newspaper.

162
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:41,400
Now, why would we know so much about the people on this prank call tape?

163
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,580
Well, we were that curious.

164
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:52,840
And one who was even more curious was your fellow subgenius minister and scientist, Reverend Lou Minotti.

165
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,960
Who recently moved to Nashville and discovered a lot about these prank calls.

166
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,220
For one thing.

167
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,680
And another thing.

168
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,520
Arnie worked in the same building as Al White Motors.

169
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,920
In the Al White Motors building.

170
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,360
He worked in the parts room.

171
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,040
And Benny worked in the showroom.

172
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,020
When Arnie was making these calls to Benny.

173
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,460
He could see Benny.

174
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,480
And Benny knew the person who was playing Arnie.

175
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,240
Arnie was one of several aliases.

176
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,920
Another one was Roscoe.

177
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,220
And the.

178
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,040
Ah.

179
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,680
It's just inc.

180
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,820
Well, I think we should get back into these tapes.

181
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,520
And I'll tell you a little bit more that's even more frightening.

182
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,860
About the incredible Arnie and Barney and Benny.

183
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:40,520
Huh.

184
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,640
Tapes.

185
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,400
After this message.

186
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,600
Friends between us is not very far.

187
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,280
Oh Lord!

188
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,360
I'm giving my love to you.

189
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,880
Cause I only want.

190
00:08:59,880 --> 00:08:59,880


191
00:08:59,880 --> 00:08:59,880


192
00:08:59,880 --> 00:08:59,880


193
00:08:59,880 --> 00:08:59,880


194
00:08:59,880 --> 00:08:59,880


195
00:08:59,880 --> 00:08:59,880


196
00:08:59,880 --> 00:08:59,880


197
00:08:59,880 --> 00:08:59,880


198
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,360
To see you smile.

199
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,400
You got nothing to lose.

200
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,360
But a failure to choose.

201
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,200
And you're turning into somebody new.

202
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,540
Mean one.

203
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,520
Oh no.

204
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,600
Give a dog a bone.

205
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,480
Don't come thinking through the door.

206
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,700
You won't forget us.

207
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,200
Cause we were my legends.

208
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,320
We loved you.

209
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,960
Come on.

210
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:24,960
Get more.

211
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,200
More.

212
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,640
More.

213
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:26,940


214
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,040


215
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,460
More.

216
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,520
More.

217
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:29,860


218
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:29,860


219
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:29,860


220
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:29,860


221
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:29,860


222
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:29,860


223
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,580
One more time.

224
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,020
TooEngine.

225
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,020


226
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,020


227
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,020


228
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,020


229
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,020


230
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,020


231
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,020


232
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,020


233
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,020


234
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,020


235
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,020


236
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,020


237
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,020


238
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,020


239
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,040
You had a pap Vou.

240
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,040


241
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,040


242
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,040


243
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,040


244
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:32,820
You may.

245
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,620
Play these.

246
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,700
unlimited.

247
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,000
Whether their medical.

248
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,560
やキャベ legen다 m Particularly.

249
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:51,820
Every degree.

250
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,900
Even all.

251
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:57,440
He stuck that gun into his ribs and said, here's looking at you, kid.

252
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,540
Ruby killed Lee Harvey.

253
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,260
TV proved he did.

254
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:11,240
And he thought he was a friend of mine.

255
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,120
A very good friend.

256
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,160
Leave me alone.

257
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,660
How about it?

258
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,360
Eddie?

259
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:18,920
Yeah?

260
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,860
Where's your car at?

261
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,840
None of your business.

262
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,520
You know it's raining this morning?

263
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,720
I know, is it?

264
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,840
Sure is.

265
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,640
Well, I'll be damned.

266
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,560
I can't see that.

267
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,000
You can't see.

268
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:27,960
You have to tell me that.

269
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:28,660
I didn't know.

270
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,640
You knew it was raining.

271
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,700
No, I didn't know it.

272
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,740
Well, guess what happened?

273
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,300
Well, I don't care what happened.

274
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:33,580
What?

275
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,360
Mondale picked a woman for his running mate.

276
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:36,860
Who?

277
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:37,940
Mondale.

278
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:38,720
That's good.

279
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,320
He picked a woman for his running mate.

280
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,760
That's good.

281
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,720
Guess what else happened?

282
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,600
What?

283
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,240
The boss man went up on my house rent.

284
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,320
I'm going to have to move out.

285
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,060
Well, good.

286
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,280
I've been wondering.

287
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,720
Move out in the damn world.

288
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,500
I wondered if you could find me a place up there close to Fort Boyce, South Korea.

289
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,600
Get out of the state.

290
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,420
Excuse me.

291
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:56,940
Goodbye.

292
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,660
Eddie?

293
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,280
How are you, brother?

294
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:07,900
Eddie?

295
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,520
Why don't you leave me alone?

296
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,020
I'm busy.

297
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,740
Barney said you used to have some rent.

298
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,420
Leave me alone.

299
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:12,900
I'm busy.

300
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,180
Bye.

301
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:13,800
You got it.

302
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,900
And the beat goes on.

303
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,660
The beat goes on.

304
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,340
We became friends.

305
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:44,100
How about that?

306
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,100


307
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,100


308
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,320
Go ahead.

309
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:44,460


310
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:44,820
Bye bye.

311
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,180
Bye.

312
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,720
Bye bye.

313
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,140
I say there's free instructions for everybody on karate,

314
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,560
sabotage, anarchism, everything there could be.

315
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,320
I say there's free lessons from the time of you two

316
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,960
on how to do everything there is potentially to kill another person.

317
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,800
There's no hope for humanity anyway.

318
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,920
I'm just going to watch the world end.

319
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,440
You're going to make a million dollars.

320
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,020
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

321
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,040
Praise Bob!

322
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,340
Praise Bob!

323
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,140
Somebody help!

324
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,240
Somebody help me!

325
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,400
Hey!

326
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,860
Now what, Moses?

327
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,980
Listen, buzzard breath, why don't you talk to me a minute?

328
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,060
Why don't you go to hell?

329
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,120
What's my brother been telling me? Is that true?

330
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,960
Well, listen, I don't even believe you got a brother.

331
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,200
Well, he said he used to be lovers over here.

332
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,200
Go ahead, go to hell.

333
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:43,840
Hello?

334
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,580
Benny, why don't you park up next to this car store?

335
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,140
What?

336
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,360
Why don't you park up next to the building for a while?

337
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,800
Why don't you tell me you're on business?

338
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,560
Hey, Benny.

339
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:51,780
What?

340
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,180
Benny, I'm on the phone, too. I'm Arnie.

341
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,040
Hey, Arnie.

342
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,840
I'm Barney.

343
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,120
I'm Arnie, too.

344
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,360
I'm Barney, Benny.

345
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:57,740
Yeah.

346
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,740
We're all together.

347
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,600
Good.

348
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,700
We're going to get together tonight, Benny.

349
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,520
I can't.

350
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:02,900
Why?

351
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,660
Because I said I can't.

352
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,740
We're going to have a good time.

353
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,360
Mm-hmm.

354
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,240
I'll do the cooking, Benny.

355
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,440
Yeah, you'll do the what?

356
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,460
I'll do the cooking.

357
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,940
I'm down for all of you in here.

358
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,380
Oh, Benny, you'd like it if you ever got it, Jim.

359
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,060
You will do it?

360
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,380
Yeah.

361
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:15,700
Hey, Benny.

362
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,380
Yeah?

363
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,220
I wish you would do something for me.

364
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:18,560
What's that?

365
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,460
I wish you wouldn't worry my brother about his boy

366
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,500
got killed over in Vietnam.

367
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,920
Well, I can't hear it, Benny.

368
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,280
But he told me you aggravated him.

369
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,520
I wish you'd quit worrying me.

370
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,240
We ain't trying to worry you.

371
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,200
Yes, you are, too.

372
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,740
I mean, we won't be your friends.

373
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,320
Well, come on up down and meet me

374
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,940
and let me see if I can be a friend to you.

375
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,220
Well, I don't care if I miss you,

376
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,120
but Barney says he don't want nothing to do with you.

377
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:36,900
Well, I don't care.

378
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,040
I don't want nothing to do with him, then.

379
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,000
Benny, you hit me in the head.

380
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,160
That's the way he feels about it.

381
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,780
You hit me in the head, Benny.

382
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,080
Well, you asked for it, didn't you?

383
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,220
No, Benny, I was mad at my own business.

384
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,440
You told me you asked for it.

385
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,600
You was after my woman.

386
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,440
Oh, boy.

387
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,560
Yeah, you was.

388
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,860
I know that's a lie.

389
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,660
But, Benny, it still hurts.

390
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,040
Well, I can't help it.

391
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,320
Benny was bad after women back in them days.

392
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,140
I know it.

393
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,820
Back during Count Forrest's ducky.

394
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,740
Now, who are you?

395
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,440
Benny, you was like a little old rooster.

396
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,580
I asked you, who are you?

397
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,140
I'm Arnie.

398
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:04,860
I'm Barney.

399
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,420
Yeah?

400
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,880
I'm Arnie, and he's Barney.

401
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,640
Well, both of you.

402
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,560
And you're Benny.

403
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,720
Now, isn't that funny?

404
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,320
Yeah.

405
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,240
Isn't that funny?

406
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:15,620
Yeah.

407
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,320
I'm glad you're getting a kick out of that.

408
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,900
Would you go to hell?

409
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,000
Oh, dear friends.

410
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:28,000
Just an amazing, unusually long segment there.

411
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,880
Although, after three years of calls like that,

412
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:38,340
Benny got to where he would get into long, sad discussions with Arnie.

413
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,660
Arnie would start claiming to be Benny.

414
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,060
Benny's son.

415
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,780
The bold surrealist, dear friends, Arnie Swenson.

416
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,320
Praise Arnie Swenson.

417
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,820
Now, what makes the whole thing even more surreal

418
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:03,720
is that everyone at Al White Motors knew who was pestering Benny.

419
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,060
Everyone in town knew.

420
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,080
The DA knew.

421
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,080
The sheriff knew.

422
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,540
Everybody but Benny.

423
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,000
They knew.

424
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,460
And people all over town served as Arnie's eyes.

425
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:21,840
Arnie could follow Benny around and know what he'd been doing at odd times of his life.

426
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,640
And just as Lois Lane never caught on about Clark Kent,

427
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,880
somehow Benny never made the connection.

428
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,260
Arnie did some spectacular things that aren't on tape.

429
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:40,640
At one point, he bought a broadcast microphone and set Benny's radio,

430
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:45,160
before he came into work, to the frequency that that little mic would broadcast on.

431
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:50,100
So when Benny sat down with his cup of coffee and his cigarette to start the day,

432
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,800
he turned on the radio and there was Arnie going,

433
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,460
Benny!

434
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,380
Benny, how come you parked your green truck over there by the fire hydrant?

435
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,740
And Benny, Arnie could, as I said, could see Benny when this was going on.

436
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,680
And Benny, when he did that, just reached over and turned it off.

437
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,340
That was all.

438
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,620
He didn't express any surprise that Arnie,

439
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,540
had even invaded the airwaves.

440
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,160
Because at that point, friends,

441
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:21,240
let's see, there was this network of spies, you see,

442
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,740
who, for instance, Arnie would keep tabs on Benny's movement, it says here,

443
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,880
and would call him at the barber shop and the liquor store, among other places.

444
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,900
Imagine, it would be as if,

445
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:40,240
well, as Lou explained to me, this is sort of like a crazed,

446
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,080
Andy of Mayberry scene.

447
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:47,200
It's like, what if Andy was secretly tormenting Barney Fife?

448
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,940
And everyone in town knew about it.

449
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,020
Floyd knew about it.

450
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,820
Goober knew.

451
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,940
Everybody knew.

452
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,620
And everyone except Barney.

453
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,340
It was like everyone had an evil side.

454
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:04,960
Anyway, I got a letter from Lou, who has some newly revealed background data pertinent to the Al White Motors saga.

455
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,960
And I know that many of my listeners wish they had this tape, but a lot of my listeners do have it.

456
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:16,280
It was a pledge giveaway in years past, and I know that we sent out dozens of them.

457
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,080
As Lou says here,

458
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:26,380
I have spoken to the individual at the firm who engaged in the protracted phone debate with Benny Garrick.

459
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,500
He actually spoke to Arnie.

460
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,180
I found him to be a warm-hearted, seemingly sincere soul,

461
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:37,200
who frankly spoke of his unique contribution to telephone research history.

462
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,020
Among the key findings,

463
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,420
Benny and Arnie were good friends before the calls commenced.

464
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,500
And even while the calls were going on, Arnie and Benny used to go fishing together.

465
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,260
Arnie speaks favorably of Benny today in the wake of his passing,

466
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,340
though he does admit that Benny had a stubborn streak and disliked anyone getting the best of it.

467
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:06,040
Arnie would make his calls early in the morning when both began work at Al White Motors.

468
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,620
Arnie would usually knock off by late morning,

469
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,940
then immediately walk away.

470
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:14,620
Benny would walk across the showroom and ask Benny who it was he'd been cussing out on the phone.

471
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,760
Can you imagine the gall to do that?

472
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,520
Approximately five hours of calls survive on tape.

473
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,680
We should be getting the complete series soon, but we won't play them all on the show.

474
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:36,480
Arnie reports that Garth Brooks, Clint Black, Chet Atkins, the governor of Tennessee, are among his fans.

475
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,920
Rumor has it that Senator Al Gore, the governor of Tennessee, is one of his fans.

476
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:39,920


477
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,480
Arnie also says that the governor of Tennessee is a big Arnie fan.

478
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:48,060
And Clint Black tried to give a copy to George Bush several years ago.

479
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:57,440
Now imagine how much better the country would be now if those bold Surrealists had indeed gotten through to them.

480
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,800
Dear friends.

481
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,600
A waitress asked me what we'd like to have.

482
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,180
And I said, I don't know where they are.

483
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,920
What would you suggest?

484
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,760
And she stood still.

485
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,760
She just kept staring at me.

486
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,300
And I started getting very nervous.

487
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:27,500
At the time, I had a beard and I lost a few pounds.

488
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:35,320
And I thought it would be very hard for anyone to recognize me.

489
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,860
This song is dedicated to Jesse Presley.

490
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:38,900


491
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:38,900


492
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,240
The aborted fetus twin brother of Elvis.

493
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,380
You can't arrest me, officer.

494
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,360
I'm not drunk.

495
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,400
I might be half-ass drunk though.

496
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:51,680
Whee!

497
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,120
Have a half-ass drunk.

498
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,020
Hell, you know who you are.

499
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,060
When you got a hangover and it's all hung over back.

500
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,200
Say to your girlfriend's car, have a half-ass drunk.

501
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,840
Just you and me.

502
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,280
Sergeant Carter haircut.

503
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,980
Gilmore Pyle hookup.

504
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,480
Living off of LSD.

505
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,060
Have a half-ass drunk.

506
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:38,900
This is a subject of the American Public.

507
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:38,900


508
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:38,900


509
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,780
And I'm feeling blue

510
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,220
Well a flood come in

511
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,640
And it washed away my den

512
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,660
And my water bill's still past due

513
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,020
Have a ass drunk

514
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,480
Called my boss

515
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,240
I ain't feeling quite right

516
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,720
Well it can't be Monday

517
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,100
Cause I don't remember Sunday

518
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,120
And my hands are sitting Saturday night

519
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,520
Sweet love song

520
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,140
Have a ass drunk

521
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,340
Hell I'm drunky

522
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,000
Well I used to have a job

523
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,320
But I'm sick of getting robbed

524
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,340
So I finally just up and quit

525
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,740
Mama had a fit

526
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,420
Have a ass drunk

527
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,200
Well my head feels odd

528
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,640
Well baby needs food

529
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,040
But his daddy needs a lude

530
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,500
Well the baby needs food

531
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,100
Baby better find himself a job

532
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,400
Have a ass drunk

533
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,980
Have a ass drunk

534
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,480
And I'm having fun

535
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,100
Stopped on a hill

536
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,460
Cause I had to take a pill

537
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,500
But I couldn't quite find my tongue

538
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,920
Have a ass drunk

539
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,500
Hell I can see

540
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,060
Well they said the light was red

541
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,100
Now a couple of folks

542
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,000
Well there was 22 mangled

543
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,300
And there was one guy

544
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,760
That was gimped up pretty good

545
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,460
He had to sort of walk like this

546
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,560
For the rest of his life

547
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,860
Well there was one guy

548
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,780
Who was pretty neat

549
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,480
They had a huge bag of cigarettes

550
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:35,480


551
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:35,480


552
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:35,480


553
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:35,480


554
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,900
And it was hurt pretty good I guess

555
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,300
They had like this machine

556
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,480
That was like hooked up

557
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,380
Where he had this tube

558
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,160
Running up through his nose

559
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,640
You know

560
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,040
And that was the only way

561
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,620
He could breathe

562
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,100
And well there was this one dude

563
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,640
It was like a blade

564
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,020
He chopped straight down

565
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,880
On his toes

566
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,720
And last I heard

567
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,780
He still couldn't walk

568
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,940
There was one guy

569
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,580
Well this is what's weird

570
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,360
They found parts of him

571
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,400
On the front of the car

572
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,700
And other parts of him

573
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,560
On the back of the same car

574
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,980
I mean it sort of defies the mind

575
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,620
Doesn't it

576
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,380
How you could find

577
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,460
Pieces of the same car

578
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:05,460


579
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:05,460


580
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:05,460


581
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:05,460


582
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,500
The same person on the front and back

583
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,480
Of the same car

584
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,120
I mean it

585
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,380
I just don't understand

586
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,220
They ought to run

587
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,620
Some kind of scientific test

588
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,500
I don't even see

589
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,420
How that could even happen

590
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,040
And a couple folks dead

591
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,540
Well it

592
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,500
Well it sure looked green to me

593
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,000
Half-ass drunk

594
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,880
Hell I wish I was

595
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,440
Well I wish I was

596
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,840
Turned a brand new Trans Am

597
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,160
Into an old tin can

598
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,160
Trying to outrun the fuzz

599
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,240
Half-ass drunk

600
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,060
I'm a victim of lies

601
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,480
Well there's nothing wrong with me

602
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,740
Your honor I can see

603
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,820
Hell I got you damn

604
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,980
D-Dug your eyes

605
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,300
Half-ass drunk

606
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,000
Oh woe is me

607
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,460
Well I don't really pay

608
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,820
But it's steady every day

609
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,500
Breaking rocks

610
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,800
Till they're broke as me

611
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,240
Half-ass drunk

612
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,060
Hell I'm half-ass drunk

613
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,860
Lord I'm half-ass drunk

614
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,480
Just sorry I'm half-ass drunk

615
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,840
Oh man friends

616
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,060
That was Jainer Hypercleets

617
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,180
Doing half-ass drunk

618
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,520
As part of our study

631
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,880
Not with anybody knowing

632
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,020

00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,320

641
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:04,220

00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:04,220

00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,740
Okay just a minute

Okay Max this is Jerry Topher

You are

00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,380
Okay yeah

664
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,200
HNA that's uh

665
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,880
I know it's late but I want to talk to you about your house a little bit

666
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,340
Yeah

667
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,640
So you're over there on Westbrook

668
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,120
Yeah

669
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:40,820
And that

670
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,440
Well that HNA is the Home Owners

671
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,080
Neighborhood Association

672
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,140
Uh huh

673
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,940
And we'd like to talk to you a little bit about your house see

674
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,600
You know

675
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,260
Little things like uh

676
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,440
You know parking a car on the street

677
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,160
Uh huh

678
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,200
Long too long

679
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,120
Yeah

680
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,400
Trash cans sitting out there

681
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,620
And you're gonna have to start picking them up okay

682
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:03,860
Yeah

683
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:11,640
Well, I don't know. I picked my car scans up just when the drugs come along.

684
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,300
Well, it's none of that except that lawn, too.

685
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,140
Huh?

686
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,600
Your lawn needs serious mowing problems.

687
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,880
I think you're in the wrong place.

688
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:28,700
No, I just wanted to let you know that we want to have a nice atmosphere around here and you're going to have to take better care of it.

689
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,060
Well, I think you're in the wrong place because my lawn is not in bad shape.

690
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,900
Well, you know, you just need to mow it a little bit more.

691
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,980
You know, we're not too picky about it.

692
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,860
Well, I keep my lawn mowed.

693
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,600
Okay.

694
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,060
Are you sure you've got the right plan?

695
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,500
You're Maxwell Green, aren't you?

696
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:45,740
Right.

697
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,940
Okay. 1214 Westbrook.

698
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,160
Hey, what's up?

699
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,720
Well, you know, we don't want to, you know, you just...

700
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,160
Where do you live?

701
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,680
I'm right down here about four doors down.

702
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,520
They kind of elected me chairman of this here, so...

703
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,860
I thought I'd give you a call and be real.

704
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,080
You know, mainly about it.

705
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,600
Where's your book?

706
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,760
It's getting out of hand, Max.

707
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,200
Well, what's getting out of hand?

708
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:17,260
Well, you just need to take better care of your house and your things.

709
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,920
You know, we've got that...

710
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,300
Stings.

711
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,340
Huh?

712
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,620
It stings.

713
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,520
I didn't understand you.

714
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,760
What did you say?

715
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:32,000
I said you have to take better care of your possessions, you know, if you want to stay in this neighborhood.

716
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:32,940
Okay.

717
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,640
I'll blackball you.

718
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,700
You never...

719
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,480
You never get another house in this neighborhood again.

720
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:45,620
Well, I thought my house looked as good as anybody else's on here.

721
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:50,080
Well, you know, just consider this here a fair warning.

722
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:56,460
We'll just give you a couple chances, you know, and then things don't work out, we'll make an arrangement for you, Max.

723
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,620
Well, I don't know how you made me leave.

724
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:02,560
Yeah.

725
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:02,560


726
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:03,780
Yeah.

727
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:03,860


728
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:03,860


729
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:03,860


730
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:03,860


731
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:03,860


732
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:03,860


733
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:03,860


734
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:03,860


735
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:03,860


736
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:03,860


737
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:03,860


738
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:03,860


739
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:03,860


740
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:03,860


741
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:03,860


742
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:03,860


743
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,120
There ain't no small-time organization.

744
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,500
We take care of that one.

745
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,960
I don't want to get into that.

746
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,800
You know, that's...

747
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,720
We don't even want to talk about that.

748
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,160
Just take care of the lawn a little better.

749
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,480
We'll check back with you and take the progress on that.

750
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,680
What did you say your name was?

751
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,120
Jerry Topher.

752
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:23,940
Jerry?

753
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,380
Jerry Topher.

754
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,560
H-N-A.

755
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,500
Chairman.

756
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,220
T-O...

757
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,500
How do you spell it last name?

758
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,260
T-O-L-F-E-R.

759
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,660
T-O-L-F-E-R.

760
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:36,660


761
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,820
Now, we'll give you a call back here in about a month's time.

762
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,120
We'll talk to you later then.

763
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,600
See you later, Max.

764
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,320
Better beware, Max.

765
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,660
I want to tickle your love offerings.

766
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:51,660
Sir?

767
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,000
I want to tickle your love offerings.

768
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,120
Hey, that's fantastic.

769
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:56,760
Is it?

770
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,940
I'm coming over, too.

771
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:58,640
Good.

772
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,420
I'm going to bathe your entire family tonight.

773
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,760
You're going to what?

774
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,320
I'm going to bathe your entire family tonight.

775
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,200
How's that?

776
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,480
You know, in the tub with the sponges and the water.

777
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,900
Well, you sound like just the right kind of guy.

778
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,120
You betcha I'll do it, too.

779
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,360
You don't know us.

780
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,060
We get drunk.

781
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,620
We like to go canoeing and bathing.

782
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,440
Well, I'll tell you what.

783
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,920
I got a whole bunch of friends that sit exactly the same way.

784
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,720
Well, maybe we can get together.

785
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,540
Have one of them fleas yours or something.

786
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,380
What is he up to?

787
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,660
Says, how much money do you owe him?

788
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:54,960
Thumblite.

789
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,920
They like butt.

790
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:57,720


791
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:57,720


792
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,300
They feel like butt and a meditate on their necks too.

793
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:58,440
Go to tan.

794
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:58,440


795
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:58,440


796
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:58,440


797
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:58,440


798
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:58,940
I got to go to tic-tac-toe.

799
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,020
When I'm back, you got a costume for your daughter.

800
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,020


801
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,020


802
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,020


803
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,020


804
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,020


805
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,020


806
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,380
Oh, no!

807
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,140
No, not now.

808
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:00,360
No, you around me you ain't.

809
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,980
You mean it?

810
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,620
I love her, but I can't stand her

811
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,040
My girlfriend is a homeowner

812
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,480
I put the mirror on the radio on

813
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,100
Watch that driver dance around

814
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,920
Got a head start, beat the lock

815
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,000
This time it's a little bit like a dog

816
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:34,820
I love her, but I can't stand her

817
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:38,000
My girlfriend is a homeowner

818
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:10,960
I love her, but I can't stand her

819
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,160
My girlfriend is a homeowner

820
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,440
Whoa, Swingin' Love Corpses.

821
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,000
They're live at the Chicago Subgenius Convention

822
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,940
with that lovely old hymn,

823
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,360
My Girlfriend is a Poe Bucker.

824
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,720
And, uh...

825
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,940
We'll be playing more material from the sub-con there.

826
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,240
You'll hear some Sister Mary Squared,

827
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,100
some Sister Velveteen Sly, actually.

828
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:42,280
I think we played most of Mary Squared's formal ranting.

829
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,260
But also some informal material

830
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,840
from the conspiracy panel discussion

831
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,860
with G. Gordon Gordon

832
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:54,140
and those aforementioned lady preachers

833
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,560
and dominatrixes.

834
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:57,540
And, uh...

835
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,440
Uh...

836
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:58,500
Uh...

837
00:31:59,540 --> 00:31:59,560
Yes.

838
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,260
Boy, we got a call.

839
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,880
We could tell a rumor on the air.

840
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,280
Ah, it would be so fun.

841
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:11,280
But I think we better be safe than sorry

842
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,700
because I would hate to have the Secret Service

843
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,720
call the station up and subpoena somebody,

844
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,700
make them go,

845
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,860
Where'd you hear this?

846
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,920
You know, where was the leak?

847
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:21,800
Uh...

848
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,760
Oh, well...

849
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,200
The eternal conundrum of Connie.

850
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,240
It's clean.

851
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,040
Connie knows that a cucumber isn't better than a man

852
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,040
because cucumbers can't cry for clemency.

853
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,200
Oh, unbelievers,

854
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,840
that Connie can castrate and cripple.

855
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,260
Connie comes and craters crash.

856
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,960
Comets careen from Connie's...

857
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,400
Connie's kiss cascades from her lips.

858
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:54,960
Lest it burn you.

859
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,140
Leave a tip.

860
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,280
Yeah, Connie.

861
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,460
Can you confront the candle of Connie?

862
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,260
Yes, no, I just...

863
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:05,280
Now, this chick...

864
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,880
I'm a chick with a Y.

865
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:07,640
Of course.

866
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,040
This chick has to cruise.

867
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,140
But the chronicles of Connie will continue

868
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:17,280
as I keep on co-opting conspiracy

869
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,380
and cracking clichés

870
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,800
for I am Connie,

871
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,900
the ultimate con.

872
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,120
Praise Connie!

873
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,240
Praise Connie!

874
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,280
Praise Connie!

875
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:31,820
Praise Connie!

876
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:31,940
Praise Connie!

877
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,200
Praise Connie!

878
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:32,200


879
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,540
Y'know, I love it!

880
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,900
I love all my Connie worshipers

881
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,580
me around here!

882
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,400
I don't know what Reverend St neol

883
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,260
has been doin' lately.

884
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,040
I remember he used to talk about

885
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,260
the makeup of the church

886
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:44,520
ISS!

887
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,720
Oh, I dunno,

888
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,880
a whole bunch of

889
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,940
computer nerd types,

890
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,240
People just

891
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,820
spend all their time

892
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,460
indoors, you know,

893
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,420
Never...

894
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,200
Never talkin' out

895
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:03,800
They just didn't know how to please a kind.

896
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,940
And I'm so glad to see this new young crap of a subgenius.

897
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:09,800
Yes!

898
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,200
Call MSG!

899
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:18,620
Whoever, one or more, are gathered together in the name of greed,

900
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:25,520
greed, confusion, control, and censorship, there is the conspiracy.

901
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,740
But I want to know, all you out there,

902
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,200
after hearing all this stuff that should have got you riled up tonight,

903
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,900
how big is your hand?

904
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,720
You know what's going to happen?

905
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:42,120
For 30 years, X day.

906
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,300
And our revenge will come on X day.

907
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,020
Our revenge will come because what's going to happen to those pinks and those normals?

908
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:53,260
They're going to go through the worst experience of their entire lives.

909
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,500
They are going to be forced off the stage.

910
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:55,500


911
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,640
They are going to be forced all of a sudden to be obsessed with sex.

912
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,780
And enjoy it.

913
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,700
And they are going to enjoy it.

914
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,600
But, you know what else they'll feel?

915
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,580
Because they're those pinks and those normals.

916
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,040
They will feel guilt.

917
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,000
They won't be able to help it.

918
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,940
You'll see those nice little ladies that you saw typing into Office.

919
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,780
They'll be like, ripping their clothes apart.

920
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,380
They can't help it.

921
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,580
They'll be like, oh my God!

922
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,260
I'm so horny.

923
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,420
But it's bad.

924
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,480
For weeks.

925
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,080
You'll see them for two weeks.

926
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,240
It's true.

927
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,500
And it'll seem like thousands of years.

928
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,100
That's what they will be doing on X-Day.

929
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,340
They'll be here, up.

930
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,500
Laughing.

931
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,980
Losing a squirty.

932
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,340
They are so uptight.

933
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,400
Oh, yes dear friends.

934
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:42,620
Some new prophecies about X-Day, the end of the world, as understood in our church.

935
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,360
The pinks will suddenly start having fun.

936
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,920
But they'll feel so guilty it'll be like hell.

937
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,120
They'll be ravishing each other in those offices.

938
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,260
But they'll hate it.

939
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,380
They won't be able to stop themselves.

940
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,220
But they'll hate it.

941
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:04,980
Speaking of X-Day, Reverend Zaphod left a message on the church headquarters phone last night.

942
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,180
With the most outrageous request.

943
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:18,100
He said, can't you call Bob up and change the end of the world to, like, I mean, you've got it set up for 7 o'clock in the morning, July 5th, 1998.

944
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:21,020
And at 7 o'clock in the morning, everybody's going to be hungover.

945
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:21,900
It's going to be horrible.

946
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,180
They're not going to get up.

947
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,500
They'd rather burn with the pinks than get up.

948
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,100
They'd rather get up in the morning, get up that early in the morning.

949
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,820
So I'm sorry, Reverend Zaphod.

950
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:40,120
But even if I did call Bob up about that, somehow I don't think that the X-ists are going to change their schedule just because you don't want to.

951
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:44,100
But the idea is you don't fall asleep the night before, okay?

952
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,020
You just stay up.

953
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,460
That way you don't have the hangover.

954
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,960
It'll, of course, sooner or later it's going to catch up with you.

955
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,540
But, you know, I'm just sorry.

956
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:00,780
These godlike creatures from Planet X just are not going to set their alarm clock.

957
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:05,360
They're not going to be, I mean, you're just going to have to put up with their wake-up call, all right?

958
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:10,020
I mean, there's only so much that you can get for that 20 bucks.

959
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,880
I mean, eternal salvation is a lot to ask right there.

960
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,480
You ought to be satisfied with that.

961
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:25,380
The difference is when a pink, a human, sees something that shocks them, they run away.

962
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:25,480
Yeah.

963
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,820
They don't like it.

964
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:32,120
When a subgenius sees something that shocks them, that offends them, they go, what?

965
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,020
This is, I'm shocked, I'm offended.

966
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,520
I want to know more.

967
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,440
If they still don't like it, then they might lynch it.

968
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,840
But at least they're doing their job.

969
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:54,680
But that conspiracy, that confederacy of dunces, you know, the horrifying thing is it's not that they're stupid.

970
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:01,700
The individual pink may be much more intelligent than a given subgenius because look at the word subgenius.

971
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,280
It's not the intelligence that counts.

972
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,300
It's what you do with it.

973
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:08,700
It's common sense, sense of humor, and dollars and cents.

974
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:17,680
But yet these pinks, these mindless bovine stereotypes, and that's all they are.

975
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,760
They're walking stereotypes.

976
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:19,660
Come on.

977
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,780
Sometimes generic slurs do apply.

978
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,660
In the case of pinks.

979
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:35,380
This is Lee Edwards, commonly known as the Christian con man, because I have total confidence in the Lord Jesus Christ as my savior.

980
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:48,420
And now this being my first album in Hawaii, I want to dedicate this album new to you, my loving wife, for all the inspiration you have given me in life.

981
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,220
And their children are captains on the squad.

982
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,480
Oh, so happy with Stretch Lee.

983
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:54,800
Happy with Stretch Lee vibes.

984
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,920
Also happy with Stretch Lee vibes.

985
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:57,880
Et cetera.

986
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:07,780
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who.

987
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:20,140
And all you have to do is squeeze your little finger, ease your little finger back.

988
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,200
You can change the world.

989
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,460
Whatever it is you want it to be.

990
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:24,460


991
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:24,460


992
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:30,360
Whatever else is true, you trust your little finger.

993
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:39,860
Just a single little finger can change the world.

994
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,280
Is that justice?

995
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:45,560
Is that proper?

996
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,400
I'm talking to you.

997
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,480
Life's so cruel.

998
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:00,340
Why not end it all?

999
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,320
Oh, man.

1000
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,860
Happy birthday.

1001
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,320
Hey, G, thanks, man.

1002
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,540
I'm glad you went through all that trouble to write that for me.

1003
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,780
Take a shot.

1004
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:14,240
And if you can't whoop it, go down.

1005
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,860
That's a lesser known slogan of Bob's.

1006
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,320
No, go down is a slogan of kind.

1007
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,680
I just want to tell you, don't pay no attention to my brother.

1008
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,000
I ain't going to pay no attention to neither one of you.

1009
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:34,900
He ain't got a good sense.

1010
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:35,820
Yeah.

1011
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,920
I just want to tell you, don't pay no attention to him.

1012
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,580
I wish y'all wouldn't be worrying me.

1013
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,060
You can't mention about driving me crazy.

1014
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:41,900
Oh, no.

1015
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,440
Yeah, and I've been trying to be nice to you.

1016
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,600
Oh, no.

1017
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,460
You've been driving me crazy for the last week or two.

1018
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:48,860
Well.

1019
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,780
Don't call me no more.

1020
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,300
No.

1021
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,940
Don't get aggravated about it.

1022
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,440
Don't pay no attention to my brother.

1023
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:54,840
Here.

1024
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,580
Don't call me up anymore either.

1025
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,820
They haven't paid off about it.

1026
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,400
Who is?

1027
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,520
The company.

1028
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,520
Oh, is that right?

1029
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:01,840
Yeah.

1030
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,720
Well, they don't know who we are.

1031
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,760
No, and I don't either.

1032
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,360
No.

1033
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,200
Well, I wish you wouldn't bring it up to my brother about his boy.

1034
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,340
He tears him all to pieces.

1035
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,300
I ain't brought it up.

1036
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,180
He starts crying.

1037
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,340
I didn't bring it up.

1038
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,280
He says you call him.

1039
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,840
I ain't never brought it up to him.

1040
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,180
You're the one who's calling me.

1041
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,020
He says you call him about his brother.

1042
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,440
Well, you know, Bob.

1043
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:29,640
The hour of slack really is made for those who tuned in by accident.

1044
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,420
That's right.

1045
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,040
Those who scanned the dial.

1046
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,500
That's what the show is for.

1047
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,700
Leave me alone, will you?

1048
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,440
Leave me alone.

1049
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,660
You've got a house to rent.

1050
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,640
No, I haven't.

1051
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,920
Don't call this number no more.

1052
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:40,900
What's wrong with your car?

1053
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,560
Now, I've noticed.

1054
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,620
The authority told me you've got some rental property.

1055
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:46,700
What is it?

1056
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,480
Have you got anything else to do?

1057
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,640
As long as they can sit and visualize world peace.

1058
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,580
Boy, that's better than folk.

1059
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,180
You know what?

1060
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:54,440
You think I'm a fool?

1061
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:54,440


1062
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,500
Boy, I've been good.

1063
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,660
Because it's magic.

1064
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,280
And think of the ant.

1065
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,680
Oh, the ones you poison and step on.

1066
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,780
They have rights, too.

1067
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:04,140
Think of the lice that inhabit people.

1068
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,740
They have rights, too.

1069
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:05,940
What about the bees?

1070
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,220
What about the bees?

1071
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:07,760
What about the ants?

1072
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,200
That's right.

1073
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,700
Nature is an open-ditch latrine in mid-summer.

1074
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:14,420
Praise God.

1075
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,800
Do not deny your evolutionary destiny.

1076
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,580
Which involves lots more...

1077
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:28,200
Sweating and being stinky and killing and stuff like that.

1078
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:28,880
And frapping.

1079
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,600
We try to keep the killing down and the frapping up.

1080
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,140
That's right.

1081
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,540
But realize if you can visualize the nuclear winter,

1082
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,040
you can save in your air conditioning bills.

1083
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,960
If you believe.

1084
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,480
But only if you believe.

1085
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,000
And nuclear winter sports.

1086
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,280
The nuclear winter Olympics.

1087
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,920
The nuclear winter is hot, but it's cool.

1088
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,020
He's going down the slope now.

1089
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,420
Look, his hair blowing off in little tufts in the breeze.

1090
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,080
Chunks of radiated flesh flying out.

1091
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:56,920
It's so poetic.

1092
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,400
Dangerous sex on skis.

1093
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:00,740
Bad words.

1094
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:05,660
But you see, the things like abortion and pro-life and contra-life,

1095
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,740
or whatever you want to put it,

1096
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,300
those are all little issues that have been designed to keep you busy,

1097
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,020
to keep you stirred up,

1098
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,180
to keep you worrying about this and keep you worrying about that.

1099
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,780
The war on drugs has eroded your civil liberties to the point

1100
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,400
where they can kick your door in anytime they want.

1101
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,320
All they got to do is say drugs and your wife is in jail,

1102
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,520
you're in jail, your children are far now.

1103
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,640
Your Cadillac's taken away.

1104
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,700
Your Cadillac's taken away.

1105
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:36,400
They can walk up to you in any airport in the United States of America and say,

1106
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:39,580
excuse me, did you pay for that ticket in cash?

1107
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,560
Yes, I did.

1108
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,200
Can we see your wallet please?

1109
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:42,920
Here it is.

1110
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,980
Sir, you have cash money on you.

1111
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:50,280
We're going to have to confiscate it because you fit the profile of someone going somewhere,

1112
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,040
probably to buy drugs.

1113
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,020
This is not, this exists right now.

1114
00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:02,660
The war on drugs is probably the single most divisive and single-minded effort to erode,

1115
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:08,300
erode every little bit of freedom that we've managed to wring out of these sons of bitches

1116
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,100
in the last 200 years.

1117
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:16,540
We've spent 200 years trying to spread that we the people to include someone else

1118
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:19,080
besides land-owning aristocracy.

1119
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,720
And now that we're finally beginning to do that,

1120
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,600
we're going over to the other end of the Constitution and gradually saying,

1121
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,480
you don't have the right to do this, you don't have the right to do that.

1122
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:32,860
Everything that is not forbidden is prescribed.

1123
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:36,120
And if you don't watch it, we're going to get you.

1124
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,620
And that's what you've got to remember.

1125
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:39,760
Nobody up there is a friend of yours.

1126
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:44,380
Nobody up there wants to see you have what you would call freedom.

1127
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:49,220
The whole purpose of this government in this country right now is to produce consumers

1128
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:52,380
and workers who will keep the cost of the economy going.

1129
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:52,380


1130
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,100
The cost of labor down, the profits high for the earning people.

1131
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,440
I'm not a communist or anything like that.

1132
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:02,600
I'm just simply saying that if you believe that any of the people that are running for

1133
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,600
office are going to do anything for you as a subgenius,

1134
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:11,120
if you believe any of these people who proclaim to be on the side of liberty and freedom give

1135
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:15,220
us what you want, then you have bought the conspiracy lie.

1136
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,220
Fascism back for the people!

1137
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,220
Fascism for the people!

1138
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:19,900
People!

1139
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,200
The subgenius church is behind people!

1140
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:22,380
Fascism back for the people!

1141
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:22,380


1142
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,680
Fascism for the people!

1143
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:24,720
Fascism for the people!

1144
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,440
The individual fascism!

1145
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:29,960
Don't visualize world peace, visualize armed insurrection.

1146
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,480
Every dad a Duce.

1147
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,680
That's right.

1148
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,080
Every mom an Ivetta.

1149
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,360
So what are you guys going to do at this revival meeting?

1150
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,320
You're going to make fun of religion stuff, right?

1151
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,880
We never make fun of religion.

1152
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,000
We're making money off religion but not fun of religion.

1153
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:48,620
No!

1154
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,620
No fun!

1155
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:51,020
They can't have fun!

1156
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:52,160
No fun!

1157
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,120
raise the slack area in this part of the country.

1158
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:57,820
And hopefully...

1159
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,260
These are called cribbage crotch figurines, and they're wanted

1160
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:06,240
in every home across America. That's right, young man,

1161
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,920
and you've won one. Well, as soon as you sign out the

1162
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,720
jewel form for the Lettuce Leaf Kids...

1163
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,380
At Jewel Co.

1164
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:20,000
We have to put up with these guys because they know the right people.

1165
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,200
But you can trust me, Ivan Stang.

1166
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,100
Yes, you can trust me. I'm Dr. Ivan Stang.

1167
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:30,460
And I'm prepared to take your money and give you back your slack.

1168
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:35,720
And I'll be at the revival, the great subgenius revival on the 20th and the 21st

1169
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,680
at the Victoria Theatre. So you can believe in me.

1170
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:42,340
I'm Ivan Stang. I never lie, and I'm always right.

1171
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:46,740
It extends throughout the rules and has to do with

1172
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:47,500
the universe.

1173
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,800
It has to do with...

1174
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,780
It has to do with Gilligan's Island.

1175
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:02,120
Actually, there is another big subgenius conclave coming up

1176
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:06,880
in November. November 13th through 15th.

1177
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:10,780
You might have a pencil ready because I'm going to give you their P.O. box

1178
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:14,200
you can write to. Big subgenius convention.

1179
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:18,720
Actually, it's part of a bigger event called Phenomicon

1180
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,920
in Atlanta.

1181
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:19,980


1182
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:19,980


1183
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:19,980


1184
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,480
Atlanta, Georgia.

1185
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:26,580
But the subgenius guests will include myself,

1186
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,960
the Swingin' Love Corpses,

1187
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,660
Janer Hypercletes,

1188
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,080
and Father Joe Mama.

1189
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:37,120
Plus, oh gosh, Reverend Susie the Floozy

1190
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,000
and loads more of the very interesting Georgia subgeniuses.

1191
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:46,920
As well as UFO abductees,

1192
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,360
conspiracy researchers,

1193
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:49,820
and just...

1194
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,020
a bunch of cyber punks and so forth.

1195
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:53,100
Who else?

1196
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:54,880
Huh?

1197
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:02,140
Um, and for information, you need to write to Phenomicon

1198
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:07,140
at post office box 12141.

1199
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:16,940
That's box 12141, Atlanta, GA 30355.

1200
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:19,300
2141.

1201
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,520
ZIP code 30355.

1202
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:24,680
2141.

1203
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,280
Yeah, big show.

1204
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,800
You go to hell, you son of a bitch.

1205
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,960
You're so, you're so sick minded.

1206
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:33,680
Why don't you meet me?

1207
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,200
I'm going to show you what sick human beings deserve in this world.

1208
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:38,000
Yeah, what do we deserve, my friend?

1209
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,220
We deserve your wife's swampy.

1210
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:41,820
Yeah, how would you like to be mutilated?

1211
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,660
I don't believe you, you sleazy, slimy, dripping.

1212
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,580
Hold it down, I'm talking.

1213
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:49,980
Okay, I'm going to get you out of here.

1214
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:49,980


1215
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:49,980


1216
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:49,980


1217
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:49,980


1218
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:49,980


1219
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:49,980


1220
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:17,680
I'm going to get you out of here.

1221
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:17,840
I'm going to get you out of here.

1222
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,800
Hey, I'm going to get you out of here.

1223
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:19,960


1224
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:20,300
Oh, you're going to get me out of here?

1225
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:20,300


1226
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:23,820
That doesn't cut no ass with me, see?

1227
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,520
My ass.

1228
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,440
I'll tell you.

1229
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:30,200
I'm going to get on some asses today.

1230
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,720
Listen, I've been sitting here.

1231
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,520
I'm putting it down in there.

1232
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,240
I can't hear no air means but I ain't wanting any.

1233
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:40,060
No?

1234
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,620
Hell fire.

1235
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,260
Hell fire.

1236
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,640
All right.

1237
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:45,960
Okay.

1238
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:47,640
There's something else, too.

1239
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,940
Now, I noticed, I noticed that you were going to be a little bit more of a little

1240
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:49,940


1241
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:49,940


1242
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:49,940


1243
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:49,940


1244
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:49,940


1245
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:49,940


1246
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:50,520
sketchy.

1247
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:50,520


1248
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:50,520


1249
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:56,980
You know, I heard last Sunday that one of you put a quarter in the offering plate, see?

1250
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,620
Yeah, Raymond Welsh.

1251
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:01,100
You're the one.

1252
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:02,680
You put a quarter in there.

1253
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:07,740
You tight son of a — I'd see all that, see?

1254
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:09,620
I'm up here where I can see it.

1255
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:13,660
Y'all don't even look or nothing.

1256
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,060
I can see it.

1257
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:15,320
See?

1258
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,820
Some of you are doing pretty good and others, you ain't doing

1259
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:19,340
for nothing.

1260
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:19,920
That's it.

1261
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:19,920


1262
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:20,380
All right.

1263
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:25,380
I'm going to maybe go to another church.

1264
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,260
I don't know.

1265
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:27,480
I don't give a shit.

1266
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:29,980
I've just about come to the end of the road.

1267
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:33,460
Yeah, I've just about lost patience with you people.

1268
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:38,040
You know we need a Sunday school space out there.

1269
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:42,600
You say, oh, amen, praise the Lord and all that

1270
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,720
when I'm saying something that you like.

1271
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,200
But when I'm trying to get something done,

1272
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,460
that's something else.

1273
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:53,140
You get your ass out to the mountains or someplace

1274
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:56,720
or hide in there and watch that damn tube.

1275
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,160
That's what you do.

1276
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,500
Listen, that ain't going to get it.

1277
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:05,420
The horse and the horses, it ain't going to do it.

1278
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,180
Uh-uh.

1279
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:11,160
Listen, I tell you, this will determine the day.

1280
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:16,540
I have no doubt whether I will be your pastor or not.

1281
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,560
But I tell you, if so, fine.

1282
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:21,720
That's what I want to do.

1283
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:25,160
But if not, I'm done.

1284
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:28,880
In fact, my sermon is done.

1285
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:30,960
Don't give me no more.

1286
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:35,520
Brother Woodrow, lead us in the closing prayer.

1287
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,440
Whether you're going to do it or not,

1288
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,180
I'm a stupid...

1289
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:44,800
Dismissed.

1290
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:46,880
How come you hit my brother so hard back here?

1291
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:47,680
Just go with it, old man.

1292
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:48,700
Well, I don't know.

1293
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,060
I don't know.

1294
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:50,920
I'm Arnie.

1295
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:51,720
You hit my brother.

1296
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:52,380
Oh, I did.

1297
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,300
Well, he said it deserved it.

1298
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:57,840
He said you knocked him loose with your shoestrings.

1299
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:58,620
I did.

1300
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,040
Well, that's good.

1301
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,660
I'm going to hit him hard at night next time if I ever get a chance to.

1302
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:06,980
This is potentially five and a half hours of calls.

1303
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,620
This will test whether you're hardcore or not.

1304
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:10,700
Yeah, yeah.

1305
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:14,560
But I can truthfully say that these calls probably mean more to me

1306
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,980
than any other calls I've ever heard,

1307
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,360
including ones that I've been somewhat involved in.

1308
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,440
These are, I think, the great...

1309
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,000
In fact, speaking of folklore, he actually...

1310
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,920
Somebody tried to contact Arnie from the University of Virginia

1311
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,580
that was doing a folklore project.

1312
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:31,760
They wanted to talk to him.

1313
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,560
It's an example of southern folklore.

1314
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:34,260
Wow.

1315
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,280
Hey, so what is Arnie like?

1316
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,520
Very interesting.

1317
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,460
He's kind of like a Mayberry character.

1318
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,720
He sounds like a likable guy.

1319
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,400
In fact, the weekend that I called him,

1320
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,000
he was parking cars in his lawn for the county fair.

1321
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:49,920
Uh-huh.

1322
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:52,620
He's just a working guy that works in the parts department.

1323
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:55,240
He was friends with Benny for years.

1324
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,140
He says that Benny was his friend.

1325
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,300
He was a good guy.

1326
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,880
Used to go fishing together.

1327
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:03,260
He was just like what you would call a po-bucker,

1328
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,680
a bored po-bucker,

1329
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,820
who had been a prankster for years,

1330
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,700
but this was the first telephone prank he had engaged in.

1331
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,340
And he says he meant no malice from it.

1332
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:13,260
He meant no harm.

1333
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,820
But interestingly, he told me why the calls ended.

1334
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,940
Benny got a brain aneurysm.

1335
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:20,060
He's a good guy.

1336
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:21,220
He gets his own church out.

1337
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:25,620
Yeah, well, it's cold out here.

1338
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,180
It's cold and lonely.

1339
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,860
Nobody can understand what's going on

1340
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:35,380
until the effects are turned down and your brain's turned up

1341
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:39,940
because it's 435 in the morning and the president's inside your head.

1342
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:40,820
I know.

1343
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,820
But it's so quiet here in the station.

1344
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:48,920
We're picking up dead bodies.

1345
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,540
We're picking up dead bodies.

1346
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:52,700
We're picking up dead bodies.

1347
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,240
We're picking up dead bodies.

1348
00:53:54,500 --> 00:54:02,740
So the KPFA show fades off into their dawn there in Berkeley, California.

1349
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:06,100
We don't have to worry about that dawn,

1350
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:14,320
for it's the dawn of a new age here at the Dallas subgenius hour of Slack.

1351
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:18,000
And dear friends, I feel that I should give you a chance to write

1352
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:18,780
for free information.

1353
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,860
I'm going to give you a chance to write for free information about the church of the subgenius.

1354
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:24,700
If this is the first time you've ever tuned in and listened to this show,

1355
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:30,640
well, there's a lot of other things involved in our faith here,

1356
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:38,560
besides prank calls and seditious ranting about sexual freedom

1357
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,820
and how bad the normal people are.

1358
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:47,140
And you can get that free information by dropping us like a self-addressed stamped envelope.

1359
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,900
It would be the best thing you could do.

1360
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,240
You could just send us postcards.

1361
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:54,040
You'll get a lot more with the self-addressed stamped envelope.

1362
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,440
And the place to send that is, of course,

1363
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:12,960
Bob at Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1364
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,360
You know, my Sunday night just doesn't seem complete unless I say that twice.

1365
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,880
That's Bob at Post Office Box 140306.

1366
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:23,700
Bob at Post Office Box 140306.

1367
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,040
I am through.

1368
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:31,900
In fact, my sermon is through.

1369
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:38,360
Will, you want to lead us in the closing head launching?

1370
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,840
Well, are you going to do it or what?

1371
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:45,060
Oh, one last thing.

1372
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:48,880
Boy, I've got some great videos.

1373
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:48,880


1374
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,880
I've got some great video tapes to edit from that subgenius convention.

1375
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,920
Wonderful stuff, particularly with the swinging love corpses.

1376
00:55:55,140 --> 00:56:00,140
But I have to have a VHS editing system with controller.

1377
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:07,180
You know, it needs to be a place where I could sit and cut that,

1378
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:14,840
do some sync inserts, you might say, of my close-up footage with Toth's wide shot footage.

1379
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:18,040
That's all technical church talk, you see,

1380
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:23,820
for, well, stuff that we can't hardly pay for

1381
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:27,740
because we've got to spend all the money on the food outreach, you know, and the slack.

1382
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:31,620
...on free, kids, rolling right along with your own special brand of music.

1383
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:32,400
And now...

1384
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:32,880
Oh, yeah.

1385
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:34,540
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1386
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:35,840
Oh, yeah.

1387
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,740
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1388
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:43,560
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1389
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:44,080
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1390
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,740
Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee.

1391
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:47,640
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1392
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,340
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1393
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:50,360
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1394
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,540
Come on, baby, don't you be late.

1395
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:57,580
I want your head, I want it tonight.

1396
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:00,860
Cut your head off a hot pass, hey.

1397
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:04,220
Now, have a look at my wall, got a hot pass pin, yeah.

1398
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:07,060
Come on, baby, I want that head.

1399
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:10,180
Come on, baby, want that head.

1400
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:13,940
I want your head to hang on my wall tonight.

1401
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:25,140
My sun, my sand, my surf.

1402
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:26,880
Come on!

1403
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,860
Come on!

1404
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:40,880
My sun, my sand, my surf.

1405
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,980
Come on!

1406
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,040
Come on!

1407
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:47,620


1408
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:21,700
Place Mr. Bones, mighty fun board skipping stones.

1409
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:26,940
You feel fresh as a lemonade setting in the shade.

1410
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,060
Well, it's hot.

1411
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:33,820
Well, it's cool.

1412
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:46,300
Whoa.

1413
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:46,460
Whoa.

1414
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,020
Before I go too much further into this tape,

1415
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,120
which ain't gonna be far,

1416
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,600
cause we only got about one minute left,

1417
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:55,600
I should mention that I don't know who sent us this tape.

1418
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:57,740
Boy, people send us such wonderful tapes

1419
00:58:57,740 --> 00:58:59,600
and then they don't put their own name on it.

1420
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,420
This says, look out Miami,

1421
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:05,860
and lists the 10 zillion cuts of music and records

1422
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:06,520
that were on it.

1423
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:11,320
But I can't remember which envelope it came out of.

1424
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,880
If anybody knows, tell us.

1425
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,100
I don't know.

1426
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:16,660
I'll have to look great.

1427
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:18,060
I forgot the whole thing.

1428
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,140
Oh, stop it, you're killing me.

1429
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:27,260
See, it makes me feel much better just talking to you.

1430
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,500
Anytime, baby, anytime.

1431
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,160
Now I think that I know who sent me this tape.

1432
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:10,160


1433
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:10,160


1434
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:10,160


1435
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:10,160


1436
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:10,160


1437
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:10,160


1438
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:10,160


1439
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:10,160


1440
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:10,160


1441
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:10,160


1442
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:10,160


1443
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:10,160


1444
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:10,160


1445
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:15,520
Which you go to what's called La Plagna.

1446
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,520
Make that Billy sweet William now

1447
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:27,300
Married life done changed him somehow

1448
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:31,300
He's the man the town used to fear

1449
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:34,220
Now they all call him sweet Papa Willie dear

1450
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:36,520
Stronger than Samson I declare

1451
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:39,480
Till the brown-skinned woman's bobbed his hair

1452
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:40,980
Excuse me

1453
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:44,360
Excuse me

1454
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:59,320
Good evening, you are listening to radio station KNON 89.3

1455
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,000
Dallas-Fort Worth, the voice of the people.
