Well, I'm having a Christmas party.
...wraps.
I had to get them in there as whole after the wraps one time.
Wraps.
Wraps.
I used to have to eat wrap a lot.
Back in the 90s and the Depression.
World Depression II, they called it.
This was after the one in the 80s.
Boy, them was lean years, brother.
Had to wipe your ass with some genius pamphlets back then.
It's the only kind of paper there was.
No wonder there was a bad, bad depression all over the world.
It kind of figures.
Dateline for dominance
didn't mention that it would be caused by some genius church.
And I can see why.
Why Bob would not want to mention that in his,
teachings to the uninitiated, they wouldn't understand.
Them was lean years, boy.
That move in Mad Max movies, I remember we used to look at those.
Boy, I wish it had been that easy.
Now, all we got in this refrigerator is plutonium.
Yep.
All we got on the airwaves is this show.
This weird show.
I remember I used to be amazed.
I used to be amazed.
I used to be amazed that Dr. Gene Scott was on 12 hours a day on TV in Dallas, Texas.
But now, this show for 24 hours a day forever.
I just, I wish this show could be more exciting, folks.
But just, I guess.
Just, I guess.
Just, I guess.

But, ever since the nuclear war, it's been hard for us subgeniuses to keep the show running
like it used to back in the good old days.
Now, I remember those times.
Those were good times, boy.
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.
I'm gonna bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.
I'm out.

Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.
This is Reverend Ivan Stang, sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megafist Temple Lodge
of the Church of the Subgenius, with Pastor Buck Naked of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs, living avatar of Slack and saint of sales on planet Earth.
Yeah, Doug Smith says we're different.
Doug's right, Virgil. We are different, thanks to Jesus, the Genetic Engineering Corporation of American States.
Mommy too?
Yep, the whole family.
Is everybody like us?
No, son, but we're working on it. Round the clock. Soon everyone will be a superior biospecies.
Wowee. I want to be a genetic engineer just like you, Pop.
You will, Vir.
pounds I want to help death at a

was changed and on each insanity and destruction that all of mankind's history and prehistory
before it.
Bob brings a new destiny for America, a time of cataclysmic economic change that will offer
untold riches and power to those in the know, while billions of deserving conspiracy dooms
for hiding hell on earth.
Uncontrolled thinking, controlled by Bob, will usher in a spiritual rebrief of a cascade
of astounding mysteries, supernatural riches, and a restoration of lost psychic abilities
that will transform the lives of those who dare to seek them head first.
That's right.
You're lucky to live in the dark.
Here's more, Bob.
Wise up.
We make smaller mistakes.
We make faster corrections and adjustments.
I was wondering, has the show started yet?
No, no.
This is the warm-up.
We generally warm up.
The pre-show warm-up?
Yes.
We're broadcasting from outer space to radio station KPFA, and a garbled version is reaching
you.
Oh, I'll get it.
Oh, why, come in.
Welcome to our ship.
Hi, Mom.
Our show, whichever you'd like to refer to it as.
Set recorders for stun.
And as the message is broadcast back to the earth, Mobius Rex turns it into code which
only the high masters, the elders, can understand when they listen to this show.
We're passing through clouds of images and words which were sent off from earth many
years ago.
Fortunately, we catch up with them, and then we pass them.
The linguistic scoop brings them to you for your listening pleasure.
The amazing tales from the church of the subgenius.
Be there for the end of the private life and the destruction of the American dream.
Don't say you weren't warned.
We've got to save you.
You already.
Oh, we do it again.
Oh, we do it again.
Oh, we do it again.
Oh, we do it again.
If you would like to hear it again.
Yes.
Yes.
I call this psycho technology.
We call up the church of the subgenius.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
You're wonderful.
More fictional garbage.
Yeah.
Uh, yeah.
I am calm.
The minute, the day, the hour after, and I am calm.
You're a demon-possessed boy.
That's the problem.

I want to tell you not to operate this program while listening to a car or other heavy machinery.
What do we think of next?
Wake up.
What?
Where am I?
And we'll welcome them pigs.
Welcome to the show, Dallas.
We've started all over again.
We're broadcasting down here from the Biblical Arts Center.
We're going to be talking about the





non-radio.
Down here at non-radio.
Yes.
Non-radio.
Church, elastic, plastic, man.
Okay, we're watching the slides of the city here.
And here, of course, is the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Memorial at Main and Market Streets.
You're listening to, uh, Fuck Naked.
Myself, Doug Smith.
And we're telling you who else will be on the show this morning.
Oh, you don't need to know who else is going to be on the show.
That's right.








That's not the real show.
This is the real show.
Friends, I'm sorry.
This is puzzling evidence.
And I'm real sorry.
We're having some technical difficulties.
We keep getting our show all tangled up with these other subgenius shows from Texas.
We're broadcasting live from Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley.
This is some kind of a mix up with our satellite communication system.
That's right.
We are having continuous mix up.
How is that?
How is, uh, view screen two over there?
Would you give me another, give me another signal there, Hellswami?
Yeah, let me try this out here.
Well, I'm not, no, I'm, I'm not really picking you up.
We're going to have to.
Well, I'm thinking as hard as I can.
All right.
We're just going to spread this microphone way out here.
Let me just try to, uh.
Camera two doesn't seem to be working here in the station.
A little bit more.
There we go.
The cords have too much slack in them.
Yeah, there's, there's.
But friends, you know, there's, there's never.
Such a thing as too much slack.
Bring the trauma bar over here.
We'll, uh, apply some tension to this thing.
No.
Yes.
Friends.
Well, this is, uh, this is Doug Wellman, Reverend Doug Wellman.
Puzzling also known as puzzling evidence here with, uh, Gary, Brooke friend.
Say hi girls, Gary.
No, hold it.
That, that camera doesn't work.
You can't talk.
Hi dudes.
Okay.
Yeah.
There we go.
And a buddy West and the incredible hell Swami satellite.
We were a new guest on the show.
Uh, the help.
The hell Swami is one of the few human wealth post humans who's ever been authorized to
actually draw original new depictions of Jr.
Bob Dobbs, the guru of our, uh, mystic cult.
That's right.
Apparently all the others will have something to pay for.
Yeah.
The afterlife or the before life, whichever comes first.
They'll all be paying.
But friends, uh, we, like I say, we, we constantly have technical, that's what these shows are
all about is technical difficulties.
Um, but hello, that's the false buck.
That's the false buck.
That's not the real buck.
Hello.
Uh, they hung up on us.
Yeah.
This is another thing friends in, in a couple of weeks, this show will have call in capabilities.
It's something that any religious broadcast really needs is to be able to minister to
the needy, the slack lists out there.
And, uh, hopefully in a couple of weeks, this station will have enough extra money after
the legal problem.
It is a cause.
It is a high.
It is.
I St. Paul Mavridis.
Hi girls.
Yeah.
It's it's, it's gets more and more confusing to those.
We thought about doing a show that was an explanation of the church of the subgenius,
because someone called in last week and said that, uh, that they, they were going to
give us a chance, but it seemed too disjointed and friends is true.
You do have to understand about the church of the subgenius to understand the show, but
you also have to understand the church of the subgenius in order to have any satisfaction
in any area of your life at all.
So I may sound like a big claim, but it's true.
Just keep listening and you shall find, I got a new explanation.
Uh huh.
Yeah.
We could explain the jokes to them.
That wouldn't save your soul.
Reverend Wellman, I got a new explanation for the church of the subgenius.
Yeah, Gary.
Okay.
You know, everybody thinks that church of the subgenius started about 1953 or so, but
that's not true.
It's a lot older than that.
And it dates back to the first time, uh, uh, a couple of kids cut up in church.
There you go.
That is a, that is a great history of the church.
I mean, I think it's a great history.
I mean, I think it's a great history of the church of the subgenius, but friends, ah,
yes.
Listen to that music.
It's every show is a Christmas show on K and O N for the next couple of weeks.
And we'll be doing our lovely subgenius Christmas show too.
And you can't leave us out.
As a matter of fact, the only house on my block that has Christmas lights up yet is
the, is my house, the evil subgenius castle.
That's right.
Celebrating the holiday of Jingle Bob.
That's right.
There you go.
We have a lot of, we're going to be talking about the different holidays in the church
of the subgenius.
And the different, the different products you can buy for, oh, oh heck, I hit that voltage
meter again.
No, that's okay.
They won't bite.
The different products you can buy from the church, like my buttons.
Oh, there you go.
Don't forget it is, it is turnover.
The time of the year when all things sell, the end of the year sale.
So, so come and get it everyone.
And, uh, just buy our products.
Now are, are we, is Chris, I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about.
Are we celebrating the birth of Santa Claus or his death when they nailed him?
Well, uh, that, that's the ancient, ancient subgenie, but the present subgenie, uh, try
to make sure that, um, we have our inventories cleared by now and sell everything to the
pigs.
Oh yes.
Once a pagan holiday and now a shopping season.
And it was something else in between there.
But before it was after it was a pagan holiday and before it was a shopping season, it was
something else, but I think they started a war over it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well friends, we've got, um, our own special Christmas Carol that we're going to play.
That's that we're inventing as we go right now.
The excess, the yes, the nativity of the excesses from planet X.
You always wondered what that X-mas thing was all about.
Uh, but anyway, if we can avoid having any more mid-air collisions with other subgenius
shows from around the country, we'll be playing some truly abnormal holiday material to bless
your heart and anoint your gland.
Uh, yes, but first this Christmas Carol coming up, this is what we consider Christmas to
be really all about.

And Jim and Tammy want to give you Susie Moppet, it'll bless a child.
And this little Bob doll you pulled the string at the back of his neck.
What did you do with the $31,000 you won?
Well, this $31,000, friends, goes to the home for a selfless children.
And last, the control room.
No, stay out of here. This is the control room.
And what have we here?
I think we've got a phone call.
Everything's soggy.
Everything's soggy all over the floor.
Hello? Hello?
Hi, girls.
No wonder...
You know, part of the problem with doing any kind of a call-in thing around here is that
we have a lot of trouble digging our way through the sound effects
and getting to the actual telephone.
Norm, who will follow us in here in the next show, will...
Here's Peaches and Cream Barbie downstairs.
And I can't doubt...
He's a kid...
We'll return after these messages.
Hey?
Introducing the G.I. Joe USS Flag Aircraft Carrier.
Let's get back into some pretty music,
and we'll just leave that little rug of hideous noise in the background.
At one time, folks, the Santa Bob came.
And in the prescriptions, uh, prescriptions, uh, Frost Ecclesians 1914,
it says,
and yea,
he climbeth down chimneys and delivereth us gifts of the flesh and of slack,
and he commandeth horned demons with cloven hoofs to take to the air
and pull him in his chariot in glory,
for he knoweth when thou hast been sleeping,
and he knoweth when thou art awake.
He judgeth if thou art damned or worthy,
so he did this for thine own sake.
His eyes are everywhere, like unto thine big brother.
He puffeth on his pipe and laugheth at our follies,
for he is jolly, and yea, in his mercy,
he giveth us days off,
and he bringeth us goods, yet billeth us not.
Oh, friends, that's such a touching message from the prescriptions.
Wouldn't you say, Reverend West?
I say, I just want old Bob, Santa, Santa Dobbs,
to come and give me my Bob Hope Hill Bobble Magic from 1995.
But Bob will change on you, friends.
Bob's a transformer.
He's one of the top-selling toys in the country right now.
It's the little Bob Dobbs doll.
There you go, see?
That's some style.
Only you can return the demons to the chest.
Sound too good to be true? Well, it is.
Just pull the string, press the button.
Upsy baby starting to stand, she gets up by herself now.
She looks so proud, let's give her a hand.
That's my baby.
Up, upsy baby.
Upsy baby, the doll that stands up.
She's new, from Kenner.
Where illusion is the ultimate weapon.
We must buy our toys.
We have devised a marketing scheme for children's toys.
It will empower us to resist us.
You will use your church as a vehicle to bring these toys before the public.
It will be called Bobber For Kids.
Do you understand and accept this blessing now?
For the usual plus expenses.
Good.
This code has been recorded in the archives of reality.
Okay, I think for the girls we'll have the strawberry rainbow, rainbow bites.
And for the boys, little tiny transformer robots that change into dollar bills and back again.
Yes, but how will the battle of good against evil be represented in your marketing schemes, human?
Just 150,000 nice toys of beautifulalu 착 slice.

Too much is always better than not enough.
Too much, too much!
A hour and two, we're down here at the reunion tower...
I hate that demon...
Desperately...
Gary, we need those demons to go on the air.
They're part of the exciting new show.
I'm mighty glad to be here on radio tonight because we know that other station
is tragic.
to get rid of us. Hey, non-radio.
Yes, right. Non-radio for Central
Texas, South Texas, East Texas,
Nunu, some Texas.
That's right. Radio Nunu
Narnini. Yes, Nunu, here we
are in the cult of Nunu and Narnini
and Ivan.
Yes.
I hate that name.
Yes, this is Ivan.
Hello. I forget, that's right.
My name is Ivan Stan. No, this is
Doug Wellman with Puzzling Evidence
or Ivan Stan.
And this is...
My name is Rex. My name ain't
Puzzling Evidence. And who are you?
That's right. So you will be getting that
part. We'll be leaving
that part. Alright, so we've got
friends, I'm sorry, once again, I'm trying to
disentangle this California
show from the Texas show that has
infringed on our airspace.
Actually calling up those doctors,
those crazy doctors. No, I don't
want to get a call from those guys.
It is the hour of flash.
It is the hour of flash.
This is not the hour of flash.
If you were listening to more than one or less of the show
right now,
you'd be a lot more entertained than you are
here from these stupid little
doctors like us in Texas.
That's right, and I'll put it as a question because then
the FCC can't do it.
Is this KNON?
Well, yes, it is a question.
Is this KNON?
Is this not radio?
Friends, this is KNON
90.9 in Dallas, Texas.
Um,
area code 75214,
but it really is KNON.
I should have taken that pill in Arkansas
and I wouldn't have been here in the first place.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's awfully hard to remember
when you take those pills when you're in Arkansas
because there's so many pills to take there.
I was working at
Las Colinas last night on a
conspiracy media church tape
and, well,
I was getting paid, too.
It was real good work, but I thought
I have forsaken my church.
I have forsaken the church.
I'm the subgenius and
I have hurt
those around me.
Here in Dallas,
it's not so easy
to be a subgenius.
Hey, listen, we had to rush back here from Las Colinas, too.
We had to jump in the car
and get back here and do the show.
It's about 11.30 now.
These other subgenius shows,
they'll...
That's right. It's about 11.30 now.
See, they don't even know what time it is.
It's really 6.30 in the afternoon.
Yeah, Monday.
It's all over the station.
Is it a non-radio?
Hey, I've been trying to tell the wrong...
We don't heat our houses here in Dallas anymore.
We decide to be like...
It's 1.45 a.m. right now.
No, we're in San Francisco, bud.
No, no, no, no.
I'm sorry.
Friends, I know this show is confusing.
I'm Paul.
Gary, say a few words.
Hi, girls.
No, no, that's my line.
Hi, Paul.
Is that time demon?
That time demon that be on your back?
I came down to the station
and I found out I wasn't even me anymore
and I found my real self passed out
in a room full of pills
with a giant piece of live meat
hanging out of my jaws.
Yep, that sounds like me too.
I hate that demon.
I hate that old demon myself.
Folks, we're trying to do a Christmas show in here
and we've got...
We've got all this...
this incredible mess.
Dr. Helswami Satellite Weavers,
do you have that tape of Judgment Day queued up?
I think we've got something on here.
Let's see what it sounds like.
It's inspirational music and nothing else.
We'll just bring it in here real slow
like a professional mixing job.
Ah, yes, friends.
This is the Church of the Subgenius.
We're still on the air on KNON 90.9.
It's Judgment Day, so hold on to your wazoo.
Yeah, it's gonna be tough for some of you sinners out there,
but it's gonna be tough for some of you sinners out there.
But the point is,
the problem is you don't know which was the sin
and which was the good deed anymore in this day and age.
Ladies and gentlemen, in just a few minutes,
you're gonna be ushered in to the Judgment,
a one-act play where men and women are brought
before the Judgment seat of Christ
in one of the most awesome events
that this world will ever witness.
In the ninth chapter of the book of Hebrews,
in verse 27,
it's appointed unto man once to die
after death,
the judgment.
We're heading toward that judgment today
and every thinking person on this earth.
It's a judgment that we speak about today
and that's gonna be...
You have lost your reward.
You shall enter heaven as a servant
without a single soul to your credit.
It's unfair.
It's so unfair.
I've worked so hard for the kingdom all these years.
It's unfair.
I should lose all my credits now.
Oh, my.
You knew all of this before you backslid.
Show him his record.
January 3rd, 1973.
But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness
and committeth iniquity
and doeth according to all the abominations
that the wicked man doeth,
shall he live?
All his righteousness,
that he hath done,
shall not be mentioned.
In his trespass,
that he hath trespassed,
and in his sin that he hath sinned,
in them shall he die.
This simply means that if you backslide...
Pull the lever.
Turn away from God.
Down you go.
All the rewards that you've accumulated
shall be lost.
Oh, my.
I just don't understand how this could happen to me.
Oh, my.
August 21st, 1973.
You mean you aren't going to church again today?
Baby, it don't bother me.
You know it's the morning of the day off.
Y'all don't have to live in church to be saved.
Dana, if you aren't careful,
you're gonna miss out with the Lord completely.
Come on, Kim.
My son, you heard the word.
I think we're all gonna miss out.
You were warned.
Were you so foolish that you think
you could outwit the law of God?
No, we actually are not...
You have returned and have been saved as a baron.
See, friends, here's the thing.
When they told us that we were damned
and we're gonna go to hell,
you know, what else could we do but start a church?
Uh, yes.
But the glory and the splendor that could have...
Switch over to some, uh...
What have we got here?
We're on turntable one, I think.
Mommy.
Throughout the ceaseless ages of eternity...
Mommy.
...is an awful price to pay.
Mommy.
It is an awful price to pay.
Mom, Buck's calling you.
Mommy.
And we do...
We're gonna...
We're gonna seriously address this issue,
but in the meantime,
we have the problem of who is the Santa Bob?
Were there any readings here on the Santa Bob?
Didn't you have I'm-a-Bob on the show last week?
No.
No, that was the show before,
and we had to pay...
Yeah, that's right.
That's right.
We did have the I'm-a-Bob on the show last week.
It's a...
It's a...
It's a Bob and a Euro Bob.
Santa Bob and Maria.
Santa Bob and Maria.
But, you know, we ought to talk a little bit about
Were-Bobs and I'm-a-Bobs tonight, Reverend Stang.
I can sense a little bit of that coming on Red Room Stang.
The Were-Bobs and I'm-a...
Those who have the psychosis that convinces them
that they are the Santa Bob.
Or the...
They're Santa Bob by night.
They go shuffling through the snow
on their nameless, hideous errands.
The grin of Bob and the spirit of Santa Claus
and the pipe of the Lord stuck on their face.
They stop using the locks of their doors
and they just kind of float in through the keyhole.
Oh, friends, it's tough.
And, you know, just going to church ain't enough.
You gotta...
You gotta...


Send your money to the Santa Bob.
As a matter of fact, I...
The people across the street from me
told their kids that...
That Santa Claus bills them for the toys he brings.
Can you believe that?
They asked...
The kids were asking if their parents...
If maybe Santa Claus will bring us two He-Man erector sets.
And the mom said, no, no, he won't because he bills us.
We can't afford that.
Santa Claus sends us a bill after Christmas.
Yeah, but at least he totes the note.
Yeah, what kind of a Christmas season is this
where Santa Claus is starting to bill...
And the delivery.
Can you imagine the delivery costs
of bringing that stuff up from the North Pole?
That's going to be added on, too, friends.
Even the gimme-bob sort of pale into comparison with that.
Yeah.
Well, friends, we've got to play a public service cartridge here.
It says on the log,
I hope you're enjoying the music.
But when we come back,
we're going to play part one of our collection of Christmas music.
So genius style.
We've got the Santa's on a Diet by Zug's Rift.
Santa Claus is Coming to Rape Your Wife by Mechanical Sterility.
Mommy.
And the Manson Family Christmas.
Mom.
So here it be, folks.
Every other Sunday night on Canowind 90.9,
tune in for mind-melting extremist noise
with best in industrial experimental music
featuring such top-name group sales,
Robin Grissel, SBK, and Nocturnal Emissions.
Every other Sunday night,
TV4 AM.
This is...
Okay, we're back.
We're still here.
And this song coming up,
this is a really beautiful Christmas song
by Zug's Rift,
an un...
generally obscure...
pure musician from L.A.
who's been sending us records.
He's sort of Captain Beefheart-esque,
which is dear to my heart
and some of yours,
but probably not too many.
Anyway, yeah, this is Zug's Rift
with his lovely song,
which I had to censor quite a bit for the radio,
Santa's on a Diet from the album Epic Hack.
Santa's on a Diet.
Now he has to eat.
He's going to miss.
He's going to miss,

brauch definiej.

It all started
when he accidentally sat on one of his elves
and turned into a smelly elf suit.
As punishment,
he was forced into exile
to a San Fernando Valley health spa
where they forced him
to take off his clothes and embarrass him.
And he rained in front of his reindeer,
who fled in confusion and hung her into the sky.
Luckily, his famous white beard
was long enough to cover his tiny penis,
which had gone soft in the cold shower.
Everyone had to leave the steam room,
so Santa would have room to sit down.
Some idiot threw him a medicine ball,
but it bounced off his belly and knocked down the wall
like the Battle of Gettysburg and the Battle of the Bulge.
When he got home, nobody recognized him.
Instead of the chimney,
he could fit through a keyhole like a skeleton key.
And this one, dear friends,
is Santa Claus is Coming to Rape Your Wife
by a band called Mechanical Sterility.
The singer, I think, is Reverend Hale.
M. Schaefer of the Church of the Subgenius.
Listen to this beautiful, beautiful song.
Ah, yeah.

Santa Claus is coming to rape your wife.
Santa Claus is coming to rape your wife.
Santa Claus is coming to rape your wife.
Santa Claus is coming to rape your wife.
Oh, yes, dear friends.
I hope you hear Rudolph.
Oh, what a beautiful, lovely Christmas carol.
Santa Claus is coming to rape your wife by Mechanical Sterility.
This is a cassette album called Band of a Thousand Lunches.
And I don't have their address right now, but if you want to write to the Subgenius Foundation,
we'll be there.
We'll be giving that address at the end of the broadcast.
If you want to know what anything is that we're playing, or if you want to buy a copy of one of these shows,
why, buy gobs.
We've got them.
So, yeah.
Stay there.
Please stay there.
I'll be right back.
Remember, you are commanding, not having, to be heard.
Oh, yes, friends.
Ahem.
Good evening.
What I'm about to play, to close out.
Well, there's really two of me here.
Christmas show here.
This is a Christmas show.
A tape song.
There are two Doug Wellmans in here.
By Pete Warner, the editor of famous magazine called Toilet Suck.
I'm sure you've heard of it.
Out of New Jersey.
Toilet Suck is a fantastic cultural artifact.
And what we're playing right now, friends,
is an album by this fellow.
It says,
The irritating sounds heard on this recording are not intended to be digested as reenactments of actual events.
Sounds based on personal activity.
Monsoon familiar mechanized calf Jesus.
And it is copyrighted.
The name of this tune is,
The Manson Family Christmas.
Here's the theme.
I fear games.
Sad but true.
And let all well due to a hell of a fault
Women got one motherburgers.
Still we are not .
Oh, I guess that's all I'm saying to him.
Why are themy Japan al sw manipulating yourself?
He's been the gay.
After, see you Bye.
We have to let love happen.
Charlie is our love.
We are Charlie's love.
It's our one.
It's our happening now.
Listen to that beautiful
Charlie Manson Family Christmas.
Yes.
You know, those were
different kind of family values,
I think, in those days.
But who says the 60s can't live again
here in the 80s?
And now, your local multinational corporation presents
some energy-saving holiday tips
from Mr. Abernathy.
Thank you.
Hello.
Your local multinational corporation
has sent me to this remote point in Australia
to prove a point.
Conservation can be dangerous.
In this remote Aboriginal village
just outside of Sydney, Australia,
the natives were told by their government
to slow down in their consumption
of gasoline and fossil fuels.
Unfortunately, the files in the government energy office
on this town were lost.
So, nobody bothered to tell them
when it was okay to go back to normal energy.
Sadly enough, this town has become the victim
of what we call an energy surplus.
And the natives have been forced to convert
many of their dishwashers, lawn mowers, and refrigerators
into these homemade, energy-hungry, miniature racing guards.
Boys and girls in the village between the ages of 14 and 20
must stay behind the wheels of these primitive, high-speed,
and dangerous machines for up to 90 hours at a stretch.
Just so their village can survive






and receive the next fuel shipment
from their local multinational distributor.
And we'll keep on shipping at our usual rates.
Just so this little village can meet and surpass its energy quota.
And to think, it's all because they kept lights off
when it didn't have to be convenient.
This holiday season, why not turn on all the lights in your house
and keep them on for the rest of the year?
Maybe you'll make the load a little lighter on us
here at Multinational.
And a winter reminder, citizens,
carbon monoxide, the silent winter killer,
lurks everywhere.
So if you have a gas stove, oil burner, or open flame,
make sure all the doors and windows in the room
are tightly sealed
so that none of that nasty carbon monoxide can sneak in.
Thanks and happy holidays.
This is Mr. Abernathy signing off from your town to you.
Scott, you made your choice.
When you rejected my word, you rejected me.
And to your eternal soul,
you have found that I only could you afford
to give to God that which was his,
but you could not afford to do otherwise.
The Senate still stands.
And from me,
I will stand.


In your outer darkness,
where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth.
Sir, please, give me just one more chance, sir.
I don't want to go to hell, sir.
Sir, no, no.
Thank God I don't want to go to hell.
No!
And the children say he could laugh and play
just the same as you and me.
The talebearer will be at the judgment.
I suspect that here
will be a special place in hell for such beings.
David the Psalmist said in Psalms 50 and 1 and 3,
Lord, who may abide in thy tabernacle,
who may dwell on thy holy mountain,
the man of blameless life,
who does that which is right
and speaks the truth from his heart,
who has no malice on his tongue,
who never wrongs a friend and tells no tale
against his neighbor.
At the judgment,
there will be those who have lost his tongue
and have destroyed the lives and reputation of others.
These gossipers will be cast into the lowest, darkest pit of eternity.
They're gonna be cast into the pit.
Mommy?
Why do my feet hurt so bad, Mommy?
Um...
Pastor Naked?
I mean, Dr. De Brogfran?
If you need to do your public service messages,
this is a good time to do it.
We can...
Oh, we got a phone call.
Yeah.
Oh.
No.
They wanted to know if we could do the...
mention the curse of Neegi over the air,
but we're not allowed to mention the name of Neegi.
No, whatever.
We really shouldn't talk about Neegi over the air
because he's a demon.
You know, for every Bob particle,
there is a Neegi particle,
and for every Santa Claus particle,
there's a Bill that comes in the mail.
No, don't fall for it.
For wherever you find Bob,
you must also find Neegi.
It's true.
There's a dark side to the cult
and to the Santa Bob.
You know, friends,
because if...
you better watch out,
you better not cry,
you better not...
uh...
You can't hide from Santa Claus.
You can't hide from Santa Claus,
that's right, friends.
You just better not.
Whatever you do, don't do it.
You haven't told them about Jingle Farkin Bells yet.
No.
Jingle Farkin Bells,
Jingle Farkin Bells,
Jingle Jingle Any Day,
Oh, what gosh darned fun it is to ride
in an old Corvair with a top down
in the dead of winter.
Oh, that's another lovely Christmas hymn.
Friends, we do have a serious message
to impart, aside from the fact that this is
K-N-O-N 90.9 in Dallas, Texas,
Dallas and Fort Worth,
and the fact that this is...
Near downtown.
Yeah, near downtown,
and this is the subgenius hour of Slack,
radio ministry, prophecy...
Serving grapevine in Lancaster and Fort Worth.
Yes, with, uh...
and we're with the podcast,
with the potential of getting into all kinds of big trouble.
I've been loathing it.
We have to sort of run this,
this, uh, recording of hell in the background,
because, you know, on a subgenius show,
you can't just talk.
You gotta, you gotta have at least 10 or 20 things going on at once.
Well...
But, friends, we do have to talk seriously about
the Sternodocs Disaster Relief Fund.
That's right.
And tonight, uh,
the Reverend Pope Sternodocs,
Pope of all, uh, Little Rock,
a valued member of the Church of the Subgenius,
and to those of you who are listening who aren't subgeniuses,
you don't care.
And we don't care that you don't care,
because the rest of us love and value the,
the, uh, contributions that Sternodoc did.
He was the discoverer of the Jainer device,
and, and, uh, one of the first launchers of the bleeding head,
and the founder of Doctors for Babel.
We all got back from the subgenius,
world tour and atomic devival crusade on the west coast,
and Sternodoc's house was burned down.
Now, he had prophesied,
he used to lie to television interviewers that
the, the first mega fist temple gog lodge
of the Church of the Subgenius had been firebombed
by the conspiracy.
He used to, he used to tell that as a lie
to conspiracy interviewers.
And now, friends, it has happened.
It's true.
It's in the Book of the Subgenius.
Um,
Transparency.
That's right.
It was predicted by Bob Dobbs so long ago
that there would be schismatic division in the church
and firebombings of Pope's homes by other popes.
And, uh, and so we're going to give the,
the address for the Sternodoc's disaster relief fund,
but what you need to send them,
we're swamped with mail and good wishes
and money from everybody, so, uh,
send whatever weird, horrible things you were going to send them,
send to the Church of the Subgenius,
send it to Sternodoc,
send old broken tractor parts,
shattered pieces of someone else's washed up reality,
non-existent void particles,
uh, unused fatty deposits from old religious dogma,
pennies that clog the bottoms of your dresser drawers,
thigh bone fragments of dead holy men and movie stars,
money,
thyroid extractions from giant South American fruit bats,
prairie squid, wild or shaved,
buckets of pills,
pieces of chopped off,
one true cross,
uh, fragments or the Holy Grail,
the philosopher's st-stone,
miraculous bleeding heads of World Cup golfers,
uh, old groupie scrapings,
their laundry that you stole,
blank checks,
evidence of Earth's visitation by entrant astronauts at the dawn of history,
comfortable clothes or loose women,
and above all, money, friends.
Money.
Money. And send that,
send that money and all those broken tractor parts
to the Sternodoc's disaster relief fund,
at P.O. Box 544 North Little Rock, Arkansas, 72119.
That's, let me do that again.
And really send this guy something horrible,
uh, but nice.
P.O. Box 5444,
you heard me right, 5444 North Little Rock, Arkansas, 72119.
And we, if you want information from the Church of the Subgenius,
we might as well throw that in now.
It's the sacred P.O. Box of Bob,
P.O. Box.
1-4-0-3-0-6,
Dallas, Texas, 75214.
Ah, yes.
But I never said anything about anyone except what was true.
I only spoke the truth.
That's right, Batman, yeah, now that we're here in California.
From Gotham City, Texas?
Yeah, Batman.
Far and in?
Batman, did you care to say anything to the chronic?

Time-fighting audience out there?
Just, just don't go to any of these shopping malls,
there's just too much people ripping everyone off there.
It's the truth.
With his deadly call and fatal sling,
is the only fit emblem of the man or woman
who stabs and kills the character of another.
Let your own words condemn you.
Oh, that's right, Robin is here.
I'm sorry, Robin always gets left out in these, uh,
oh, they're still playing tapes of Robin's past life.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hi, girls.
Linda's such a good friend in spiritual health.
I've been drinking some of this bat beer.
Well, when you've known as long as I have,
you'll really get to know her.
Yeah, uh, hey,
What do you mean?
stands up.
She's not as concerned about your spiritual life.
I think, uh, this, uh, Bob guy can do anything to help
the security situation in town here in California.
Well, now, you guys, you guys had claimed that, uh,
supposedly part of the new Batman and Robin security service
was everything is under control and you're sitting here drinking bat beer.

Your, your Batmobile has fallen apart.
We don't have to divulge this to the public.
Hey, man, don't, they'll never clean my cage, Reverend Stans.
Yeah.
Robert, Robert, come up here.
Now that Batman and Robin are, if you don't mind, boys,
washed up drunks, they've become subgeniuses as well.
That somehow seems to go hand in hand around this church,
so-called church.
Just, just let me have a little more of that frop,
Reverend Stans, and I'll let you get away with that not batarang you.
Okay, well.
That's good.
You have in your lifetime destroyed the weak among my flock.
Have you destroyed the weak?
Oh, it's time for our sign-off music,
because Norm is coming in for his beautiful talk show.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, I got something to say.
A burglar in the yard wasn't on his guard.
Through the batarang sucker really slapped him hard.
Batarang, batarang.
Oh, man.
Batarang, batarang.
I'm a batarang.
Batarang, batarang.
Batarang, batarang.
Batarang, batarang.
Batarang, batarang.
Your record will speak for itself.
Batarang, batarang.
Go ahead.
Right.
It's sign-off time.
Yeah, it's Pastor Buck naked with a square deal business proposition for you.
Just go there, the Twilight Room, downstairs.
You know where it is.
Right at, uh, right downtown Dallas.
Heck, the Twilight Room, more drunk cowboys.
My band, Batman's in it.
Come on down and party with us all night long.
New Year's Eve, more drunk cowboys.
That's Reverend Buck with more drunk cowboys.
New Year's Eve at the Twilight Room.
Yee-haw!
Oh, yes.
Well, look at those needles get handed, friends.
This is the end of the Subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.
That's it.
That's all you get.
We're coming down on the end here.
So, um, uh, and I would recommend that reading Prescripture 16, 14, 17, 18 of the Book of the Subgenius,
which you can pick up at Better Bookstores everywhere.
And, folks, we need blankets and contraceptives for those boys and girls in the home for slackless children,
like I say on every broadcast.
Your contributions also keep those we hate starving to death.
Uh, so I command you to spill your gift seed pledge of 100 pounds of dollar bills on my lap,
as this will buy modeling, play, and transformer toys for those poor children in Haiti this Christmas.
Ah, yes.
Dobbs will bless you for planting this seed, Faith.
And now the announcer will give our mailing address before Norm comes in to finish the broadcast.
Friends, that's Church of the Subgenius at P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.
P.O. Box.
