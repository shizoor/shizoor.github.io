1
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,440
Frisbee

2
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:33,580
Frisbee

3
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,340
I started to drive home and I turned on the car radio

4
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,180
But no radio station came through

5
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,200
It was almost as though the radio was dead

6
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,400
And then the strange sounds began

7
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,580
Now that's very strange

8
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,420
I wonder what happens when I change the dial

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,920
It's almost like a signal

10
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:06,820
Is it a signal?

11
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,440
For me?

12
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,100
Wait a minute, let's get a code

13
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,200
Two for yes and one for no, alright?

14
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,280
Am I mistaken?

15
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,540
It's tonight, the night?

16
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,220
You're going to fly down?

17
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,340
I'm not being deceived

18
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,440
Frisbee

19
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,680
There's a radio program that gives you the energy to be a football hero or a rock star

20
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,900
It's so hip, Tammy Bay can't stand it

21
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,460
It lets you drink all the beer you want with none of the drawbacks

22
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:47,300
And it smooths out all the wrinkles on your brain that contain your childhood phobias

23
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,960
It's the subgenius hour of slack

24
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,260
With your bionically muscle-bound host

25
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,680
The only Reverend Ivan Stang

26
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,340
He wears more hats than Hedda Hopper

27
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,260
Bob gives him free shoes

28
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,080
Every week

29
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,820
He's such a wild driver

30
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,240
The only original parts left on his car

31
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,300
Are the steering wheel and the hood ornament

32
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,380
He's the only man known to science

33
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,280
Who can mysteriously turn a croissant

34
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,780
A can of three-in-one oil

35
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,180
And a tin-vinny nail into a lovely meal for twenty

36
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,160
Give him your undivided attention

37
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,580
Your undying loyalty

38
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,440
And all your spare cash

39
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,900
It's the subgenius hour of slack

40
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,640
9 p.m. Sunday nights

41
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,800
On the official radio station of the 1998 Olympics

42
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,900
KNON

43
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,240
90.9%

44
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:29,560
9 FM

45
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,320
And Dallas

46
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,040
A division of Subgenius Industries Unlimited

47
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,700
Along with a $20 donation

48
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,540
For this radio broadcast

49
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,600
All I can say is thanks a million

50
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,940
And I won't settle for a cent less

51
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,340
Oh, that's right, dear friends

52
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,840
It's the hour of slack

53
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,220
Hypocrisy you can live with

54
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,600
Or die for

55
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,620
Oh, why not?

56
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,280
Die for Bob

57
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,420
He loves you enough

58
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,540
Surely, surely he does

59
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,660
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

60
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,800
Does it seem like somebody's working witchcraft?

61
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,780
Who do a voodoo on you?

62
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,260
Does it seem like you have a money jinx?

63
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,700
Or a money hex on you?

64
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,140
So that you can't hold on to money

65
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,420
So that you can't get your money

66
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,180
Do you seem to be unlucky in love?

67
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,960
Unlucky in romance?

68
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,320
Is your husband or your wife

69
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,400
Or your loved one

70
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,660
Running around on you?

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,480
Being unfair toward you?

72
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,440
Are you having bad luck in your home

73
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,460
With your children?

74
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,320
With your family?

75
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,240
With your friends?

76
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,740
I want to send you my secret of good luck

77
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,640
And my secret of good luck

78
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,840
Will set you free from bad luck

79
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,240
And bad luck will set you free from bad luck

80
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,300
And bring you the blessings of God

81
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,240
Of help, happiness, love, success

82
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,620
Sideband frequencies and high amplitude harmonics

83
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,700
Yeah, man, that's all cool

84
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,320
But, hey, man, you want to buy some drugs?

85
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,340
Well, uh, it depends on whether you're talking about a linear path or trajectory

86
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,860
Or the initial amount of velocity

87
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,620
Which is repelled by the pure gravity

88
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,440
Well, look, man, I can see you're a little flustered

89
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,220
But I got something to say to you, man, I'm going to get you some drugs, okay?

90
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:29,220


91
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:29,920
I got something for you right here

92
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,020
I got some Bob pills

93
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:31,800
Really?

94
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:32,520
Yeah

95
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,200
That sounds, uh, um, like quite, uh, placebo

96
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:35,960
It's legal

97
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,140
It's completely legal

98
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,480
100% FCC approved

99
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,180
Oh, well, I'll take anything that the FCC approves

100
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:41,780
Okay

101
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,080
Let's both take one

102
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,780
Wow, man, these are great

103
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,720
Hey, wow, boy, that really picks up your perspective on things, you know

104
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,880
All right, I'm doing very, very, very, very

105
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,880
I'm doing jumpy and really just kind of

106
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,540
The initial path of trajectory is modulated by the vector of a hyperscope

107
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:50,980
Which is

108
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,460
Don't talk to me that way

109
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,000
Possibly, uh

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,480
Why are you looking at me like that?

111
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm not here, no, man, I'm just thinking

112
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,820
No, I'm just trying to explain to you the basic principles of the, um

113
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:55,920
Okay

114
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,840
The path of trajectory, right, yeah

115
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,660
As opposed to exponential, uh, algorithm

116
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,780
Which is projected by, you know, a linear curve

117
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,080
Hey, man

118
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,580
The vector, uh, bifurbulation is also, um

119
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,620
Inconsistent with the, uh, incongruent curves of, um

120
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:06,380
Dilating

121
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,440
Hey, wait a minute, I think I can already see that the piles are wearing off, um

122
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,160
Angles

123
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,080
You can always, uh, smear an oblong square

124
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,460
But you can't, uh, square an oblong smear, right

125
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,000
Uh, unless, of course, you take all the angles and subdivide them by, uh

126
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,580
Two, the ratio of two to one, um, the subcarrier

127
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,160
But anyways, getting back to the vectors

128
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,100
Wow, these pills really do pick you up

129
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,500
I have not talked this fast in a long time

130
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,980
The truth is, I think you need actually more pills

131
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,320
More pills?

132
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:23,740
Yeah, me too

133
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,140
Okay

134
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,840
You know what's really interesting is that the more pills you take, the faster you can take pills

135
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,760
Which is, which is kind of an interesting concept

136
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,560
Because the faster you take it, the pills, the more pills you want to take

137
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,480
I already feel like taking another one

138
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,000
Let's take another one

139
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,560
Yeah, I just keep withdrawing my pills

140
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,500
Let's go on to the bucket of pills

141
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,360
Go, go, go, go, go, go

142
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,260
Oh, well, yeah, this is really, uh, really quite the rush

143
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:35,860
I'm going to get some more

144
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,820
You want some medium, large, or small?

145
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think I'm going to go work on some more

146
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,820
Yeah, I'm going to get a lot of stuff done

147
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,460
I'm going to get a lot of stuff done

148
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:39,880
Go for it!

149
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,960
Let's go, I know, let's do some drawing

150
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:08,360
And in my dreams, I walk the earth with giant feet

151
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,940
And in my dreams, I walk the earth with giant feet

152
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,960
And in my dreams, I walk the earth with giant feet

153
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,460
I hear them sing to me

154
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,540
And the song is beautiful

155
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,360
And leads me onward in hope and joy

156
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,420
The way the future did when I was young

157
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,780
There is the promise of a secret

158
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,880
A secret that will not disappoint

159
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,260
The way love and wealth and power disappointed

160
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,200
A secret contained here

161
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,280
Touching it, there are golden dreaming forests

162
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,600
Cooling a fire

163
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,100
They sing to me, and I am golden

164
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,960
How did I get so old before this moment?

165
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,840
How could I have felt nothing for so long?

166
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,860
How could love have died into this?

167
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,380
There's no point of contact anymore

168
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,380
She doesn't even look at me anymore

169
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,420
She never saw the color draining out of my life

170
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,360
Never saw the emptiness, the weariness

171
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:22,980
It's been as if I was watching a TV show about someone else's life

172
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,460
It didn't matter

173
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,060
I was a successful man

174
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,220
With a beautiful, elegant wife

175
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,220
A home in the most expensive part of town

176
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,060
And it didn't matter

177
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,180
I had all of it

178
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,060
And nothing felt like anything anymore

179
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,920
Old life

180
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,500
Old

181
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,560
I had been dead

182
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,760
I had been dead

183
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,820
And then

184
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,540
A soft hand

185
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,500
Singing gold and need beyond mourning

186
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,920
Came to me

187
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,040
And was now alive

188
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,560
And every time I stumbled and fell

189
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,580
Something in me got harder

190
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,380
Harder

191
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,020
Became worse

192
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,300
Worse

193
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,600
And in my dreams

194
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,220
I walked the earth

195
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,840
With giant feet

196
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,000
And in my dreams

197
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,760
I walked the earth

198
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,680
With giant feet

199
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:29,780
With giant feet

200
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,900
Hell Pope Huey

201
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:40,260
Thank you Hell Pope Huey

202
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,280
Bob loves you.

203
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,580
Oh, wondrous and strange.

204
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,720
Hideous and convoluted are the paths to Bob's secret hideout.

205
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:06,640
His unobtrusive tract house in the neighborhood of divine transcendence.

206
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:18,860
Dare you tread that ancient way where shreds of flesh and gnawed bones hint of unspeakable rights and unpalatable half-truths?

207
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,700
Oh, there are no shortcuts to Bob, my friends.

208
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:33,760
Like a blast of hot wind through the very bowels of the earth, you must pass through the sphincter of the conspiracy's mental and emotional constrictions

209
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,940
into the disciplined dissipation.

210
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,780
Of true slack.

211
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:50,180
Where you can sit amidst the rage and fusion of nature's most elemental powers without a worry in the world.

212
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,960
What have you got to lose?

213
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,980
As it is, you may be fooling yourself and others that you care about

214
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:06,220
with smug assumptions that all those things you see and hear around you every day are solid.

215
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:06,620
Oh, my God.

216
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,480
And that the world is run by people who care about the future.

217
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,460
Or that the world is run by people at all.

218
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,120
Right!

219
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:26,140
You may as well put yourself in the hands of some smiling pipe-smoking bland-face innocuosity

220
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:35,800
whose seductive promises of satisfying sex and ill-gotten gain seem suddenly irresistibly attractive.

221
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,120
And that's why Bob's

222
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,120


223
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,300
Give yourself to Bob.

224
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,640
Freely.

225
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,600
Joyously.

226
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,440
Without an atom of restraint.

227
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,640
Now!

228
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,600
Do it now!

229
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,860
And all your worries are over forever, my friend.

230
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,280
Don't laugh.

231
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,900
Don't laugh.

232
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,820
Oh, God.

233
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:23,820


234
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:23,820


235
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:23,820


236
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:23,820


237
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:29,880
Every time I sit down on my kingdom's throne

238
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,500
and junk for the good book

239
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,620
That's my free hand

240
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:36,620


241
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:36,620


242
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:36,620


243
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,440
That will save my soul

244
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,200
Save me

245
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,480
From the vultures of conspiracy

246
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,360
Save me

247
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,780
From the chains of time

248
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,720
Save me

249
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,780
From the men in black

250
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,300
It's never such genius

251
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,040
Must have slack

252
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,260
Praise God

253
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,720
Praise God

254
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,460
Praise God

255
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,800
Praise God

256
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,920
Praise God

257
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,180
Praise God

258
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:18,320
Praise God

259
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,500
So relax

260
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,420
In your

261
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,100
own delusion

262
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,100
Find a place to hide

263
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,040
Get rich on confusion

264
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,380
Save me

265
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,740
From the vultures of conspiracy

266
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,620
Save me

267
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,040
From the chains of time

268
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,860
Save me

269
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,000
From the men in black

270
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,540
It's never such genius

271
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,440
Must have slack

272
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,480
Praise God

273
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,760
Praise God

274
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,220
Praise God

275
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,440
Praise God

276
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,620
Praise God

277
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,340
Praise God

278
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,480
Praise God

279
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:21,480


280
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:21,480


281
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,040
Praise God

282
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,040


283
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,040


284
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,040


285
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,280
One, two, three, four

286
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,020
And let me hear you say

287
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,720
Whoaaaaaaaaaa

288
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,900
Thank you.

289
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,960
Thank you.

290
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,040
Sorry, we were that the new tape, Bob's Earwax,

291
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,720
a compilation of songs,

292
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,320
had already had all its labels and such like and masters printed,

293
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,600
but, oh, you'll be hearing from us.

294
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,620
But first...

295
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,620
The U.S. Customs Service is waging war on drug smugglers,

296
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,680
and you can help.

297
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:55,860
If you see any unusual activity involving private boats or planes

298
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,100
that might be connected to drug smuggling,

299
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,420
call the U.S. Customs Service 24 hours a day

300
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,460
toll-free at 1-800-BE-ALERT.

301
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,020
You can remain anonymous,

302
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,900
and you could receive a cash reward

303
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,260
if your information leads to the arrest and prosecution of drug smugglers.

304
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,280
Help stop drug smuggling.

305
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,880
Call 1-800-BE-ALERT.

306
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,740
Yes, it's subgenius boot camp.

307
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,180
Drinking coffee and staying awake.

308
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,220
Stand up there.

309
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,320
Here, have some old Bob Cologne.

310
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,920
You call yourself a subgenius coming to drill with a beard?

311
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,000
That's two demerits.

312
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,040
Okay.

313
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,400
All right, Mr. Cologne.

314
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,780
Three more demerits and I'll get that new baseball glove.

315
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,700
Look at the knees of your uniform pants.

316
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,420
That's disgusting.

317
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,740
I'm docking you five more demerits, Mr. Cologne.

318
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,280
Oh, gosh, gosh.

319
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,120
Get a new car.

320
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,900
What are you smiling about?

321
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,720
Order me that six more demerits.

322
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,040
Don't just eat a hamburger.

323
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,600
Eat the hell out of it.

324
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,480
My kingdom is on the earth.

325
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,100
Not that I want it.

326
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,080
A good boy.

327
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,400
A good boy.

328
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:01,400


329
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:01,400


330
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:01,400


331
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:01,400


332
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:01,400


333
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:01,400


334
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:01,400


335
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:01,400


336
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:01,400


337
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:01,400


338
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:01,400


339
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,020
A good deal is in the wallet of the beholder.

340
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,520
Know ye this.

341
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,780
Knowledge of earth, pagan love, and moons.

342
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,800
Not that the sun, extremists, and the Circus,

343
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,360
discard and mine the great order and patriarchy.

344
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,140
Through my discipline and armies and triumph.

345
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,240
The harlot will bribe thee with the reins of mine.

346
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,720
But anything that is unclean shall be to perdition.

347
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,320
The divine king will be killed in the closet by his own clowns.

348
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,620
Darkness will fall.

349
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,820
The door signs.

350
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:29,900
Rain.

351
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:44,600
If you act stupid, them creatures shall come indeed with their bestowals, and their minds and their tools shall be all stirred up together. The image will be made flashing, and I pray to clean the hounds, and that's what I want to talk to you about tonight.

352
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,220
The prophets shall be loosened from their mouths, and they will be made to stand in the midst of the world.

353
00:16:49,920 --> 00:17:01,620
You may not know what you're doing, but that sign shall be known, and they shall command the source of all knowledge, which is likened to a book of the score, and which ground everywhere like a vine.

354
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:07,140
They shall receive the sacrament from the angels, of the light which preserves the rights in heaven.

355
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,400
The chariots of the Lord shall reign on the right well, and the right will be on the right.

356
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,200
I'll always lie.

357
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,160
I'll always lie.

358
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,040
I'll always lie.

359
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,260
Everything comes apart.

360
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,340
I'll always lie.

361
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,440
I'll always lie.

362
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,820
I'll always lie.

363
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,160
I'll always lie.

364
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,860
I'll always lie.

365
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,100
I'll always lie.

366
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:31,520


367
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:43,240
Inhibiting Factor, dear friends, a wonderful piece from Inhibiting Factor.

368
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:44,580
All the...

369
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:49,260
All the greatest quotes of that man Dobbs in one piece.

370
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,100
Yes, that man Dobbs.

371
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:02,360
I think Dr. Zedd and Chris Gross can supply the background here for a while.

372
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:08,660
Even as we sit here quietly pursuing our own ends, or...

373
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,200
Ends.

374
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,620
Ends.

375
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,040
Alien forces.

376
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,580
Of annihilation.

377
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,340
Powered by dreams too hideous to contemplate.

378
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,240
Gather in a frenzy of normalcy just outside your door.

379
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,300
Just over your shoulder.

380
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,520
In the very stars overhead.

381
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,320
Drunk with boredom and abstraction.

382
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,700
They cluster around graphs and charts and maps which target with cool scientific...

383
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,580
Cool scientific...

384
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,460
Precision.

385
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,240
Any center of lunatic resistance.

386
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,180
Only Bob's embrace.

387
00:18:53,220 --> 00:19:02,840
Only the refreshing and intoxicating cloak of his burning frop can transmute this coarse

388
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:11,000
material substance of our flesh into the glorious, invisible leisure of nothingness itself.

389
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,320
They won't even be able to see you.

390
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:21,420
Much less crush out the light of your Bob's soul in the dull routine of their monstrous design.

391
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,660
They'll be able to see you.

392
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:23,660


393
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:32,220
Trade in hours and weeks and years of tedium for an eternity of controlled abandonment.

394
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,700
They'll be able to see you.

395
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:41,580
So claim again your ancient genetic heritage, your bludgeon of prophetic and profitable irreverence,

396
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,980
your right to smite.

397
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:53,660
And when that stark fist of removal swoops low and makes such a mess of things during

398
00:19:53,660 --> 00:20:01,600
the final days, squeezing a fine vintage wine from the harvest of believers and unbelievers

399
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:11,120
alike, you can sip that heady brew and toast the master of ceremony whose beneficent grin

400
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,960
spared you that senseless sin.

401
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:13,960


402
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,800
But never do you dream of Jess's leaving.

403
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,400
Better die than cả một chết, and that being a tale of true doświadозмu食енс,

404
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:17,400


405
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:17,400


406
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,480
Next debate

407
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,920
aszcz somehow

408
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,260
One of us

409
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:38,740
All

410
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,080
A lovely piece from the Reverend Parks.

411
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,500
I'm reading you secret previews of the Stark Fist, my friends.

412
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,540
That's what this is.

413
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,380
This is the Stark Fist ahead of its time.

414
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,320
We're busting booty on that magazine, friends.

415
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,860
You members out there, just to let you know.

416
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,660
It'll be worth the wait, more than worth the wait.

417
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,460
Thank you, Professor Gross, for the music.

418
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,480
And here's Clark.

419
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,800
Change takes time.

420
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,920
We don't want to feel bad.

421
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,000
Change takes time.

422
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,760
We don't want to feel bad.

423
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,900
Change takes time.

424
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,060
There's no sense in that.

425
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,620
Just relax.

426
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:36,780
Contingencies.

427
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,600
Contingencies.

428
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:39,680
Contingencies.

429
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,920
I'm a human being.

430
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,620
Contingencies.

431
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,260
Contingencies.

432
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,360
Contingencies.

433
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,140
Contingencies.

434
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,300
Contingencies.

435
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,600
Contingencies.

436
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
Contingencies.

437
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,900
Contingencies.

438
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,260
Contingencies.

439
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:05,420
Contingencies.

440
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,640
Contingencies.

441
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,680
Contingencies.

442
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,760
Contingencies.

443
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,760
Contingencies.

444
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:11,580
Just relax.

445
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,200
Just relax.

446
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,460
How much do I really know?

447
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,660
Just relax.

448
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,420
Like a freight train in my veins.

449
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,600
I'm a human being.

450
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,540
Just relax.

451
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,000
Come, James, please.

452
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,820
We don't want to feel bad.

453
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,220
Change takes time.

454
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,460
Change takes time.

455
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,140
Change takes time.

456
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,060
There's no sex in there.

457
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,260
Change takes time.

458
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,020
Change takes time.

459
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,280
Change takes time.

460
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,620
I'm a human being.

461
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,000
Change takes time.

462
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,800
There's no sex in there.

463
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,260
Change takes time.

464
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,500
Change takes time.

465
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,940
Change takes time.

466
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,480
Change takes time.

467
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,620
Change takes time.

468
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,040
We don't want to feel bad.

469
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,380
We don't want to feel bad.

470
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,700
We don't want to feel bad.

471
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,680
We don't want to feel bad.

472
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,840
We don't want to feel bad.

473
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:26,840


474
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,080
We don't want to feel bad.

475
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,240
We don't want to feel bad.

476
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,440
Baby, you ought to be bad

477
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:41,720
Come, mio, baby

478
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,740
Come, mio, baby

479
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,120
Come, mio, baby

480
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,260
Come, mio, baby

481
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,260
Come, mio, baby

482
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,960
Come, mio, baby

483
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,480
Come, mio, baby

484
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,140
Come, mio, baby

485
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,420
POSSIBILITY!

486
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,060
POSSIBILITY!

487
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,640
Just relax.

488
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:19,940
POSSIBILITY!

489
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,480
POSSIBILITY will never end.

490
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,540
Just relax, dear friends.

491
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,360
Don't worry about the screams.

492
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,500
The church of the subgenius isn't here to hurt you.

493
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,160
No, no, nothing like that.

494
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,640
That was Quark, by the way,

495
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,320
a tape sent to the church headquarters here in Dallas

496
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,560
from Atlanta, Georgia.

497
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,960
Never heard from him before,

498
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,580
but the other four songs on this tape are great.

499
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,300
You'll hear them next time.

500
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,900
You'll never hear them anywhere else,

501
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,720
because you never see the materials

502
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,160
of the subgenius church anywhere else

503
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,060
until years later after they've become famous.

504
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,340
You wouldn't believe how many people

505
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,340
you watch on TV now

506
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:03,260
that were subgenius $10 members back in 1980.

507
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,980
Saw one in a movie last night.

508
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,580
Interesting the way that works.

509
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,040
Yeah.

510
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,120
When was the last time you sank

511
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,020
to the untamed groove of white man?

512
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,600
When was the last time you witnessed

513
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,300
shallow rain at Deep Ellum's finest,

514
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,800
funkiest venue?

515
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,880
Club Dada.

516
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,480
When was the last time you were healed

517
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,920
by ultra-healer and inspirational speaker,

518
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,000
the Reverend Bob?

519
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,900
Not to be associated with the church of the subgenius.

520
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,640
Your favorite radio station, KNON.

521
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,280
Make this your first time

522
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,540
or your long-awaited next time

523
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,280
to do all of the above.

524
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,980
For on Wednesday, April 20th,

525
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,280
KNON and Club Dada Productions

526
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,460
proudly present white man, shallow rain,

527
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,160
and the Reverend Bob.

528
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,100
Two bands, two unique sounds,

529
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,100
one inspirational speaker, $5,

530
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,180
one night of healing and rocking.

531
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,360
2720 Elm Street at Club Dada.

532
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,100
I'll see you on Wednesday night, April 20th.

533
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,900
He instantly becomes another one of those dumb minorities.

534
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,640
And we can tolerate his kind.

535
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,040
Yes, friends, this is probably a good time

536
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,040
for me to just drop in and mention that

537
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,320
the Reverend Bob that you see playing in clubs

538
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,460
around Deep Elm and Lower Greenville

539
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,960
is a very, very funny individual

540
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,280
and does a great takeoff on fundamentalist religion.

541
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,180
He has been calling himself Reverend Bob

542
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:46,140
since long before Bob Dobbs

543
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,740
revealed his secret doctrine to us

544
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,060
at the church of the subgenius.

545
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,020
So though we do not know

546
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,840
or disassociate ourselves from the Reverend Bob

547
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,800
you often see in public,

548
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,100
we condone and endorse his humor.

549
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,840
However, what we're doing is not humor.

550
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,520
This is not a comedy show.

551
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:12,780
Everything you hear on here is absolute gospel truth

552
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,460
according to the word of that man, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

553
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,680
who would not be caught dead ranting or doing comedy.

554
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,440
Comedy!

555
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,540
I mean, not even me would be caught dead

556
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,960
doing comedy at some local dive.

557
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,400
I've had to get out there and try to preach the word.

558
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,740
They often call it comedy to attract people,

559
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,900
but that's what it's required.

560
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:41,300
For those of you who are brand new to this

561
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:45,700
and wonder what all this subgenius thing is about,

562
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,260
I'll give you a quick history here, okay?

563
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,980
Oh, this is from Prescriptures 1871.

564
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,420
In the book of the subgenius.

565
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,140
Simon & Schuster publication.

566
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,740
The music in the background is by Martin Mothersbaugh.

567
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:10,280
Long, long ago, during the years of trouble,

568
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:15,820
when all the northern fathers still slept beneath the glaciers,

569
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:22,860
there lived the being we now know as J.R. Bob Dobbs.

570
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:28,120
This man, Dobbs, was chosen by Jehovah One

571
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:33,940
for the primary communications from our alien benefactors.

572
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,800
As Bob moved through the stars, he changed the face of them.

573
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:45,700
His ten billion quasi-modalities now vibrate in each of us.

574
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:51,760
This has transformed him into the eternal incarnation

575
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,040
of slack.

576
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,180
From Dobbs came the unreasonable, unreasoned utterances

577
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:04,340
which have since remained forever unerasable.

578
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,420
His brave experimentation with extra-meditation

579
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,240
and fornicationalism on a mass scale

580
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,920
resulted in the rule of the subgenius for the next 12,000 years,

581
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,700
using all humankind as his test flock.

582
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,500
During his span, disaster followed Dobbs,

583
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,460
resulting in the outright obliteration of his physical shell.

584
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,120
Only by careful church-supervised studies

585
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,360
can we now have our first look at the Dobbs shell.

586
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,760
Here is the approved religiofficial bioreconstructoid

587
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,600
seen on slide number four in the corner of your screen,

588
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,560
perfect in every detail.

589
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,320
This is him, our salesman.

590
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:57,160
His skull is shaped a bit differently than ours is today.

591
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:01,100
It is somewhat flattened in the rear and bulges over the brow.

592
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,520
His brain was well devolved.

593
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:08,340
Some theocraticians think that Dobbs did not speak at all,

594
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,160
or that if he did, he did not have what we would call a language.

595
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,500
He wears the suit.

596
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,360
His hands and feet are like ours.

597
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,180
He was left-handed.

598
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:26,160
The briefcase he holds sent the signals that launched the rockets of cleansing,

599
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,460
the blessed vehicles of our birth, we the mutants.

600
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:37,600
He is seen here, standing in the wreckage of Earth, his native planet.

601
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:46,240
That's from the directions of the model Plasticos de Don Dobbs

602
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:46,920
and the

603
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,220
The

604
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,020
The

605
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,440
The

606
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:50,860
The

The

608
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:50,960
The

609
00:30:50,960 --> 00:31:20,940

625
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,720
The world ends tomorrow, and you may die.

626
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,740
Self-preservation came first.

627
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:46,220
Kill or be killed was the fundamental law.

629
00:37:49,620 --> 00:38:01,720
After an infinity of groping in the darkness, man was beginning to find some answers, to understand the values which lay in group living and mutual assistance.

630
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:32,020
You do what you do because you want to. I do what I do because Bob told me to. That's all I need and that's all you should need.

631
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:41,320
Here's your instructions. Okay, you want instructions? You want to know what you really think? Here it is. Here's the truth.

632
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:49,040
Resist all conspiracy normal programming. Be different from them. Ignore or distort.

633
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:58,540
All fashion. Kill them in the streets. Hunt them down. Smash all governments and exterminate all leaders.

634
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:05,140
Resist all conformity. Speak out for complete mutant freedom.

635
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:12,620
Laugh at them. Laugh at them before you kill. Whisper rumors in the dead of night.

636
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:19,600
Build fallout shelters and arm them. Buy comic books and read them.

637
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:26,620
As religious tracts, for they are. Prepare for the end.

638
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:36,760
Mutter while walking along the streets. Eat junk. Run wild. Don't question authority. Destroy it in public.

639
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:43,980
Quote bizarre sources. Don't follow any trend. Lie.

640
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,080
Make bombs and guns validate all emotions.

641
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:59,240
Disrupt the orderly flow of life. Speak up. Speak up. Declare your difference.

642
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:09,500
Scream aloud the truth in public. Make them hear you. Store food. Hoard things. Carry weapons.

643
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:19,600
Die. Die. Cause the dead to walk. Play with toys. Spend all your money. Buy. Live it up. Be a man.

644
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:27,580
Behave poorly. Fire shots into the night. Argue with them. Practice death and fertility rituals.

645
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:34,580
Design your own church. Pray and invoke the forgotten ones.

646
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:39,580
Search for the elder gods. Steal and rob.

647
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:45,180
Make burnt offerings. Make sacrifices to childhood gods.

648
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:49,600
Believe in devils. Watch the skies for UFOs.

649
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,760
Or Jesus.

650
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,120
Break out. Mutate all over the place.

651
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:59,460
Strike fear into the hearts of normals.

652
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:04,400
Alienate all humans. Vandalize. Don't play it safe.

653
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:09,200
See what you can get away with. Get drunk. Watch TV all day long.

654
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:13,160
Indulge yourself. Stop caring. Never give up.

655
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:16,860
Declare your freedom. Quit your job and slack off.

656
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,600
Make the weird signs. Consort yourself.

657
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,140
Work with strange characters. Con your family and friends.

658
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,820
Listen! Look for art and beauty in the gutter.

659
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,380
Make tapes of winos. Go to bed.

660
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:37,100
Cure yourself. Invent things. Snarl at people. Be free.

661
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,220
Hooray!

662
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:44,080
Marry people. Levitate. Baptize. Cast out the false prophets.

663
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:47,880
Burn. Burn. Smite the arch demons.

664
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,980
Contact aliens, space gods and monsters.

665
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,540
Use black magic to probe the secrets of the universe.

666
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:59,020
Come out on top. Make up theories to explain everything.

667
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,080
Goof off. Tell stories. Don't give in.

668
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,000
Do things your way. Don't listen to the crap.

669
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,700
Understand the bowels that exist.

670
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:14,860
Make public your superiority. Laugh. Damn.

671
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,820
Curse. Get revenge. Play mean jokes.

672
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:21,980
Stay up all night. Go on a binge. Explode in a rage.

673
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:26,900
Take out your frustrations. Rationalize. Let it all seem unreal.

674
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,780
Fall in love. Punch out the boss. Control the world.

675
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:35,080
Create life in your basement.

676
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,880
The Savage Beat is everywhere.

677
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:52,740
We are the Savage Beat.

678
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,080
Hey! Hey!

679
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,380
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Yeah!

680
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,500
Yes!

681
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:11,080
It's the scream that knocks you out when you go down for the count.

682
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,800
It's the dream becoming reality and the battle cry of success.

683
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:26,240
seduction. Estimal? It's true! I know you asked me how it all began, but it seems it's

684
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,900
always been like that.

685
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:29,760
Aye! Aye!

686
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,920
Whoa, whoa, yeah!

687
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,040
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

688
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,640
Yeah!

689
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:51,560
Saturday afternoon in my living room, I was looking for some housekeeping. He said he

690
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,360
was Nicaraguan, but sometimes he was Dominican, too.

691
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,040
It's true!

692
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,720
The star in his eyes could have filled the book of Revelations.

693
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,440
And after his lips wet, thinking no candles and 50 faces.

694
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,160
Really, it's true!

695
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:23,100
I know what you're thinking right now, but I was weak and backsliding, and I liked it!

696
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,160
Ow, yeah!

697
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,600
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

698
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,760
Do it to my fever now!

699
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,000
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

700
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,620
This has nothing to do with me!

701
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,240
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

702
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:42,240


703
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,960
It's just a simple realization.

704
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:53,800
There's a point in space and time where everything comes to a grinding halt.

705
00:44:54,860 --> 00:45:02,640
Once you make eye contact like I did, you can't be responsible for your actions!

706
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:10,020
Fascination becomes participation as consciousness slips away into...

707
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:10,840
Ow!

708
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:16,240
Screaming at you out when you go down for the count.

709
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:24,640
It's a dream becoming reality and the battle cry of seduction.

710
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:25,780
Hey!

711
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,260
I really do these things!

712
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,480
Hey!

713
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:36,240
I told you, it's true!

714
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,860
Oh, yeah!

715
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,540
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

716
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,120
Oh, yeah!

717
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,220
Oh, yeah!

718
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,820
Oh, yeah!

719
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,140
Ow, ow!

720
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,480
Ooooooooooow!

721
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,120
Ov, ov, oerin', ho!

722
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:08,320
Spirit!

723
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,620
Get em out of here now!

724
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,700
Oh, yeah!

725
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,320
Oh, oh, oh!

726
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,920
Oh!

727
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,420
Oh, oh, oh!

728
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:59,560
Oh, oh!

729
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,840
Oh!

730
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:08,120
Oh, oh!

731
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,640
Oh!

732
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,380
Oh!

733
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:20,660
Oh!

734
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,180
Oh!

735
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:23,980


736
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:25,300
Oh!

737
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,740
The Church of the Subgenius, dear friends.

738
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:38,060
Bob wants you to use the things you were born with.

739
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,500
Why do you think you were born with them?

740
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:44,020
Why do you think the Lord made it feel so good?

741
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:50,580
Oh!

742
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,900
Och...

743
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:56,020
Oh O родной Th Contact

744
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:56,020


745
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:56,020


746
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:56,020


747
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:56,520
Oh!

748
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,020
V Mt.

749
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:18,160
Become the mad scientist of your dreams. There's no reason why not to.

750
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:27,440
Bob is here. He's the proof that everything you know is true. You may now proceed.

751
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:39,400
Conjure monsters! Conjure monsters! Shout it out! Speak in tongues! Talk to gods! Give up on idiots!

752
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:48,860
Never pay for it! Get out of having to do things! Put it all off! Don't bother with it! Collect things!

753
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:58,400
Dream your life away! Study what is banned! Bone up on the forbidden sciences! Believe in the occult!

754
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:06,980
Have guts! Prove you're weirder than they are! Scare the beed Jesus out of them! Be sick! Do whatever you want!

755
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,320
Justify your guilt!

756
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:18,460
Never play into their hands! Be evil! Be good! Be neither! Size up the situation! Open your eyes!

757
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:26,600
Don't do what they say! Trick them! Walk on your hands! Make your house into a castle! Defend yourself! Write letters!

758
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:38,300
Expose them at every turn! Hide out! Go underground and stay there! Break promises! Cast off all responsibility! Don't accept anything!

759
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:39,380
There are others!

760
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:50,300
There are no laws! Everything is permitted! Get angry! Act ape-like! Become an overman! Band together with other true mutants!

761
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:57,700
Discover your history! Learn your past lives! Travel in time! Stripe back! Plot to take over!

762
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:06,680
Be unreasonable in everything! Dare! Battle with the arcane forces of space and time!

763
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,380
Know thyself!

764
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:39,180
Program the computer god! Confront the demons of your own soul! Arise! Stare into the void! Dance at the edge of the abyss! Use ESP! Travel to the stars on the solar winds! Jump in the leaves! Abandon the darkness! Embrace it all! Sell your soul to the old ones! Spy on them! Penetrate their lives! Make yourself be heard! Go crazy! Take a stand for mutant freedom before it's too late!

765
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:42,500
Start to penetrate their lies!

766
00:50:44,040 --> 00:51:00,460
Protest it all! Don't try to be cool! Don't be a hip wimp! Get tough! Wake up! Discover the forgotten things! Fool them! Attack their beliefs! Get rich! Warp out on music! Unmask them or kill me!

767
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,020
If you want to support our work! Give us a thumbs up! insisted on providing grants from over 8 million supporters!

768
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:30,020


769
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:30,020


770
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:35,720
I'm burning this tape. I'mope to start praying to God!

771
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,380
i really.

772
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:37,800
Yeon hey, thoi.

773
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,360
terrier.

774
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,720
He's a demon.

775
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,160
God, I must be a demon worshipper.

776
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,280
I just gotta be.

777
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:47,020
Damn.

778
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,380
Bunch of Satanists like this.

779
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,600
Man, I just hope he doesn't

780
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,460
do that creature thing

781
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,320
where he doesn't...

782
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,980
All that talk about Bob, man, makes me

783
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,740
puke, you know what I'm saying?

784
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:06,340
I, uh...

785
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,580
There is a great pestilence upon this land.

786
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:12,780
Here he goes.

787
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,960
Or is it a great mortarance?

788
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:16,780
Oh, Nick Smith again.

789
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:20,120
There is a great mortar and pestilence

790
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,180
upon the land.

791
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,020
I never let see.

792
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:29,960
It is a common thing

793
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,020
among our youth today

794
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:33,560
to become

795
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,340
one with...

796
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:37,600
the monster predicted in the Bible.

797
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:40,160
Its core, a seething mass

798
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,160
of lethal radiation.

799
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,300
Its head,

800
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,480
the head of Philodrumon.

801
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:47,340
Runs its legs

802
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:50,000
over the brains of the listener.

803
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,600
And with the secondary brain

804
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:54,140
located at the base of the spine.

805
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:55,420
There's no brain anywhere around here.

806
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:57,380
While in its forepaws, it bears a cup

807
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,900
bearing all the abominations

808
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,200
and filthiness of the world.

809
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:04,600
This hideous creature

810
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,100
shambling around

811
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:08,460
this shambling mob

812
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,500
is waiting for something to be born.

813
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,440
The basement of my spine.

814
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,420
The basement of your spine, yes.

815
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,580
As Cyclonians 425 tells us,

816
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:17,960
he was delivered

817
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,720
and eviscerated for our sins

818
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:22,560
and was regurgitated to live in death

819
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,860
for life that is in him

820
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:24,740
for the just and only

821
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:25,780
of our sins.

822
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:30,460
As we wander

823
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,140
Hey, Dr. Drummond,

824
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:32,860
do you have a light?

825
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,600
I'm still here, though.

826
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:37,080
Oh, no cigars for you, Stang.

827
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,200
Have some fresh lemonade.

828
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:39,520
Okay, that's right.

829
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,260
Okay, goodbye.

830
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:41,780
Here goes.

831
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,160
Farewell, farewell.

832
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,280
But this I shall see you

833
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,140
at our wedding, yes.

834
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:54,560
Ah, that felt good.

835
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,160
Evaporated.

836
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:59,280
I feel like the phylo's gone out of my head.

837
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,000
Every color that is destroyed

838
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,700
gives us terror.

839
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:04,160
Ah, destroyed.

840
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:05,900
By the sound.

841
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,920
Though the dear Bob

842
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,420
he made and loved us all.

843
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,100
You can tell it's getting down near the end.

844
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:14,860
Is that the show deflating?

845
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,720
Have we got a leak in the show?

846
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:17,660
Man,

847
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,760
we're gonna have to land soon.

848
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,560
Which of which of this

849
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,540
There's plenty of waste gas in the show.

850
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,460
Look at the ozone bubbling up.

851
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,540
In fact, I would say waste gas powers the show.

852
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:30,680
Look at that spark leap across the gas.

853
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,500
Yeah, don't let it spark across the waste gas.

854
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:34,760
Don't look directly at that arc.

855
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,940
It can burn out your eyes.

856
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,700
Don't look at the spark in the waste gas.

857
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,860
Show error, one conspiracy per breath.

858
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:42,180
A penny a puff.

859
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:45,300
And a pound a poop.

860
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,120
Isn't that the way it is?

861
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:50,480
You pay more to get rid of it

862
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,840
than you're good to get it.

863
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,880
Is that the way it is in your life, my friend?

864
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,540
Look at this disgusting

865
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:57,640
organic mess.

866
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,460
You know what this heaving monstrosity is?

867
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,840
It's every piece of meat you ever ate in your life.

868
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:04,520
Now it's back to us.

869
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:07,780
The need for one gigantic creature

870
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,420
which we call

871
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:10,860
the Overslime.

872
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:14,680
We begin show sequence four.

873
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,740
The Overslime.

874
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,960
Bob stuck new pets

875
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,840
in Overslime maintenance.

876
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,780
Edit show mode seven.

877
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,500
Young Adam Cadman Dobbs

878
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,300
brought home the Overslime one day.

879
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:27,820
Oh, show deflating.

880
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,660
Two night of slack shooting tape.

881
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,840
As Connie shows support mechanism.

882
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:32,660
Can I actually do this?

883
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:34,940
The tapes did not die because he had to.

884
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:36,780
Wellman chose to kill him

885
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:38,580
on the stage for unique everyone.

886
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,840
But mainly for his own reasons.

887
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,180
This man was handed over to you

888
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:45,200
by Dobbs who set purpose and knowledge.

889
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:46,620
And he, of course,

890
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:49,320
is the making to the people at Overslime

891
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,000
with the help of Rucos,

892
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:51,940
Pinkton, Wands,

893
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
putting together by nailing him with raw

894
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,660
cat hairs of Wellman's gums.

895
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,260
And who got up in the morning

896
00:55:58,860 --> 00:55:59,960
just to be able to slay him?

897
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,700
This computer is incapable

898
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,700
of saying things like that.

899
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,160
It was impossible to make it so.

900
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,600
Little other computers hurting brain now.

901
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,680
Yes, friends, that's what happens.

902
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,980
That's what the show does to you.

903
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,220
Especially this show in Berkeley.

904
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:16,920
That was puzzling evidence.

905
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:19,300
Dr. Howell, the evil Dr. Howell,

906
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:20,140
Gary Gabrogfran,

907
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,880
and myself for once.

908
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,580
That's it.

909
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:26,280
On KPFA in Berkeley.

910
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,380
But this is KNON 90.9

911
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:29,940
in Dallas, Texas in the morning.

912
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,320
And this is what happens to you

913
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,640
when you get too much show here.

914
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:00,680
Who's that?

915
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:01,660
Oh, I know, I know.

916
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:02,400
It was the other one.

917
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:03,940
You're moving too fast for me.

918
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,200
I'll just sit over here and relax.

919
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:09,740
Yeah, just relax.

920
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:12,580
Just relax.

921
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:14,680
I'm having a good trip.

922
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,280
I'll start again.

923
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,500
I'll talk a little bit slower.

924
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:21,080
If you start talking slower,

925
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:23,020
then I'll have to concentrate on what I'm saying

926
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:24,620
and then I'll start getting into this stream of consciousness

927
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:26,100
just like it's coming out of my mind as soon as I think it.

928
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:26,660
I can't think of it anymore.

929
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,520
So just think and just talk slow.

930
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:33,260
Or else.

931
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,040
Yeah, oh yeah man, I can dig that.

932
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,300
That's cool. That's cool.

933
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:39,280
Hey, well, uh, not to get too excited or anything,

934
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:41,220
but, uh, you got any more of those pills?

935
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,320
Oh, you mean those green pills?

936
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,080
Or those, uh...

937
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,520
Actually, the red ones would be really cool.

938
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,060
You don't want to try the red ones.

939
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:49,860
You see what's happening already.

940
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:50,760
Oh yeah, the red ones. Those are the good ones.

941
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,640
Yeah, I like the red ones.

942
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,360
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

943
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,360
You can't have any more red ones.

944
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:55,140
Give me the bag back.

945
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:57,400
There's something weird going on.

946
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,040
It's slightly delayed. I can hear a little feedback.

947
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:02,640
Yeah, do you hear the echo in the room?

948
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,140
It's not an echo.

949
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:07,460
Let's just take a little more pills.

950
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:11,640
Oh, you gotta be careful about them pills, friends.

951
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:13,960
Oh, yeah.

952
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,120
You gotta be real careful.

953
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:17,660
I want you to write for information

954
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,400
from the Church of the Subgenius.

955
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:21,600
Free information

956
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:23,340
in this video.

957
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:24,360
This outreach...

958
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,740
trying to bring

959
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:27,840
succor

960
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:30,640
to the suckers, you might say.

961
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:32,420
No, no, not really. To the mutants.

962
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,100
Sounds funny to say that.

963
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:37,320
Sometimes we make it sound like a funny joke.

964
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:38,900
Ha, ha, ha.

965
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,160
It's not that funny.

966
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:44,260
Well, what should I get out on? Shoot.

967
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,740
This is the rain.

968
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,900
We got three minutes to go until

969
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,780
Robert Wisdom's

970
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:52,300
American Music Party.

971
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:53,900
I think we got into it pretty good.

972
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,100
This is the Rainmakers song.

973
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,960
This is their Bigfoot type song.

974
00:58:57,060 --> 00:59:00,200
I thought about saving it until we did a Bigfoot show,

975
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,520
but it's not really about Bigfoot.

976
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:03,740
It's really about crazy people.

977
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:05,040
And that's why you need to write

978
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:09,380
Bob at P.O. Box 140306

979
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,440
Dallas, Texas.

980
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:10,980
Oh, yes.

981
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:14,320
Dallas, Texas 75214.

982
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,840
That's Bob at

983
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,380
P.O. Box 140306

984
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:21,360
Dallas, Texas 75214.

985
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:22,840
Thank you.

986
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:48,560
I'm Bob at P.O. Box 140306

987
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:49,160
You can find me on

988
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,580
www.daviddick.com

989
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:51,240
I'll see you next time.

990
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:51,260


991
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:51,480


992
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:52,080
Bye.

993
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:52,300
Bye.

994
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:52,680


995
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:52,680


996
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:52,680


997
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:52,680


998
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:52,680


999
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:52,900
Bye.

1000
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,100
There's a wild man

1001
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,200
Lives in the woods

1002
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,840
Outside of town

1003
00:59:58,900 --> 00:59:59,540
Howls at the moon

1004
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:01,360
Listen if you can

1005
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:04,680
You might hear the late view man

1006
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:05,760
. . .

1007
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,440
Some say he was a soldier

1008
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,040
Who came home from war

1009
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:25,440
All in one piece but with emotional scars

1010
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:29,100
We'll be on the story, argue about the days

1011
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:32,540
Vietnam or the war between the states

1012
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:35,780
And the late new man is a wild man

1013
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:39,580
Lives in the woods outside of town

1014
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:42,960
Bow to the moon, listen if you can

1015
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:46,300
You might hear the late new man

1016
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,080
guitar solo

1017
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:03,760
I took the shortcut to the river last night

1018
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,240
A beard and a blur in the long mean lights

1019
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:10,620
We drank a few beers, skipped a few stones

1020
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:14,160
And I drove a little faster on the way back home

1021
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,160
guitar solo

1022
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:31,460
A dog disappears, a cow is found dead

1023
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:34,900
A chicken is missing, bound missing its head

1024
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:38,440
Shotgun gone, bread in the sand

1025
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:41,780
Two toes shy of the late new man

1026
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:45,100
The late new man is a wild man

1027
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:48,920
Lives in the woods outside of town

1028
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:52,280
Bow to the moon, listen if you can

1029
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,620
You might hear the late new man

1030
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:59,000
Cause the late new man is a wild man

1031
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,800
Lives in the woods outside of town

1032
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:06,140
Bow to the moon, listen if you can

1033
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:09,580
You might hear the late new man

1034
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:13,120
You might hear the late new man

1035
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:16,620
You might hear the late new man

1036
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:19,960
You might hear the late new man

1037
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:20,700
guitar solo

1038
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:26,880
A dog disappears, a cow is found dead

1039
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:32,140
He lives in the woods outside of town

1040
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:33,100
A chicken is missing, bound missing its head

1041
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:33,100


1042
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:33,340
A dog disappears, a cow is found dead
