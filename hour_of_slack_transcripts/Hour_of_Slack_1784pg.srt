1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,920
Well, boys, I reckon this is it.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,620
The Self-Genius Power of Swatch.

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,080
Now, I want all privately owned radios to be immediately impounded.

4
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,060
After you've done that, report back to me.

5
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:38,000
Ah, dear friends, last episode was all new and pretty serious.

6
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,720
This one is pretty old and very cosmic.

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,740
It's not, however, a rerun, but more like a long-lost classic recently unearthed.

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,420
I found the master recording of an ESO Swamp Radio and Brain Rot Theater show

9
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,980
that I had sat in on while visiting.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,880
I was visiting WCSB in Cleveland in July of 1994,

11
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,280
long before I'd moved there.

12
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,980
I didn't really know the host, the late Professor Chaz Smith,

13
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,600
or his regular guest, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, all that well then,

14
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,700
or even Princess Wee, who was just my buddy then.

15
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,220
But we were all young and in our prime with the fire in the belly,

16
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,680
and it really shows in shows like this.

17
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,980
I've used the P.S.

18
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,440
of it before on Ancient Hours of Slack,

19
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,540
numbers 455 through 457,

20
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,520
which were rerun again a few years back,

21
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,000
but it was all chopped up and besmirched and intercut with other tracks,

22
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,600
which was fine then,

23
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,120
but this recording actually stands alone just fine,

24
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,560
probably much better,

25
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,920
and this is certainly a superior reproduction of the original master recording.

26
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,540
It was, in fact,

27
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,720
two hours long,

28
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,040
and will probably run the second hour next week.

29
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,400
Here, then,

30
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,520
is a remarkable historic document,

31
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:15,140
the original master recording of the July 1994 ESO Swamp Radio Show

32
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,980
from WCSB,

33
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,540
which contains, among other epic things,

34
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,820
the uncut improv session later called Lonesome Cowboy Dave in Space,

35
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,520
not to be confused with Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

36
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,580
Cowboy Dave in Hell,

37
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,860
or Lonesome Cowboy Dave in Neighborworld.

38
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,920
Praise Bob,

39
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,120
praise Chaz and Dave.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,960
Oh, and by the way,

41
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,080
I think all the music is being performed live at the station.

42
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:45,980
Yeah.

43
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,260
Yeah.

44
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:50,840


45
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,040
Yeah.

46
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:54,900
Yeah.

47
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,800
Yeah.

48
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:56,620
Yeah.

49
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,420
Yeah.

50
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:57,680
Yeah.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,640
Yeah.

52
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,440
Yeah.

53
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,500


54
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,500


55
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,500


56
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,500


57
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,500


58
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,500


59
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,720
Yeah.

60
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,540
Yeah.

61
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,780
Yeah.

62
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,320
Yeah.

63
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,940
Yeah.

64
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,440
Yeah.

65
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:24,680
Yeah.

66
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,640
Yeah.

67
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:25,640


68
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:25,960
Yeah.

69
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,600
Yeah.

70
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,460
Yeah.

71
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:27,460


72
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,000
Yeah.

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,000


74
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,520
Yeah.

75
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:29,520


76
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:11,480
Men of Earth, seize all atomic testing.

77
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,760
90,000 TV channels will praise Bob.

78
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,520
Bob.

79
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,540
The day when they pass out sandwiches in little yellow trucks,

80
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,020
there'd be one smiling face standing out there.

81
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,740
It'd be the face of J.R. Bob Dodds, handing out plasma bags to children in need.

82
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:49,160
All the children in Joker Town go to buy their plastic bags from Bob.

83
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,540
No wonder.

84
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,700
They don't have any souls.

85
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,180
They don't have any souls on the shoes of their feet.

86
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,800
They walk around flapping around like little clowns in a circus,

87
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,480
but they're happy all the time.

88
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,760
That ice cream truck has got the right stuff.

89
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,300
The best kind of frozen plastic bags.

90
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:15,500
Bob could sell plastic ice cream bags in Joker Town.

91
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,720
He could sell ice to Eskimos.

92
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,780
And he could sell...

93
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,020
Eight.

94
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,760
Even to a subgenius.

95
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,580
Bob Dodds sold ice to Eskimos.

96
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,820
He sold the plans to the Brooklyn Bridge.

97
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,080
He sold the Brooklyn Bridge.

98
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,860
He'd been around the world a thousand times.

99
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,080
He'd sold more things than you'd ever seen, buddy.

100
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,800
He was born to sell.

101
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,940
He was born to sell.

102
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,020
Yeah, he got to start selling lightning rods.

103
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,960
He'd sell a family of lightning rods,

104
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,500
and then he'd pray down a lightning bolt to demonstrate.

105
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:52,940
Usually worked.

106
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:52,940


107
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:52,940


108
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,820
Usually worked.

109
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,060
These ain't the old ways.

110
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,640
You get them coming both ways.

111
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,220
You get them coming and going, see?

112
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,540
Now, that's the old school.

113
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,780
That's not a con job.

114
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,300
That's not a con job, see?

115
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,200
That's just giving people what they want.

116
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,200
What they want, see?

117
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,020
You gotta give them what they want.

118
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,860
You gotta give them what they want.

119
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,240
It's just that they have to be told what they want,

120
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,480
and that's what we're here for, friends.

121
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,740
We just want to tell you this.

122
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,860
We want to tell you what you want.

123
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,040
Of course, we're gonna hint around about it,

124
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,560
because we can't just come out and say it.

125
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,580
It wouldn't do you any good to learn it that way.

126
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,280
No, you need instructions.

127
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,780
You must be carefully instructed.

128
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,160
You must listen.

129
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,500
You must pay attention.

130
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,640
You must close your mind to all extraneous thoughts.

131
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,580
Now listen.

132
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,380
Begin.

133
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,740
Now listen.

134
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,420
We just want to ease you into it, kid.

135
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,960
You know, it can backfire if you try to go too far too fast.

136
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,940
Too much too fast.

137
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,340
Look what happened to him.

138
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:08,080
Look at that pathetic excuse for a biped.

139
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,360
Sad, ain't it?

140
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,120
It could happen to you, too.

141
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,120
So that's why we...

142
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,780
You know, we don't want to hurt you.

143
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,020
And we don't want the lawsuits.

144
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,480
So you'll just have to be patient.

145
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,280
Understanding, or in this case, its opposite,

146
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,920
can only be imparted over a long period of time,

147
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,040
unless you're spending a lot on it.

148
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,040
But we could probably turn you on to it real fast.

149
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,420
If you wanted to, you know, pay for the plane ticket to Malaysia,

150
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,170
or the plane tickets to Malaysia.

151
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,150
Malaysia.

152
00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:00,950
This music reminds me of the lovely old folk songs

153
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,970
that the natives there in Dobstown

154
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:09,010
and the jungles outside of Dobstown in Malaysia used to play

155
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,270
while the bobbies work out in the fields.

156
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,930
Well, they turn yak butter.

157
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:18,470
Some of them get around and start dancing and sing that Malaysian folk song

158
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,450
while they're turning the butter, and their feet would just get all sore.

159
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:27,670
Well, Bob and Gordon would sit up there with a hot buttered rum martini

160
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:31,430
being fanned by sycophants,

161
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:38,890
taking the occasional pot shot at anything that moved out in the jungle just for fun.

162
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,210
An infamous potpourri.

163
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,190
Do you mean an infamous potpourri?

164
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:48,370
A lavish land where everyone laid everything at everyone's feet at all times,

165
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,390
where there was no room for any kind of incidents.

166
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,070
No sense of pain or miscreant feeling.

167
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,130
Everything was according to plan.

168
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:59,750
What a super sumptuous planet it was.

169
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,430
It was a sumptuous planet.

170
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,170
We fed well on it.

171
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,010
Now it's used up.

172
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,270
We'll have to move on.

173
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,390
Edamame!

174
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,770
Move on!

175
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,210
Yee-haw! New planet!

176
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,590
I can't breathe!

177
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:30,290
Yeah, I was gonna go on a planet diet, but I decided to put it off till tomorrow.

178
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:35,070
I thought I was gonna chew cosmic holes, big pieces of black debris,

179
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,290
coming down my gutter every day, every minute, every hour.

180
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,030
I'd keep on eating until everything was gone.

181
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,990
I'd chew all the matter up. I'd chew into empty space.

182
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,410
That's... it's God's will.

183
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,510
He said be fruitful and multiply and eat up everything and overpopulate

184
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:55,630
until you turn the planet over on its side from the weight of sheer humanity.

185
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,810
And then start eating.

186
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,410
And just dig in, folks.

187
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,990
That's a pensive, mighty good planet.

188
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,350
Just dig right in.

189
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,330
I mean, look, I'm eating the lizard, too.

190
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,930
Now, what else is there around here?

191
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,650
Mars. No, that didn't taste that good.

192
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,330
Kind of dry.

193
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,870
Venus. No, that's bitter.

194
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,510
It's bitter.

195
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,670
Kind of got a bad tangle.

196
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,190
It needs, like, send of one in cheese.

197
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,370
Stop it!

198
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,190
Look, Jupiter!

199
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,590
No, yes, no.

200
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,470
Hey, let's... give me that salt.

201
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:29,470
All right!

202
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,310
Let's see how Jupiter tastes with some salt on it.

203
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,630
Oh, la, la.

204
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,310
Quelle saveur.

205
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,910
Mm-mm, le saveur de Jupiter.

206
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,750
Le grand bleu d'or.

207
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,230
I want the red spot.

208
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,710
I'll get the red spot.

209
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,370
I'm feeling a little bloated.

210
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,210
I, I, I...

211
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,990
The planet eaters.

212
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:03,290
Sometimes their brains were no bigger than the average peanut.

213
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:07,730
A few of them gathered around Greek concubines and argued theology.

214
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,730
They weren't made for the task at hand.

215
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,350
They weren't really a warrior clan.

216
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:16,050
They didn't enjoy eating planets, per se.

217
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:21,590
It was, it was a hobby that had to be fulfilled in some traditional mission.

218
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,050
But they continued.

219
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:26,930
They, they persevered begrudgingly.

220
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,350
They had to.

221
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:37,050
And even after their great bulk became so vast that their own bones could not support them

222
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:42,770
and they had to be fed planets by the planet delivery angels.

223
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,690
Planet delivery.

224
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:46,530
I mean...

225
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,050
Mount Olympus.

226
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:51,350
Yep.

227
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,530
Went downhill.

228
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,690
After Dobbs moved it to Malaysia.

229
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,710
Kidnapped.

230
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,570
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.

231
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:01,930
Huh?

232
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,390
This is ESO Radio.

233
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,250
And, uh, my name is Chas.

234
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:14,750
And, there are some people in the studio tonight that will be speaking.

235
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,030
They are going to go on an adventure.

236
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,030


237
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,890
And there you are.

238
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,510
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

239
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,050
That's me.

240
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,810
The Reverend Ivan Stang.

241
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:26,750
That's me.

242
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:29,610
And...

243
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,410
Oh, I'm the Princess We Are Doe.

244
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:38,010
And the mighty Princess We Are Doe

245
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,590
will be connecting their synapses

246
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:47,030
and flying at an altitude of 50,000 feet above the surface of the moon,

247
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,330
which is just high enough to be snagged up by the Columbia

248
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,210
if something should go wrong.

249
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,990
So don't fear.

250
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,450
Oh, the moon is just a condiment.

251
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:03,250
It's just the onion we put on the great bun of Earth.

252
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:03,710
The onion ring.

253
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,550
Just a little piece of chutney we put on the window loop.

254
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,470
Just a little tiny spicy taste to add to the rest.

255
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,530
The fun number...

256
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,770
is 6873515.

257
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,330
And maybe I will answer it.

258
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,090
And maybe I won't.

259
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,390
But I probably will.

260
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,970
And he is the finest chef.

261
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:27,630
He adds just the perfect species to each planet

262
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:31,090
that will create the most toxic hell runoffs

263
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,930
from industrial pollution and so forth.

264
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:37,150
They're just the flavors we most enjoy

265
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:42,310
in a fine, fine steaming hot bowl of planet.

266
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,670
This is not the perspiration they drop in the pan.

267
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,550
The perspiration from his nipples.

268
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:51,670
Now, this is a real, real toxic waste of every kind

269
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,150
to add to the...

270
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:57,050
Ultimately, I suppose the dish is a nice soul.

271
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,950
It's cultivation of a nice human.

272
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,090
You don't want to say, but a human, mostly soul, right?

273
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,010
Human soul.

274
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,510
Yes, with nipples, as you say.

275
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,970
Oh, again, the work of my...

276
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,470
Your transmission.

277
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,150
Be good.

278
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,230
This is the radio check.

279
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,510
Over.

280
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:14,410
Over.

281
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,450
We are flying over Mars,

282
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:24,270
and the mountain appears to be in the shape of a gigantic pipe.

283
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,190
We would call it a pipe shape.

284
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:26,950
Like a pipe.

285
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,970
Like, you know, a smoking pipe.

286
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,970
What's the white stuff on the pipe?

287
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,270
I think it might be creamed glass or something.

288
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:37,790
It's a volcanic pipe on the surface of Mars.

289
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,630
That's where the comet hits.

290
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,290
And when it hits, it throws out those...

291
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:50,270
That's the ash that builds up on the rim of the volcanic Martian pipe.

292
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,130
I bet the cool...

293
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,150
Can we go close now?

294
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,810
Because I'm getting very hungry.

295
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,850
I want to eat the babnos.

296
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,370
At the pub.

297
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,990
Anyway, we go down there.

298
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:04,850
The whipped cream is spewing out of the volcano.

299
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,370
Oh, look at that.

300
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,630
Oh, my God.

301
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,230
It's all...

302
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:08,930
Oh, my God.

303
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,990
It is a fiery dottle of...

304
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,430
Of hot whipped cream.

305
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,270
I think that's more than...

306
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:19,190
Our computer shows the pipe-shaped volcano

307
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:22,910
to be 50 times the height of Mount Everest,

308
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,170
the earthly Himalayas.

309
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:25,910
This is so exciting.

310
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,710
I can't remember.

311
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,390
Are you awake?

312
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,110
Oh, look.

313
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:32,930
Oh, look.

314
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:33,490
Oh, look.

315
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:36,390
I think the face, he look like he smile or something.

316
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,970
There's some kind of stupid look on the face.

317
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:39,410
It has...

318
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,350
The entire plateau...

319
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:50,830
Seems to coincidentally appear as if it were a gigantic sculpture of a smiling human face.

320
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,710
See, that's what I told you.

321
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,650
You can look in my mouth.

322
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,790
You look, it's for real.

323
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:55,410
I told you.

324
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,030
I told you.

325
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,670
I told you.

326
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:57,590
You're right.

327
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:57,970
It's right.

328
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:02,530
We consider this, though, simply a geological...

329
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:09,030
Martian geophysical anomaly similar to the so-called Pee Wee Herman face on Mars

330
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,490
and the alleged Elvis face.

331
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:17,610
Obviously, superstitious people will see these same things in clouds.

332
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:23,650
I, myself, saw Jimi Hendrix in the clouds just the other night.

333
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,970
Oh, I get that one.

334
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,650
That was back on Earth.

335
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:35,850
Here we are, stuck in this tiny tuna can,

336
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:41,870
spinning endlessly through the black depths of space.

337
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:49,210
Broadcasting to any pilgrims down below,

338
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:54,030
settlers on the planets of this solar system as we fly by.

339
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:01,630
Coagulation pills will begin taking effect in about five minutes,

340
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:04,170
so just sit back and relax and enjoy the rest of it.

341
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,990
Your body will feel just fine in a few minutes if you don't relax.

342
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:10,710
Take your three doses of Chen.

343
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,150
Yeah.

344
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:11,230
Yeah.

345
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:11,510
Yeah.

346
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,290
Three.

347
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:13,370
And.

348
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,410
Eleven hundred.

349
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,290
Thank you.

350
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:25,270
The tuna fish cans marked Bob Tuna with the large pipe monogram on the outside

351
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:31,430
are not fit for consumption at this time because there's been some sort of mix-up with the commissary there,

352
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:35,350
so please just relax and enjoy one of the cakes or some pie.

353
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,950
Here's Planet Pizza.

354
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:41,330
I'd like to order a Planet Pizza, if you please.

355
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:41,970
Okay.

356
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:42,790
One Planet Pizza.

357
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,070
Would you like anchovies on that?

358
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:51,310
Of course, I'd like a lot of continents and seas and oceans and all that's usual, you know,

359
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,830
just make it one of the planet lovers special.

360
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:55,770
Let's see.

361
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,630
There's no object.

362
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,910
I'd like to order three of them.

363
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:58,790
Three.

364
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,750
Three Planet Pizzas.

365
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,650
You want those populated planets?

366
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:04,670
Of course.

367
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,590
Post-industrial or pre-industrial?

368
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:11,810
I mean, do you want a dinosaur-type planet or do you want a human-type planet?

369
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:15,490
Is this 759-6705-4321?

370
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:17,450
Yes.

371
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:18,890
Oh, well.

372
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,830
Is that Visa or MasterCard?

373
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,630
I'm not quite sure which, but the money is new.

374
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,350
Get it rolling, please.

375
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,250
I'm terribly hungry.

376
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:38,250
Well, that Planet Pizza will be there in 30 minutes or it's free.

377
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,990
Well, that's an absolute record time.

378
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,070
I would appreciate it.

379
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:41,710
Thank you very much.

380
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,170
Thank you.

381
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,210
Thank you for your order.

382
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,150
And thank you for your organs.

383
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:56,450
We want you to remember when you order some of the new pie that we have going for us over here at Rex and Wendy's Pizza,

384
00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:01,450
that free delivery, not only you'll get for a planetary pizza of your own choice,

385
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:09,930
you also get, I think it was macaroni salad and also some soda you get, too.

386
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:11,950
And what?

387
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:19,650
We'll be sending that little almond-eyed gray humanoid around to your door to collect those organs.

388
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:21,130
Snappy.

389
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,890
He'll be in the cute little uniform, so don't be afraid.

390
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,370
They're your friends.

391
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,370
They're here to help.

392
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,150
They're our brothers from the stars.

393
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:36,390
You should believe anything they whisper into your ear in the dead of night as you try to sleep.

394
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,590
Whisper, whisper, whisper.

395
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,830
They're your friends.

396
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:40,710
They're your friends.

397
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,950
They want to help.

398
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:49,930
They want to teach humanity and lead us into a new age of enlightenment under their gray jackboot.

399
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,810
Whisper, whisper.

400
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:54,170
Now listen, now listen, now listen, now listen, now listen.

401
00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:03,090
If you wake up in a vat of poison with little aliens standing around outside the vat,

402
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:09,510
wrapping, tying napkins around their necks, sharpening their knives and forks,

403
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,990
be glad.

404
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:11,570
Be glad.

405
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:14,550
Because you've just fell into the hands of the good aliens.

406
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:19,450
The bad aliens are far, far worse.

407
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,270
Whoa.

408
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,610
Oh, they're not like the thing.

409
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:30,790
That was a cuddly little Benji of an alien compared to what we're...

410
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:34,510
They aren't like aliens in that movie Aliens.

411
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:41,410
Those are silly little werewolves among monsters compared to what we're talking about.

412
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:42,710
What is in the box?

413
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:48,730
What we're talking about is more like what's growing in your refrigerator right now.

414
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:49,950
That's what you're having.

415
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,670
That's what it looks more like.

416
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,050
What is this?

417
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:58,950
The effect is it turns you into the alien.

418
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:06,150
But man, take my word for it, it's worth it.

419
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,670
It's great, man.

420
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,150
It's cool.

421
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,170
You'll love it.

422
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,550
I feel so much better now that I can sleep.

423
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:11,550


424
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,170
It's for your own good.

425
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,530
It's like I got rid of the program.

426
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,550
I feel so much better.

427
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:16,850
I feel so much better.

428
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:17,950
I don't need that anymore.

429
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:18,090
I don't need that anymore.

430
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:18,310
I don't need that anymore.

431
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:18,310


432
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:18,750
What's the matter?

433
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,350
Are you afraid?

434
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,350
What's the matter, you chicken?

435
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:22,870
Come on, man.

436
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,290
Everybody's doing it.

437
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:26,310
Go ahead.

438
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:34,570
Stroke the alien and collect the dew that builds up on the side of its neck like appendage.

439
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,510
Go ahead.

440
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,530
Now demagnetize it.

441
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:41,530


442
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:41,530


443
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:42,270
Now demagnetize your head.

444
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,130
Okay.

445
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,330
I think you know what to do next.

446
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:54,110
I don't think you're the kind of listener that I'd have to explain that to, now are

447
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:54,370
you?

448
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,810
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

449
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:01,390
Yeah, I think they know just what I'm talking about.

450
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,410
Oh, they like it too.

451
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,050
Oh, they're first in the...

452
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,290
Yous, I don't know what to do next.

453
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,510
You stand up on the floor.

454
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:11,510


455
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:11,510


456
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:11,510


457
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:11,510


458
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:11,510


459
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:16,050
You stand on the hillside with your bat call and blow into the bat call.

460
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,710
Don't try to...

461
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,930
It's not like a moose call or a duck call.

462
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,210
You can't hear it.

463
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:21,810
I don't know what to do next, honey.

464
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,550
Yeah, but it's super...

465
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,210
This is superfluous cock.

466
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,790
I'll give you the wrong name.

467
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:33,850
And just make sure you've got your antidote pudding ready for when that bat lands on your

468
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:34,170
face.

469
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,590
You're going to have to use that pudding mighty quick.

470
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,950
That antidote, really?

471
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,250
But it's worth it.

472
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,690
You'll dig it.

473
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,470
Well, I don't know.

474
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:41,490
I don't know.

475
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:41,490


476
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:41,490


477
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:41,490


478
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:41,490


479
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:41,490


480
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,890
I'm kind of scared.

481
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,690
Well, it's always scary the first time.

482
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:46,990
That's part of the kick, man.

483
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:48,890
Oh, okay.

484
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,270
Come on.

485
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,070
Everybody's doing it.

486
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,970
I ain't never going to do it.

487
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,130
I'm too old to do it.

488
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,270
Aren't you susceptible to peer group pressure?

489
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:56,850
I mean...

490
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:57,690
I'm too old for it.

491
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,550
What are you, some kind of a weirdo?

492
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,190
Yes.

493
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,190
No, I'm not a weirdo.

494
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,130
I want to be like everyone else.

495
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,030
No, no, no.

496
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:06,490
Good.

497
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,970
Then you'll take this little alien home and...

498
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:09,870
I am a weirdo.

499
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,210
I mean...

500
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,130
Stop rubbing your legs.

501
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:11,490
I'm coming.

502
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:11,490


503
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:11,490


504
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:11,490


505
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:11,490


506
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:11,490


507
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:11,490


508
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,510
I don't think there's a reason for her to be confused.

509
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,190
It's something you find when you open the door.

510
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:25,130
You take these keys, and one of the keys says Bob on it.

511
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:28,490
You stick it in the lock, and you open up the door.

512
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:31,470
And if you're lucky, the green carpet rolls out.

513
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,450
And if you're not...

514
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,490
The red carpet rolls out.

515
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,290
That was 1959.

516
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,470
I think it was.

517
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:41,470


518
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:41,470


519
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:41,470


520
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:41,470


521
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:41,470


522
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:45,210
I was in the basement in the church in Akron.

523
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,590
I was at work in St. Helens, Constantine's church.

524
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,650
And then there I saw this pipe.

525
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,110
It was by the furnace.

526
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,130
I had to fix the furnaces.

527
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:56,530
It took me four and a half hours to fix this one damn furnace, and it blew my leg off.

528
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:57,770
And there was this pipe.

529
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,570
And this pipe was always lit.

530
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:02,670
I swear to God, I swear to Jesus, God, it always stayed lit.

531
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,490
I could never put the thing out.

532
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,250
I put aluminum foil on top of it.

533
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:10,610
I stuck an apple in the top of the pipe, and it would always, always smoke.

534
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:10,970
I'm sorry.

535
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:11,010
I'm sorry.

536
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:11,010


537
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:11,010


538
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:11,010


539
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:11,010


540
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:11,010


541
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:11,010


542
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,250
What is the symbology of the pipe?

543
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:26,030
Surely there's something more than merely some juvenile adoration of tobacco or whatever.

544
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:27,290
Nay.

545
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:28,870
It is...

546
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:29,370
Is it...

547
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:38,030
Is it that vortex of movement that goes into the bowl of the pipe, up through the stem,

548
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,990
into Bob, and then out his nose again to Bob?

549
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:40,990


550
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:49,410
to be inhaled yet again with that flamethrower-like effect constantly happening between his left

551
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:52,650
nostril and the bowl of the sacred pipe.

552
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:58,930
It's an ancient buffalo woman put the pipe in his mouth and he can't get it out.

553
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,190
It's like the story of Trickster.

554
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:08,710
She was beeping with his mind and so she made sure that it would never, ever come out.

555
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:17,190
And then she turned into a white buffalo and rolled over three times and scraped out a

556
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:25,870
message in the sand for all the people to see and the message said, drink Coca-Cola.

557
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,810
It's a joke on your own, Farmer.

558
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:36,330
It said roll up in a puddle of stink in some fleabag hotel, drink Coca-Cola indeed.

559
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,510
It was weather enough.

560
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,730
I needed something different.

561
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,570
I needed...

562
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:45,410
That's the way the aliens always do it.

563
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:49,250
You know, just when you're thinking they're going to do the most cosmic thing, they do

564
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:54,610
a whole series of incredible crop circles and suddenly there it says...

565
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:55,690
Pepsi.

566
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,870
You have got to be kidding.

567
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,110
I didn't know.

568
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,670
You have got to be kidding, okay?

569
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,870
We have a god to be kidding?

570
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:07,890
Yes.

571
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,110
That's correct.

572
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:09,690
I'm not correct in that.

573
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,730
In that, uh, yes, you're right.

574
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,230
I don't see what's so funny.

575
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,510
You have a god.

576
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:19,330
We do have a god to be kidding.

577
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:20,870
We have to.

578
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,010
We were called.

579
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,570
We're called ministers, man.

580
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,450
We have to kid.

581
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:25,950
I mean, we're...

582
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:26,930
Hey, I'm a minister.

583
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,550
Hey, ref, I'm a minister.

584
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,110
I'm a minister.

585
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:30,910
I'm a minister.

586
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:31,250


587
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,370
Say, can I be a Monsignor now?

588
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:36,770
Huh?

589
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,410
I want to be a Monsignor now.

590
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:38,690
I want to be a Monsignor now.

591
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:42,050
You can be anything this time around.

592
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,070
You can be...

593
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:46,410
You can be the moon swan you're...

594
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,250
You could be a turkey in the sky.

595
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,270
You could be...

596
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,690
You could be Charlie Manson.

597
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,650
You could be a sidewalk.

598
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:53,650
You could be anything.

599
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,310
You're trapped being a human.

600
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,290
I could be anything.

601
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,510
Can I be the bishop of Hawaii?

602
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:04,470
If you'd let me out of these bars, if you'd open these...this jail cell, I could be anything.

603
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,730
If I had a gun, I'd start my own religion.

604
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,690
Every day is X day when you...

605
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:08,690


606
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,310
Every day is X day when you have a gun.

607
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,470
The gun.

608
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,370
The gun.

609
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:11,810
The gun.

610
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,750
Because it has no sex.

611
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:15,950
The gun is the perfect teacher.

612
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:17,850
Hyperclesians 914.

613
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,430
I'll have you know.

614
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,650
Amen to the amen for that.

615
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,390
Hyperclesians, what was the...what are the numbers again?

616
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,150
914.

617
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:30,410
914, which is also a drug made by the hills angels, I heard.

618
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,230
It was 914.

619
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,530
Wasn't that the drug that...

620
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:36,830
No, that's the French abortion pill.

621
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:37,570
Oh, that's right.

622
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,270
The French...

623
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:38,690
The French...

624
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:38,690


625
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:38,690


626
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:38,690


627
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:38,690


628
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:38,690


629
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:38,690


630
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:38,690


631
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:38,690


632
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:38,690


633
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,770
French abortion pill.

634
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,890
Now, the...we were talking...

635
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,630
Do you French, I think is the...

636
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,570
Um, do you French?

637
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,410
No, I don't...I have no idea.

638
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,990
But I remember that you were talking this previously.

639
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:57,130
You had mentioned that...you mentioned the...the...Diacronomy from the crown, or something about the crown.

640
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:02,410
You know, so that they...when the...the upshot would be that when this...when everyone got

641
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:08,110
ruptured, so to speak, that the crown would...the...some sort of crown or the...what the...the...

642
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:08,350
The...

643
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:08,630
The...the crown.

644
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:08,630


645
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:08,630


646
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:08,630


647
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:08,630


648
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:08,630


649
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:08,670
One of the crowns.

650
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:11,530
The end of the separ-off, or the separation?

651
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,530
No, it was the clown.

652
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,250
It wasn't the clown.

653
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,870
I mean, it wasn't the clown.

654
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:18,750
Hey, what?

655
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,730
I'm burning up.

656
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,490
Is anybody else hot in here?

657
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,630
Do you smell smoke?

658
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:25,590
You get it.

659
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,270
Oh.

660
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:33,490
God, it's burning the cornstarch off my muckluck.

661
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,390
Whoa, my feet are burning.

662
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:36,810
Oh, Zeno.

663
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:40,910
I thought you were going to tell me if my face was on fire.

664
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:46,350
You said you would tell me if my face was on fire.

665
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,210
My legs.

666
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,510
It's time for Richard Stang to go to hell.

667
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,490
My legs.

668
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,610
My legs.

669
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,870
I'm sliding in.

670
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,930
Preacher, I'm sliding over to the other side.

671
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,070
It's time for you to go to hell, Stang.

672
00:28:59,290 --> 00:28:59,470
I'm on fire.

673
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,030
I can feel the fire.

674
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,530
As best as pants.

675
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:06,050
Quick, step in front of the inquisitory box.

676
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,550
Damn you, Reverend Stang.

677
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:08,210
Listen to me.

678
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,530
Step in front of the inquisitory box.

679
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,710
You've been accused of...

680
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,410
What the hell is he accused of against me?

681
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:15,270
You are going to H-E double hockey sticks, buddy.

682
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,150
I will have no fear.

683
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:17,990
Fear is the mind killer.

684
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,310
Fear is the little death which brings me...

685
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:23,490
Yeah, right.

686
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:28,610
Princess, could you read off some charges against this guy, please?

687
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,550
Hey, I've got my asbestos suit on.

688
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,870
You can charge me all you want, Johnny.

689
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,150
I'm handling the firmament in the name of...

690
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,570
Okay, that's the first one.

691
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,570
That's the first thing you stand accused of.

692
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:43,630
And you're being embittered with this material world all the time, calling yourself a sex-

693
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,810
Uh, uh...

694
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:48,030
Was that a caller?

695
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,570
No, that was an accusation.

696
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,050
An accusation.

697
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,710
We need more caller souls.

698
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,530
The bucket isn't half full yet.

699
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,830
Bob won't be pleased.

700
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:00,550
6-8-7-3-5-1-5.

701
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,930
Bob won't be pleased if we...

702
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,690
6-8-7-3-5-1-5.

703
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,150
Call and deposit your...

704
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:07,310
Soul.

705
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,950
There was another one.

706
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,810
Oh, look, Bob's bucket's half full.

707
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:11,070
It's a pretty one.

708
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,490
Look at that little old soul.

709
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,470
Ooh, it's squiggling around.

710
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:13,870
Look at that.

711
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:14,390
Look at that little temple.

712
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:17,070
I'm gonna wipe it on the end of the table and kill it.

713
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,210
Whoopsie-bitch.

714
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:18,390
Ow!

715
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,750
I'd like to donate my soul.

716
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:22,250
Ay-yo.

717
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:22,750
Ay!

718
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,690
She'd like to donate her soul.

719
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:25,970
Oh, it's...

720
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:26,630
Let me whiff it.

721
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,490
We need to chew the organs.

722
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,350
Ooh, it's a ticklish one, isn't it?

723
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,950
You've got a ticklish soul now, admit it.

724
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,270
Never mind, I've changed my mind.

725
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:35,870
Goodbye, bye.

726
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,970
Oh, that's a used soul.

727
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,390
We've already used that one.

728
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:39,450
It's too late now.

729
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,630
She can't change her mind, can she?

730
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:44,290
Change?

731
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:45,290
Change?

732
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,850
There is no change.

733
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:47,850
Change your mind?

734
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:50,810
There is no changing your mind?

735
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:54,410
Chump change in this media swamp.

736
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:55,890
We need...

737
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,190
We're talking big money, friends.

738
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,350
Big money.

739
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:00,010
You know what a human soul is worth?

740
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,230
About 5,000 bucks, man.

741
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:02,610
That's right.

742
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:03,110
That's about...

743
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:03,990
That's exactly...

744
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,930
You are very close.

745
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,070
It's 5,600.

746
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:06,750
That's about $131.

747
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:07,790
Is it going right?

748
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:08,770
I'm using it for...

749
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:09,390
But it's made up of...

750
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:12,510
A Japanese soul is slightly more valuable right now.

751
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:15,250
But isn't it made up of 97% water?

752
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,530
You know, one of the reasons why I was calling

753
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,550
is because I thought it would be a perfect tribute

754
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:22,270
because this being the 25th year anniversary

755
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,690
of the first music and arts festival held on the moon,

756
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:28,210
that I thought we should take a few moments to think about.

757
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:32,390
To salute those freak-flagging astronauts.

758
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,150
Well, that's what we've been doing all night.

759
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,370
We've been having a cultural planet on the moon.

760
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,130
We ate it.

761
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,710
Some of us even planted some fags.

762
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:41,290
And danced around the donuts and sang...

763
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,150
What was that song about?

764
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,230
Chrysler's and Plymouth's?

765
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:43,650
It was...

766
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:47,670
You can't get the bonfire very high in that thin, rarefied atmosphere.

767
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,090
No, there's no O2.

768
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:49,470
Well, that...

769
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:49,830
You were thinking that song about the big dipper.

770
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:50,970
And we laid in the craters.

771
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:52,710
Whose dipper?

772
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:53,530
The craters.

773
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:54,210
The sheep dipper.

774
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:57,390
The one that sang that song back then?

775
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:58,750
Oh, the sheep dipper.

776
00:31:58,810 --> 00:31:59,270
Now, I don't think...

777
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,470
Now, let's keep this clean, boys.

778
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,130
He didn't come there.

779
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:01,650
No.

780
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:02,250
He didn't.

781
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,650
Let's not be talking about big dippers and so forth.

782
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,290
And critters.

783
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,350
They said they were...

784
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,450
No plastic bags, please.

785
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,610
Well, we already did plastic baggage.

786
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:16,530
What are you doing in celebration, though, of this, all these...

787
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:18,630
The baseball thing and the moon and everything?

788
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,170
There's so many anniversaries.

789
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,830
I don't know which one to keep track of anymore.

790
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:26,310
No, I just came back from big X-Day pilgrimage to Portland.

791
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,210
He had...

792
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:29,670
In Portland, Oregon, where heads were...

793
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,110
We launched heads and...

794
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,130
Heads were spinning up there.

795
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,510
Yeah, they actually...

796
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,310
He wore St. James's sandals, too.

797
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,270
And he had a little...

798
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,170
He had a little prick on his back.

799
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:39,670
Now, I told you, James...

800
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,490
It's pennant.

801
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,310
You told me.

802
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:42,170
It's all right.

803
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:42,930
Don't worry.

804
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:48,650
Everybody's like sub-GNI around here, even if they don't know it.

805
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,910
Even if they haven't paid yet.

806
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:54,170
Some of us have tried and never paid.

807
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:57,710
Say, Wes, I got a tape from you called Radio Shorts.

808
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,110
Yes, that's very true.

809
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,150
Which I haven't even opened yet.

810
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:01,850
Copy.

811
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,010
Yeah, that's why you haven't...

812
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,330
That's why you didn't hear back until now.

813
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:07,870
It's a lovely letter.

814
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,790
It starts off with deer, in fact.

815
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,790
That's one of my favorite...

816
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,130
In a salutary manner.

817
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,650
I think it had to do with salads.

818
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,370
No, you were talking about the venison.

819
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,330
The tape smelled good, though.

820
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:24,010
I haven't listened to it yet, but it did have an excellent whiff.

821
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,690
I'm afraid my cat got too close to the stamp.

822
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,710
Oh, I thought that was the pork and buckwheat.

823
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:29,610
No, no, no.

824
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:32,450
That was definitely the cat thing.

825
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:35,510
I'd like to meet your cat someday.

826
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:36,210
I apologize.

827
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,770
You're growing whiskers there, thinking about it.

828
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:41,110
Yeah, I had...

829
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,490
Is there something weird like a...

830
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,750
Oh, Chaz doesn't like that because he's got ten of them.

831
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,050
Oh, no, I just wanted the M&Ms.

832
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:54,250
Yeah, there's a whole table full of M&Ms here.

833
00:33:54,350 --> 00:34:04,050
This is the first radio studio I've been to that had, like, about a square yard's worth of M&Ms instead of turntables.

834
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,190
No, there's no M&Ms here.

835
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,610
So you're not allowed to have M&Ms.

836
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:08,810
No, you're not allowed to have...

837
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:10,470
And make them like, mwah, mwah, mwah.

838
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,930
And you can put the letters around.

839
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,410
You can make...

840
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:16,650
It's kind of like a candy Scrabble game.

841
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,710
We do that a lot up here when it gets really cold outside.

842
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,910
You're the M&Ms?

843
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:23,710
It's kind of like Scrabble.

844
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:27,130
You pick and poke, you know what I mean?

845
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,650
I don't know what you mean.

846
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:31,510
Get that food out of the studio now.

847
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:34,550
No M&Ms.

848
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:37,530
Well, I just thought I'd just call up and...

849
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:40,650
Wes, why do you call and bring the M&Ms on the air?

850
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,750
Well, I bring the M&Ms on the air...

851
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,530
That's a FCC ID regulator.

852
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:49,450
...part of the whole postage thing that I was trying to explain as far as the cat thing goes.

853
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:54,470
Because we... I don't know whether it is there, but cat houses out here are fine.

854
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:57,650
They're legal and they're protected, and we don't have to worry about it.

855
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,630
They do things with M&Ms at the cat houses in...

856
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,670
In Portland and in St. Francis.

857
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,630
You can buy a map for like $2.

858
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:03,950
$2.

859
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:05,090
That's all.

860
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,150
And you can find...

861
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,370
You don't even have to...

862
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:08,190
You don't even have to worry.

863
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,390
Well, those are the visionary cities, you know?

864
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,630
Well, I don't know.

865
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,090
I was on the...

866
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:13,990
I spent...

867
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,950
A couple of weeks ago, I was out on the West Coast.

868
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:18,690
Went to Portland, Olympia, and Seattle.

869
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:23,210
And every neighborhood I was in, every shop sold espresso.

870
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:27,710
I mean, even auto repair places, you know?

871
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,010
Tire shops sold espresso.

872
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:33,610
And all the boys had long hair.

873
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:33,610


874
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:35,670
And all the girls had short hair.

875
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,790
And everybody was a vegetarian.

876
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:38,990
And...

877
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,030
But they don't do that there?

878
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,070
Where?

879
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,910
Over there in the other area.

880
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:45,710
Well, it made me...

881
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,430
Well, no, it's just the opposite.

882
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,830
They'll kill you for doing that here.

883
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:50,290
Oh, they're...

884
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:52,030
They're microbiotic.

885
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,730
Except a few small pockets.

886
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:53,730


887
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:54,530
Well, the West Coast...

888
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:55,990
There's a few small pockets.

889
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:56,910
They're called the beakers.

890
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,150
Yeah, where they have the...

891
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,470
They sell pocket pastries there, too.

892
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,690
I'm sorry, I mean, you know, the...

893
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:03,270
Oh, what?

894
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:03,310
What?

895
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,110
You look great out here.

896
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,650
I don't know.

897
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,650
It was just so groovy.

898
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,910
I wanted to cut my hair.

899
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,750
I wanted to get a haircut and end up looking like Dave here.

900
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,130
Where did you get a razor bank?

901
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,150
Well, see, if you cut your hair, you end up looking like a woman out here.

902
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:17,470
Well, that...

903
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:19,190
Well, that was the idea, man.

904
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:19,910
Oh, I'm sorry.

905
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,190
Have you got something against that?

906
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:27,050
I mean, are you, you know, are you trying to dictate my gender identity or something?

907
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:27,410
Come on, Pete.

908
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:30,630
I thought...

909
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,590
I thought that out there it was okay.

910
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,810
Out there?

911
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,190
To want to look like a bald-headed woman.

912
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:36,590
How do you bring an out there and do it again?

913
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:37,190
And I don't...

914
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,710
And that was, that was just a mistake.

915
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:41,810
That had something to do with the Merchant Marine, and I didn't, I didn't ever want to

916
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:42,650
bring that up again.

917
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:45,990
I'm a bald-headed woman in the body of a long-haired guy.

918
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:50,790
He was a long-haired seaman, and he was quite, he was, it was different then.

919
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:51,490
Yeah.

920
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:53,390
It was a different time, and it was a different uniform.

921
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:53,950
Yep.

922
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:56,930
And the Merchant Marine were very, very hard on Reverend Stange.

923
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:57,830
I...

924
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:02,350
He dressed, especially dressed like a woman, and preaching the word of J.R. Bob Dobbs in

925
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:05,310
the Merchant Marine at what, was 1923 or something like that?

926
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:07,650
Hazing was, yeah, that's 1929.

927
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,950
1929, and hazing.

928
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:17,090
There was a big, big article in the Washington Post, some courier of the, I remember, that...

929
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:19,490
It was worse on subgeniuses in the Navy.

930
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:23,530
They whacked them with little rulers on the tushy, and they made them run the gauntlet

931
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,730
back in the old days, which is backwards.

932
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:29,910
Back before, even before Bob came along to have something to blame it on.

933
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:30,990
And spiny critters.

934
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,070
People...

935
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,270
People wear gauntlets out here.

936
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:36,850
I don't, I mean, because when I was in Portland, I was probably telling you earlier, but up

937
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,890
in Portland, people wear gauntlets wherever you go.

938
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:44,850
You go up there and they drink Javad, a pita bread, and they wear gauntlet things.

939
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:50,710
Oh, no, no, where I come from, you have to, the gauntlets are the things you run from.

940
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,550
They're not what you run in.

941
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:56,790
If you've been in enough gauntlets, you want to run from them too, but it's still, it's,

942
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:57,730
they're still tasty.

943
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:58,830
Yeah.

944
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:01,650
You can eat them, but you don't, you don't want to hang around.

945
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,450
I mean, I, like, that I understand.

946
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:03,590


947
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,550
We, the same thing here.

948
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,190
The average golfer would, I don't know.

949
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:11,710
Have you noticed a fad of teenagers dressed as vampires, where they're all dressed in

950
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:15,730
black and wear white pasty makeup and dark eye shadow?

951
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:16,290
What channel?

952
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:16,770
What channel?

953
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,750
It's on every channel.

954
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:19,290
It's everywhere.

955
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:20,330
Oh, they said, yeah.

956
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:25,450
I mean, they were in Portland, they were in Atlanta, they're, and maybe, for all I know,

957
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:30,090
they are vampires, and it's just gotten to the, to the point where nobody even cares

958
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:30,590
anymore.

959
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:38,950
That living, you know, living dead things, supernatural monsters can wander the streets,

960
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:43,750
going in and out of rock clubs and looking painfully, tragically hip.

961
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:49,150
I think the proliferation of vampires has to do with the fact that there's no really

962
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,970
good vegetarian cuisine out there.

963
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,510
And there's no good religion.

964
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:53,210
That's it.

965
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:54,550
Yep.

966
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:55,490
Yep.

967
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:55,870
Yep.

968
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,450
And, and, you know, what do you expect?

969
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:58,630
That is exactly why I called.

970
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:03,310
There's, the religion's falling apart, werewolves and vampires are gonna start reappearing.

971
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:07,530
You know, it's the age of superstition and what you believe, it's gonna come, it's gonna

972
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:08,110
come true.

973
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:13,710
They're just kids, they've been watching these Freddy Krueger movies and stuff, but the next

974
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:16,290
thing you know, Freddy Krueger's be, well, Freddy Krueger is real.

975
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,370
He appeared in my dreams.

976
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:21,430
He's got a shop up in Portland, by the way.

977
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,270
Freddy Krueger?

978
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:25,770
Of Nightmare on Elm Street fame?

979
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,610
See, he's selling skateboards and people.

980
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:28,610


981
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:28,910
He's selling skateboards in Portland.

982
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:33,910
Yeah, he's, and he's got that, it's a decal thing underneath that's been getting them,

983
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:36,470
him and Richie Havens are suing everybody now.

984
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:41,310
Yeah, and, and the kids think it's so cool that now they're, you know, it's like tattoos

985
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,210
aren't enough.

986
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:44,610
Now they have to get Freddy Krueger faced.

987
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:51,270
They have to, they have to get burned, third degree burns over their entire body just to

988
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:51,790
be cool.

989
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:56,090
Well, it's like the women have short hair and all the men have long hair and now it's

990
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:57,190
the, the face thing.

991
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:57,930
Yeah.

992
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:00,150
Oh, the face, the whole body.

993
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:01,950
You know, it's the pose.

994
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:07,010
If you only have your face burned down to the bone, that's either, you're just a poseur.

995
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:11,570
You're not a real, you know, you're not a with it raver or whatever they call them,

996
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,250
vampire, whatever they are today.

997
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:14,150
Huh?

998
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,270
I think that's why, I know that's why I'm doing it.

999
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:20,910
Because if you have your face burned down like Freddy Krueger, you don't even have to

1000
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:21,610
get your hand stamped.

1001
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:22,890
You can just like sail.

1002
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,190
Yeah, just walk in, man.

1003
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,490
You're the coolest thing there.

1004
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,590
Which I, I better go.

1005
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:28,590


1006
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:28,590


1007
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:31,870
You'll probably check, I got a, I got a loaf in the oven.

1008
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,970
Your eye sockets.

1009
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,050
Eye sockets.

1010
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:34,610
Oh, it does.

1011
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:37,790
Thank God when I was a kid, it was only knee capping.

1012
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:38,750
You know, you were cool.

1013
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:40,550
You got knee capped and then you were cool.

1014
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,290
Have you ever been eye socketed?

1015
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:43,250
Eye socketed.

1016
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,150
Eye socketed.

1017
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:45,510
I never had my knee capped.

1018
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:48,210
Well, you weren't in with the in crowd.

1019
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:52,150
See all those cool people had to get knee capped and that's why we all do desk jobs

1020
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:52,490
now.

1021
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,210
We can't walk very good.

1022
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,510
That's the baby boomer generation.

1023
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:58,350
Yeah.

1024
00:40:58,610 --> 00:40:59,130
We do squat now.

1025
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,110
Squat now.

1026
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:00,930
Squat now.

1027
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,090
Now, squat like I've trained.

1028
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:02,130
Is that squat?

1029
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:02,890
We might have to squat.

1030
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:03,630
Squat.

1031
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:04,330
Squat.

1032
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:05,130
Squat.

1033
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,110
Squat.

1034
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,410
Well, I better run away.

1035
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:10,910
I ain't gonna walk.

1036
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,450
Away away away.

1037
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:16,750
Why don't you take the slimy dish?

1038
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:16,870
Slimey dish.

1039
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,670
Slimey dish.

1040
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:21,510
Slimey dish.

1041
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:23,290
Whatever you carry around with you.

1042
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,190
Whatever, whatever you carry around with you.

1043
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:26,610
I don't care.

1044
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:27,430
Whatever that one does.

1045
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,490
I don't care.

1046
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:32,530
I don't care if you're in Portland or Eureka.

1047
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:33,310
Eureka.

1048
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:35,910
Eureka.

1049
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,790
I saw.

1050
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:53,130
I saw.

1051
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,210
I saw.

1052
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:54,370


1053
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:54,590
I saw.

1054
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:54,770
I saw.

1055
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:55,550
I saw.

1056
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:56,390
I saw.

1057
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:57,250
I saw.

1058
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:03,890
I saw.

1059
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:04,950
I saw.

1060
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,030
I saw.

1061
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:07,790
I saw.

1062
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:09,610
I saw.

1063
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,790
I'll get you sick.

1064
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:30,630
I'll get you sick.

1065
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:31,430
I'll get you sick.

1066
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:32,710
I'll get you sick.

1067
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:33,790
I'll get you sick.

1068
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:35,670
I'll get you sick.

1069
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:39,430
You're supposed to have a beginning of that

1070
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:40,530
or something.

1071
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,730
Something like that.

1072
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,910
The form for the...

1073
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:47,230
for you behaving like this.

1074
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,910
Why do you think you're going

1075
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:50,970
to school alone?

1076
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,610
You're going and...

1077
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:55,870
and it's just disgusting.

1078
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:57,130
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1079
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:01,010
We are ashamed.

1080
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:06,710
Terribly, terribly, terribly, terribly ashamed.

1081
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:09,690
I'll get you sick.

1082
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,670
I'll get you sick.

1083
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,350
I'll get you sick.

1084
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:25,850
I'll get you sick.

1085
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,730
Mr. Dimple, you're...

1086
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,010
Now, would you now know all about

1087
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:30,270
Teen Times Fast?

1088
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:31,630
Teen Times Fast?

1089
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:32,290
Fast.

1090
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:34,350
Fast.

1091
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,110
Fast.

1092
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:36,350
Fast.

1093
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:36,570


1094
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:37,230
Fast.

1095
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:38,050
Fast.

1096
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:39,070
Fast.

1097
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:39,210
Fast.

1098
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:39,770
Fast.

1099
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:41,230
Fast.

1100
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:41,230


1101
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:46,090
Fast.

1102
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:49,690
Fast.

1103
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:50,670
Fast.

1104
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:51,470
Fast.

1105
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,050
Fast.

1106
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:53,050
Fast.

1107
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:53,370
Fast.

1108
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:55,210
Fast.

1109
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:55,810
Fast.

1110
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:55,810


1111
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:56,670
Fast.

1112
00:43:58,930 --> 00:43:59,690
Fast.

1113
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:12,110
Ah, yes, dear friend.

1114
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:18,170
Ah, yes.

1115
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:22,710
The Harvest.

1116
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:33,390
That bucket's almost full now.

1117
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:01,550
Look, we were getting paid to be idiots.

1118
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:03,490
I wasn't getting paid to be idiots.

1119
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:04,530
I was doing it for free.

1120
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:05,790
Well, he's a real idiot.

1121
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:06,410
Yeah.

1122
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:10,790
The rest of us are all getting paid real good for being idiots.

1123
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:15,270
I feel sorry for those smart people who have to pay instead.

1124
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:16,470
To?

1125
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:18,390
Just to hear the idiots.

1126
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,990
To hear a bunch of flesh-grabbing, cracking idiots?

1127
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:26,350
I feel sorry for those intelligent people.

1128
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:27,270
I really do.

1129
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:29,470
Think how disturbing it must be

1130
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:29,670
to get a job like that.

1131
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:33,090
To go through life so painfully aware of...

1132
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:33,510
Whoa!

1133
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:35,510
God, earthquake!

1134
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:38,630
Praise Bob!

1135
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:39,890
It's a sign!

1136
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:43,150
We're being punished!

1137
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:44,930
We must have done the right thing!

1138
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,670
He must be happy with us!

1139
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:48,910
He's never happy with anybody.

1140
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:50,430
What the hell are we talking about?

1141
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,150
You guys are a bunch of babies.

1142
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,330
You guys are juvenile.

1143
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,050
You're pre-juvenile.

1144
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:56,730
You're infantile.

1145
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:59,070
You're fetal.

1146
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:01,010
No, you're pre-fetal.

1147
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:02,610
You're spermatozoic.

1148
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:05,650
No, you're gleaming daddy-zayic.

1149
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:09,290
No, you're so infantile and juvenile.

1150
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:11,910
You're DNA-like.

1151
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:12,850
I'm tadpole?

1152
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:14,370
You're genetic entirely.

1153
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:16,070
I'm genetic waste?

1154
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:19,690
It was genetic humor, ma'am.

1155
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:22,710
Genetic humor done him in, ma'am.

1156
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:25,410
It's not pornography, officer.

1157
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:27,170
It's empowerment.

1158
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:29,670
It's porno-genetic?

1159
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:32,390
It's porno-genetic empowerment.

1160
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:38,070
Once you get a hold of your genitalia and you can feel that power surging backwards, you know...

1161
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:38,970
Just hang on, ma'am.

1162
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:41,010
Now, now, now, there's nothing to worry about.

1163
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:41,030
Get it real.

1164
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:45,150
It's all just a part of the cosmic flow.

1165
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:47,690
Don't be afraid.

1166
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:49,650
It's that English woman again.

1167
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:50,630
It's the most famous...

1168
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:50,970
I beg your pardon?

1169
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,610
It's a transvestite.

1170
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:53,030
Fanny.

1171
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:54,570
Is that Fanny?

1172
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:58,890
It's a guy who dresses up in place in white ostrich feathers at the bar.

1173
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:01,490
Now, those guys make good money, too.

1174
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:04,470
Yeah, it's good money until you try and spend it.

1175
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:04,690
Depending on the bar.

1176
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:09,570
Oh, I don't know which bar you've been to, but the ones I've seen don't make much of a living at it.

1177
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:11,930
It's more like a slow death.

1178
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:14,050
It is.

1179
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:21,010
No, man, they live for that moment when they're up there in front of all those people and they're someone else.

1180
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:24,470
They've become transformed into a...

1181
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:25,830
Barbra Streisand?

1182
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:28,270
A Barbra Streisand or Marilyn Monroe or...

1183
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:28,850
Marilyn Monroe.

1184
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:29,650
Liza Minnelli.

1185
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:30,050
Liza.

1186
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,590
Yeah, or Bette Midler, you know.

1187
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:33,770
Oh, I love when they do bad.

1188
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:35,310
That's the best.

1189
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:38,690
That's, you know, that's what they live for.

1190
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:48,270
That one golden moment in their lives that the rest of it's just sidewalks and garbage cans and crappy hamburgers.

1191
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:50,690
It pales yellow with the golden showers.

1192
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:51,130


1193
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:53,570
They gotta hook up with the later in the afternoon.

1194
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:55,910
You know, you gotta get slack any way you can.

1195
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:58,250
Well, some of them just figure they can take it.

1196
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,530
They suck it right out of you, I suppose.

1197
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,890
Of course, they may hang you for it.

1198
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:05,430
One ear and eye pointing down, one pointing the other way.

1199
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:08,050
Yeah, you take that risk now, don't you?

1200
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:09,210
Yeah, you take a risk every day.

1201
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:10,170
You take that risk every day.

1202
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:10,770
That's right.

1203
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:12,670
I gotta remember you take a risk every day.

1204
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:15,890
You walk out and you can get slack if you just...

1205
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:16,510
What are you...

1206
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:17,870
If you just...

1207
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:19,070
Shit, I don't...

1208
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:21,210
Shit, I don't know what I gotta do to get slack.

1209
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:23,570
I know I gotta get slack because I need...

1210
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:25,330
Because everybody has to have plenty of slack.

1211
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:28,230
I gotta have at least enough to fill a whole closet.

1212
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:32,670
And I should probably start putting together some of those securities I've been thinking about and stuff.

1213
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:36,930
Because I could maybe get more slack later if I saved up for more slack now.

1214
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:38,810
It's really good.

1215
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,570
Okay, now do you understand?

1216
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:46,190
We started this whole thing off telling you that we were gonna tell you what you really want.

1217
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:49,110
Well...

1218
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:51,470
You're on the puff.

1219
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:53,750
I don't know any other way to do it.

1220
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:54,950
We stuck with the script.

1221
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:57,730
This is the same script we've used every time.

1222
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:00,230
If you haven't...

1223
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:05,470
What is this old Dr. Demento stuff?

1224
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:06,390
You should...

1225
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:07,150
I gotcha, Dr. Demento.

1226
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:12,250
That was real funny in 1971 when I lived out in South Dakota, but...

1227
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,590
Yeah, when you used to...

1228
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:17,210
When you used to ride bareback over the plains and listen to the...

1229
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:17,630
Who told you about that?

1230
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:18,990
The voice of the Black Hills.

1231
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:23,570
Hi-ya, hi-ya, hi-ya, hi-ya, hi-ya, hi-ya...

1232
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:28,130
I actually did end up riding across the plains on horseback with a...

1233
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:33,550
A fellow named Lorenzo Black Lance at 3 in the morning in the middle of the Rosebud Reservation,

1234
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:38,110
and we were looking for the UFO he had just seen.

1235
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:44,050
And he couldn't go to sleep unless he saw that UFO again, and he wanted me to go out and help him look for it.

1236
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:48,330
We rode all over the prairies all night long, and it never came back.

1237
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:50,570
Now, this here was a full-blooded Indian feller?

1238
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:52,050
Hmm...

1239
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:54,690
Well, he was a member of the Rosebud Sioux tribe.

1240
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:55,810
His dad was a...

1241
00:49:55,810 --> 00:49:57,110
Why do they have...

1242
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:57,790
He was a medicine man.

1243
00:49:57,930 --> 00:49:58,090
Apprentice.

1244
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:01,110
Why do them damn UFOs hang out in the reservations?

1245
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:06,150
Over across the state lines over there in New York State, they just had a big hubbub about...

1246
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:11,830
Over on Iroquois Reservation there, they spotted three slongical discs...

1247
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:12,810
Discs?

1248
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:18,810
Not discs, but like, looked like a three-pronged article of some kind floating through space at high rates of speed

1249
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:22,970
with numbers of diminishing and growing rapid lights circling the bottom area.

1250
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:25,530
We know those Alaskan totem poles?

1251
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:27,090
They're actually UFOs.

1252
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:30,090
Those are the heads of the UFO pilots.

1253
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:31,570
Do you see the connection now?

1254
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:32,370
I thought it was the...

1255
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:38,870
The white buffalo woman that we were talking about earlier came down in a UFO and gave the pipe to the Lakota people

1256
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:46,870
and then crushed all the bodies into... made a giant pool of blood which hardened into pipestone,

1257
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:49,350
which they make modern pipes out of.

1258
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:53,690
It's a very soft rock made of human blood, according to legend.

1259
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:56,730
I got one of them things you were talking about filled with marijuana resin.

1260
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:59,070
And the Iroquois...

1261
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:03,310
Used to steal them. They'd go thousands of miles to steal the pipes from the buffalo.

1262
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:08,850
They invented the UFO originally. They had an anti-gravity thing and most of them took off.

1263
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:11,410
And they only left a couple Iroquois around?

1264
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:18,210
You know, they used to accuse the Erie Indians who lived around here of high sorcery, which is why the Iroquois wiped their cousins out.

1265
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:26,250
Well, you know, you gotta... sometimes there's no... none of those particular bunches of Indians around to defend themselves...

1266
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:26,510
Verified.

1267
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:30,130
...and the only... the only thing you know about them is what their enemies said.

1268
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:31,790
That's right. That's right.

1269
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:41,110
For instance, the word Sioux is actually what the Blackfeet used to call the Lakota and it meant snake in the grass, you know, nasty worm thing.

1270
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:46,590
Well, that's... that's a bitchin' thing to wind up for the... a moniker for the rest of your life.

1271
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:50,810
For the whole rest of your ancestral days, all your people be called the snake and the thing.

1272
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:53,590
Right. Well, see, that's why Sioux isn't cool anymore.

1273
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:54,170
These are great.

1274
00:51:54,170 --> 00:52:01,730
And it's... in today's modern dances with wolves, now a go-go PC world, it is correct to say Lakota.

1275
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:03,470
But it's not correct to say...

1276
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:04,550
Heard here on camera three.

1277
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:09,270
Oh, look, they're all lining up for the high-eye dance now. They're doing the corn ceremony.

1278
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:13,350
There's Russell Means, Dennis Banks, Claude Bellacourt...

1279
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:14,210
All dressed up in suits.

1280
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:14,730
Yup.

1281
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:16,250
Yup. Flannel suits. My God.

1282
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:21,270
Sitting on top of that general store there at Wounded Knee reading comic books...

1283
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:21,850
But... but...

1284
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:23,210
...waiting for the FBI to...

1285
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:26,450
...burn them like they did Koresh.

1286
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:31,830
But it was in the past, and the FBI didn't have the special flamethrower tanks then.

1287
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:35,630
And that's the hope of the future, is that the FBI was not in the past.

1288
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:40,450
And why we must all escape into the future so that we can rescue ourselves in the past.

1289
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:43,530
So that we can create... yes, we have to go into the future and create a time machine...

1290
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:43,890
A time machine.

1291
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:47,390
...so we can go back into the past and correct everything so it doesn't happen...

1292
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:47,490
And correct everything.

1293
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:51,150
...but then if that happens, we won't be born to make the time machine in the future...

1294
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:51,530
Yeah, but what if...

1295
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:53,890
...in order to go back in the past and change it, which would mean it would...

1296
00:52:54,490 --> 00:53:00,370
...some... every other past would be good, and the other... and then every other one would be bad.

1297
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:02,490
Oh, there'd be four good ones and three bad ones.

1298
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:07,710
So we're in the bad one now that we didn't... we weren't able to go back and change the past this time.

1299
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:08,090
Okay.

1300
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:09,410
The last time, I should say.

1301
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:09,730
All right.

1302
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,990
But this time we will, so the next time will be good.

1303
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:13,210
Well, that's this time, then now.

1304
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:16,970
Because if we were gonna go back because we had already intended to go back...

1305
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:18,990
...because we were in the bad one, we were going back to the good one...

1306
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:23,030
...that would mean kind of necessarily we'd both be back in the bad one and the good one at the same time.

1307
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:23,870
Man, it's a paradox.

1308
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:25,590
It's like that cat in the box.

1309
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:29,770
You know, you can cut it in half, and Heidinger's still gonna...

1310
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:30,670
Schrodinger.

1311
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:32,270
Schrodinger, yeah, that's right.

1312
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:35,250
Schrodinger's still gonna burn up as he... when he hits the atmosphere.

1313
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:35,750
Heidinger.

1314
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:37,770
I couldn't remember either.

1315
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:39,450
I was just trying to give him some doodar.

1316
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:41,630
No, wait a minute.

1317
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:42,350
Heidinger was...

1318
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:43,350
I was trying to be old.

1319
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:45,330
Heidinger was the guy who played with clams.

1320
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:50,510
He was also the one that when he'd walk into a furnace or a surf factory unit or some kind of laboratory...

1321
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:51,890
Haven't you ever heard of Menzies effect?

1322
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:57,930
Where you'd have a testicular or ovarian spite or something like that, or someone would try and arrest you?

1323
00:53:58,170 --> 00:53:59,170
No, but I do...

1324
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:01,790
Someone told me the other day that Einstein...

1325
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:02,170
One stone.

1326
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:04,070
...was once sold an elevator.

1327
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:07,770
A man came to Einstein's house, a salesman...

1328
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:08,150
A Chicago...

1329
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:12,710
A salesman with a pipe, and sold Albert Einstein an elevator.

1330
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:13,490
Did he take...

1331
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:16,990
But Albert Einstein lived in a one-story house.

1332
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:20,510
Oh, my God. You know who that sounds like.

1333
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:21,750
Why do you think they call it...

1334
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:23,370
A subgenius, my friend.

1335
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:24,430
Only in this reality.

1336
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:26,750
Because an idiot would believe anything.

1337
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:27,890
No, that's backwards.

1338
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:32,830
Well, I hate walking in a dark alley myself.

1339
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:34,810
I can't get out of it. I just got into one.

1340
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:37,110
But it was only a one-story house.

1341
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:38,910
In this reality.

1342
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:40,890
Yeah, that's right. Einstein knew...

1343
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:46,210
In the other backwards time stream, it probably was a two-story house, and Einstein knew that.

1344
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,130
And he probably installed the elevator.

1345
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:50,610
And it probably worked for Einstein.

1346
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:52,150
That's what we...

1347
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:53,150
Here we are.

1348
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:56,170
We're sitting there making fun of that guy for being old smarty pants.

1349
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:58,870
And then it turns out he had the last laugh after all.

1350
00:54:59,090 --> 00:54:59,150
Yeah.

1351
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:04,350
If you ever watch those instructional television programs, the current program has Einstein,

1352
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:10,750
or one stone as they used to call him, going back and forth in the elevator to prove the theory of relativity relative to quantum physics.

1353
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:17,130
Don't you remember like the fact when the elevator's on its way up there, and he's already down, but it's only one story.

1354
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:17,530
See?

1355
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:19,130
That's where the...

1356
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:20,590
That's where the elevator is.

1357
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:22,290
That's where the light starts to bend the...

1358
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:23,330
That's right.

1359
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:23,710
The continuum.

1360
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:24,850
The time continuum.

1361
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:25,030
Right.

1362
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:32,230
And he's only in the elevator for ten minutes, but when the door opens, it's 4,000 years later and apes have taken over the planet.

1363
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:32,590
That's right.

1364
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:36,550
And the Statue of Liberty stuck up to, you know, puts neck in sand.

1365
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:38,510
And it's actually wearing an ape mask too.

1366
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:40,310
And Einstein is very old.

1367
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:43,210
But I think they took that off for a while.

1368
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:45,450
I mean, at least some of the kids were getting scared.

1369
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:46,130
Remember?

1370
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:47,090
I...

1371
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:48,650
I don't know.

1372
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:49,530
I think, I don't know, it was Captain...

1373
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:50,130
I memorized it.

1374
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:53,990
It was Captain Duty or it was, um, the wildebeest or...

1375
00:55:53,990 --> 00:56:04,670
You don't get a goddamn job before sundown or we're shipping you off to military school with a goddamn fake-o-tease shit-kin.

1376
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:06,610
Son of a bitch.

1377
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:16,530
Well, now, if that don't beat all, another hot recipe from down in Cajun country.

1378
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:18,910
You gotta get on the microphone a little bit.

1379
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:20,810
Yeah, but she's not saying anything.

1380
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:22,030
She's giving me dirty looks.

1381
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:24,070
All she's gotta do is grab my head and give it to me.

1382
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:27,870
Your proximity has to come closer to the microphone.

1383
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:30,850
Oh, I'd never move my posterior too much because you could get also, uh...

1384
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:30,970
Proximity?

1385
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:33,430
Some of, one of those other devices stuck up there too.

1386
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:35,770
Well, I didn't put it there.

1387
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:38,490
Well, you tried, I know, a few times.

1388
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:40,990
You know, I'm sick of you bringing that crap up, you know.

1389
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:42,650
Well, it's just, it was a psychic thing.

1390
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:45,150
It didn't really happen in this, in this part.

1391
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:46,310
Well, I didn't do it.

1392
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:48,670
Well, I'm saying it wasn't intention.

1393
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:52,650
It was just, uh, kind of a lackluster thought that came and went like a will of the beast.

1394
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:54,550
Oh, wait. A Tibetan moment.

1395
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:06,310
Now, I heard that Bob sold the Dalai Lama a pair of spandex slippers that wouldn't bend when he had to do his obfuscations.

1396
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:10,670
And he had to carry his, uh, rotary, er, his, uh, rosaries.

1397
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:16,290
He, uh, supposedly told the, the Dalai Lama that, that, that would lead to, uh,

1398
00:57:16,310 --> 00:57:19,110
a better comprehension of nothingness.

1399
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:21,550
Geeze, see, he's got it for everybody.

1400
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:23,710
He would then, he, he said to the Dalai Lama, he said,

1401
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:29,830
wear these and you will be in the silence of only the air conditioner noise.

1402
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:31,210
Oh, man.

1403
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:35,310
Now, see, he told my dad he'd be only in the silence of Onan.

1404
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:39,330
But he ain't got, uh, well, I think he's too old to spank anyone.

1405
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,930
The silence of Onan?

1406
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:42,050
Onan was a super-type.

1407
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:44,390
Onan got a spanking. He got him a spanking.

1408
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:46,010
That's the sound of your one-hand clapping.

1409
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:46,430
Yeah.

1410
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:49,130
That's the, well, that's not Janet's singing voice.

1411
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:50,670
Wasn't that Jaffe's brother?

1412
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:50,970
The white noise of Onan.

1413
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:52,690
The white noise of Onan.

1414
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:54,490
Onan, wasn't that Jaffe's brother?

1415
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:55,850
Jaffe Wonan?

1416
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:56,310
Yeah.

1417
00:57:56,690 --> 00:58:01,490
I don't know. I heard him talk about doctors for Watoomba, but I didn't know if Jaffe Wonan was in there.

1418
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:04,010
I was running around with Onan last week in Portland.

1419
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:04,790
Yeah, right around.

1420
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:07,450
Onan lives in Portland now. Works in a bookstore.

1421
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:09,890
And he is a one-handed man.

1422
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:14,310
Uh, he, he's, I'm proud of it. Darned proud of it, I might add.

1423
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:15,710
From prehistoric Arkansas.

1424
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,130
Yep. Goes all the way back.

1425
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:18,710
Mm-hmm.

1426
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:19,210
Tennessee.

1427
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:24,410
Is that where the Australian monoliths planted the Indians? Or that's, now that was when they-

00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:31,930
No one knows where. It was on the Lost Plateau of Leng, which is just a name. Nobody knows, you know, where it is.

1429
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,170
So nobody knows what a Leng is, then?

1430
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:40,170
It's occulted knowledge. It's, it's knowledge that is hidden from, from us. For, probably for our own good.

1431
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:43,070
Because, you know, if we could get there, we could dig up the treasure.

1432
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:46,010
And Bob told me he has the map.

1433
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:47,210
In his closet.

1434
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:47,990
And he's gonna sell it.

1435
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:48,870
Under the bed.

1436
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:49,530
Oh.

1437
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:51,870
And he's gonna sell you a Xerox copy.

1438
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:53,110
We could get that map, man.

1439
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:55,870
Yeah, right. You could get a map from, and he's gonna sell it to you.

1440
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:59,110
We could, we could break Charlie out. We could, we could free Charlie.

1441
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:00,990
Well, I, I don't think we should-

1442
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:03,410
And we could, and we, Charlie, man, Charlie's got magic powers.

1443
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:04,330
You can't break Charlie.

1444
00:59:04,330 --> 00:59:05,490
We could get them panties.

1445
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:06,170
No, if you pop Charlie's-

1446
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:07,310
We could get into the Forbidden Plateau.

1447
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:15,050
No, he told me he was gonna kill me. He said he didn't like the idea of me reintroducing listening to Music Mind.

1448
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:18,030
I'm gonna kill you.

1449
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:28,730
Uh, friends, that was part one of an incredible two-hour recording from ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB Cleveland in 1994.

1450
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:34,350
But, friends, everything you really need to know is at subgenius.com.

1451
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:41,530
Thank you, CyberChump, from their album, Their Moment of Perfect Happiness.

1452
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:43,310
Praise Bob.

1453
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:45,130
Praise our listeners.
