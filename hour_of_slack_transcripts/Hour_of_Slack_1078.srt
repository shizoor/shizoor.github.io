1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,580
Ich geh auch schon raus mit.

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,580
Es ist ja offen an die Betten.

3
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:45,400
Es ist ja offen an die Betten.

4
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,960
Es ist ja offen an die Betten.

5
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,640
und hat den Traum wahrgenommen.

6
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,440
Machen Sie euren siebten Toiletten so gut,

7
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,280
dass er die anderen sechs übernimmt.

8
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,040
Körle in einen Ball und schließe deinen Kopf mit

9
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,340
THE SOGENIUS POWERHOUSE.

10
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,100
Ich habe meine Westenböcke nicht gemacht.

11
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,740
Schließt nur eure Augen einen Moment

12
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,200
und erinnert euch, dass ihr alle Bob-Buttonen habt,

13
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,560
die ihr vielleicht wollen könnt.

14
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,760
Brillant vier-farbene Bob-Buttonen.

15
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,960
Würde das nicht eure Augen poppen?

16
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,700
Ja, Gang, das ist wirklich was.

17
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,900
Weißt du, Kinder überall schreiben mir,

18
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,580
was für einen tollen Kick sie aus diesen Bob-Buttonen bekommen.

19
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,640
Sie mögen den Weg, wie die rot, schwarz, blau und gelbe Farben

20
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,520
gegen die puren, weißen, enamelten Kappen,

21
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,460
Schuhe oder Jacketten stehen.

22
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,860
Es gibt keine Frage, Gang,

23
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,460
diese Buttons werden täglich mehr populär.

24
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,220
Aber wie ich schon gesagt habe,

25
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,100
kann man diese schmutzigen Bob-Buttonen nirgendwo kaufen.

26
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,480
Nein, all you do is to see to it,

27
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,140
that mom puts in a good supply of Bob-Buttons for your house.

28
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,860
Then you'll find the button,

29
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,860
in the inner wax bag.

30
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,480
It's a prize for you.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,240
It's doubtful you like Bob anymore.

32
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,640
Bob's broke.

33
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,340
Bob goes haywire.

34
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,620
And Bob's desperate.

35
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,160
And Bob's almond-shaped.

36
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,340
And Bob's never gonna find out.

37
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:43,980
And Bob's drunk.

38
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,840
News at 11.

39
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,900
Aliens have landed in front of the White House.

40
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,680
More details after

41
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,940
the subgenious

42
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,020
Hour of Slag.

43
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,900
I am unable to continue

44
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,580
blindly working on a project

45
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,480
of such phenomenal destructive potential.

46
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,600
Accordingly, there is only one

47
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,920
course of action open to me.

48
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,760
Zach Hobson, July 5th.

49
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,660
One.

50
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,500
There has been a malfunction in Project Flashlight

51
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,660
with devastating results.

52
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,000
Two.

53
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,640
It seems

54
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,000
I am the only person left on earth.

55
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,340
Is this really so?

56
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:31,820
Oh, man!

57
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,320
Oh God!

58
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,140
Dave!

59
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,860
That idiot blew up the station again!

60
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,060
I can't believe he would destroy the station again.

61
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,020
As if in some Mobius movie.

62
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,760
Every week he must do the same thing.

63
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,520
He's crying.

64
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,920
He's silly, silly.

65
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,000
We're gonna need more donations, friends.

66
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,100
Gonna need a lot more donations.

67
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,220
You're gonna need a lot of backbone muscles.

68
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,980
A lot of free...

69
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,340
Put out that fire!

70
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,700
...any sort of gland.

71
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,360
...

72
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,640
Oh yeah, right, whatever.

73
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,860
Was he talking about terrising his lawn or something?

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,720
Building burgers. I hate those building burgers.

75
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,400
I thought he was talking about terra.

76
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,440
Oh, terraforming.

77
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,800
No, terracing.

78
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,760
So he's going to start a garden or he's going to start the earth over again.

79
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,520
Which is a very old story.

80
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,300
It didn't originate with the church of the subgenius.

81
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,940
It goes way, way back to 912.

82
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,180
Nebuchadnezzar in the days of ancient Sumeria.

83
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,140
What? The creation

84
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,860
of the world? Stories?

85
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,240
The garden?

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,080
The Adnoi people?

87
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,420
The Adnoi people?

88
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,220
The Adnoi people?

89
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,300
The Adnoi people?

90
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,480
I can't say it.

91
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,420
The Adnoi people

92
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,780
were a kin to the Exes.

93
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,000
Although Exes were easier to pronounce.

94
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,340
Yeah, and it rhymes with sexist.

95
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,360
Yeah.

96
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,360
So you're saying that your own creation or the creation of those

97
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,080
who have fondled you for so long

98
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,320
is a sexist creation?

99
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,660
No, it's the other way around.

100
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,020
We were created by them in a test tube.

101
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,500
Millions and millions

102
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,060
of years ago.

103
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,100
In the deep past.

104
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,500
And friends, that's where I

105
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,740
have returned from.

106
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,660
Follow the pirate flag.

107
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,960
Dave, I don't know if you knew this, but I,

108
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,300
Reverend Stang, have been

109
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,840
lost in time.

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,840
Mostly the

111
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,720
deep past. Mostly the

112
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,540
1980s.

113
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,760
Are you serious?

114
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,620
Yes, I inserted the lever

115
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,140
into the machine.

116
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,240
I pulled the crank.

117
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:10,780
You pulled your crank?

118
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,320
I ignited the platenorite,

119
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,940
which is the active ingredient in the time machine.

120
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,900
That's really dangerous.

121
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,560
And I traveled through

122
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,600
time itself.

123
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,380
The other dimension besides space.

124
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,660
I thought it was a pair of fishnet stockings, and now you're

125
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,700
saying you traveled through very time and space?

126
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,560
Relativistically speaking?

127
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,060
Yes, and I went back, back, back

128
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,640
to a greater day.

129
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,200
A more glorious age.

130
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,980
The early ages

131
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,900
of the subgenius.

132
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,680
The peas and the cheese nut and the children

133
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,400
laughing at each other.

134
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,440
When the subgeniuses still loved Bob.

135
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,120
And when Bob still loved

136
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,960
his children.

137
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,820
Bob Dobbs is crippled.

138
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,020
Yes, friends, it's because

139
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,680
of that job

140
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,240
I got myself into.

141
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,000
Teaching.

142
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,200
I'm Professor Stang now, and I've been teaching

143
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,060
an online course in

144
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,460
the history of the Church of the Subgenius.

145
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,980
The first 100 years.

146
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,560
Is that why you have the bleeding ear dog

147
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,160
with you now?

148
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,860
I've been kind of filled

149
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,560
with the spirit of the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

150
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,620
Yes, I dare say it.

151
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,520
The launching of said bleeding head

152
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,100
has, and I've been

153
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,700
recalling those wonderful rituals.

154
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,800
He's got the suede patches on his plaid shirt.

155
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,400
And I've been in terrible pain.

156
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,800
Because of all the hard work

157
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,860
late into the night.

158
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,960
Scanning and, you know,

159
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,860
documenting this trip

160
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,000
into the past.

161
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,860
Which is so much more fun than the future.

162
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,420
Because the future is

163
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,640
scary and grim.

164
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,320
What could be more fun than the past?

165
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,840
A jolly trip down memory lane.

166
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,460
Yes, back when I was

167
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,080
tortured and abused by

168
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,980
joblessness and jobs.

169
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,660
I can't breathe.

170
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,560
Actually, what I

171
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,580
discovered in my trip to the past,

172
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,380
I met my younger self.

173
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,420
Who was actually

174
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,680
never that young. And I'm pretty well convinced

175
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,500
that the conspiracy has

176
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,480
their own time machine and has gone

177
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,620
back in time and swapped us

178
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,220
for

179
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,280
imposters. With imposters.

180
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,360
Meaning your cyborgic, cymorgic body

181
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,240
is ensconced in some

182
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,740
CIA wagon, nut wagon out there

183
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,880
in the middle of the cosmos.

184
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,300
Why you, the elder

185
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,400
Zionist. Well, I don't know.

186
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,460
I don't really know.

187
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,420
All I know, I looked at these videos

188
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,520
from 1980 and I was never

189
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,460
that young and my friends were never that

190
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,420
young. They were never that cute.

191
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,560
That didn't happen.

192
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,540
I supposedly shot those videos, but somebody

193
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,960
has crept into my home,

194
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,340
dug through these ancient archives

195
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,520
and replaced them, doctored

196
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,340
them. They took the doctor tapes,

197
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,320
the tapes of doctors at the

198
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,800
subcons and the world conclaves

199
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,700
and had restaged

200
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,600
with actors. Well, did you notice

201
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,160
in the one picture that Hal

202
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,540
has a bouffant hairdo?

203
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,040
Right, exactly. I mean, there's

204
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,460
none of us ever had that much hair.

205
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,120
You vaguely remember that time, but if someone

206
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,960
were to say, well, did you walk down, were you in

207
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,060
Lower Haight and you walked down the street to Leggies or something

208
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,840
like that and had a pizza pie? It's like,

209
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,200
no, the memory is so fragmented

210
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,180
and disconnected. I can

211
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,240
barely remember him wearing the bouffant

212
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,440
hairdo. It's

213
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,000
strange. I had many

214
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,320
false memories.

215
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:24,840
And I

216
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,820
discovered that I had split

217
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,040
into two persons. There was the

218
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,560
elderly, the subgenius

219
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,140
sacred scribe

220
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,900
who was having a great time and a new

221
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,180
career. And then there was

222
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,400
worker Smith,

223
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,580
a worker Smith,

224
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,620
citizen Smith,

225
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,860
who lived in the year of 1984,

226
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,920
much like Winston Smith.

227
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,840
I'd say very much. Who, by the way,

228
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,880
joined the church in 1984, the

229
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,560
artist named Winston Smith.

230
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,000
And also the minister of information guy, too.

231
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,920
Ministry of... Well, that's in the future.

232
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,860
He is a minister of information

233
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,080
now, but... Yeah. But we gotta

234
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,540
go to the next 1984

235
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,180
for that to happen.

236
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,000
But first we must go to the next

237
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,200
1998. Well, wasn't

238
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,280
there a collision day?

239
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,140
The time collision. That's

240
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,140
in the future, but it could have repercussions

241
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,020
that echo back to our

242
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,120
time. And maybe these are just ripples

243
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,940
from that time intersection

244
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,640
that we're starting to see.

245
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,960
It's just like a loose fart sprung in a hallway

246
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,060
when there's too many people. You can never tell where

247
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,960
the rebounds are going to go or even some

248
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,440
of the sockets are going to start frying.

249
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,040
Here, come with me. Let's try

250
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,860
this. I'll crank the

251
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,000
lever forward. Here, I'll turn up this little knob.

252
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,940
And look, you can see

253
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,060
the calendar pages are flying

254
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:41,460
away.

255
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,520
The candles are all just

256
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,920
dripping down. That mannequin

257
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,760
across the street keeps changing clothes.

258
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,960
You could change everything.

259
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,020
My wife keeps changing her mind.

260
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,520
But

261
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,940
we are going this time, not into the past.

262
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,460
But deep into the future.

263
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,060
Deformation's a little...

264
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,900
The human race has split into two

265
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,560
species.

266
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,980
Well, actually, that all happened a long

267
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,300
time ago when it split into the subgeniuses

268
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:09,840
and the humans.

269
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,860
But you meant the sexual change...

270
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,520
But what of the Morlocks?

271
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,960
And this is what I learned

272
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,700
in my travels.

273
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,060
The Morlocks, which the pinks like to

274
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,680
regard as some kind of monsters,

275
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,960
are just because

276
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,000
they live underground and come out at night to steal

277
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,240
humans and eat them, like cattle.

278
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,900
The Morlocks are the ones

279
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,800
that are in charge. They're the ones that know

280
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,700
how everything works. And they're pretty, too.

281
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,860
Well, if you're a Morlock...

282
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,940
Well, they're pretty to others.

283
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,740
It's too late when they encounter

284
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,320
them and stuff, but Morlocks are pretty.

285
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,220
Their skin

286
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,220
is very, very shiny and soft.

287
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,880
Their teeth are very, very, very long

288
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,660
and yellow. And it's just

289
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,620
a matter of moments before they snap

290
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,720
the back of your head and eat the

291
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,220
intestines.

292
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,460
Well, they're not that crude about it.

293
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,620
They have little forks and knives and things.

294
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,340
That's what they call it.

295
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,020
They flay you and cook you and so forth.

296
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,720
That's what our descendants will be doing, Dave.

297
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,820
Because we are the

298
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,180
grandsires of the Morlocks,

299
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,460
not of the Eloi.

300
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,300
The Eloi are the cattle. They're the sheeple

301
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,920
that are literally raised.

302
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,320
It's because of class division

303
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,060
today that all of this will happen.

304
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,060
In the continuing class division?

305
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,500
Yes, and in the continuing sequel to

306
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,160
H.G. Wells' Time Machine called

307
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,520
The Time Ships by Stephen

308
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,380
Baxter, which I've been re-reading.

309
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,020
Who is not H.G. Wells?

310
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,280
No, Stephen Baxter.

311
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,880
Yeah, but he's British.

312
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,960
That counts for something.

313
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,340
I have no idea what it might be.

314
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,100
Anyway,

315
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,940
I've had this time

316
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,700
paradox.

317
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,000
Here's another thing. I look at these old

318
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,260
videos of the olden

319
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,860
days of the subgeniuses.

320
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,900
And I find myself identifying

321
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,900
not with the me that I see,

322
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,620
but with this guy, Doug Smith.

323
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,720
Did you ever hear of him?

324
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,100
He was like the office boy.

325
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:03,800
He's a character.

326
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:04,980
Well, okay, yeah, right.

327
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,760
He was a real guy.

328
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,080
But every time I see him on the film, I go,

329
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,560
oh, that's me. But no, that's not me.

330
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,800
That's this loser.

331
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,460
I remember that guy, but why do I keep

332
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,620
identifying with him?

333
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,980
It's not because he was a character in your film,

334
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,700
but what I was saying was he was an actual

335
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,740
kind of a character in Dallas.

336
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,780
He was a known Lee Harvey.

337
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,180
And a crackpot and stuff.

338
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,960
And that's why you're fixated.

339
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,880
When you see him, it's not recognition

340
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,380
of your own cellular self.

341
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,100
It's recognition that you've rubbed elbows

342
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,260
or perhaps pubis with this inordinate

343
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,120
meaning and want to continue

344
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,720
some way.

345
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,700
I believe that's right.

346
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,320
It's a good theory.

347
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,160
It holds all kinds of water.

348
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,300
I don't take no truck

349
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,640
with this modern day

350
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,520
psychotherapeutic jive talk.

351
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,220
That's a bunch of

352
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:55,800
fruit.

353
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,260
It's a bunch of fruit for all.

354
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,380
It's a bunch of hoo-ha.

355
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,000
If you asked me.

356
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,400
You guys with your malleable memories.

357
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,420
You got a smoke sugar?

358
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,020
Hey, here comes another malleable memory again.

359
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,880
I didn't really say something so stupid

360
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,460
that it caused that person to have a nervous breakdown.

361
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,520
That wasn't my fault.

362
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:14,800
No.

363
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,020
That's funny. That memory is so much more comfortable now.

364
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,860
I didn't do that off.

365
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,840
I didn't snap at that innocent child

366
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,180
that time like I remember.

367
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,500
This memory is completely

368
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,440
different now.

369
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,280
And now the hypothalamus comes out.

370
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,400
They say time heals all wounds.

371
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,720
And there's jokes about

372
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,880
what it does to heals.

373
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,760
You should see them in the old days

374
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,640
they had shoe stores.

375
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,860
You would go there and you would argue with shoes.

376
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,760
Perhaps like one of the reptilians would come in

377
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,060
and maybe start a credit thing with you.

378
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,240
Yeah, but it's all been replaced by mall warts now.

379
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,180
Mall warts.

380
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,360
I hate that phrase.

381
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,820
Oh, I hate the one on Mars.

382
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,340
Oh, it's the worst.

383
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,100
Mars marts.

384
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,040
Those are the worst.

385
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,280
The wall of Mars mart.

386
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,960
Yeah, flaying your feet is what it should be called.

387
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,860
The flaying of the vesicles in feet.

388
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,500
You know, they suspect that they've found

389
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,140
evidence of underground water on Mars

390
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,020
squirting out.

391
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,920
But I don't think what squirted was water.

392
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,060
The scientists said

393
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,480
we suspect that the fluidizing agent

394
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,100
is water.

395
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,580
But I don't suspect that myself at all.

396
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,280
Well, see, when you get to be my age,

397
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,520
any fluidizing agent,

398
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,660
you suspect to be water.

399
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,160
Why do they use fluidizing?

400
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,140
Earlier you suspected

401
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,620
it's a schermatopoferenema

402
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,280
or the other spermatic devices

403
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,160
that they use to impregnate universes.

404
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,300
Sometimes, anyway.

405
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,840
I hope I never get old like you, Dave.

406
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,960
Well, you'll probably be cursed

407
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,220
with getting old like yourself.

408
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,840
How long will it be before I get old like Dave?

409
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,000
Five years?

410
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,180
But Dave's about five years further in the time stream.

411
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,780
No, you've already gotten older like yourself.

412
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,980
I know, man.

413
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,580
Once again, you've got to stop obsessing

414
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,480
with these characters that are not real people,

415
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,700
but just characters.

416
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,780
I remember...

417
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,060
I'm going back.

418
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,420
I'm going back again.

419
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,260
And I remember the first time I met

420
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,400
Dr. G. Gordon Gordon, Bob's bodyguard.

421
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,840
I remember thinking,

422
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,920
I can't believe that there's a subgenius

423
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,120
who's that old.

424
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,860
I think at the time he was 39.

425
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,380
Well, that's an old subgenius.

426
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,180
Well, when you're 26,

427
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,320
when you're 27, sure.

428
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,880
Yeah, 39's real old.

429
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,940
What's the expected lifespan?

430
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,420
Everybody knows a subgenius doesn't have long on this plane.

431
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,000
Philo just married a 37-year-old

432
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,960
and I thought he was being a crib fisherman.

433
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,180
A crib fisherman?

434
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,360
Cradle robber.

435
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,480
And she's robbing the grave, of course.

436
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,360
She's leaving the analogy of a fish out of it.

437
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,100
Because aren't you?

438
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,020
We're going to go to San Francisco

439
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,080
and see Philo and Puzzlin

440
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,820
and Dr. Howell and...

441
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,460
Lies.

442
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,020
And not you, Gary.

443
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,960
And lies.

444
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,940
Yeah, there'll be a lot of lies.

445
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,140
Will you be having San Francisco treats

446
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,500
or just taking the telegraph or the...

447
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,460
Actually, I think we're going to have...

448
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,000
Carmel car, whatever it's called.

449
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,900
We're going to have our annual

450
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,620
anal subgenius business meeting

451
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,520
at the Crosley Bendix studio

452
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,120
in Berkeley.

453
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,180
Where over the edge...

454
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,200
It starts over the edge

455
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,200
and then we fall all the way into the puzzling evidence

456
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,500
and it's five hours long.

457
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,240
Oh, and Phineas Narco.

458
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,220
Maybe we can dig up...

459
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,000
We've got to remember not you, Phineas, this time.

460
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,820
Five weird hours.

461
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,320
There are a lot in the Bay Arians.

462
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:27,620
Yeah.

463
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:32,560
The Bay Arians are a masterful race of po-buckers.

464
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,460
Of all different hue,

465
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,420
but still some sort of...

466
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:35,780
Yeah.

467
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,560
Of some kind.

468
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,240
Yeah.

469
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,140
They call it Baghed by the Bay,

470
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,720
yet there's no people wearing furniture on their backs.

471
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,740
Yeah, there are now.

472
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:44,480
There are?

473
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:44,700
Yeah.

474
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,160
There is?

475
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:45,580
Yeah.

476
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:45,980
Okay.

477
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,300
And...

478
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,440
Are there any Bay Arians, Breath Arians?

479
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,580
Do you think?

480
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,580
Oh, surely.

481
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,280
I heard that they died out.

482
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,100
They have...

483
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,300
I heard that, yeah, the Breath Arians just...

484
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,360
They all just sort of dried up and blew away.

485
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,620
Well, they still have Sufi frog divers.

486
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,100
I mean, they've had those since the late 60s.

487
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,120
Is that what's crawling up out of the water right now?

488
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,260
No, I think that might be one of the Pummelards.

489
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,560
They've got the long back.

490
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,460
Oh, that's not one of the Morlocks.

491
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,660
It's one of the Lesslocks.

492
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:16,940
One of the...

493
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,480
They don't have it.

494
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,140
They're not as hairy.

495
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,540
It's a very hairy one underneath.

496
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,140
Just don't get too close to the stone.

497
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:24,420
Uh-uh.

498
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,380
It's a face only a mommy Morlock could...

499
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,920
This music in the background is from the...

500
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,360
The face is in the coin area.

501
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,180
The George Powell...

502
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,320
And it's where the buttocks should be.

503
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:33,840
Time Machine.

504
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,520
Which is the only movie that's ever been made of the novel The Time Machine.

505
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:46,560
There have been some crapolas, including one directed by H.G. Wells' grandson in 2001 that just...

506
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,320
Oh, God.

507
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,640
Oh, God.

508
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,220
Oh, God.

509
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,920
I hear crickets.

510
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,740
Is that coming from your head?

511
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,440
I just...

512
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,040
I get upset when the holy texts are trifled with.

513
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,520
Hollywood does that.

514
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:09,460
Hollywood will take a great piece of literature that's an earnest warning that we should all heed

515
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,940
and change it into a guy flying through the air in front of a fireball.

516
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,980
But you should not...

517
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,860
Who saves the world by using his brute strength and going...

518
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,060
To push the lever at the last minute.

519
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,380
Just relax.

520
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,020
And it blows up every Morlocks hole in the whole world.

521
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:24,900
Everything's fine.

522
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,840
And the only reason the Morlocks came was because there was an industrial accident.

523
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,380
It wasn't because of the have-nots and the haves.

524
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,940
Here come some of those haves right now.

525
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,980
Oh, the cricket sound coming out of his left ear, you mean?

526
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,880
It looks like the maneuver horns went like one side of the...

527
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,180
They're coming after us, have-nots.

528
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,600
What do they call that part of...

529
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,480
Those horny haves are coming after us, little hornless have-nots.

530
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,860
No, no, no, no, no, no.

531
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,720
Are you ready for the next course?

532
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:01,360
We've finished the long pig and coming up next we'll be having short pig.

533
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:01,880
Short pig.

534
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,460
And we'll be doodling in the ice cream, so please don't disturb this table.

535
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,440
It's a table of science and a table of reason.

536
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,480
So if you could just get your fat equipment back into the December zone where you don't belong.

537
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,820
It's dream time for you, baby.

538
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,400
Just get...

539
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,680
Yeah, never mind the fug fish and the Ernestines and the chocolate soup.

540
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,060
And any of the other...

541
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,080
And that's another thing.

542
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,600
I haven't had a dream in years now.

543
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:35,160
Did my dreams go to another time stream?

544
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,500
Is someone else dreaming my dreams?

545
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,180
Someone has stolen his dreams.

546
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,040
They're kept on dusk.

547
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,540
They stole my dreams.

548
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,720
They're keeping your dreams on dusk.

549
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,160
You stole my dreams, man.

550
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,380
Bob, I believed in you, dude.

551
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,780
I saw you on night flight and I believed in you.

552
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,980
I was only...

553
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,260
I was only...

554
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,500
Eight years old.

555
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,620
And you let me down, man.

556
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,560
You let me down.

557
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:03,680
Stang.

558
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,960
This is the voice of someone who doesn't sound like Bob, but really is.

559
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,440
Fall upon your knee, all three.

560
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,660
Look.

561
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,840
Out the window.

562
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,380
Yeah.

563
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,160
Look, it is Santa Claus with a pipe.

564
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:18,300
It's stolen.

565
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,480
Your dreams have been ransomed.

566
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,200
Santa's real.

567
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,480
Your ransom has been neglected.

568
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,320
I knew it.

569
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,280
Go and look under the Christmas tree.

570
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,840
The baby Jesus is lying there.

571
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,720
Christ Jesus.

572
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,540
For you.

573
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,440
Oh, he's probably...

574
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,140
Look at that crucified baby.

575
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,940
He's so cute.

576
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,640
I told you if you had faith.

577
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,080
I told you.

578
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,000
So heartwarming.

579
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:43,740
Oh, this manger is so warm and comfy with that crucified infant there.

580
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:52,020
And who is that horned man sitting in that rocking chair over there knitting?

581
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,360
That's not Santa.

582
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,100
That's not Santa, is it?

583
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,020
No, that's...

584
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,480
We call him Uncle Scratchspunkle.

585
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,160
It's kind of a long name, but it serves his purposes.

586
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,140
Come on over and meet him.

587
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,120
He's a hell of a guy.

588
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,480
I've always wanted to meet Mr...

589
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,420
What's his name?

590
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:07,800
Scratchspunkle.

591
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:08,800
Oh, right.

592
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,380
Scratchspunkle.

593
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:10,720
Oh, sure.

594
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,920
That must be old Splitfoot that they're always...

595
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,040
Hey, hey, kids over here.

596
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,560
What's your name?

597
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,540
You with the long hair and the pull out.

598
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,500
I'm Reverend Ivan Stang and I want to be a famous filmmaker when I grow up.

599
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,460
I want to be just like that.

600
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:23,460


601
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:23,460


602
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:23,460


603
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:23,460


604
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,440
I want to be just like Ray Harryhausen.

605
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,720
Bend over and pull down your pants.

606
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,440
What?

607
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,300
Bend over and pull down your pants.

608
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,140
I want to see what you're really made of, Stang.

609
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,060
To get in this club, you've got to be made of plenty of things.

610
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,320
My mama told me not to talk to people like you, Mr. Scratch.

611
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,360
Never mind.

612
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,660
I've got a check.

613
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:39,620
Okay.

614
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,300
Ow!

615
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:40,980
Ow!

616
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:41,720
Ow!

617
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,280
That thing's cold.

618
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,400
No, that's the device that was implanted in you long, long, long, long, long ago.

619
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:49,980
Do that again.

620
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,520
I say.

621
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,340
He doesn't even know how long he's been out there, does he?

622
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,440
He's snobbish.

623
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,440


624
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,440


625
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,440


626
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,440


627
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,300
He smiles, he laughs, he's living his own life.

628
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,180
He thinks there's nothing.

629
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,960
He's sold his dreams.

630
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:57,720
He has no dreams.

631
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,500
I'm laughing.

632
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,280
I don't laugh.

633
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,460
Stop breathing.

634
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,460
All right.

635
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,020
You, Philoderman.

636
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,260
You, the third Duranio.

637
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,560
You, you.

638
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,520
Step to the...

639
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,640
He's already...

640
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,780
Okay, he's sleeping.

641
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,820
You, we are done.

642
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,020
Step up to the front.

643
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,240
Step up.

644
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:21,980
Closer.

645
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,400
Up front.

646
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:23,420
Up front.

647
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:23,420


648
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:23,420


649
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:23,420


650
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:23,420


651
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:23,420


652
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:23,420


653
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:23,420


654
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:23,420


655
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:23,420


656
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:23,420


657
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:23,440


658
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:23,440


659
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,420
Do you know how to do the little girly pirouette?

660
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,260
Do you now how to put one finger on top of your head and make a ballerina like me?

661
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:31,780
I'm too nervous.

662
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,320
You've practiced.

663
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,080
You've practiced for aeons.

664
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,360
Ooh.

665
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:36,380


666
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:36,400
Yes.

667
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,660
I can't, I can't.

668
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,660
I have stage fright.

669
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,100
You've been motionutos.

670
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,520
Don't you want to be Little Miss Sunshine?

671
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,720
Don't you want to be like him?

672
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,200
Her?

673
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:42,880
It?

674
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,300
Any of those things?

675
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,880
You can't give up now after we've come all this way.

676
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,300
Don't you want to assemble other things in the room?

677
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,580
For instance, the turn table.

678
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,420
Don't you want to be like everybody else?

679
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:53,420


680
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:56,300
Das ist die große Chance, normal zu sein.

681
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,320
Sie sah die Lichter in ihr Kopf kommen.

682
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,860
Am Topf ihres Kopfes, wo ein Baby ein kleines Donut-Farm gemacht hat.

683
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,280
Es war ein leiser Ort, aber sicher genug,

684
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,500
wurde das Gehirn gequetscht und vibriert.

685
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,720
Ein Donut-Farm, ist das was, was auf dem Kopf war?

686
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,360
Nun, einige Leute haben es allgemein umgekehrt.

687
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:50,320
Einfach... seltsam.

688
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,060
Ein paar.

689
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,400
Einfach... seltsam.

690
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,140
Einfach... seltsam.

691
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,280
Einfach... seltsam.

692
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:09,960
Santa Claus.

693
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,320
Einfach... seltsam.

694
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,100
Nicht schreien, Kind.

695
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,820
Ich werde dich nicht schreien.

696
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,560
Ich weiß, du bist ein Bob.

697
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,160
Schleim, dunkle Haare, schön aussehend.

698
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:19,900
Dann...

699
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,280
Dann musst du...

700
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:21,860
Vielleicht.

701
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:22,820
Nicht wahr?

702
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,360
Was machst du?

703
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,660
Du wirst es finden.

704
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,520
Schleim.

705
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,660
Aber, je, ich...

706
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:33,940
Schleimhaare.

707
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,320
Schau, Bob.

708
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,560
Komm.

709
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,620
Schön aussehend.

710
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,700
Oh, je.

711
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,600
Ich weiß nicht, was ich tun soll.

712
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,980
Halt deine Mund schief.

713
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,880
So lang, Bob.

714
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,940
Ich verspreche, dass ich komme, aber er versucht, es auszuheben.

715
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,800
Ich sagte ihm, ob er kommen muss, ob er es will oder nicht.

716
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,180
Er hat es richtig gemacht, Bob?

717
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:57,920
Ja, sicher.

718
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,320
Oh, na gut.

719
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:02,300
Ich glaube, ich muss, wie er sagte, sie alle zusammenheben.

720
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,380
Und dann komme ich.

721
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,420
Nachher, ein entspannter junger Bob.

722
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,400
Das ist alles klar, Bob.

723
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,220
Echt?

724
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,560
Ist das einer von ihnen?

725
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:11,940
Das ist Bob.

726
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,200
Oh, so ist es.

727
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:13,980
Wie geht es, Sir?

728
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,400
Bob hier ist eingeschaltet und wartet...

729
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,360
Wenn wir da rauskommen?

730
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:17,840
Ja.

731
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,080
Es gab zwei große Jungs und eine Mädchen.

732
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,540
Sie versuchten, Bob zu sagen, er sei einer von ihnen.

733
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,980
Und er hat gemerkt, er hätte...

734
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,960
Oh, Robert.

735
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,240
Was ist passiert?

736
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,260
Sieh, Mama.

737
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,460
Ich weiß nicht, wie ich es dir sagen soll, aber...

738
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,620
Sei nicht so dumm, Bob.

739
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,640
Du hast einen guten Job gemacht.

740
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,200
Oh, Robert.

741
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,560
Aber Mama, es war wirklich nicht so, wie er sagte.

742
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,520
Bis morgen, Bob.

743
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,320
Ja, Frau.

744
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:36,620
Ich...

745
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,020
Ich verstehe diese Dinge nicht.

746
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:42,160
Ich weiß nur, dass er ein Mann ist, der mit Haar auf den Händen hat

747
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,520
und kein Blut in seinem Gesicht.

748
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,100
Er isst kein Essen und ist mordlich Angst vor...

749
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,400
...die Prussikus.

750
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,220
Die...

751
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,100
...so geniöse...

752
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,100
...Power...

753
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,560
...of...

754
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,220
...Wand...

755
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,260
...Wand...

756
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,600
...Ich bin ein Sturm...

757
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,260
...Ich bin ein Sturm...

758
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:57,460
...einer von allen...

759
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:57,720
...und...

760
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,120
...ich...

761
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,900
...helf...

762
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,520
Das ist PR-Mobio.

763
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,100
Siehst du, Bob, mit...

764
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,100
...especially mit...

765
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,360
...und...

766
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:10,840
...und...

767
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,060
...er macht Dinge...

768
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,680
...er macht Dinge...

769
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,320
...was...

770
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:14,980
...was...

771
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,240
Siehst du...

772
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:16,540
...das...

773
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,080


774
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:17,360
...Bee...

775
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,240
...Bob...

776
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,280
...da ist keine Frage darüber.

777
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,420
PR kommt aus PR-Stationen.

778
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,200
Hey.

779
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,000
Ja?

780
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,060
Ja.

781
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,000
Ja.

782
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:26,820
Nein?

783
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,460
Wie?

784
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,000
Hey, du, B.

785
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,540
Ich wette, du könntest ein paar der Trick-Stücke, die sie haben,

786
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,620
wie das Plastik-Eis-Cube.

787
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,260
Das kannst du in den Rubber-Cheese geben,

788
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,960
das kannst du in den Kaffee mit Soap in den Mitteln geben,

789
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,240
um es mit Rubber-Snaken zu vermischen, mit dem Bug in es.

790
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,140
Geil.

791
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,420
Hat es funktioniert?

792
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,800
Oh, er hat es gemacht.

793
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,780
Meine Mutter weint und trinkt,

794
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,160
aber du bist aus dem Fenster.

795
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,560
Ja, warum nicht?

796
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,480
Na, Hank?

797
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,980
Das ist gut, tschüss.

798
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,100
Beavitt to Lemur.

799
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,680
There's no doubt.

800
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:06,320
That was all Lemurian stuff just then, by the way.

801
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,080
You must disclaim that through pure coincidence...

802
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,140
There's Lemur in the back...

803
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,400
And look, they're over in the background of the scene.

804
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,500
You can see him fighting.

805
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,780
What were you saying, Dave?

806
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,080
I was just saying that through pure coincidence...

807
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,860
Through pure coincidence of improvised girdle wear

808
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,720
and by that Lemurian rantade

809
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,140
that we were thrust into a position,

810
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,760
a carnal, somewhat abstruse position,

811
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,480
where we're forced, and forcing small children

812
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,440
to think that they must have sex with Santa Claus,

813
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,880
especially if they're a male,

814
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,800
a little, good little boy

815
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,740
who deserves more than a trick or treat on Holy Night

816
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,060
and more than one of those peppermint cakes

817
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:46,740
that you can eat at the end of the day.

818
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,080
And I'm not saying that's a good thing,

819
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,080


820
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,580
but I'm saying that there's a change in the wrong spot.

821
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:54,120
And I just wanted to disclaim from the bottom of my...

822
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,680
Yeah, that we're not into that.

823
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,200
No, we're a mirror reflecting the ills of society around us.

824
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:05,100
That's a satirical take-off on putting down that sort of thing, you see.

825
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,860
We're against young boys.

826
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,040
Man, how could I not have gotten that?

827
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,300
I'm sorry, I took three...

828
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,260
What are... Equinox?

829
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,080
We try to always be against the...

830
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,320
The young boys in our church.

831
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,740
Firmly against them?

832
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:22,860
Well...

833
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,380
You try to direct their...

834
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,720
Let's not go there.

835
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,000
We've gone there so many times before.

836
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:32,880
Yeah, but let's not...

837
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,460
Can we please...

838
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,040
Go there right now.

839
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,320
Particularly at this juncture.

840
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,680
Not... Later, Dave, later.

841
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,500
What are you foul-faced, smelly boys doing down there?

842
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,380
I can hell and smell and hear all of you up here.

843
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,780
You, Stang.

844
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,280
Get your hand away from that woman's...

845
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,720
Get out of there.

846
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,900
Can I put it on mine?

847
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:52,960
No, no.

848
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,980
Move up here by the stairs.

849
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,300
I wanna see your face in the...

850
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,240
In the light.

851
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,800
So you wanted to see me.

852
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,500
You wanna know who I am and what I am.

853
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,520
Well, then I'll show you I will.

854
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:07,620
Mwahahahaha!

855
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,660
Look, look, I didn't mean nothing by it.

856
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,020
See, you go on, do what you want.

857
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,700
What's happened to her?

858
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,460
She's scary looking now.

859
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,940
Friends, life is tough and it does things to you.

860
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,820
And makes you old and ugly and wrinkled.

861
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,560
Why, just the other day Susie the floozy was saying,

862
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,220
Yeah, Stang used to be pretty ugly, but you're cute now.

863
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,900
Isn't that weird how that happens?

864
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,440
I actually think it was the other way around.

865
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:41,400
Like I say, I was looking at old videos and I was like, oh no, I was cute.

866
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:46,560
If I didn't have any idea how cute I was, I would have cheated, started cheating on my wife.

867
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,060
No, you were looking...

868
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,000
...big time.

869
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,540
Well, you already cheated on your wife.

870
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,020
I blew it, man!

871
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:50,660
Before you cheated.

872
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,800
I totally blew it!

873
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,520
That's what everybody says, you know.

874
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,420
Now it's too late.

875
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,840
It's a waste.

876
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,580
Might as well just throw it all away now.

877
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,620
Calm down there, calm down.

878
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,200
Just a loser, man.

879
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,520
There are greater things at hand.

880
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,660
Greater gains, greater loss.

881
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,400
Bub, let me down, man.

882
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,060
Life is a bowl of pickles surrounded rich, rich,

883
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,580
He never gave me the bowl of pickles.

884
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,580
He gave me three slices.

885
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:16,720
Three slices.

886
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,860
And they weren't the kind I liked. They were sweet pickles.

887
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,060
Yes, that's the church of the subgenius.

888
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:34,100
You've been listening to the drama entitled WCSB I.D. Oye.

889
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:41,080
We'll be back to our normal programming after this word.

890
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,480
Okay.

891
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,020
That was it.

892
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,100
That was the word was okay?

893
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:46,460
Yeah.

894
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:46,580


895
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,020
Go ahead.

896
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,980
So are we back yet, so to speak?

897
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:49,360
Yeah.

898
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:49,500
Okay.

899
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:49,960
We're back.

900
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,680
Well, I remember what we were talking before.

901
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:56,600
We was trying to put out some of the small fires who are still in the studio here.

902
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:01,760
We had some problems with the EMS and we were trying to do a disclaimer, but you said

903
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,640
it was just satire about, well, I can't really remember the flow of anything.

904
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,640
Why am I even on the radio?

905
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,060
I'm going home.

906
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:08,320
Goodbye.

907
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:12,560
That was the way I felt for so long.

908
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,040
That's because you were in pain.

909
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,440
See, pain does that to you, Stan.

910
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,720
There's nothing wrong with you, really.

911
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,760
It's not in your mind, like you might think.

912
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,420
You think you're going mad, don't you?

913
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,140
See?

914
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,720
You think you're going mad, don't you?

915
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:23,980
See?

916
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:24,900
Sometimes.

917
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:25,720
No.

918
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,300
You look out the window and you wish you could fly by like a witch, don't you?

919
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,580
Maybe jump in the dumpster and have some little snack.

920
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:32,820
Sure you do.

921
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,360
Come on.

922
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:42,400
I saw a guy one time I was parked outside of a bar, stuck, waiting for Jesus actually

923
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,560
to finish up inside the bar, getting the money.

924
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,920
It was seven in the morning or something.

925
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:53,900
And there was an old man, he looked kind of like you, Dave, rooting through the dumpster

926
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,900
by the bar.

927
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,900
And he would pull out paper cups and look at them and there'd be a little bit of beer

928
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:02,560
in there and he'd drink the beer and then...

929
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,380
That's risky business.

930
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,260
Uncarbonated beer.

931
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,120
You know what uncarbonated beer looks like, don't you?

932
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,720
It looks like diamonds.

933
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,700
No, it looks like human urine.

934
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,540
And so, therefore, I would say that was risky business.

935
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:15,540


936
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:21,780
Well, I mean, he was giving them a little look, you know, and I mean, hey, look, if you

937
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,440
need it, you know how it is.

938
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:30,640
He just really needed a drink and that was the only way he could get them.

939
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,180
Well, Mr. Know-it-all, the part you don't realize is shortly after you looked away and

940
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,260
thought of inhumanities, inhumanities to itself...

941
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,520
Yeah, it wasn't like I went over there and gave him a buck or anything.

942
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,180
Right.

943
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,920
I could have gone over and said, here, man, take two bucks and buy yourself a quart of

944
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,120
beer.

945
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,800
I could have said, you know, you're going to be dead in two weeks anyway.

946
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:53,100
You prefer to anecdotally comment on it later rather than notice as he walked in the shadows

947
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,500
ostensibly to be looking for more of those things.

948
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,360
And the thing is, obviously, with Jesus...

949
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,240
He popped out.

950
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:02,680
Jesus could have filled every one of those dirty old cups with fresh new beer.

951
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,960
But he wasn't looking for fresh or old beer.

952
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,660
He was waiting to pop that third thyroid eye out.

953
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,700
No, he was trying to get money out of the club owner.

954
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,580
Well, I was trying to do a shtick where he turned out to be an alien and he just like,

955
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,280
you know, just...

956
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:15,980
Jesus?

957
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,140
He's not.

958
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,280
No, the old drunken fellow.

959
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:19,900
Oh.

960
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,140
So the old drunken fellow goes, ah, never mind.

961
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:23,900
Okay.

962
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:24,280
Okay.

963
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,440
But you did know this person?

964
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,540
That wasn't you, was it?

965
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:28,980
No.

966
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,660
It was in Columbus.

967
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,100
No.

968
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:30,900
I think.

969
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:35,100
Just because Columbus is in the same temporal plane as Ohio.

970
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,380
He really looked like he was really old.

971
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,760
And, you know, kind of had that...

972
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,620
Old look.

973
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,300
That lonesome cowboyish look.

974
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:45,520
Yeah.

975
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:45,520


976
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:45,520


977
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:45,520


978
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:45,520


979
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:45,520


980
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:45,520


981
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:45,520


982
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:45,520


983
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:45,520


984
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,540
I don't think those things combine very well.

985
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:47,840
But here's the...

986
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,980
Oh, I know what my point was.

987
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,200
I know, here was my point.

988
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:55,420
But the whole thing, while I was looking at that man, I was thinking, I wish I was him.

989
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,320
Because he...

990
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,240
It looks to me like he's got a slightly better deal than I do.

991
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,020
So I was working too hard then.

992
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,000
And I got the impression this guy wasn't really working very hard.

993
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:08,100
You know how hard it is to find a good hearty ale amongst all the urine?

994
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:12,120
Man, that guy works hours and hours and it's not for 10.95s, dang.

995
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,800
But he could drink on the job.

996
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,680
That's the difference.

997
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,900
Yeah, of course.

998
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,220
Look, my back hurts.

999
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,200
Drink it is part of the job.

1000
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,160
I really wanted a beer, a medicinal beer all day today.

1001
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,200
And there were two crappy tasting beers in the fridge.

1002
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:29,600
But I didn't touch them because I knew I had to do a radio show tonight.

1003
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,880
And that's how much I care about...

1004
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,740
What am I saying?

1005
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:34,780
Yeah, really.

1006
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,020
I'm going home.

1007
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,540
I'm gonna go have a beer right now.

1008
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:44,220
He's gonna go and have seven medicinal beers and then try and find the keys so he can

1009
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:44,600
go and get them.

1010
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,160
And he's gonna get an additional six medicinal beers.

1011
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:47,640
Hey, Bob!

1012
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,480
You better not talk about Bob!

1013
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,080
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1014
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,020
It's real important.

1015
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,940
Bob, shall we just talk about Bob?

1016
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,400
If you get tired, just push one of the buttons on that and some stuff will apply.

1017
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:57,620
Any button?

1018
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,000
Yeah, pretty much.

1019
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,840
Can we go like, you know, move one up, down and like...

1020
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,440
That's what I like.

1021
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:01,940
I like that.

1022
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,320
It's like a show normally.

1023
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,240
Okay.

1024
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,620
That's what I do.

1025
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,440
You're gonna drink them all?

1026
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,280
You're not gonna save even like one or two?

1027
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,080
Damn, I can't get into the car.

1028
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,340
Yeah.

1029
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:13,660
No.

1030
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:13,880
No.

1031
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,380
No.

1032
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:14,660
No.

1033
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:14,660


1034
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:14,660


1035
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:14,660


1036
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:14,660


1037
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:14,660


1038
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,380
See, Princess Wee has no...

1039
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,520
Princess Wee's had to deal with me when I get carried away.

1040
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,680
He can't get away.

1041
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,200
You have the handcuffs as well?

1042
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,580
Well, we don't talk about those on the air.

1043
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,540
Look, this...

1044
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:39,240
We're given an hour of public air space and we should use it for something edifying.

1045
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,620
Yes, edification.

1046
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,680
But aren't we supposed to like bitch about the president or decroceate?

1047
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:45,130
decry the war

1048
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:47,290
or something

1049
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,690
I don't know, you know,

1050
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,330
cool or whatever.

1051
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,570
That shows our outrage with the fluxes

1052
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,630
that we're in vagary with.

1053
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:56,890
Yeah. Well,

1054
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,590
well, everybody knows where we stand.

1055
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,130
We're not very fond of wars.

1056
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,510
This one guy on alt-slack

1057
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,270
who does a radio show

1058
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,430
of his own out of Houston.

1059
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:08,190
He was going,

1060
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,610
I need some Christmas stuff to do Christmas.

1061
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,410
I was going to do a new show and maybe

1062
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:14,750
use some Bush cut-ups.

1063
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,630
And at the phrase Bush cut-ups

1064
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,230
another subgenius

1065
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,610
kind of cut in and went,

1066
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:21,950
oh,

1067
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:24,530
spare me.

1068
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,350
And I've got to admit, when I

1069
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:29,310
put in this week's Bush cut-up

1070
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:31,110
I was thinking, wait a minute, man.

1071
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,210
Haven't we had

1072
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,190
enough Bush cut-ups on

1073
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,810
all the college radio shows?

1074
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,190
I mean, I got tired

1075
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,830
of Clinton cut-ups before that.

1076
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:42,370
Before that was the other Bush.

1077
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,310
Before that it was

1078
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:45,210
that other guy.

1079
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,970
And then before that was that other Bush.

1080
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:47,910
And then it was that other guy.

1081
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,790
Before that it was that other Bush.

1082
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,890
So it's been Bushes every time for 50 years.

1083
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,170
People don't remember that.

1084
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,710
They don't know their actual names.

1085
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:56,730
They're given stage names.

1086
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,170
After they leave Andover, Mass,

1087
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,250
prep school, they're all given stage names.

1088
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:02,470
They don't remember Fred Bush,

1089
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,370
who was the president after Johnson.

1090
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:05,570
The original one.

1091
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:07,870
And John Bush, who was the president

1092
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,550
just before Eisenhower.

1093
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,510
In between Truman and Eisenhower.

1094
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,510
What about Weisenheimer?

1095
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:13,210
K. Bush.

1096
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:15,070
The actual man behind the Civil War.

1097
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,970
He thought Seward was pushing Lincoln's buttons.

1098
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:19,310
My parents saw him get assassinated on Telegraph.

1099
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:21,150
Yeah, with ice skates.

1100
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:23,670
I guess they just cut him to ribbons

1101
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,750
in front of a couple thousand people at least.

1102
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,410
Man, those were the days.

1103
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:28,370
Those were the days.

1104
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,990
You guys are totally forgetting

1105
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:32,330
the assassinated Samuel Bush.

1106
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,230
Oh yeah, of course.

1107
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:34,950
Sam Bush.

1108
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:38,350
That was a sad day when Sam Bush went down

1109
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,370
near the Depositorium.

1110
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,210
And there were at least three extra

1111
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:43,230
wounded gunmen.

1112
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:46,370
They were called the Bush League, weren't they?

1113
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,010
At a very serious time.

1114
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,170
League of Bush or something like that.

1115
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,690
That's like the Hanseatic League.

1116
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,270
I think you're thinking of the Bilderbergers,

1117
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,290
which is, although interrelated.

1118
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,950
I like Wendy's. I prefer Wendy's, really.

1119
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,890
And I like Limburger myself best.

1120
00:38:58,930 --> 00:38:59,110
Do you?

1121
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,150
Is that what that is?

1122
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,630
I wondered what that is.

1123
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:05,970
It smells like either a chemical or like one of those...

1124
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:08,110
Have you been rolling in cheese, dear?

1125
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:08,770
Again.

1126
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,670
Cheese is what I've been rolling in.

1127
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:12,430
I let it fall.

1128
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,090
We've all been rolling in something, friends.

1129
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,850
And what have you been rolling in?

1130
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,870
You know how dogs like to roll in

1131
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:22,010
smelly dead things and then suddenly

1132
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,050
show up at your doorstep wagging their tail

1133
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:26,750
thinking, oh, they're gonna love me now.

1134
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:29,330
Jesus loves me.

1135
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,190
City dogs don't get to do that.

1136
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,830
You get to roll in dead

1137
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:35,550
like rats and stuff that are near the sewers.

1138
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:36,890
No, they're not allowed out.

1139
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:38,550
Dogs in the city can't go out.

1140
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:41,410
They get snatched up and taken to the laboratories.

1141
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,290
They must be on a limb.

1142
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:44,650
Leash, don't you know.

1143
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:45,110
Yeah.

1144
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,250
Now, in the country, your dog will...

1145
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,850
Dogs has always been my friend.

1146
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:54,010
Except when they roll in the dead things.

1147
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:54,770
And then...

1148
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,530
Sometimes they will chase a silly skunk

1149
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,390
out in the wilderness

1150
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,490
and learn a lesson afterwards.

1151
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:05,610
And sometimes they'll chase shadowy figures

1152
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,630
that look like they're wearing those

1153
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:10,350
Burger King crowns.

1154
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,290
Have you ever seen those guys?

1155
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,290
I thought it was drug users that chased them.

1156
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,130
They chased the shadowy...

1157
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,890
Oh, no, they flee shadowy figures.

1158
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:18,270
Well, some drug addicts and dogs

1159
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,570
are one and the same.

1160
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,070
Well, and then you had that dog

1161
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,730
that chased invisible things.

1162
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:24,650
Yeah, yeah.

1163
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:28,170
I lived on the Lakota reservation then

1164
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:31,770
and this old medicine man gentleman

1165
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:34,730
informed me that my dog could see spirits

1166
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:37,710
because it had been injured in a car accident

1167
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:41,130
and was different than other dogs.

1168
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,210
That it could see spirits and chase...

1169
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,170
Well, I believe it.

1170
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:46,470
I don't.

1171
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,150
You don't?

1172
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:47,350
No.

1173
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:49,530
Was the medicine man a known liar?

1174
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:50,390
No, no.

1175
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,890
No, he wasn't anything like Bob.

1176
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:54,470
Well, see, there you go.

1177
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:56,030
You know, Bob is a convincing

1178
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,650
but still a lying...

1179
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:59,790
Well, actually, I shouldn't say that.

1180
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:02,990
Actually, these particular bunch of medicine men

1181
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,850
were, in fact, charlatans

1182
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:07,410
who put on fake seances.

1183
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:10,270
But they didn't do it for money.

1184
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:12,150
They really did heal people

1185
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:12,970
because, you know,

1186
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:13,950
the placebo effect.

1187
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:14,950
And it really works.

1188
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,510
I later, I went to several of their ceremonies

1189
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,390
and I believed completely

1190
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:22,070
that the spirits of dead holy manhood

1191
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:24,090
Indian guys had entered the room

1192
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,610
because you could smell the buffalo leather.

1193
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:26,710
You could, you know,

1194
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,530
they even made little sparkies

1195
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,870
and flashies in the dark.

1196
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:32,070
And later, sitting in the extra meditation

1197
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:34,030
one year, I suddenly went,

1198
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,050
that was nothing but masking tape

1199
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,550
being stripped real fast in the dark.

1200
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,990
And those were just old brattles they had.

1201
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,850
And they just had a box full of smells.

1202
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:43,470
Smelly old stuff.

1203
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,610
And, oh my God,

1204
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,570
that guy was faking that whole thing.

1205
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,670
And he even told us,

1206
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,290
he said, after you leave,

1207
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:52,810
you may start to think about

1208
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,190
what has happened here.

1209
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,870
But you have to remember,

1210
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:58,210
what's important is your feeling.

1211
00:41:58,530 --> 00:41:59,930
Think how you felt.

1212
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,630
And he was as much as saying,

1213
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,290
look, I know you wash your shoes,

1214
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:04,510
you're probably not going to believe

1215
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,110
this is real.

1216
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:06,270
Sooner or later,

1217
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:08,230
you're going to wise up and come down.

1218
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:10,670
But I'm not doing this for money

1219
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:11,970
and it really does help people.

1220
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:14,650
And maybe you'll get some kicks out of it too.

1221
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:15,390
That's beautiful.

1222
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:17,590
And there were cases,

1223
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,390
at least I heard of,

1224
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:23,590
like a person that had been told

1225
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:26,070
by the Bureau of Indian Affairs Hospital

1226
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:28,050
that their cancer was incurable.

1227
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:29,370
But they go to the medicine man

1228
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:30,150
and lo and behold,

1229
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:32,310
their cancer is miraculously cured.

1230
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,110
Because they believed.

1231
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:36,790
They believed, sure, Bob was a liar.

1232
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:38,690
And sure, Mr. Steed,

1233
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,910
the medicine man, was a charlatan.

1234
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:41,210
But,

1235
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,310
he wasn't the kind of charlatan

1236
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,550
that's only in it for the money.

1237
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,670
He was brought groceries.

1238
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:48,450
You know, after you went to one of his things,

1239
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:50,690
it was expected that you'd sort of

1240
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:52,830
drop off a load of groceries next week.

1241
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:55,610
So he was eating off your lack of suffering

1242
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:57,530
because he was a true Hippocratic charlatan.

1243
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:58,570
He wasn't like,

1244
00:42:58,670 --> 00:42:59,450
he wasn't a duck

1245
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:00,910
or one of those people

1246
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:02,170
that argue with french fries.

1247
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:04,930
He was a serious, serious charlatan.

1248
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:05,610
He was a helpful.

1249
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:06,570
He's still a charlatan.

1250
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:08,710
He was using his charlatanic powers

1251
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,430
for good.

1252
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:11,950
For good instead of good.

1253
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:12,650
Just greediness.

1254
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:14,530
Which is pretty good too, actually.

1255
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:17,870
I mean, if somebody's gonna give money

1256
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,870
to a charlatan, like say Bob Tilton,

1257
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:21,210
that preacher on TV.

1258
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,070
Who's gonna spend it right?

1259
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:25,470
Who's gonna spend it more wisely?

1260
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:27,210
Obviously the preacher.

1261
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:29,490
Because he's not gonna give it to some charlatan preacher.

1262
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:30,250
He knows better.

1263
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,990
He's gonna buy something of value, a yacht.

1264
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,490
You know, or a hooker.

1265
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:36,230
A Mercedes.

1266
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:40,210
He's sure not gonna give it

1267
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:41,330
to some guy who goes,

1268
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:43,850
God needs your money.

1269
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:50,430
Don't you need to help God?

1270
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,690
He can't do it all himself.

1271
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:57,530
You've gotta smite the subgeniuses for him.

1272
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:01,550
I know that always brought a fond,

1273
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:03,050
I don't know,

1274
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:04,150
sparked a little tumor

1275
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:06,570
in the middle of my Lemurian region itself

1276
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:07,770
when I think about

1277
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,110
how many of those

1278
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:11,030
of the professorial class

1279
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:12,210
of the intelligentsia

1280
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:14,770
while they're deriding the proletariat

1281
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:16,330
for not catching up quickly enough

1282
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:18,330
going backwards and forwards like that

1283
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:21,410
at the same time

1284
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:23,630
There's that word again.

1285
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:24,250
Time.

1286
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:25,470
The same time.

1287
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:29,090
They do not see the slickness

1288
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:30,170
of their own slack.

1289
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:32,090
And that's why I hate them.

1290
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:33,070
I hate them.

1291
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:34,670
God will not survive

1292
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,950
if you do not give me another sandwich.

1293
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:39,230
That bothers me.

1294
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:40,850
Well,

1295
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,550
actually the gods won't survive

1296
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:44,350
if no one believes in them.

1297
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:45,990
They're exactly as powerful

1298
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:47,470
as the belief

1299
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:50,130
that people have in them.

1300
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:51,470
So what do we call the world?

1301
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:52,670
Is it Weltbekommt

1302
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:53,690
or the world belief?

1303
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:55,230
What is the great dragon?

1304
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:57,410
The horns of Mazar?

1305
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:58,450
I don't know, professor.

1306
00:44:58,750 --> 00:44:59,910
Why don't you tell us?

1307
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:01,050
Well, no, I mean,

1308
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:02,410
isn't there a word for that?

1309
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:04,190
Probably a German three-part word

1310
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:06,210
which is like how everybody thinks

1311
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:07,750
and feels

1312
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:09,170
at the same time

1313
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:09,910
and then has the

1314
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,230
composite right amount of stuff

1315
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:13,030
to make something happen.

1316
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:14,770
You know,

1317
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,010
they're not worldview,

1318
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:17,510
but it would be.

1319
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:18,770
I know, Weltenschlang.

1320
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:19,870
Weltenschlang.

1321
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:21,650
Yes, I have quite a Weltenschlang.

1322
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,230
Would you like to come up and see it?

1323
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:24,890
Mine is as big as the world.

1324
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,690
Yes, it's very wooden.

1325
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:30,070
My wooden Weltenschlang.

1326
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:31,430
Oh, you wooden.

1327
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:32,630
That's Weltenschlang.

1328
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:36,170
That was made in the late 1840s.

1329
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:38,070
Yeah, I had to learn

1330
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,410
that word in prep school.

1331
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:40,930
Weltenschlang?

1332
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:41,450
Yeah.

1333
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:42,830
At least you weren't struck

1334
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:44,230
with one forcibly around the head

1335
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:44,710
and the shoulders

1336
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:45,770
like when they run the gauntlet

1337
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:47,010
at that other school you went to.

1338
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:50,410
The other school I dropped out of,

1339
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:51,390
actually, is what it's a long...

1340
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:52,950
They dropped you out.

1341
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:55,150
No, no, no, I quit.

1342
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:56,590
Well, your prep school

1343
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:57,810
was better than my prep school

1344
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:59,010
because I didn't learn that word.

1345
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,090
No, your prep school

1346
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,830
was tons better than mine

1347
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:02,830
because your prep school

1348
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:04,770
was all girls.

1349
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:06,850
Mine was all boys.

1350
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:08,270
I'd have much rather been

1351
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:09,450
going to your prep school.

1352
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:09,890
I would have much rather been going to your prep school.

1353
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:09,890


1354
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:09,890


1355
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:11,410
I would have much rather been going to your prep school.

1356
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,570
Well, with this time machine,

1357
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:14,390
we can trade.

1358
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:19,450
And Senor will wish you

1359
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:21,630
have gone to co-ed public schools.

1360
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:23,750
Yeah, she went to one of those schools

1361
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:25,210
that was run by nuns.

1362
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:25,750
Nuns.

1363
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:26,970
The blue nuns.

1364
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:28,090
Yeah, the blue...

1365
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:30,130
They were the leap for milk ladies?

1366
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:31,150
The leap for milk nuns.

1367
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,090
Oh, cool, man.

1368
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,610
Yeah, she was raised by nuns.

1369
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:34,590
They drink like schweinhunds.

1370
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:35,550
They're all nuns.

1371
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:37,250
Oh, they can drink.

1372
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:39,330
They can't have sex,

1373
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:40,590
but they can do drugs.

1374
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:41,710
Okay.

1375
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:44,510
Oh, that's good.

1376
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:46,510
That's the way they can give

1377
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:48,410
real worldly advice to people.

1378
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:50,950
Well, yeah, they should be on the bottom

1379
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:51,850
where the rest rest

1380
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,490
and know what's going on with them.

1381
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:54,310
And, you know,

1382
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:54,890
if you're going to

1383
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:56,570
explanderate the feelings

1384
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:58,430
and the apostasy of the Lord

1385
00:46:58,430 --> 00:46:59,490
or any of his minions,

1386
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:00,630
you've at least got to know

1387
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:01,910
where he's coming from or been.

1388
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:02,710
Dig it.

1389
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:04,090
You know.

1390
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:06,390
Who's drinking his stuff?

1391
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,210
Did you just say a dirty word, Princess Wee?

1392
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:09,210
Oh, dig it.

1393
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:09,550
I get it.

1394
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:10,050
I get it.

1395
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:10,250
Okay.

1396
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:11,170
Dig it.

1397
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:12,530
But, you know, like, you know, like.

1398
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:13,310
I misunderstood.

1399
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:15,310
Did you think I said bugger it or something?

1400
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:19,170
We didn't want to have to bugger the lad again,

1401
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:21,010
but he was insolent and so.

1402
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:21,970
Bugger it.

1403
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:23,090
Bugger it.

1404
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:24,050
Lay your hand and shrimp.

1405
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:25,510
Hey.

1406
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:30,110
Um, um, well, we both seem, um, uh.

1407
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:32,670
Somehow hurled right back into that bad stuff again.

1408
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:34,250
I just don't know about you two.

1409
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:39,250
Well, you know, embrace Bob, uh, with, with our hands.

1410
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:39,930
Our feet.

1411
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:43,570
If we were to give him the love he needs, wants from us.

1412
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:44,990
Embrace him with our minds.

1413
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:46,650
I don't think he actually wants love.

1414
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:47,810
What does he want?

1415
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:49,230
Our, um.

1416
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:50,130
Money.

1417
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:50,510
Well, Reverend.

1418
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:51,090
Okay.

1419
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:52,590
He wants our money.

1420
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:53,150
Yeah.

1421
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:54,650
We give him our checks.

1422
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:56,390
We give him our actual paper money.

1423
00:47:56,470 --> 00:48:00,090
No, actually you give them to me and then that helps Bob.

1424
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:00,670
Okay.

1425
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:04,750
I'm actually, I mean, not me, but Subgenius Foundation Incorporated.

1426
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:05,190
Okay.

1427
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:07,890
Which I happen to be the president of right now.

1428
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:08,690
Okay.

1429
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:09,190
Okay.

1430
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:11,590
I think she's the, uh, treasurer.

1431
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:12,690
So, all right.

1432
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:13,810
Well, we're here with the, uh.

1433
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:14,610
Philo's the vice president.

1434
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:16,870
The president of the church of the slave.

1435
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:17,490
No, no, no.

1436
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:23,690
I'm president of the Subgenius Foundation, which is a, uh, limited partnership, uh, in Texas.

1437
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:24,370
Okay.

1438
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:26,510
It also says here you're the high epoch.

1439
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:27,650
No, no, that's Bob.

1440
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:28,910
Bob is the high epoch.

1441
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:29,710
Bob is.

1442
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:30,350
She is a princess.

1443
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:31,470
And she is a princess.

1444
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:32,730
But I'm not an epoch.

1445
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:35,310
And do you, are you also a princess or do you, uh.

1446
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:36,590
No, I'm the, um.

1447
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:39,110
The, the, the CEO perhaps.

1448
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:41,050
Maybe the word might be, uh, the phrase.

1449
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:44,630
No, actually I'm the, her consort is technically my title.

1450
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:45,610
The princess's consort.

1451
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:46,070
Okay.

1452
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:48,350
Now, once we give our checks.

1453
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,250
I was the palace janitor originally.

1454
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:53,890
Our plastic money, uh, our sofas and couches are a different part.

1455
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,450
The furniture that we don't need or anything, I suppose.

1456
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:58,570
We give this to Bob.

1457
00:48:59,130 --> 00:48:59,530
Right.

1458
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:00,330
We give this to Bob.

1459
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:03,730
But through the Subgenius, because you can't just write a check to J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1460
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:06,670
He, where's, where, where are you going to send it?

1461
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,590
Well, you send it to Subgenius Foundation.

1462
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:13,790
The publishing and PR firm of the church, of the Subgenius.

1463
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:18,150
But Bob will answer our, um, not prayers.

1464
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:20,210
What would be the, the correct word?

1465
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:20,790
He will answer.

1466
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:21,070
Orders.

1467
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:23,710
He will answer your orders with goods.

1468
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:24,630
And we place.

1469
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:25,310
Actual goods.

1470
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:25,890
Yes.

1471
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:31,350
Orders by a holy calendar perhaps or more like a, uh, catalog.

1472
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:32,390
A bucket of pills.

1473
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:33,370
A bucket of pills.

1474
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:35,970
An old fashioned bathtub full of pills perhaps.

1475
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:36,610
Oh, right.

1476
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:38,150
A claw-footed bathtub full of.

1477
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:39,130
That's explaining.

1478
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:40,050
That's explaining something here.

1479
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:40,550


1480
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:40,750
Um.

1481
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:46,050
Whatever you want to buy, I'm sure that, uh, the man of Bob and Bob can provide that.

1482
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:47,570
Just about anything.

1483
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:52,110
So he will to those, um, who have decided.

1484
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:56,150
To those who have enough, who have enough faith and are able to invest enough faith

1485
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:57,270
and money in Bob.

1486
00:49:58,010 --> 00:49:59,790
All miracles can come.

1487
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:00,270
Yes.

1488
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:06,450
They are, is there a guarantee or is there anything that, um, a potential Subgenius could

1489
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:06,550
do?

1490
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:07,050
Something bad.

1491
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:12,910
Well, as we, as we discussed earlier into every life from every life, some poo must

1492
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:13,410
fall.

1493
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:14,150
Poo?

1494
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:14,770
Yes.

1495
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:17,650
And Bob is no, he is a life form.

1496
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:21,670
And so some poo falls from Bob and rains down upon us.

1497
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:22,290
So.

1498
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:24,370
And there are, so there are drawbacks.

1499
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:24,650
Yes.

1500
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:29,770
I can see why some people want to call the church of the subgenius a cult or, uh, an

1501
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:30,370
ism.

1502
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:31,130
Uh.

1503
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:32,010
An ism.

1504
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:37,030
And, uh, I mean, uh, when really, uh, obviously it's just exactly what we want.

1505
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:37,030


1506
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:38,290
It's exactly what it says it is.

1507
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:48,890
It's a, a, uh, Sato futuristic, uh, mega futuristic, uh, religion, religion, philosophical, anarcho

1508
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:49,970
materialist outreach.

1509
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:56,690
Uh, and the outreach is, uh, well said there are thousands, it says here in this release

1510
00:50:56,690 --> 00:51:02,790
that's been just been released here in front of hundreds of thousands of guests and cabin

1511
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:03,430
freaks.

1512
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:06,710
Uh, all enlisted in the service of.

1513
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:08,170
Of the church of the subgenius.

1514
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:08,410
Right.

1515
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:13,310
These are soldiers for Bob, nun snakes, uh, altered boys.

1516
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:18,710
Says here even port caricature artists and portraiture artists are, uh, needed sometimes.

1517
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:19,730
Right.

1518
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:20,550
Um, there's.

1519
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:26,290
Well, the, there's never a, an end to the, the need for, uh, paintings and drawings of

1520
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:28,130
the subgenius hierarchites.

1521
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:29,630
I suppose there's a lot of.

1522
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:30,970
The sacred scribes for instance.

1523
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:31,710
Oh, of course.

1524
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:35,310
The, and different saints or what are religious characters?

1525
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:35,530
Yeah.

1526
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:37,290
Well, the saints that we still talk to.

1527
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:42,030
We had to take down paintings of quite a few saints who lost their minds.

1528
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:43,950
Well, it also says here at Ablator.

1529
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:47,710
And took their pants off in the wrong place at the wrong time.

1530
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:51,590
You know how some of those soldiers for Bob are rambunctious.

1531
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:57,930
Bunch home from the front, I guess, looking for some act in, um, but not always, at least

1532
00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:02,110
here in the church of the subgenius, you also have a resume, a corrector.

1533
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:05,050
What does that, uh, have to do with this?

1534
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:06,170
A resume, correct?

1535
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:09,810
Well, basically we just show people how to lie realistically on resumes.

1536
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:12,110
Now this is also lie and resume.

1537
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:14,830
That's related to the sacred doctrine of erasability.

1538
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:15,450
Right.

1539
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:17,450
So nobody ever checks.

1540
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:18,450
That's the main thing.

1541
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:25,450
So it's fair to lie on your resume because everybody else is doing it.

1542
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:26,210
That's the reason.

1543
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:27,810
That's why it's okay to steal.

1544
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:32,770
I don't know if you knew that, but it's okay to steal because everybody else is doing it.

1545
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:33,110
Ah.

1546
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:38,530
But if you think about it, everybody pilfers a little bit somewhere along the line.

1547
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:39,770
So that makes sense.

1548
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:40,010
Okay.

1549
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:47,270
As Bob Nelson once said, if, uh, if one or more, if more than one subgenius businessmen

1550
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:51,330
do something, then it is therefore legal.

1551
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:52,570
That makes it legal.

1552
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:53,150
I see.

1553
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:57,970
So it's not just memory that's malleable, but it's also morals that are malleable.

1554
00:52:57,990 --> 00:52:58,570
Oh yeah.

1555
00:52:58,670 --> 00:52:59,310
Well, absolutely.

1556
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:01,010
That's what religion is all about.

1557
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:06,150
Bob's religion is built on a shifting sandy beach of hypocrisy, as we've said so many

1558
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:07,110
times.

1559
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:14,710
And, uh, and yes, you are, you're in, the truth is, is to be wielded as a weapon.

1560
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:22,950
You see, you just say, it's basically it, it becomes, it's okay to lie as long as you

1561
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:23,630
don't get caught.

1562
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:25,190
Same with stealing.

1563
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:28,090
Those are codified into the religion.

1564
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:30,470
Kind of intramural, like intramural.

1565
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:30,870
Right.

1566
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:36,650
And Bob said, as I've said so many times, uh, I don't practice what I preach because

1567
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:37,990
I'm not the man I'm preaching to.

1568
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:40,210
And he wouldn't want to be either.

1569
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:41,590
We'd, we'd noticed that.

1570
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:43,870
I was trying to make a joke.

1571
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:44,270
I'm sorry.

1572
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:45,070
You said that so smarmily.

1573
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:49,370
Oh, well, no, I, I thought maybe that fit with the flow of what you were saying.

1574
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:50,470
I didn't really know.

1575
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:52,230
Well, it's beautiful smarm, Dave.

1576
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:53,090
That's all I'm saying.

1577
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,210
It's smarmalicious.

1578
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:54,970
Well, thank you.

1579
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:59,150
Um, I've never heard such a smarmy triacly.

1580
00:53:59,550 --> 00:53:59,950
I'm sorry.

1581
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:00,850
I'm sorry.

1582
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:00,850


1583
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:00,850


1584
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:03,010
I'm sorry.

1585
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:03,010


1586
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:03,010


1587
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:03,010


1588
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:03,010


1589
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:03,010


1590
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:03,010


1591
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:03,010


1592
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:03,010


1593
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:03,010


1594
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:03,010


1595
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:03,010


1596
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:03,010


1597
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:03,010


1598
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:03,010


1599
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:05,390
I was wondering about your students.

1600
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:11,970
Do you have many students now in the, um, well, what's the name of the post that you're

1601
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:12,250
offering?

1602
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:12,690
Oh, yeah.

1603
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:15,290
The How to run your own cult.

1604
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:17,150
How to run your own mind control cult.

1605
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:18,550
Do's and don'ts.

1606
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:19,230
Do's and don'ts.

1607
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:20,850
The first do is don't.

1608
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:23,550
Uh, and some of them aren't.

1609
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:28,150
Some of them said, okay, I'm not gonna do the class assignment and create my own cult

1610
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:29,830
weil ich ihnen gesagt habe, dass sie nicht.

1611
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:32,630
Aber viele von ihnen sind Kulteure.

1612
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:33,830
Es gibt 45 Schüler.

1613
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:36,710
Und es gibt noch keinen Grund,

1614
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:37,490
nicht zu signen.

1615
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:39,630
Alle Materialien werden bis Januar sein.

1616
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:41,070
Es gibt viele Materialien,

1617
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:42,730
etwa drei Gigabyte bis jetzt.

1618
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:44,630
Das ist viel.

1619
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:46,750
Und das ist alles, was wir...

1620
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:50,890
...nein-ein-mal-vor-geesehenes-Stuff.

1621
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:52,810
Nicht nie vorher,

1622
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,330
aber nicht seit dem vorigen Jahr.

1623
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:58,170
Nicht mal gesehen.

1624
00:54:58,490 --> 00:54:59,790
Und nicht wertvoll gesehen.

1625
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:02,210
Ich glaube, viele würden das auch.

1626
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:03,410
Hat das ein Problem gewesen?

1627
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:06,030
Muss ich wirklich alle Rezepte

1628
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:08,110
von 1980 für Audio-Tapes sehen?

1629
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:11,090
Wenn du das Mädchen-Band

1630
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:12,310
Falsche Beweise sehen willst...

1631
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:14,390
Was du auch sehen kannst,

1632
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:16,590
sind die Läufer

1633
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:18,290
von den verrückten

1634
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:20,070
Weirdo-Artisten

1635
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:21,430
und seltsamen Leuten.

1636
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:24,330
Ich habe alle Läufer von Ken Kesey

1637
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:26,030
von den Merry Pranksters gefunden,

1638
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:26,190
die

1639
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:27,390
eigentlich verraten haben,

1640
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:31,410
dass der starke Fist so groß und dick geworden ist.

1641
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:32,670
Das war unser Kirchenmagazin.

1642
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:34,330
Er wurde so groß,

1643
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:36,510
dass er es in einer Session

1644
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:38,430
von Exkremeditation nicht mehr lesen konnte.

1645
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:40,310
Das ist nicht necessarily eine schlechte Sache.

1646
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:41,550
Für ihn war es schlecht.

1647
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:44,430
Wir haben uns viel zu ernst genommen.

1648
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:46,750
Er denkt, es ist eine Exkremeditation.

1649
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:48,790
Du lachtest.

1650
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:49,870
Aber er...

1651
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:53,050
Er ist noch einer, der gestorben ist.

1652
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,530
Es gibt so viele, die gestorben sind.

1653
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:56,110
Sie waren alle meine.

1654
00:55:56,190 --> 00:56:00,190
Ich habe eine Menge Läufer von Robert Crumb gefunden,

1655
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,250
die ich als lebender Gott gedacht habe.

1656
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:04,410
Er war wie mein Hero.

1657
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:05,770
Und hier war er,

1658
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:08,730
mir Fan-Läufer zu senden.

1659
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:09,470
Das war es.

1660
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:11,670
Sie waren und sie waren nicht.

1661
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:13,790
Er ist so ein zynischer Bastard,

1662
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:14,790
dass er basically sagt,

1663
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:17,790
du handelst diese kleine Celebrität

1664
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:18,590
ziemlich gut.

1665
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:20,010
Nächstes Mal wirst du sehen,

1666
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,130
dass sie alle

1667
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:23,630
die letzten Jahre sind.

1668
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:24,690
Es ist alle alt.

1669
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:25,570
Dann beginnen sie,

1670
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:25,890
und sie fangen an,

1671
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:28,450
dich über deinen Sexismus und Rassismus

1672
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:29,630
und jede andere kleine Sache zu verbreiten,

1673
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:31,330
die sie in deinen alten Comics finden.

1674
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:31,850
Oder was auch immer.

1675
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:33,930
Und dann bist du nur ein Niemand

1676
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:34,710
und du bist depressiv.

1677
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:35,770
Also hast du all das noch vor dir.

1678
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:37,750
Es war eigentlich sehr gute Hinweise.

1679
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:38,930
Es kam alles in Ordnung.

1680
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:40,810
Was für eine krummige Art,

1681
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:42,430
um seinen Punkt zu überwinden.

1682
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:43,650
Krummig?

1683
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:45,110
Ah, schau mal,

1684
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:46,310
das ist alles, was es geht.

1685
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:47,370
Es ist schrecklich.

1686
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:49,790
Er ist eigentlich,

1687
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:53,870
wie er sich in den Comic-Strips depiziert,

1688
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:55,490
was ziemlich krank ist.

1689
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:56,910
Er hat mich informiert,

1690
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:58,650
dass es noch keine gute Musik gab,

1691
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:02,410
die seit den 30er und 40er Jahren

1692
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:02,410


1693
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:05,410
Es gibt viele solche Leute

1694
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:08,270
in den Lucid Island-Mitglieden.

1695
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:09,190
Von ihnen.

1696
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:10,890
Von diesen vier oder fünf.

1697
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:13,690
Wir denken an Harvey Pekar

1698
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:15,730
und seine Liebe für den alten Wax.

1699
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:18,730
Krumm ist Teil eines Kultes.

1700
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:20,230
Krumm ist Teil eines Kultes.

1701
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:21,990
Es ist ein Kult.

1702
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,050
Sie haben einen Kult von Leuten,

1703
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:25,070
die franke,

1704
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:27,250
die auf Greyhound-Busse mit Karten

1705
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:28,450
und so weiter.

1706
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:30,550
Und es gibt nur drei Rekorde in dieser Karte.

1707
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:30,910
Und...

1708
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:32,010
Das ist...

1709
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:33,330
Na, sie machen das immer noch.

1710
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:35,310
Der große Subgenius Nenslo

1711
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:36,730
ist immer noch da,

1712
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:39,510
zu hassen und zu kranken und zu gräben.

1713
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:40,550
Und...

1714
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:41,910
zu verbreiten.

1715
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:43,690
Und zu verbreiten.

1716
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:47,290
Es gab so viel Sachen damals.

1717
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:48,770
Und es gibt so viel Sachen jetzt.

1718
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:49,870
Und es macht mich wundern,

1719
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:50,770
wo all das Ganze geht,

1720
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:51,490
wenn es so viel ist.

1721
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:52,370
Ich habe gesehen, wo es geht.

1722
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:54,250
Du stirbst,

1723
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:55,450
und es wird geschlagen,

1724
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:56,310
die meisten davon.

1725
00:57:56,430 --> 00:57:57,650
Es wird ausgestattet.

1726
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:01,690
Die normalen Dinge,

1727
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:02,290
wie Künstler,

1728
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:03,090
werden ausgestattet.

1729
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:05,250
Aber all deine wirklich guten Bücher

1730
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:06,110
und Comic-Bücher

1731
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:07,210
und die Rekorde,

1732
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:08,130
die dir am meisten wert sind,

1733
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:10,010
und all deine Snapshots,

1734
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:11,810
werden in den Regen verbracht.

1735
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:12,550
Das ist nur,

1736
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:16,010
wenn du von deiner Familie

1737
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:16,170
ausgestrahlt wirst.

1738
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:17,150
Oh, gib mir einen Break.

1739
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:17,630
Guck dir an,

1740
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:18,330
was meine armen Kinder

1741
00:58:18,330 --> 00:58:18,630
durchgehen werden,

1742
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:21,170
wenn sie mein Gebiet

1743
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:21,250
aussteigen.

1744
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:21,650
Sie werden nicht

1745
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:23,650
all deine kulturellen Sachen

1746
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:24,610
in den Regen verlassen.

1747
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:25,390
Ich kann dir das sagen.

1748
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:27,470
Ich hoffe,

1749
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:28,510
dass ein Penalty...

1750
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:29,670
Tisch, tisch, tisch.

1751
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:30,650
Ein Penalty...

1752
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:31,230
Habe ich das gesagt?

1753
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:33,550
Das ist kein echter Wort.

1754
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:34,710
Das ist eine Art Phrase.

1755
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:35,710
Ich hoffe,

1756
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:36,830
dass ein Penalty...

1757
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:37,170
Ich bin wirklich sorry.

1758
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:38,730
...einem Zeitpunkt in der Geschichte,

1759
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:40,030
wo die 1930er,

1760
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:40,530
40er,

1761
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:40,890
50er,

1762
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:41,270
60er,

1763
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:41,650
70er,

1764
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:42,070
80er,

1765
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:42,590
90er,

1766
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:43,890
2000er und so weiter,

1767
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:45,070
und all das

1768
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:46,870
Kutting-Edge-Stuff

1769
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:48,650
alle auf einmal da ist.

1770
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:49,710
Also hörst du

1771
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:51,510
King Oliver

1772
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:52,290
oder jemanden,

1773
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:53,050
und am gleichen Zeit

1774
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:54,710
hörst du etwas anderes.

1775
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:55,390
Und es ist

1776
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:55,890
beide neu

1777
00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:56,970
am gleichen Zeitpunkt.

1778
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:57,990
Ich bin sorry,

1779
00:58:58,050 --> 00:58:58,490
dass ich das gesagt habe.

1780
00:58:58,610 --> 00:58:59,470
Was auch immer.

1781
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:01,690
Nun.

1782
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:03,030
Nun...

1783
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:03,290
Wünsche,

1784
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:03,930
Träume,

1785
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:05,210
wenn Wünsche

1786
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:05,950
Fisch waren.

1787
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:06,430
Oh,

1788
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:07,050
wenn ich nur

1789
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:08,770
Zeit zurücknehmen könnte

1790
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:10,530
und das Wort

1791
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:11,270
wegnehmen würde,

1792
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:12,090
würde ich...

1793
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:12,890
Du kannst nicht

1794
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:13,490
das eine sagen,

1795
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:14,010
aber du könntest sagen,

1796
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:14,850
Zeit ist wie

1797
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:15,630
ein Wart in einem Bottle.

1798
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:17,250
Das ist anders.

1799
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:18,410
Ich weiß.

1800
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:19,530
Ich habe eine

1801
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:20,490
viel schlechteren Sache gesagt.

1802
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:20,910
Zeit...

1803
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:21,430
Ich bin so entschuldigt.

1804
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:22,330
Prinzessin Wade

1805
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:22,790
hat sich

1806
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:23,130
abschließend

1807
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:24,570
besessen.

1808
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:26,490
Du machst es

1809
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:27,070
immer schlimmer

1810
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:27,850
und schlimmer

1811
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:28,670
und schlimmer.

1812
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:29,490
Jetzt werden alle

1813
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:29,770
sagen,

1814
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:30,410
oh Gott,

1815
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:31,310
ich muss die Tape

1816
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:32,390
zurück spielen

1817
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:32,690
und sehen,

1818
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:33,250
was für

1819
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:33,610
schreckliche,

1820
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:34,330
schreckliche Dinge

1821
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:35,070
sie gesagt hat.

1822
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:36,050
Tisch,

1823
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:36,550
tisch,

1824
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:37,050
tisch.

1825
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:41,470
Wir könnten

1826
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:42,330
einen Anruf

1827
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:42,570
für

1828
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:44,790
WCSB

1829
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:46,230
Zukunftsärzte

1830
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:46,410
stellen,

1831
00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:47,590
die

1832
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:48,130
kommen,

1833
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:49,690
um sich

1834
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:50,210
zu übernehmen.

1835
00:59:50,290 --> 00:59:51,190
Denn wenn sie

1836
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:51,630
nicht kommen,

1837
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:52,330
werden wir

1838
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:52,550
einfach

1839
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:53,430
wegschlagen,

1840
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:53,990
Freunde.

1841
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:54,670
Ich glaube,

1842
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:55,150
wir sollten

1843
00:59:55,150 --> 00:59:57,450
ein Ending

1844
00:59:57,450 --> 00:59:57,630
machen.

1845
00:59:57,690 --> 00:59:58,190
Wann ist das Zeit?

1846
00:59:58,190 --> 00:59:59,050
Wann ist das Zeit?

1847
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:00,190
Ja, es ist das Zeit.

1848
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:00,930
Es ist Zeit

1849
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,410
für Dr. Sinister's Show.

1850
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:03,110
Es ist das Zeit.

1851
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:06,970
Das Zeit-Maschine.

1852
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:08,130
Zeit.

1853
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:09,910
Und wir werden

1854
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:11,530
unsere rickete

1855
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:12,750
kleine Zeitmaschine

1856
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:12,950
anbinden,

1857
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:14,870
mit Platinorite

1858
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:15,890
über die Främe

1859
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:16,230
und

1860
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:17,870
wieder einmal

1861
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:18,510
drücken

1862
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:19,870
den Lever

1863
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:20,210
und

1864
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:21,750
flicken

1865
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:22,190
durch

1866
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:22,830
das Zeit

1867
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:23,430
selbst.

1868
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:24,110
Jetzt geht

1869
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:24,770
das Joystick

1870
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:25,010
da.

1871
01:00:25,150 --> 01:00:26,070
Ja, das stimmt.

1872
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:27,210
Jetzt drücken wir es

1873
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:27,890
zurück in die Linke.

1874
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:30,730
Nein, nein, nein.

1875
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:31,230
Wir gehen

1876
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:32,810
in die falsche Richtung.

1877
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:34,310
Wir sind in der

1878
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:35,350
anderen Zeitreise.

1879
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:36,370
Er kommt

1880
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:37,170
in die Zukunft.

1881
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:37,670
Oh, nein.

1882
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:39,010
Das ist der

1883
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:39,830
gefährliche Wast.

1884
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:40,510
Das ist der

1885
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:41,370
gefährliche Wast.

1886
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:41,990
Das ist der

1887
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:42,870
gefährliche Wast.

1888
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:43,450
Das ist der

1889
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:44,330
gefährliche Wast.

1890
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:45,270
Ja, du wirst

1891
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:46,130
aus diesem Welt.

1892
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:46,930
Du wirst leben.

1893
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:47,490
Du wirst leben.

1894
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:48,390
Topsy-Turvy-Leib.

1895
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:49,370
Topsy-Turvy-Leib.

1896
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:49,950
Kein anderer Mann

1897
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:50,330
hat jemals gelebt.

1898
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:51,710
Nicht morgen,

1899
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:52,990
nicht nächstes Jahr,

1900
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:53,870
aber manchmal

1901
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:55,070
bevor das Jahr 2000.

1902
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:55,350
Bis zum Jahr 2000.

1903
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:56,190
wird dieses

1904
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:56,970
unglaubliche Event

1905
01:00:56,970 --> 01:00:57,470
stattfinden.

1906
01:00:57,830 --> 01:00:58,430
Und jetzt

1907
01:00:58,430 --> 01:00:59,670
wirst du Teil davon sein.

1908
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:00,030
Wir werden

1909
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:01,210
über den Horizont

1910
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:01,790
unserer Zeit

1911
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:02,510
fliegen, um die

1912
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:03,250
größte menschliche

1913
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:04,450
Erfahrung aller Zeiten zu sein.

1914
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:05,650
Chef, glaub mir.

1915
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:06,150
Du bist in der

1916
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:07,290
Zeit, als Jimmy

1917
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:07,670
zurückkommt.

1918
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:09,210
Was hält er auf?

1919
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:10,050
Du weißt, dass ich

1920
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:10,530
nicht arbeiten kann

1921
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:10,910
ohne Smack.

1922
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:11,650
Chef.

1923
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:12,970
Verrückt.

1924
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:13,410
Dieser Junge

1925
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:13,930
weiß, dass ich

1926
01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:14,550
Smack mag.

1927
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:15,390
Und er weiß, dass ich

1928
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:15,570
auch.

1929
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:16,730
Besser niemals.

1930
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:18,830
Und Candy Sweep.

1931
01:01:19,930 --> 01:01:20,610
Hier bin ich.

1932
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:22,590
Junge Mann,

1933
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:23,370
du bist verletzt.

1934
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:25,110
Aber,

1935
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:26,230
ich glaube,

1936
01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:26,710
wir alle

1937
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:27,610
auf Smack

1938
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:27,790
stimmen.

1939
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:28,350
Richtig.

1940
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:29,150
Leute,

1941
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:30,190
nicht Smack

1942
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:30,610
kriegen.

1943
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:33,950
3.15 Uhr

1944
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:34,830
und Frank und ich

1945
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:35,990
sind zurück auf Stage 2.

1946
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:36,930
Wir haben mit Bob gesprochen

1947
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:37,550
und haben die gleiche

1948
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:38,370
Geschichte von ihm bekommen.

1949
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:39,710
Bobs Finger wurden

1950
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:40,290
genommen und sie

1951
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:40,970
haben die, die

1952
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:41,650
auf dem Lampen

1953
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:41,710
gefunden wurden, gematcht.

1954
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:42,690
An diesem Punkt

1955
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:43,410
gab es die Möglichkeit,

1956
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:44,310
dass Bob nicht

1957
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:44,870
ein Unfall war.

1958
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:45,550
Ja.

1959
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:46,130
Ja.

1960
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:46,950
Ja.

1961
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:48,190
Nein, nein.

1962
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:53,550
Würdest du

1963
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:54,310
freie Geld,

1964
01:01:54,490 --> 01:01:54,650
Geld,

1965
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:54,930
gut.

1966
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:55,450
Geld.

1967
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:56,510
Freie Geld.

1968
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:57,150
Freie Geld.

1969
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:57,350
Freie Geld.

1970
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:57,350


1971
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:57,350


1972
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:57,350


1973
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:57,350


1974
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:57,350


1975
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:57,350


1976
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:57,350


1977
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:57,350


1978
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:57,350


1979
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:57,350


1980
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:57,350


1981
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:57,350


1982
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:57,970
Du brauchst keine Bildung.

1983
01:01:58,310 --> 01:01:58,890
Du kannst Geld machen.

1984
01:01:58,930 --> 01:01:59,350
Geld.

1985
01:01:59,390 --> 01:01:59,650
Freie Geld.

1986
01:01:59,990 --> 01:01:59,990


1987
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:00,450
Geh.

1988
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:00,750
Geld.

1989
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:01,090
Geld.

1990
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:01,610
Nicht schnell.

1991
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:02,090
Also,

1992
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:02,570
Verlangen.

1993
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:03,350
Nicht kümmern.

1994
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:03,870
Jetzt.

1995
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:09,690
Es gibt Menschen,

1996
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:09,790


1997
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:11,530
dass etwas Mysteries

1998
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:12,950
in der Südengland lebt.

1999
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:13,910
Wo immer es

2000
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:14,910
Lake Monsters gibt,

2001
01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:15,850
gibt es Leute

2002
01:02:15,850 --> 01:02:16,550
wie dieses.

2003
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:17,530
Lokale,

2004
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:17,990
Besucher,

2005
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:19,150
Wissenschaftler und

2006
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:20,210
Befragte, die sich

2007
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:21,670
für Lake Monsters

2008
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:21,690
bewegen.

2009
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:22,930
Es gibt einen Mann,

2010
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:24,310
der einen Lake Monster

2011
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:24,490
unterstützt.

2012
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,250
Ich fühle mich

2013
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:25,530
geblasen.

2014
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:26,990
So

2015
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:27,670
lange.

2016
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:31,250
Die neue Serie

2017
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:32,310
von Broadcasts

2018
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:33,350
mit dem weltweit

2019
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:33,950
berühmten

2020
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:34,570
Detektiv

2021
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:35,870
Sean Markle.

2022
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:37,450
Ich habe

2023
01:02:37,450 --> 01:02:38,070
Christoph

2024
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:38,470
Wiener von

2025
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:39,110
Stardust

2026
01:02:39,110 --> 01:02:39,530
gegeben,

2027
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:39,970
dass er

2028
01:02:39,970 --> 01:02:40,630
in den

2029
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:40,990
Kontrauten

2030
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:41,210
geblieben ist.

2031
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:42,310
Geheimlich

2032
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:42,570
habe ich

2033
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:43,130
gelacht, dass er

2034
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:43,670
