1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,100
Say what?

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello?

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,260
Hello, Grandfather?

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,920
Yes, who is this?

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:12,580
It's Dorothy.

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,000
Good Lord.

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:14,800
Yes.

8
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,160
Yes.

9
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,140
Joe.

10
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:24,560
What?

11
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,300
Joseph.

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:25,860
What?

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,100
Joe.

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,000
Go, Joe.

15
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:27,660
Why?

16
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,080
Why?

17
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:28,320
Why?

18
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,760
You lousy rat, huh?

19
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:32,380
Go!

20
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,000
Go!

21
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,500
Oh, my.

22
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,120
Oh, my.

23
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,480
Oh, Joe.

24
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,340
It's just the self-genius.

25
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,860
Power of slack.

26
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,360
Like I say, we're the funny weirdos.

27
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,820
Like I say, we're the funny weirdos.

28
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,160
Like I say, we're the funny weirdos.

29
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,380
Like I say, we're the funny weirdos.

30
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,520
Like I say, we're the funny weirdos.

31
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,620
Like I say, we're the funny weirdos.

32
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,260
Like I say, we're the...

33
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:58,940
Like I say.

34
00:00:59,180 --> 00:00:59,880
Like I say.

35
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,740
We're the Funny Weirdos

36
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:28,380
Oh Wally don't you look sweet

37
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,980
Sweet. Doesn't he bore you?

38
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,580
Yeah, reminds me of the time my brother and I had our prize hog in the 4-H club show.

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,420
Uh-huh.

40
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,460
Well, uh, oh, it's, uh...

41
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,400
What do you think, Beeb?

42
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,460
Yeah, sure, Dad. Sure, Dad. Yes, Dad.

43
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,260
Okay, Dad.

44
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,200
Oh.

45
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,160
Do you think Wally's old enough to have prize hogs?

46
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,760
Well, dear, a boy's life can't be all one-sided.

47
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,900
He can find his own girlfriends like I used to.

48
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,600
Well, when Mrs. Hanson called, she said there was a dance at the country club in two weeks.

49
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,180
What for?

50
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,800
Mrs. Hanson said it was for prize hogs.

51
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,580
I'd hardly approve of his going steady with one prize hog.

52
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,100
And I certainly don't approve of his going steady with her mother.

53
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,100
What do you think, Beeb?

54
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,040
She'll be coming when she comes.

55
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,300
She'll be coming.

56
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,940
Oh, yes, Dad.

57
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,480
Okay, Dad. Sure, Dad.

58
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,680
Well, Wally, uh, your mother tells me you may need a white prize hog for a dance soon.

59
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,720
Yeah, well, I, uh, I think I might try that.

60
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,600
Okay.

61
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,360
You know, Wally, when I was a kid, I used to dance.

62
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,980
When I was in college, there was a prize hog who, uh, well, who rather took a fancy to me.

63
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,380
Gee, Dad.

64
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,080
Uh, anyway, I wouldn't let this thing get out.

65
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:40,820
Yeah.

66
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:44,900
Oh!

67
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,700
Frog went to court and he did right.

68
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,400
Campbell.

69
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,540
Frog went to court and he did right.

70
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,260
Campbell.

71
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,920
Frog went to court and...

72
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,540
Oh!

73
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,340
Oh!

74
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,880
Frog went to court and he did right.

75
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,060
Gotta have another whisker and then I'm next.

76
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:03,660
You...

77
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,040
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

78
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,440
Kitty.

79
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,540
Oh, there you are.

80
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,440
Come back here, you unrecruiter.

81
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,620
I don't aim to let one...

82
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,060
Cat whisker standing between me and Raymond.

83
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,140
Oh, God.

84
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:27,540


85
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,020
Send out here, Captain.

86
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,020
Let's have a mic for a clock.

87
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,600
Stand still.

88
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,120
Ain't gonna hurt much if I yank it out.

89
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,080
Come on out here, nephew.

90
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,560
Here's what I play for my encore.

91
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,040
Encore.

92
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,560
Encore.

93
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,040
Encore.

94
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,720
Encore.

95
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,420
Encore.

96
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:56,940
Encore.

97
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,520
Encore.

98
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:57,520


99
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:57,520


100
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:57,520


101
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:57,520


102
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:57,520


103
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:57,520


104
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,480
Encore.

105
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:58,700
Encore.

106
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,600
Encore.

107
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,020
Encore.

108
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,280
Uh...

109
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,540
Encore.

110
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,240
Encore.

111
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,440
Encore.

112
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:10,720
Encore.

113
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,380
Oh, I give you an ear spanking!

114
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,340
E progressed.

115
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,660
How'd he get that?

116
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:18,960
Hurrah!

117
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,300
Here comes the incredible!

118
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,000
So gross.

119
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,340
Don't

120
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:24,340


121
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:24,700
Or nature.

122
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:25,320


123
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:25,320


124
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:25,320


125
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:25,320


126
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:25,320


127
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:25,340


128
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,060
Uh...

129
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,180
Uh...

130
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:27,320
Uh...

131
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:27,500
Uh...

132
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:27,520
Uh...

133
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:27,520


134
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:27,520


135
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,880
Don't you want to please, Soupman?

136
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:48,000
Friends, this is going to be a pretty sexy show this time.

137
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,900
The above bits were by Leemur and The Large,

138
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,300
and the song was from a Tom and Jerry cartoon.

139
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,180
But sexiest of all, we return to the Baltimore revival of 2008

140
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:04,480
and Priestess Pisces' killer, and I do mean killer, sermon to the bobbies.

141
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,000
Sinners! Sinners!

142
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:15,540
You're all filthy, nasty sinners and degenerates,

143
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,420
perverts, you're freaks and queers and deviants,

144
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,340
every last one of you.

145
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,120
Damn right, good for you.

146
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,740
And I have a throat on my belly.

147
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,060
Friends, Bob is not going, our friend Bob here,

148
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,180
he's not going to wash away your sins.

149
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,620
Bob is going to watch you do your sins

150
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,680
and videotape them and sell them on the internet,

151
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,120
but that's another story.

152
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,220
And speaking of other stories,

153
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,360
I am damn tired of some of you so-called subgenitalists,

154
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,040
and I am tired of that.

155
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,040


156
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,040


157
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,080
you're going to live with your namby-pamby whining

158
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,600
about how you feel wronged by this person or that person,

159
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,520
and getting all fuckin' butt hurt over the mean old man on the internet.

160
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,180
Shut up already.

161
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,540
I didn't do it.

162
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,840
You're a damn overman, you're a damn uberfem.

163
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,280
You are Yeti, you are different and you are better.

164
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,080
Well, except that one over there.

165
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,680
Hey.

166
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,600
Yeah.

167
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,380
Look here Bobby, I'm talking to you, you dear, stupid, sweet little Bobby.

168
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,400
It seems that when I was in Baltimore last time you really just weren't paying a look

169
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:34,760
of attention.

170
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,860
You missed all the points of that lesson.

171
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,760
In fact, you missed the points so much that the points sent a search party out for your

172
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,040
ass.

173
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,600
So I'm here to beat you over the head with a clue by four.

174
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,120
Because there is a reason, young Bobby, that we all make fun of you.

175
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,260
There is a reason we troll you on the internet.

176
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,260
There is a reason we torment you.

177
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,400
There's a reason we gang banged your mom.

178
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,260
Um, wait, well, the reason we gang banged your mom was because she was a crack whore,

179
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,120
but that's another story.

180
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,420
But seriously, the reason we treat you the way we do.

181
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,140
Oh, wait, no, I, okay, I see what you're thinking.

182
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,920
You're thinking, oh, Pisces, I know why you guys jib me like that.

183
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,960
You're just playing around.

184
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,100
You guys really like me and this is just your funny subgenius work.

185
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:21,980
This is just a way of showing it.

186
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,460
Bullshit!

187
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,180
We don't like you.

188
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,900
Hell, we hate you.

189
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:33,000
You're a weak, whiny Bobby tripping all over yourself to be uber fanboy.

190
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,900
You're annoying as hell and you're creeping out the chicks, man.

191
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,940
Fucking A!

192
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,100
Oh, jeez, for Christ's sakes, I see you back there and you're starting to tear up.

193
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,620
Get the tears out of your eyes, you damn pussy.

194
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,080
You had to have known in your naive heart of gold.

195
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,080


196
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,080


197
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:56,700
That we wouldn't just hand over the keys to Dobstown to you, Mr. Bobby, collately.

198
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,080
You are no one.

199
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,320
You are a gnat.

200
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,680
You are a fly.

201
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,200
No, you're a roach.

202
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:10,700
You're a diseased, ridden, filthy, repulsive, disgusting roach.

203
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,780
Do you know what disease you're carrying there, Bobby?

204
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,880
Do you know what plague you bear that makes us all avoid you?

205
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,080
You are in fact a rat.

206
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,520
You are infected with anti-slack.

207
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:31,300
Yes, yes, Bobby, you have the highly contagious disease of anti-slack.

208
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:39,420
But, Bobby, once I was like you and I too have the anti-slack sickness.

209
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:46,900
Even I've been staying once had the anti-slack sickness.

210
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,180
But I got the cure.

211
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,060
I got the cure.

212
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:51,060


213
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:51,060


214
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:57,580
You see, Dobbs gave me the shot when I shot Dobbs.

215
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,340
Yeah, I killed him.

216
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:00,940
What of it?

217
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,080
Bastard keeps coming back anyway, again and again.

218
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,340
You shoot him in the chest and then he comes back.

219
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,120
You cut his head off and he comes back.

220
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,420
You burn him and he comes back.

221
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,580
I tried storing him in acid for several months, but then he still came back.

222
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:21,060
But, but every time I kill him, I get another dose of the anti-slack.

223
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:26,900
It sort of compounds and I get further and further away from anti-slack.

224
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,840
I know what you're thinking now, Bobby.

225
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,840
You're thinking, well damn Pisces, I just need to find Bob and kill him.

226
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,100
And then I won't have this anti-slack disease and then you'll all just like me again.

227
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,040
Do you really think it's that simple?

228
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:44,860
No.

229
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,380
Do you think that J.R. Bob Dobbs is just going to walk up to you on the street and say,

230
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,820
well hi there, Bobby.

231
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,620
I hear that you have the anti-slack and I figured I'd come and visit you and let you kill me right now.

232
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,540
Of course he won't.

233
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:08,000
If anything, J.R. Bob Dobbs is just going to pull a prank on your ass like the old doctors did earlier.

234
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:08,700
Wait.

235
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,280
Alright, well you might want to check your car before you leave.

236
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,480
Anyway, the point is, Dobbs ain't even going to get close to you, kid.

237
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,400
I'm sorry.

238
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,620
He can smell a green little Bobby like you's 50 kilometers off.

239
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:29,060
But if you want that cure, if you want to get rid of that anti-slack, you're going to have to kill him.

240
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,860
You just have to.

241
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:36,000
But how are you, this Bobby, going to get close enough to kill him?

242
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:41,560
How are you going to be able to get close enough to J.R. Bob Dobbs to murder him?

243
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,880
Well start off by not trying to get so damn close to him.

244
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,380
Start off by not trying to get so damn close to him.

245
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,700
Stop being such a damn sycophant.

246
00:10:52,520 --> 00:11:04,980
Find something to do besides following the overmen and the uberfem around like some pathetic and lost over-eager little puppy dog waiting for us to drop you a scrap of our hamburger.

247
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:10,680
Get your own damn hamburger and eat the hell out of it.

248
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,520
Look, just do something, man.

249
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:15,960
You know?

250
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,480
Just be yourself and be an individual.

251
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,820
And stop trying to copy me and Susie and Stang and Legume.

252
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,900
And just do your own thing.

253
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,360
And sure, we're going to tell you you suck.

254
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,680
Because that's what we do.

255
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:38,940
But if you keep up to it and you get good and stop sucking, then we'll respect you.

256
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:47,760
You see, don't waste time worrying about who's going to screw you over in the church and who's out to get you and make you look bad.

257
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,360
What you need to do is learn to screw yourself.

258
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,120
Let your id be your ID.

259
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,700
Let go of the ligatures on your ego.

260
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,840
Because self-love is true love.

261
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:10,040
And when you are screwing yourself, the conspiracy cannot get a dick in edgewise.

262
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,580
But Bob will try.

263
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,260
Sure he will.

264
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,520
You see?

265
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,340
He'll see you screwing yourself and he wants some of that action.

266
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,760
Because that's how Bob is.

267
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:31,300
And when Dobbs tries to stick his dick in there when he thinks you're not looking, well then you can just chop it right the fuck off.

268
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,600
Oh, don't worry.

269
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,280
It grows back.

270
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:33,980
It really does.

271
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:42,100
You can also shove a stake through his heart and shoot him with silver bullets and cut off his head and burn him, drown him, feed him to tigers.

272
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,520
He'll be back like I said he always is.

273
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,660
So go ahead and kill him.

274
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,500
And when you're done killing him, you're going to kill him.

275
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,820
And you'll be looking down at Bob's lifeless corpse and you'll notice something strange.

276
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,420
There's a pipe still clutched in his jaw.

277
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,300
And it's still lit.

278
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,200
And it's still burning and smoking.

279
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,740
And it's as if this dead man is still smoking this pipe.

280
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,700
And you will contemplate that oh so briefly.

281
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,680
And you will blink.

282
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,940
And J.R.R. Bob Dobbs will jump up and stick his dick in your ass.

283
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,480
And we'll see.

284
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:28,900
And with that injection of Dobbs' throbbing member into your delicate rosebud, you are protected and yet cured of the disease of anti-slack.

285
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:36,260
As you see with Bob Dobbs' patented meat injection, you have your cure and protection.

286
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,820
You're cured with the first thrust of Bob's hips.

287
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,280
Though he tends to not just do one thrust as you can imagine.

288
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,420
And it does tend to go on for several hours.

289
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,760
And he doesn't really believe in lube.

290
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,540
Anyway.

291
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,240
But you will take that thrust and you will like it.

292
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,340
And you'll take the next and the next.

293
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:07,680
Because every subsequent thrust from Bob's huge throbbing member in your asshole provides protection from anti-slack.

294
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,100
So you better take it.

295
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,880
You better take it and you like it.

296
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,600
Tinkly pants!

297
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,960
Because you have to like it.

298
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,780
Because that's all that is there to save you from this anti-slack epidemic.

299
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:27,000
The slack injection of Bob's member into your asshole is the only protection, don't you see?

300
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,500
So repeat after me.

301
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,340
That slack injection is your protection.

302
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,400
Everyone.

303
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,820
That slack injection is your protection.

304
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,060
One more time because I know some of you are drunk.

305
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,860
That slack injection is your protection.

306
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,660
Thank you ladies and gentlemen and I'm sorry dear Bobby.

307
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,040
No you cannot fuck me.

308
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,700
I have a boyfriend.

309
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,800
But I do appreciate the flattery.

310
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,900
Is he...

311
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,500
Is he dead?

312
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,360
Yes.

313
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,060
Look at his face now David.

314
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,180
Yes.

315
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,640
Maybe we ought not go through with this.

316
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,180
He can't turn back now.

317
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,820
Shall we begin?

318
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,020
I don't know.

319
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,460
Switch it on.

320
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,040
Now Tim, take a look at him.

321
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,860
Place the contact microphone on his chest David.

322
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,200
Yes Jason.

323
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,100
You're listening to the sound of his heart David.

324
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,020
The beating heart of a dead man.

325
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,820
Yes, he's dead I'd say for at least two hours.

326
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,760
Very close David.

327
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,200
A few minutes longer that's all.

328
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,900
What do you intend doing?

329
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:45,720
We'll see.

330
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,100
You know of course that all life has a connection with electricity.

331
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,260
Of course.

332
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,760
Now to turn on the machine.

333
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,980
Now look at him David.

334
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,180
Yes, he's dead I'd say for at least two hours.

335
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,120
Very close David.

336
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,560
A few minutes longer that's all.

337
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,260
What do you intend doing?

338
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,060
We'll see.

339
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,800
Yes, I intend to kill him.

340
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:10,800


341
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:10,800


342
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:10,800


343
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:10,800


344
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:10,800


345
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:10,800


346
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:10,800


347
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:10,800


348
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:10,800


349
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:10,800


350
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:10,800


351
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:10,800


352
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:10,800


353
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:10,800


354
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:10,800


355
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,960
I think so.

356
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,160
I'm not too sure about that.

357
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,740
No, I suppose not.

358
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:27,260
All characters and events portrayed in these programs are purely coincidental.

359
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,500
Hey.

360
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,220
Yeah?

361
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,280
Yeah.

362
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,200
Yeah.

363
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:31,900
No?

364
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,620
How?

365
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:38,800
Hey you know B, I bet you could get some of that trick stuff they got like that plastic ice cube.

366
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,520
That's what you put in the rubber cheese to put in the candy with soap in the middle to mix in with rubber snakes with the bug in it.

367
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,520
Golly.

368
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,720
Did it work?

369
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,000
Oh he did it.

370
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,420
My mother crying and trembling leaped out of the window.

371
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,760
Well sure, why not?

372
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,940
Well Hank, this is goodbye.

373
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,240
P W D G A apostrophe S.

374
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,520
The subgenius.

375
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,980
Power of.

376
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,660
Fudges.

377
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,580
Our object my dear Watson is to dispose of the lay that in fright finds it wants some wits.

378
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,020
Well then you dear don't have a water in the big old dream.

379
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,160
The dream that once is me rose through the ear Watson.

380
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,200
Very well, terrific.

381
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,680
Mr. Dettol sent me first.

382
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,720
Oh, that's it Watson.

383
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,500
How so?

384
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,300
My dear Watson, those listed jeopardy were the what were whose balance person them.

385
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,320
In short, a field Ainsworth family bought.

386
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,180
Or worse.

387
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,800
Well then, why not let me take over?

388
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,040
No Watson, not intruding.

389
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,560
That loose chairs with who can quitter.

390
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,660
By Jove, of course.

391
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,300
Yes.

392
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,020
Yes.

393
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,180
I was disobeyed.

394
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,980
I was disobeyed.

395
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:38,760
I was disobeyed.

396
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,320
I was disobeyed.

397
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:39,800
I was disobeyed.

398
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:39,800


399
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:39,820
I was disobeyed.

400
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,920
Oh, I don't understand.

401
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:41,580
Exactly.

402
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,680
Who does understand.

403
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,620
Thanks to Lemur for that.

404
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:54,780
And back now to the Baltimore 2008 Devival at Load of Fun, and a sobering if not fully

405
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,940
sober rant by the great Reverend Carter LeBlanc.

406
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,500
Greetings.

407
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,560
Hey.

408
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,620
I am the Magister of the Dark.

409
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,080
Welcome home.

410
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,880
I have this thing that may or may not be readable.

411
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:35,900
It says, this note is legal tender.

412
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,060


413
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,060


414
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,060


415
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,060


416
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,060


417
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,060


418
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,060


419
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,960
for all debts, public and private.

420
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,100
It says pubic.

421
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,360
Oh, pubic debts.

422
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,600
I put that in the wrong part of my pants, though.

423
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:58,900
So, this is sort of a fun thing for me.

424
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,580
I'm not doing it for my health, you know.

425
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,260
I'm doing it for my entertainment.

426
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:03,620
Entertainment.

427
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,900
I've got this little...

428
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,380
This isn't even English.

429
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:17,060
Well, look, I just have to talk about some really short, brief, concise things.

430
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,340
With regards to the Church of the Self-Genius,

431
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,660
I'm going to say you have a phenomenal rant.

432
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,220
Some of you may have been here before.

433
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,540
Some of you may have gotten here after that.

434
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:31,140
The timbre of the evening has changed as the evening has unfolded.

435
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,240
But I just have a few words.

436
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:33,740
Brief words.

437
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:34,480
The...

438
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:41,540
You ever use one of those sticky traps when you have a mouse problem?

439
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:47,620
We don't really use them in Baltimore because all that does is slow the mice down

440
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,620
for long enough for the rats to get to them.

441
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,760
And it's just not pretty from there.

442
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,780
But if you think of the sticky trap, and you think about what it's like,

443
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,720
and I don't mean this in an animal rights sense,

444
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,100
but I want you to picture what happens.

445
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,240
What happens?

446
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,320
When you get that sticky trap, when you get that first...

447
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,360
No.

448
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,720
Something's wrong, and you can't free it, and you put your other hand on it,

449
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:21,580
and next thing you know, you're sprawled out, you can't move an inch,

450
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,920
you're restricted to a two-dimensional plane.

451
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,780
I mean, I don't know if you ever read the flatland.

452
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,120
You know?

453
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,080
This whole concept of two-dimensional reality.

454
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,920
When you hit the sticky trap, all of a sudden, your range of motion is restricted.

455
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,920
You have become a two-dimensional object.

456
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,580
Now, you can be protruded out into three-dimensional space.

457
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,860
But the fact of the matter is what has happened is you've become a two-dimensional object.

458
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,780
You are a fist to this plane.

459
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,880
Now, I want you to extend that a little farther.

460
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,640
You know, imagine if you were a three-dimensional sticky trap.

461
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,220
Okay?

462
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:10,260
Imagine you've managed to get yourself entangled into some sort of three-dimensional equivalent

463
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,520
of the two-dimensional sticky trap.

464
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:20,980
You find yourself restricted in your range of movement to a point where you are entirely immobile.

465
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,020
Your perspective is limited.

466
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,040
You can't turn your head to look in any other direction.

467
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:26,940
You can't...

468
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:33,220
And maybe, you know, because what happens at the end of it, when you pick up the sticky trap with the mouse on it,

469
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,500
you take it over and you...

470
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,660
Well, I...

471
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,800
You drop it in a bucket of water.

472
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,140
You know?

473
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,840
And so, essentially, what that mouse gets is from the minute he hits that sticky trap,

474
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,240
he's completely under control of whoever controls the sticky trap.

475
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,260
Think of the sticky trap.

476
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,080
You're basically...

477
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,360
It's a linear narration.

478
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,260
You've seen the final days of his life.

479
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,960
Now, if you then extrapolate what I've described as a three-dimensional sticky trap,

480
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,560
and think about that.

481
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:08,660
This is not actually a three-dimensional sticky trap because we, like that mouse stuck on that sticky trap,

482
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,420
being carried through the bucket of water.

483
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,960
We are being carried through space in a moving fashion.

484
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:22,080
We've incorporated a fourth dimension into this sticky trap that we are still enmeshed in.

485
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,300
And we're moving.

486
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,040
You know, there's a four-dimensional experience.

487
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,640
There's the passage of time.

488
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,860
There's movement through space.

489
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,740
But our movement is still restricted.

490
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,880
Because that's how we move through the four-dimensional continuum.

491
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,560
That's how we move through space.

492
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,060
But this is the thing.

493
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,200
Our destination in space is not yet written.

494
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,720
There are things that come from other places that influence us.

495
00:22:53,780 --> 00:23:00,080
Ideas, direct and indirect concepts, books, music, things like that.

496
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,080
But there are other stranger forces at work.

497
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:10,100
And this is where the revelation that I'm bringing to you tonight comes in.

498
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,640
We are under attack.

499
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:21,560
We are under attack from the descendants of us in the future.

500
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,540
They are waging war on us.

501
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,920
Nay, they are not waging war on us.

502
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,980
They are waging war with us.

503
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,060
Because we are not.

504
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:36,340
But those of you who have studied any pop quantum physics.

505
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,880
And you know about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the waveform collapse.

506
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:53,420
And the indeterminacy concept of a hydrogen atom and the proton as it spins.

507
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,860
Or as it hazes in some indeterminate nebulous quantum cloud.

508
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,540
What happens is.

509
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,800
is that there is no determined future.

510
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,980
But in some of the futures that stem from this point,

511
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,660
there is time travel.

512
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:15,380
The problem is, is the people in the future that get the time travel,

513
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,320
they've got to make sure that it's their future that happens.

514
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:24,200
And there's not just one time traveling self from the future at work,

515
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:29,340
but there are multiple, multiple, multiple, infinite, in fact, infinite,

516
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,140
opportunities in the future.

517
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,700
And they are struggling to make their own presence our future.

518
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:44,060
And this, this is where the church of the subgenius comes in.

519
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:48,340
Because there's not just one person carrying that sticky trap,

520
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,900
that four-dimensional sticky trap of doom forward.

521
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,300
There are a million, no, a million times a million times a million,

522
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,400
there are alopnars.

523
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,040
There are a million, no, if you're familiar with the term.

524
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:09,500
There are an unquantifiable quantity of future entities struggling to bring us

525
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,700
towards their own concepts of what our doom will look like.

526
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,100
And we at the church of the subgenius, we have chosen,

527
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:25,360
we have chosen to stare into the face of planetary doom with open arms and open wallets.

528
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,320
We have looked to this man,

529
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,800
this bobbed up,

530
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:37,140
the greatest salesman that ever lived, he couldn't deal with one specific future.

531
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:52,760
On July 5th, 1998, the X-ists, the men from Planet X, they're not really men, and it's not really a planet.

532
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:59,900
But that's not important. On July 5th, 1998, they will come and destroy this planet.

533
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,540
They will lay it to waste. There will be nothing but a smoking cinder.

534
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:16,760
Where once this lush, green-blue ball swirled around our somewhat unremarkable yellowish star.

535
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,440
And that's what we want. We've decided.

536
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,980
We have decided.

537
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,740
We have decided.

538
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:27,760
Who's going to be carrying our four-dimensional, sticky trap of doom into the future?

539
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:33,220
And we are paying Bob Dobbs nothing.

540
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,220
We're paying the Church of the Subgenius $30.

541
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:45,580
But that's just to make sure that you're on board, because there is no redemption without shedding of blood.

542
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,680
But there is no profit without spending of money.

543
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,800
And that's what we're here tonight.

544
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,700
To celebrate the spending of money.

545
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:59,380
Eternal salvation for $30 or triple your money back.

546
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,980
Choose your doom.

547
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,440
And choose a spectacular one.

548
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:13,340
And you know, if you've got just the right kind of essence, those elder gods, those frightening creatures from beyond,

549
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,020
they'll save us for last.

550
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,420
And they'll savor us just a little more.

551
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,640
We don't want a savior.

552
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,720
We want to be savored.

553
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,340
And that's all I've got to say tonight.

554
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,520
Thanks for coming to the D-Vival.

555
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,760
We've got another band.

556
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,520
We've got a little bit more ranting.

557
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,440
There's good stuff happening tonight.

558
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,960
And we still haven't drank all the beer yet.

559
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,420
What's wrong with you people?

560
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,260
Party!

561
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,420
Holy cow!

562
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,480
What can I say?

563
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,600
It's got me.

564
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,260
It's got me.

565
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:47,940
It's got me.

566
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,360
It's got me.

567
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,520
We've got Adam Carter-LeBlanc!

568
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,340
And Christ, peace, and rest, Pisces.

569
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,140
You've put all this insanity together.

570
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,040
Oh look, I have some of these ranting notes up here.

571
00:27:59,140 --> 00:27:59,620
Mmm, good.

572
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,020
I can use that later.

573
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,200
Those are ordinary cephalopods.

574
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,700
Squid, octopus.

575
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,580
I need to know what's happening.

576
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,260
This planet is dying.

577
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,080
The human race is killing it.

578
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,780
So you've come here to help us?

579
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,140
No, I didn't.

580
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,400
You said you came to save us.

581
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,380
I said I came to save the Earth.

582
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,340
You came to save the Earth.

583
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,300
From us.

584
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,820
You came to save the Earth.

585
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,180
From us.

586
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,620
We can't risk the survival of this planet for the sake of one species.

587
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,480
What are you saying?

588
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,040
If the Earth dies, you die.

589
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,000
If you die, the Earth survives.

590
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:53,720
There are only a handful of planets in the cosmos that are capable of supporting complex life.

591
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,480
You can't do this.

592
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,540
This one can't be allowed to perish.

593
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,580
We can change.

594
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,840
We could still turn things around.

595
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,300
We've watched, we've waited and hoped that you would change.

596
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:02,860
Please.

597
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,960
It's reached the tipping point. We have to act.

598
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,380
Please.

599
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,440
We'll undo the damage you've done and give the Earth a chance to begin again.

600
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,040
Don't do this.

601
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,280
Please.

602
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,820
We could change.

603
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,300
We can change.

604
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,200
The decision is made.

605
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,820
The process has begun.

606
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,580
However, the majority of individuals will be unable to cope with such a catastrophic experience immediately,

607
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,620
particularly if it is unexpected or prolonged.

608
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:36,120
The sudden obliteration of their surroundings, the sound and fury of the blast,

609
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:40,200
will make it difficult to respond or react promptly and effectively.

610
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,660
Great fear will interfere with the ability of many to understand what has happened

611
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,620
or to decide what they must do.

612
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:53,740
After seconds or minutes, however, most of them should recoil and develop sufficient awareness

613
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,920
to take steps for personal survival.

614
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,500
During this recoil period, and for a time thereafter,

615
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:04,900
such survivors may be influenced by the commands and activities of leaders or other survivors.

616
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,460
Perhaps 5 to 20 percent will not rebound immediately.

617
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:14,980
They will continue to be non-effective for hours, but rarely for days.

618
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,640
Some may continue to be non-effective for hours, but rarely for days.

619
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,400
Some may continue to be non-effective for hours, but rarely for days.

620
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:24,440
It is to this group alone that the designation psychological casualty may be properly applied.

621
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,280
Okay, now, just breathe.

622
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,500
Here, sit down.

623
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,440
And tell me what happened.

624
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,300
Billy!

625
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,020
Blime.

626
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:31,980
So long!

627
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,580
What about Blime?

628
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,600
Well, now I'm full automatic in the hands of the computers.

629
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,160
My advice to you.

630
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,700
Start drinking heavily.

631
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,080
What's over, children?

632
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,720
All are welcome.

633
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,740
All welcome.

634
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,040
Go into the light.

635
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,920
My advice to you.

636
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,060
Go into the givers.

637
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,640
You are alive.

638
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,920
Therefore, I shall ignore you.

639
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:27,160
A little bit there about the upcoming X-Day this July 5th, when the earth will in fact be sprayed for tool users.

640
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:37,220
For information about our big party regarding the end of the world and how to be saved, you could see subgenius.com.

641
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:44,960
For even more endlessly detailed information about the Church of the Subgenius and so forth,

642
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:55,360
there is an online course in the whole thing starting April 6th at maybelogic.net.

643
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,220
We'll probably mention that again.

644
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,920
This is the Hour of Slack, dear friends.

645
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,360
Thanks to Reverend Sweetness McGee for the above earlier stuff.

646
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,680
And now more from Sweetness, the large, and whoever else they cooperated with.

647
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,120
What happened out there?

648
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,360
Oh, nothing much.

649
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,360
Just tried to kill me twice in the last five minutes.

650
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,000
What about Billy?

651
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,220
He's alive.

652
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,960
He's alive.

653
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,440
He's alive.

654
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,640
I'm here tonight to salute Bob.

655
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,640
What about Billy?

656
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,660
The man who...

657
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:29,680
I mean, one thing you can say about Bob, he's just...

658
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,480
I was...

659
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,560
I was in a picture with Bob...

660
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,280
What about Billy?

661
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,640
He's alive.

662
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:42,060
One time, it never reached the theater.

663
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,360
What about Billy?

664
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,800
He's alive.

665
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,060
He's alive.

666
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:45,500
It never...

667
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,180
It was...

668
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,300
He's alive.

669
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,000
He's alive.

670
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,360
He's alive.

671
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:50,520
I'm alive.

672
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:51,880
He's alive.

673
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,280
Billy?

674
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,580
What about Billy?

675
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,620
He's alive.

676
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:55,440
He's alive.

677
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,720
He's alive.

678
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,820
Bob comes after sex.

679
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,000
And sex comes after Bob.

680
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,140
Right.

681
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:10,280
And now, next, 20 minutes of various people explaining the connection between the Church

682
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,180
of the Subgenius and Robert Anton Wilson.

683
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,320
The great writer.

684
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:23,620
This is part of a tribute show about Wilson from the British show called Right Where You

685
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,300
Are Sitting Now.

686
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,940
Robert Anton Wilson Show, really.

687
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,440
You've never mentioned Wilson before, Ken?

688
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,860
We've mentioned him, in pretty much every episode, actually.

689
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,720
But we've never actually done a proper episode, as it were, about him.

690
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:41,100
So it just seems a bit wrong not to have done that.

691
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,640
But anyway, we got there eventually.

692
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,160
You did it.

693
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,160


694
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,160


695
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,160


696
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,160


697
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,160


698
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,160


699
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,160


700
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,160


701
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,160


702
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,160


703
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,160


704
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,420
Almost a year later.

705
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,060
So what was it that, how did you first find out about Robert Anton Wilson, Jay?

706
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:56,040
In fact, I first heard about Robert Anton Wilson, I may have told this story in a few

707
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:02,500
episodes of Out There Radio, but I picked up a Church of the Subgenius book called High

708
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,600
Weirdness by Mail.

709
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,200
Excellent.

710
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:04,800
Yeah, I love that.

711
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,320
Yeah, it's a great book.

712
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,920
And I think I was maybe 16 or 17 when I picked it up.

713
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,700
I was in high school.

714
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,140
And it was one of those books that I immediately fell in love with.

715
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:13,140


716
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:13,140


717
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:13,140


718
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:13,140


719
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:13,140


720
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:16,020
I immediately devoured and then showed my friends.

721
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,280
I was like, oh, have you seen this?

722
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,300
Look at this crazy stuff you can get.

723
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:24,940
It's all, and this is, of course, pre-World Wide Web.

724
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:31,820
And there was just all kinds of information in this book about just crazy organizations,

725
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,640
crazy authors.

726
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:39,660
And in fact, I credit that particular book with turning me on to a lot of different things,

727
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,860
including Robert Anton Wilson's book, The Illuminatus Trilogy.

728
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:51,580
And so by the time I decided to start looking around for, I guess, branching out from the

729
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:57,920
Subgenius book and started to find other authors that had mentioned, I was in college

730
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,620
at the time.

731
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:05,040
And it turns out that the college I went to had a pretty good library and, in fact, had

732
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:11,220
not only The Illuminatus Trilogy and its collection, but also several other books that were mentioned

733
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,840
in the Subgenius book.

734
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:12,840


735
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:12,840


736
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:12,840


737
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:12,840


738
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:12,840


739
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:12,840


740
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:19,280
So I started, I guess, becoming a regular at the university library and checking out

741
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,000
a lot of these things.

742
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,560
And that's where I first picked up The Illuminatus Trilogy.

743
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,600
And I actually, you know, I hate to say this.

744
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,680
I actually don't hate to say it.

745
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,460
I've only read the first two books of The Illuminatus Trilogy.

746
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:41,180
In fact, the other Wilson books, his nonfiction, I found to be a lot more interesting to me,

747
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:41,940
personally.

748
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,460
I mean, I read the first two books of The Illuminatus Trilogy and I was like, oh, this

749
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,120
is a lot more interesting than his fiction.

750
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:50,360
Although his fiction is, of course, a lot of fun and has a lot of other great qualities.

751
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,580
His nonfiction was what really, really got me.

752
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:59,380
In particular, his books Prometheus Rising and Cosmic Trigger and some others.

753
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,500
That's how I started reading Wilson.

754
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:05,860
Yeah, actually, I was given, again, the first one I read was The Illuminatus Trilogy

755
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,220
as well.

756
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,760
I'd heard about it before.

757
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,140
I think it, again, might have been from Subgenius, actually.

758
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,840
On the Subgenius, the very, very early version.

759
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:12,840


760
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,800
It was one of the early Subgenius websites.

761
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,540
It was one of the first sites on the web, from what I remember.

762
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,300
It was hosted on the university server, I always remember it.

763
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,720
And it kept referring back to Wilson.

764
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,940
And there was a group as well, I think it was called alt.wilson.

765
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,680
It was one of those old Usenet groups.

766
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,100
And I used to keep seeing it and wondering what the hell they were talking about.

767
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,740
And actually, eventually, a friend of mine learned it to me.

768
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,620
I remember I got about halfway through.

769
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:42,020
And it's one of those books where it's kind of, we'll talk to Are You Serious About This

770
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:42,700
a bit later as well.

771
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,820
But there's this kind of insane amount of information thrown at you.

772
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,900
And it's completely nonlinear.

773
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,860
So it's kind of hard to explain to anyone that hasn't actually read it, I suppose.

774
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,660
But there's no kind of linear passage throughout the book.

775
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,160
It kind of cuts back and forth through time and space.

776
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:02,420
And it just throws billions and billions of conspiracy theories at you.

777
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,820
And you can never quite tell if they're kind of based on facts or...

778
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,920
I just remember it completely and utterly did my head in.

779
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:12,140
So I only got about halfway through the book and had to stop for about three months then

780
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:12,820
I had to pick up the book.

781
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,600
The rest of it and finish it afterwards.

782
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:21,180
It's like having a countercultural Wikipedia in a nonlinear narrative fictional form.

783
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:21,600
Yeah.

784
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,340
The Kennedy assassination.

785
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,340
I've never been satisfied with the Warren Commission.

786
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,860
Now the next guy we're bringing on the show is someone who hasn't been on since the early

787
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,540
days of the show.

788
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:41,140
He's also quite interested in turning people into religious reverence, I suppose.

789
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:41,440


790
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,480
And he was also heavily influenced by Wilson and Discordianism generally.

791
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,980
This is Reverend Ivan Stang, one of our favorite guests.

792
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:58,060
I'm one of those people who stumbled upon the Illuminatus book first when it was in

793
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,960
cheap paperback form.

794
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:04,640
In fact, I found it in a supermarket in the...

795
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:09,540
Probably around 1976 or 77.

796
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,700
I forget when it came out.

797
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,820
But it was in a supermarket.

798
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:16,680
It had a yellow submarine and an eye and a pyramid on it.

799
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,920
I thought, well, that looks weird.

800
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,600
I'll try this.

801
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,580
It was fantastically weird.

802
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:27,960
I thought, oh my God, I guess I'm not the only one who's completely crazy.

803
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,820
It was really inspiring.

804
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:41,060
I had said many, many times that if it hadn't been for Wilson and Shay's Illuminatus, there

805
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,560
might be a Church of the Subgenius.

806
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,820
But we wouldn't get it.

807
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,620
And it probably wouldn't be funny.

808
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,720
It would be all the wrong sort of thing.

809
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:59,500
But when we finally put together the very first Subgenius pamphlet, I was desperate

810
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:07,980
to send it to my heroes, which was underground comic book artists and people like Shay and

811
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,320
Wilson, especially Shay and Wilson.

812
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,940
And somebody...

813
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,540
Oh, Paul Maron.

814
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,620
He's a clown.

815
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:19,980
He's not also a drainage man.

816
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,560
He will get you lots of it.

817
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:22,560


818
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:22,560

y

856
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:52,680
I later learned that that's only true of the three or four a year who are chosen to be the bestsellers, Stephen King types and so forth.

857
00:39:53,380 --> 00:40:05,080
But I wrote to Wilson asking him a question about a UFO group that he had mentioned in Illuminatus or somewhere.

858
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,520
The silver shirts, because they were in Texas.

859
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,900
I thought, I'm in Texas, so that'll be a good connection.

860
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:18,080
And much to my tremendous surprise, he wrote back a friendly letter telling me what he knew about this obscure little group.

861
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,880
And he said, if you get any further into UFOs, try to keep your sense of humor.

862
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,880
And that was my end.

863
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,520
I said, I'll prove to him I kept my sense of humor.

864
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,140
And I sent him the subgenius pamphlet.

865
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:36,080
And much to my surprise, he absolutely loved it and kind of gave us a pat on the back.

866
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:40,780
And when we got our book deal, he gave me a nice quote to go on the back of the book.

867
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:48,240
So he was always very friendly to us and remained extremely friendly towards Church of the Subgenius to the end.

868
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:55,380
I think the last time we saw him in person was at Winter Star a couple of years before he died.

869
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:59,860
And a friend of mine was helping him around in his wheelchair and so forth.

870
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,300
But he was in great spirits even then.

871
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:07,080
He was really cheerful and very, very funny.

872
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,480
He always struck me as being a really funny person.

873
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:18,660
And I would get asked to open for him when he'd speak in Dallas or Austin back when I lived in Texas.

874
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:26,280
And that's how I ended up having a few meals with him and got to telling how much I admired him.

875
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:32,280
But one of my very favorite memories was back when Robert Shea was still alive.

876
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:40,500
The folks who run Winter Star and Starwood, ACE, or the Association for Consciousness Exploration in Cleveland,

877
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,320
brought Shea and Wilson both in.

878
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:51,820
And I had the most wonderful evening just sitting around listening to those two guys talk about movies.

879
00:41:52,960 --> 00:42:01,020
They were both really big movie fans with encyclopedic knowledge of the whole history of movies.

880
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:04,140
And it wasn't what I expected.

881
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:10,660
I kind of expected these guys to be talking about something heavier or lighter or something.

882
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,700
But it was just movies.

883
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:16,920
It was really a delightful conversation to sit in on.

884
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,180
Yeah, I actually checked out a movie that he recommended to me.

885
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,980
Well, not directly to me, but recommended in an interview called F for Fake.

886
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,040
I don't know if you've seen that one.

887
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,440
Yes.

888
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,020
Yeah.

889
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,320
I've heard him mention that one.

890
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,960
In fact, I think he talked about it at one of the Winter Stars.

891
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:36,080
Because it had just recently sort of been re-released.

892
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,720
Yeah, isn't that excellent?

893
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,680
I mentioned to him the movie.

894
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:45,400
The Trial, which is an Orson Welles film.

895
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,000
Oh, it's a Kafka.

896
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:46,720
Yeah.

897
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,380
Kafka, yeah.

898
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,800
And he jumped up and down and said, that's my favorite movie.

899
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,040
Excellent.

900
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:57,080
So it seemed we had at least some sort of similar case in movies.

901
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,460
If you haven't seen it, you should.

902
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,660
It's really amazing.

903
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,640
It's hard to find.

904
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,320
Yeah, they remade it as well, didn't they?

905
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,480
I preferred the original, though.

906
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:06,760
I don't know.

907
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:10,500
The only one I saw had Anthony Perkins as the protagonist.

908
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,320
And was stark, stark black and white.

909
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,940
I later learned it was shot in France.

910
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,520
But, oh, and the other thing that happened, that particular Winter Star,

911
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:27,780
I think Robert Shea met the woman he married.

912
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:28,320
Ah.

913
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,040
He may have been married before.

914
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,020
I mean, these guys were in their 40s or 50s at this point.

915
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:34,920
Maybe even older.

916
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:38,280
But there was a lady speaking at Winter Star.

917
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,880
And he said,

918
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:43,980
Shea and Shea met the next thing we knew, they'd gotten married.

919
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,700
And then Shea died, which was just awful.

920
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,540
I mean, it was really sudden.

921
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:53,380
And I felt so sorry for his brand new wife.

922
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:53,880
Yeah.

923
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:57,340
And he was actually quite a good writer in his own right, wasn't he?

924
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:02,100
Well, I've never read any of his solo novels, I'm sorry to say.

925
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:02,400
Ah.

926
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:05,600
And I haven't read everything Robert Anton Wilson wrote.

927
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:06,840
No, I think it's quite hard.

928
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,380
He wrote quite a lot of stuff, didn't he?

929
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:08,960
Yeah.

930
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,140
Yeah, I think I could write faster than I can read.

931
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,480
So, but I one time had the experience of,

932
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,660
this isn't something I do all the time.

933
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,280
In fact, it's been years since I did this,

934
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:28,620
but I was tripping and reading Schrodinger's Cat on an airplane.

935
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:29,560
Oh, wow.

936
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:33,660
I'd already read most of the trilogy, and I was coming down to the end of it.

937
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:37,520
And I was, obviously, since I was on a plane,

938
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,940
I wasn't reading a book.

939
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,740
I wasn't tripping really hard.

940
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,240
But for some reason, it all seemed to come together.

941
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:45,420
And when I got to the end of it,

942
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:48,860
I was so convinced that I sort of understood what he was saying

943
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:52,780
that I wrote him a long letter on the back of a vomit bag,

944
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,600
you know, an air sickness bag.

945
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,540
I don't know if they even include those in planes anymore,

946
00:44:58,660 --> 00:44:59,860
but there was just enough room.

947
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:05,000
And I mailed him the handwritten note on the bag,

948
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:07,440
and he later told me he really appreciated it.

949
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,280
Ha, ha, ha.

950
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:08,740
Excellent.

951
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,860
So, I mean, talking about his work.

952
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,000
Well, go ahead.

953
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,180
I was going to say, talking about his work,

954
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,500
what particular books of his, other than Illuminatus,

955
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,440
did you kind of like really resonate with?

956
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,140
Well, I can't remember which book this is in.

957
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,980
It's one of the collections of essays.

958
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:32,920
But he wrote a very out-of-character, serious thing

959
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,680
about the death of his daughter.

960
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:36,940
Ah, right, yeah.

961
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,920
Who died in a violent accident.

962
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,760
He died in a violent attack when she was 12 years old.

963
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:45,060
I was, that struck me.

964
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,120
And I told him this.

965
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,560
To me, out of all the things he'd written,

966
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:58,460
that description of how he dealt with the tragedy of his daughter's death

967
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:03,340
stuck with me more than anything else because it was so very real.

968
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,040
And at the time, I had a 12-year-old daughter

969
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,300
and lived in a really dangerous neighborhood.

970
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,440
And, you know, I was worried about that kind of, you know,

971
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,160
you couldn't let your kids walk on the streets in the daytime.

972
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:21,280
Now, this, of course, was 20 years after what had happened to his daughter.

973
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,320
But that, I can't remember which collection it was in.

974
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,200
It's in Cosmic Trigger.

975
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,780
Yeah, I was going to say, it must have been Cosmic Trigger.

976
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:35,760
It's the one that I don't have a copy of left because I've loaned it to somebody.

977
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:36,280
Hmm.

978
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:38,700
And that...

979
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,040
It was just so real, you know.

980
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:47,080
So much of what he writes about is in the flighty, airy realms of mysticism and philosophy.

981
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:51,580
But, you know, when he gets down and dirty, that's...

982
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,560
That can mean a lot, too.

983
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:55,440
Yeah.

984
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:59,700
And, well, it just tore me up reading about it.

985
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:02,900
But it also was kind of inspiring, you know,

986
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,340
the fact that he had to come to grips with all that.

987
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,260
I'm sure he felt kind of partly responsible

988
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:11,700
because he wasn't making enough money to live in a safe neighborhood.

989
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:12,460
Yeah.

990
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,400
Yeah, it's very honest, isn't it?

991
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,340
It's a very honest depiction of what happened, I felt.

992
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:17,600
Yeah.

993
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:21,200
Well, it really pinned me.

994
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:21,740
Hmm.

995
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:22,620
Yeah.

996
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,540
So it's been interesting.

997
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:32,320
I can tell you that Robert Anton Wilson was one of the hardest people to record in the world.

998
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,680
He would not work with a microphone.

999
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,520
You had to put that thing...

1000
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,240
You had to put that thing...

1001
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,680
Right up against his lips and then hope he didn't change position.

1002
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:47,620
Because he talked in that nice Brooklyn monotone.

1003
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:48,120
Hmm.

1004
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,260
But he was not very mic-friendly.

1005
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,400
So in...

1006
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,840
I always...

1007
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:03,900
Every time he spoke, I found myself having the nerve to run up there and adjust the mic a little bit.

1008
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,100
Right in the middle of his thing.

1009
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,140
Because he just didn't seem...

1010
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:08,980
He didn't seem to want to speak up.

1011
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:12,280
Once when I was opening for him, I was...

1012
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,320
This was in the early days and I was kind of insecure.

1013
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:19,400
Had a couple of drinks before I went on, which I would never do now.

1014
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:25,180
And I went on and screamed and yelled and hollered in this little bookstore where he was speaking.

1015
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:30,800
When I got off, he walked up to the podium and said,

1016
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:35,900
After the storm, then the calm.

1017
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:36,740
Hmm.

1018
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,540
I felt kind of like an idiot.

1019
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,960
But I've always felt kind of like an idiot, so that wasn't anything to change.

1020
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,620
Because of my position in the Church of the Subgenius.

1021
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,120
He was very, very friendly, considering...

1022
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:58,300
You know, when I first approached him as a fan, he didn't treat me like a jerk.

1023
00:48:58,380 --> 00:48:59,860
He gave me really good advice.

1024
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,120
And I...

1025
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:03,580
I...

1026
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:07,180
I could not possibly be that polite.

1027
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:08,400
But...

1028
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,260
Not after what I've been through.

1029
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:19,460
I mean, one thing that I've been talking with the other guests about is what we think that Rob Anton Wilson's legacy will be.

1030
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,360
I mean, it's strange that he seems to have become...

1031
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:27,980
He seems to be as popular, if not even more popular now that he's actually passed away.

1032
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:29,020
And it's a bit like...

1033
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,320
Almost reminds me a bit of...

1034
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,960
I was talking to Lon Myler-DeKette about this.

1035
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,540
It reminds me a bit of Alistair Crowley in the way that he suddenly became more famous and kind of more read after he died.

1036
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:37,860
And...

1037
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:41,880
Do you think that Rob Anton Wilson does have a legacy?

1038
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:45,600
Oh, well, obviously he has a legacy.

1039
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,980
And unfortunately, it goes two different ways.

1040
00:49:49,300 --> 00:50:00,000
On the one hand, there are probably numberless people who his writing inspired to go in a really positive...

1041
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,420
What turned out for them to be a really positive direction.

1042
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:07,760
On the other hand, there's people who read philosophy and mysticism...

1043
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:12,400
And never pick up on that whole maybe thing.

1044
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:18,400
And so they will take figurative things literally.

1045
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:25,600
I think that Pope Bob has the same problem with the Church of the Subgenius in that...

1046
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,760
Sometimes it only makes assholes worse.

1047
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:34,880
And it's not just us.

1048
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:37,340
It's any religion.

1049
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:40,520
Or mysticism-related type thing.

1050
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,280
Or philosophy.

1051
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:47,800
Can function as something that just justifies a person's already bad behavior.

1052
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:48,480
Yeah.

1053
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:50,260
If they misunderstand it.

1054
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:53,820
And it's really easy to misunderstand somebody who's right.

1055
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,820
Half the time, Wilson is being tongue-in-cheek.

1056
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:00,560
And it takes a lot of subtlety to pick up on that sort of thing.

1057
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:01,060
Hmm.

1058
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:01,900
Yeah.

1059
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,800
You know, sometimes he's very blunt and plain and speaks exactly...

1060
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:08,620
What he means.

1061
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,960
And other times, I think he's playing games.

1062
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,860
And I know he was playing games.

1063
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,280
I mean, he told me so.

1064
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:15,580
It was like...

1065
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:17,020
I've had several writers go,

1066
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:18,860
Hey, now, don't take this stuff too seriously.

1067
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:19,960
I've had to say that.

1068
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:21,420
And...

1069
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:22,300
Oh, God.

1070
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,860
Sometimes it doesn't do any good.

1071
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:26,880
But...

1072
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,480
But...

1073
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:34,220
From what I can tell from looking at the last interviews with him...

1074
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:37,720
That were in the Maybe Logic film and so forth...

1075
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:42,760
It seemed to me that he kept his sense of humor to the bitter end.

1076
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:45,720
And that's a lesson for all of us.

1077
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:46,420
Really.

1078
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:47,360
There's the...

1079
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:48,780
That whole...

1080
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:50,340
Maybe.

1081
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:56,760
You know, as he said, if only people would say maybe more often, it might solve a whole lot of problems.

1082
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:57,320
Yeah.

1083
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:57,940
Yeah, definitely.

1084
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,000
And to me, that kind of sums up what...

1085
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,120
That's what I got out of Wilson's material.

1086
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,540
I like to think...

1087
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:14,140
That knowing him helped make me a little bit less mean.

1088
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:19,300
And a little bit nicer and a little bit more tolerant of other people's viewpoints.

1089
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:22,020
And a little bit less sure of...

1090
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:24,960
Well, a lot less sure of my own opinions.

1091
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,140
Things that I thought were facts.

1092
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:30,980
His work helped me to realize, no, no.

1093
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,460
What those are, are opinions.

1094
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,500
And you really don't know.

1095
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,460
And so...

1096
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:38,260
You know, you...

1097
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,380
Maybe this is the way it is.

1098
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,080
And I really do...

1099
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:50,560
That used to be when I had a cig on the internet, my cig was often that quote by him.

1100
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:51,140
Yeah.

1101
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:56,920
Maybe, if everybody said maybe more often, the world might be an easier place to live in.

1102
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:58,040
And I...

1103
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,180
Maybe that's right.

1104
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:02,680
So if you want to...

1105
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,720
If you get a deep, intuitive understanding of the relation of something and nothing,

1106
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:07,700
then you're in a...

1107
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:08,500
You're in a state of slack.

1108
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,160
And slack...

1109
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,340
Slack is even better than nirvana.

1110
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,100
Because...

1111
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:22,660
Because if you're in slack, you are in the balance point between something and nothing.

1112
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:24,440
And then you can get something for nothing.

1113
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:25,680
And...

1114
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:27,520
This...

1115
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:27,840
This...

1116
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:34,340
This was revealed to J.R. Bob Dobbs, the founder of the Church of the Subgenius,

1117
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,160
by L. Ron Hubbard on an elevator.

1118
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:37,300
And...

1119
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,640
In Palm Beach, Florida in 1957.

1120
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:42,320
J.R. Bob Dobbs...

1121
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:47,120
J.R. Bob Dobbs was only a humble aluminum siding salesman at that time.

1122
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:50,020
But it just took one meeting with L. Ron Hubbard,

1123
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:51,920
and he learned the secret of power

1124
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,100
and how to stand on the balance between something and nothing

1125
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,360
and get something for nothing.

1126
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:58,740
And he founded the Church of the Subgenius.

1127
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,200
And now he's one of the richest men in the world,

1128
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,860
but he still acts like a regular fella.

1129
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:07,200
Of course, it's very hard to see Bob these days,

1130
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:11,220
because he's reached such a tremendous level of spiritual elevation

1131
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:14,720
that most people who've met him can't even remember the experience.

1132
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,800
It's like a UFO contact.

1133
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:18,480
There's partial...

1134
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,380
There's total or partial amnesia,

1135
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,880
conjunctivitis and eye strain,

1136
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:24,720
nervous symptoms.

1137
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,680
Sometimes it requires hospitalization.

1138
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,140
And you almost inevitably,

1139
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:31,540
you're persecuted by the men in black afterwards.

1140
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,780
The men in black are agents of the conspiracy.

1141
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,880
The conspiracy is...

1142
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,900
is all the groups that's trying to stamp out the Church of the Subgenius.

1143
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:42,500
It consists of all the other religions in the world,

1144
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:43,580
the Rockefellers,

1145
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,000
the OPEC nations,

1146
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,180
and the people who put Hawaiian music in elevators,

1147
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,220
and all other evil and sinister forces like that.

1148
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,580
So if you've met Bob,

1149
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,260
they'll send the men in black around to persecute you.

1150
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,340
Don't be afraid.

1151
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,840
The men in black will come to your door pretending to be Jehovah's Witnesses.

1152
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,240
And they will try...

1153
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,360
They will try to get into your house.

1154
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:06,680
The thing to do is greet them

1155
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:07,560
in a friendly way

1156
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,520
and say,

1157
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,920
I would glad to see you.

1158
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,280
This is a Satanist temple.

1159
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,640
We were looking for subjects for a sacrifice.

1160
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,200
And we've heard you've arrived.

1161
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:17,560
This...

1162
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:22,080
This will absolutely guarantee you will never be bothered by Jehovah's Witnesses again.

1163
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:26,280
They send a report back to Kingdom Hall with your address on it,

1164
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:28,040
and nobody ever goes there again.

1165
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:28,900
It really works.

1166
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,700
This is not a put-on.

1167
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:31,540
It really works.

1168
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,180
They believe in that sort of stuff.

1169
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,220
Yes, friends.

1170
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:38,240
That was Robert Anton Wilson himself,

1171
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:39,440
Pope Bob,

1172
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:44,060
preaching about J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius.

1173
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:49,920
That interview material was from the show right where you are sitting now,

1174
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:58,380
which can be heard at sittingnow.co.uk.

1175
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,520
You're listening to the Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius,

1176
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,740
which is at...

1177
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,960
subgenius.com.

1178
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:14,600
There is an entire eight-week class about the history and practice of the Church of the Subgenius,

1179
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,500
starting April 6th at

1180
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:19,380
maybelogic.net

1181
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:22,520
and maybelogic.org.

1182
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,320
And now,

1183
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:24,960
The Loonjer.

1184
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,520
The Loonjer.

1185
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,340
Are you there?

1186
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:36,200
A fiery horse with the speed of dust, and...

1187
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,180
the hearty high odor.

1188
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:38,420
Oops.

1189
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,140
Please, please, please, Mister.

1190
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,600
What's the matter, Buttons?

1191
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:44,520
My legs hurt bad.

1192
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,020
Oh!

1193
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,020
I don't trust that masked man.

1194
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,040
I don't either, darling.

1195
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:49,880
Where are you going?

1196
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:50,620
Let's go.

1197
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:56,900
Now, perhaps you'll trust me.

1198
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:58,420
Secretly.

1199
00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:58,900
Yes.

1200
00:56:59,080 --> 00:56:59,900
Don't tell anyone.

1201
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,480
No offense intended, Mister, but I haven't known you long enough.

1202
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,000
Well, have it your own way.

1203
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:06,600
Adios.

1204
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:07,920
Come in.

1205
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:10,160
But, John...

1206
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:11,780
John...

1207
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:13,080
Then...

1208
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,640
We must share things.

1209
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,480
The good along with the bad.

1210
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:17,880
Give me a cigarette.

1211
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,820
You dumb hate thief.

1212
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:20,480
Give me a cigarette.

1213
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,440
But I don't understand.

1214
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,060
Don't try to understand anything.

1215
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,080
Just give me a cigarette.

1216
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:26,940
The masked man.

1217
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:28,920
I wouldn't count on that.

1218
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,680
John, take care of her.

1219
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:34,800
Nice going, John.

1220
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:35,940
Now tie them up.

1221
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:36,840
Oh, John.

1222
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,120
Time was right, Chavs.

1223
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,580
That's the important thing.

1224
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:42,540
Well, you outsmarted yourself, Leela.

1225
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:44,780
It was easy to make a fool out of him.

1226
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:46,620
He's alone here.

1227
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:48,820
Adios, lad.

1228
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:54,040
You know darn well I can't leave without a guitar string.

1229
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:03,180
Well, so long, nana-na-na-nephew.

1230
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:08,420
Don't forget to see me on TV tomorrow night.

1231
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:20,640
And now, ladies and gentlemen, introducing for the first time a new singing television star, Uncle Pecos.

1232
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,940
Oh, what a diddle-a-diddle-a-diddle-a-diddle-a-dee.

1233
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,300
Oh, ee.

1234
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,000
Ahhhh.

1235
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:35,720
Froggy went a-courting, he did right.

1236
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,120
He-he-he cramble.

1237
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,040
Froggy went a-courting, he did right.

1238
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:41,500
He-he-he cramble.

1239
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:45,740
Oh, ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

1240
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:51,840
Lob-a-doodle-yellow bug, doodle-lod-a-ding.

1241
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:54,040
Come a-rob-a-bob-a-lod-a-lod, cramble.

1242
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:05,940
Smokeguns

1243
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,860
Smokeguns
