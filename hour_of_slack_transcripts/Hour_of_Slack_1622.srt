1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,000
The Strange Doctor Weird.

2
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,780
Good evening. Come in, won't you?

3
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,120
Why, what's the matter? You seem a bit nervous.

4
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,220
Perhaps the cemetery outside this house is upset you.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,180
But there are things far worse than cemeteries.

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,080
For instance...

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,140
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

8
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,360
All right, fellas, here's your story.

9
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,520
A man by the name of Bob once saved our world with an arc of electricity.

10
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:48,700
Bob?

11
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,840
Is recovering from wounds received in the battle.

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,880
He's got a broken car bone and a bad headache.

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,320
Good.

14
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,980
And now, before giving you the details of the battle,

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,200
I bring you...

16
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:57,640
a warning.

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,180
Every one of you listening to Bob,

18
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,780
tell the world.

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,620
Tell this to everybody, wherever they are.

20
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,400
Under no circumstances take action against Bob.

21
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,120
Watch Bob.

22
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,300
Watch out, he's got a gun!

23
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:10,860
Keep looking.

24
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,560
Watch.

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,640
Keep watching Bob.

26
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,620
Bob, give me a hand.

27
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,980
Hey, anybody around here want some coffee?

28
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,580
No.

29
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,160
Nothing counts except Bob.

30
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:19,840
Watch it.

31
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,440
Anybody want some coffee?

32
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:21,920
No.

33
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:22,980
Then just shut up.

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,400
Watch it.

35
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,020
Mm-hmm.

36
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,120
All right, you hayseys, it's a stick-up!

37
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,140
Everybody freeze.

38
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,160
Everybody down on the ground.

39
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,140
Well, which is it, young feller?

40
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,220
You want I should freeze or get down on the ground?

41
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,820
You mean to say, if I freeze, I can't rightly drop?

42
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,820
And if I drop, I'm going to be in motion.

43
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,900
You see...

44
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,240
Shut up!

45
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,400
Okay, then.

46
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,620
Now for our next experiment.

47
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:57,300
Ah, Bob.

48
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,320
Bob.

49
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,020
Bob.

50
00:01:59,220 --> 00:01:59,620
Bob.

51
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,100
Bob.

52
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:00,800
Bob.

53
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,200
Bob.

54
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,180
Bob.

55
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,100
E.B.

56
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:12,740
Slash?

57
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,680
Where's Chompy?

58
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,360
No.

59
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,760
I'll be alright.

60
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,200
I got the door braced good and there's no outside windows.

61
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,380
But because this would be a great headlining act, of course.

62
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,780
It's kinda limited, but it would pack him in.

63
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,020
And all I've got to say, no, no, this isn't a gag.

64
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,700
folks, I'm telling you, this is

65
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,940
no, no, no

66
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,100
and so the beginning

67
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,880
of the monster movie

68
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,380
itself

69
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,600
it's Incense Around

70
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,080
Super Eastman Cine

71
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,060
Super Sit Around

72
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,220
Dinerama

73
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,700
and Todd A.O.

74
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,120
with all vision

75
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,680
the new miracle of the sea

76
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,960
in IMAX

77
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,780
3D digitally projected

78
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,200
bunion cream

79
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,280
the double entendre

80
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,240
those innuendos all just got to me

81
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,060
272

82
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,400
woofers and tweeters

83
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,740
stapled to the back of the family

84
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,900
oh look what I found

85
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,420
friends we make it back to Ohio

86
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,880
from Texas with Dammit the Hound Dog

87
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,480
who is doing great but this show

88
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,400
is a rerun from 2003

89
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,600
because I have to leave immediately for California

90
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
to do some movie documentary stuff

91
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,720
with the old subgeniuses

92
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,620
who by chance are

93
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,940
in this old episode

94
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,940
including Devo and Dr. Philodrome

95
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,380
this is show number 889

96
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,340
from May of 2003

97
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,960
here we go

98
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,000
well you tell me what's the purpose in this

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,620
you tell me what's the sense

100
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,560
what's the good of it

101
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,220
get lost

102
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,600
a tale told by an idiot

103
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,000
full of sound and fury signifying

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,480
Bob?

105
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,100
how do you suppose that happened?

106
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,680
oh

107
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,600
she dead

108
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,160
goodbye

109
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,080
oh wait a minute

110
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,440
nice going Bob

111
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,440
I was down in Australia

112
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,120
when the Waco debacle ended

113
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,480
the fiery inferno

114
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,660
which we all saw and

115
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,200
I was really bummed I was not here for it

116
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,060
because I thought it was the most fascinating

117
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,320
news story of the year

118
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,620
bar none

119
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,360
and everyone was so pissed off about that guy

120
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,560
because he called himself Jesus

121
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,960
and I was saying come on

122
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,820
the guy's real name is Vernon

123
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,640
let him be Jesus for a couple of months

124
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,720
what's it to ya?

125
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,320
who's gonna follow a messiah named Vernon anyway you know

126
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,280
you gotta call yourself Jesus

127
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,320
it's sort of part of the messiah deal

128
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,400
and Vernon spoke and he spaketh and he sayeth

129
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,280
you know what

130
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,280
let's go get some beer

131
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:43,540
weee

132
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,640
you know Vernon

133
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,480
just doesn't have the necessary spiritual weight that I'm looking for

134
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,640
but anyway

135
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,340
isn't that weird too how everyone snaps in our country and thinks they're Jesus

136
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,800
how come no one ever snaps and thinks they're Buddha

137
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,020
particularly in America where more people resemble Buddha than Jesus

138
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,320
I'm Buddha

139
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,660
you're Bubba

140
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,620
I'm Buddha now

141
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,800
all I gotta do is change two letters on my belt

142
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:22,860
Bubba

143
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,420
Buddha

144
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,600
Vernon's a false prophet

145
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
isn't that weird though

146
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,200
you know

147
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,120
and all it's funny

148
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,680
it was real funny

149
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,040
because these Australians had a big contingency in the compound that burned down

150
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,200
and they were of course curious

151
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,940
and I'm from Texas

152
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,320
and I actually went to the compound the seventh day of the siege

153
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,560
because it was right outside of Austin

154
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,260
and I went to it but

155
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,820
these people in Australia were like

156
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,520
oh Bill isn't he such an oddball

157
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,440
isn't he so odd

158
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,780
he's such a strange character

159
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,840
and I'm thinking

160
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,100
well

161
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,740
let's think about this

162
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,160
frustrated rock guitarist

163
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,280
with a messianic complex

164
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,740
armed to the teeth

165
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,240
trying to fuck everything in skirts

166
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,400
I don't know how to tell you all this but

167
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,380
sounds like every one of my friends

168
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,300
I'm waiting for the Eric Johnson compound to come out

169
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:25,660
you know

170
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,300
I don't know

171
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,560
I don't think Eric's frustrated but

172
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,580
but anyway

173
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,220
and they said you know they had to break down the compound

174
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,180
because child abuse was stepping up

175
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,580
well that's true

176
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,860
how come we don't see Bradley Tanks knocking down Catholic churches

177
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,340
you know I mean if in fact

178
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,500
child abuse is

179
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,620
your concern

180
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,580
actually folks I don't know if any of you have seen this

181
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,280
there's a tape kind of bootleg going around

182
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,860
of showing film of the Bradley Tanks

183
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,920
not knocking as the official story was

184
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,620
small holes to insert tear gas

185
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,940
but crashing the building off of its fucking foundation

186
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,820
and fire shooting out of the tanks

187
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,360
the FBI and the ATF are liars and murderers

188
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,540
and Janet Reno and President Clinton

189
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,960
either A knowingly passed on a lie

190
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,300
or B are so out of touch with their own fucking arms of their government

191
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,280
that they're incompetent

192
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,540
including me

193
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,240
and I think that Clinton should be impeached immediately

194
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,180
case fucking closed

195
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,780
and y'all have probably seen the footage

196
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,000
but it's sort of different than the official story isn't it

197
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,240
small holes tear gas

198
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,480
giant holes flamethrowers

199
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,020
they burn these people in their homes

200
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:36,940
okay

201
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,120
that's our government

202
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,900
okay

203
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,340
I've seen the tape and it's fucking real

204
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,660
and whatever

205
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,900
make your own conclusions

206
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,700
you haven't seen it so it's you know whatever

207
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,320
but old Clinton

208
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,600
you know there's I have no illusions about these cocksuckers

209
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,720
I know there's 12 guys who run the fucking world

210
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,740
and they own every company

211
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,960
and you know it's it's it's fact

212
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,900
you can look it up

213
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,180
I'm not a conspiracy nut

214
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,380
this is all on paper

215
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:07,280
there really are 22 families who run and own 50% of the mainstream media

216
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,020
which is where we get our news

217
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,380
and and it's true

218
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,120
it's a fact

219
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,080
you can look it up

220
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,380
I don't you know I I can't be this big of an asshole without having the truth to back me up

221
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,400
otherwise I'd be a fucking nut doing this

222
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,360
but see if you have the truth with you you can do this

223
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,980
gee I'm starting to sound like Koresh aren't I

224
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,320
fuck

225
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,380
people have often said I remind them of Koresh

226
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,620
I'm like Koresh only without the guns or pussy

227
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,800
so basically

228
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,280
I'm just an annoying fellow

229
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:38,960
but uh

230
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,100
and frustrated rock guitarist too

231
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,300
whatever I told you it was a dumb thing

232
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:49,580
I'm in the mirror

233
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,460
whatever I showed you it was all a lie

234
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,960
better be careful someone might hear you

235
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,140
the walls have ears and the sky has eyes

236
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,060
whatever I said you were on the dream

237
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,660
what you want better than all you gotta do

238
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,140
is open up your eyes

239
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,360
and you'll wake up

240
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:19,920
screaming

241
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,240
and you realize it's all come true

242
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,100
hush now

243
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,380
don't you believe it

244
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,460
cover your head and close your eyes now

245
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,380
take it or leave it

246
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,520
go back to bed now

247
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,140
don't you cry

248
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,960
we're going to work

249
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,020
at the fall

250
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,040
chicken

251
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,700
Don't you wonder who the mind of man

252
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,800
What if you could have been there on that day in Dallas

253
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,500
What if you could wrestle back the hands of time

254
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,400
Maybe something could have been done in Memphis

255
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,060
We wouldn't be living in a dreamless dive

256
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,800
Hush now, don't you believe it

257
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,260
Cover your head and close your eyes now

258
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,360
Take it or leave it, go back to bed now

259
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,940
Don't you cry

260
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,640
Go on, tell yourself again there are no secrets

261
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,080
Go on, tell yourself that you don't wanna know

262
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,200
It's best that you believe you don't hear

263
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,580
The footsteps that follow you around no matter where you go

264
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,040
Maybe you're thinking that you're not alone

265
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,040


266
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,000
And it didn't matter

267
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,280
Maybe you believe nobody else will care

268
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,160
But once you've added every little lie together

269
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,660
You finally find the truth that's always waiting there

270
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,040
It should be painfully obvious to everyone around us by now

271
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,880
that, you know, we're nearing

272
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,480
The end times for sure now

273
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,860
It's not just a joke anymore

274
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,460
We're getting closer to the end times

275
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,840
What are you doing about it?

276
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,240
You still going to work or school?

277
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,740
Coming home to goof around?

278
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,880
Watching the war all day?

279
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,620
What will happen to your routine when all the

280
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,100
The beep comes down on us at once?

281
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,680
What are you gonna do then?

282
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:22,160
Don't you feel responsible for trying to help this endangered planet?

283
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,360
Danger

284
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,620
No?

285
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,400
Good!

286
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,720
Fact is, it's too late anyway

287
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,540
So, you know, you just need to have a good time

288
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,780
And look for the place where you can get the most slack

289
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,300
Ah, once again, these words were written so many years ago

290
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,880
When we were such innocent children

291
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,420
Such childish, small, tiny children

292
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,680
Now a little good Christian as one half pulled it out of his bosom

293
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,080
Began to try it now

294
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,160
One half amazed

295
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,880
Breakout, breakout, breakout

296
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,300
Passed from giant, giant, giant wreck bosom

297
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,300
Pluck it out of thy bosom and try, try, try

298
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,640
Breakout, breakout, breakout, breakout

299
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,600
From heaven

300
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,820
Overthrow both myself

301
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,020
That is good news, good brother

302
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:14,020
Did you ever have any negative experiences with Christians who would condemn you because of your behavior?

303
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,160
Jesus went through it

304
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,500
We're actively trying to destroy God

305
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,540
You can't walk, stand, or sit with those who are not walking in the spirit

306
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,020
We're throwing babies

307
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,220
You don't catch flat

308
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,260
I totally disregarded God

309
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,720
You're going to be called everything but a child of God

310
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,340
We're totally normal and natural and

311
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,500
Jerry, that's my feeling

312
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,560
I think we've just seen the antechamber to terror

313
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,640
We haven't even begun to see what we can do to the major population

314
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,240
God has got to take a lot of blame for this

315
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,660
Let Christ be hanged

316
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,920
And I know I'll hear from them for this

317
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,460
But God has got to bear some burden for this

318
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,200
Because God will not be mocked

319
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,200
And when we destroy 40 million little innocent Democrats, I'll be mocked too

320
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,200


321
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,340
And Republicans, God will point the thing in their face

322
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:06,640
In other words, I point the thing in their face and say, you pagans, you abortionists, and the feminists throwing little innocent babies out of the school

323
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,680
Out on the steps of the school

324
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,660
The pagans

325
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,660
Jesus knows everything about you

326
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,620
The abortionists

327
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,820
He knows who you are

328
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,520
The feminists

329
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,080
Where you live

330
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,440
The gays and the lesbians

331
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,480
Everything you've done

332
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,940
Tried to secularize America

333
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,600
So there's no sense in trying to hide

334
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,520
All of them

335
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,000
You might as well confess it

336
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,420
You've got to take a lot of blame for this

337
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,320
In other words, God has got to take a lot of blame for this

338
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,280
As I fought off the enemy of the feather duster of modern evangelism

339
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,540
It's as though God said

340
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,220
You know, brother, you're talking about most of my relatives

341
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,860
Well, what are you doing?

342
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,220
Let me challenge you as to the validity of your salvation

343
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,460
I want the babies in their face and say, you babies, you helped this happen

344
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,760
And I know I make the gays mad

345
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,040
I really destroyed the nation on its knees

346
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,020
Examine yourself and see if you're in the faith

347
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,860
We're totally Christ haters

348
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,080
Pat, did you notice yesterday

349
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,960
Democrats and Republicans got lifestyle

350
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,280
As they called out to God in prayer and sang

351
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,380
God, let the ACLU be hanged

352
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,060
Let the ACLU be hanged

353
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,140
Let the ACLU be hanged

354
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:10,220
I saw Jesus in the morning in the burning bush

355
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,700
I saw Jesus in the afternoon too

356
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,560
I saw Jesus at dinner time screaming in the school

357
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,680
That Jesus is everywhere

358
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,340
When I saw Jesus in the morning in the burning bush

359
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,980
I saw Jesus in the afternoon too

360
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,860
I saw Jesus at dinner time screaming in the school

361
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,100
That Jesus is everywhere

362
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,560
Jesus down by the riverbed

363
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,820
Jesus laying down by me

364
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,660
Jesus down by the riverbed

365
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,580
Jesus by the riverbed

366
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,980
Jesus came into me

367
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,760
Jesus by the riverbed

368
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,060
Jesus laying down by me

369
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,520
Jesus by the riverbed

370
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,320
Jesus came into me

371
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,760
I saw Jesus in the morning in the burning bush

372
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,220
I saw Jesus in the afternoon too

373
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:28,120
I saw Jesus at dinner time screaming in the school

374
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,280
That Jesus is everywhere

375
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,740
God has failed many times

376
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,680
Now think about this

377
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,320
In God's economic system

378
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,840
There is no woman

379
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,520
But when she released her thing

380
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,860
That meal began to gurgle

381
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,220
So plant your seed in the Lamb of God

382
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:51,860
Plant it

383
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,280
Let that meal experience the benefit of that seed

384
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,280
That's 10% of your cup

385
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,340
It belongs in the Lamb of God

386
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,220
Leviticus 20 and 30 says

387
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,660
The meal is the Lord

388
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,000
Hallelujah to that gurgle

389
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,680
I want to say that again

390
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,220
The meal is no woman

391
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,160
The meal is the Lord

392
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,100
Your thing belongs in the Lamb of God

393
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,980
Hallelujah to that gurgle

394
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,980
You know, Boogie Boy

395
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,720
Who used to be the Devil Boy

396
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,920
Has been reborn

397
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,200
And he's coming out tonight, people

398
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,520
He is here tonight

399
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,160
And he is coming to sing with Devil

400
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,160
Hi there, little bitch

401
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,080
You know

402
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,080
We used to do Devil music here

403
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,540
Like that band Devoe

404
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,820
But then

405
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,020
Jerry over here

406
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,460
He sat down on a Bobby Dylan record

407
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,020
And the Lord came into him

408
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,880
And now we do

409
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,300
Music alone

410
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,160
You might be an ambassador

411
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,180
To England or France

412
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,500
You might like to gamble

413
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,520
You might like to dance

414
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,980
You might be the heavyweight

415
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,620
Champion of the world

416
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,060
You might be a socialite

417
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,160
With a long string of pearls

418
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,680
But you gotta serve somebody

419
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,040
Yes, you've got to serve somebody

420
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,880
Well, it may be the Devil

421
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,300
Or it may be the Lord

422
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,860
But you gotta serve somebody

423
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,300
Well, you might be up on Grokker

424
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,320
Dancing on the stage

425
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,600
Money, money, money

426
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:15,600


427
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:15,600


428
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:15,600


429
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,140
Drugs in your command

430
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,320
Women in a cage

431
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,560
You might be a businessman

432
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,440
A high-colonic freak

433
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,520
They might call you doctor

434
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,560
And they might call you chief

435
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,500
But you gotta serve somebody

436
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,820
Serve somebody

437
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,060
Yes, you've got to serve somebody

438
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:38,900
Serve somebody

439
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,640
Well, it might be the Devil

440
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,120
And it might be the Lord

441
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,700
But you gotta serve somebody

442
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,040
Serve somebody

443
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,620
Serve somebody

444
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,040
Well, you might be a state trooper

445
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,000
Or another kind of jerk

446
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,320
You might be the president

447
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,820
Of some big TV network

448
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,040
You might be rich or poor

449
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,080
You might be blind or lame

450
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,260
You might be living in another country

451
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,180
Underneath another name

452
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,680
But you gotta serve somebody

453
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,420
Serve somebody

454
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,400
Yes, you've gotta serve somebody

455
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,500
Serve somebody

456
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,220
Well, it might be the Devil

457
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,760
Or it might be the Lord

458
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,700
But you gotta serve somebody

459
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,740
Serve somebody

460
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,880
Serve somebody

461
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,880
Serve somebody

462
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,920
Serve somebody

463
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,940
Serve somebody

464
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,120
Serve somebody

465
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,920
Serve somebody

466
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,260
Serve somebody

467
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:40,280
Serve somebody

468
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,580
Serve somebody

469
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,680
Serve somebody

470
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:43,680


471
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:43,680


472
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:43,680


473
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:43,680


474
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:43,680


475
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,780
Say it, somebody.

476
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,820
Say it, somebody.

477
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,820
Say it, somebody.

478
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,180
Say it, somebody, boogie.

479
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,940
Say it, somebody.

480
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:13,640
Say it, somebody.

481
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,840
You gotta serve somebody.

482
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,340
Yes, you gotta serve somebody.

483
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,460
Well, it might be the devil and it might be the Lord,

484
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,060
but you gotta serve somebody.

485
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,040
You gotta serve somebody.

486
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,020
I said you serve somebody.

487
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,100
You gotta serve somebody.

488
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,340
Bye-bye.

489
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,380
Bye-bye, Long Beach.

490
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,100
Praise the Lord.

491
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,840
Thank you.

492
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,140
Praise God, brothers and sisters.

493
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,880
At some point, they looked at Bob's face and said,

494
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,220
That guy's cool.

495
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,380
I don't know why.

496
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,700
Maybe he's kitschy.

497
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,440
Maybe he's calf.

498
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,500
Maybe he really just looks good looking.

499
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,000
Maybe he really looks like your dad.

500
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,300
Maybe it's simply that he is Bob.

501
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,680
And that face is the center of the luck plane.

502
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,920
Why not?

503
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:10,900
Does anything else make any more sense, really, when you get down to it?

504
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,740
Math, maybe.

505
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,560
But then that breaks down on the quantum level.

506
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,860
So, you know, is there any way to truly have slack?

507
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:28,660
There's an old prayer, a subgenius prayer by Reverend Lemuel Atom

508
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,340
that goes,

509
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:36,840
Dobbs, grant me the serenity to endure the pinks and humans I cannot kill,

510
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:40,660
the courage to stuff the ones I can,

511
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,420
and the wisdom not to do it when the cops are around.

512
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,360
Praise Bob!

513
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,940
Praise Bob!

514
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,000
Praise Bob.

515
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,760
Bob, you see, we have left some aliens,

516
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,840
or they don't even know one.

517
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,240
This one's true living.

518
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,500
Like my turf.

519
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,560
Was this true?

520
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,220
So now they hope you can pass through the lockdown

521
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,840
though you define into heaven.

522
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,620
He's never named those who are like this.

523
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,040
What?

524
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,320
Praise Bob.

525
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,340
The man's a frog.

526
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:17,500
I'm a hopping toad in the mud of the freaking Valkyries of Siegfried.

527
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,980
He's a real man.

528
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,220
He's a giant man.

529
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,000
He's Paul Bunyan.

530
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,200
He's a giant accident.

531
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,360
Bob, Bob, Bob's a real man.

532
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,740
When are you going to let me out of this box?

533
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,420
You know, Bob is like the Elvis of gurus.

534
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,980
Have you ever thought about it that way?

535
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,760
Yes, since he has left the building.

536
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,320
But he keeps reappearing.

537
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,360
People know that he lives up there in Minnesota,

538
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,900
somewhere in a trailer park disguised as a garbage carrier.

539
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,840
Lesson two tells us conservation and transmutation.

540
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,540
He is sluggish and slow.

541
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,220
Really? The tropical Bob is?

542
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,180
Abundance.

543
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,920
Tropical, uh, topical, uh, popsicle Bob is just the same.

544
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,880
Slowness and sluggishness.

545
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,840
According to Dr. Fulatuthu Nagasawi of Aido University.

546
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,320
Forgive me, Lord.

547
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,420
I already know too much.

548
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,540
This is a place for crazy people.

549
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,700
I'm not crazy.

550
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,980
We don't use that term, crazy, Mr. Cole.

551
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,780
We've got some real nuts here.

552
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,820
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

553
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,020
You say you don't know Bob, honey.

554
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,040
Why, there ain't nothing to it.

555
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,200
All you got to do is be Bob.

556
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,360
Be Bob.

557
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,420
Be Bob.

558
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,420
Be Bob.

559
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,320
Be Bob.

560
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,500
Be Be Bob.

561
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,640
Be Be Bob.

562
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,600
Be Bob.

563
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,860
Be Bob.

564
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,680
Be Bob.

565
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,640
Be Bob.

566
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,040
Be Bob.

567
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,220
Be Bob.

568
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:02,220


569
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:02,860
Be Be Bob.

570
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,440
Be Be Bob.

571
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,540
At last, it's come down to this now.

572
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,900
The final do-it-yourself end times religion.

573
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,460
Capital A.

574
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,480
Swinging mutants and terminal abnormals.

575
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,100
S.

576
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:12,820
H.

577
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,960
Even morons know these are the end times.

578
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,000
Welcome to the end times.

579
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:25,340
But Reverend Howe, Reverend Howe, people ask this question of me all the time.

580
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,560
Do I really need to remain entirely human any longer?

581
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:34,040
I'm sorry, your humanity must be abnegated and proscribed.

582
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:39,340
For in the wonder world of tomorrow, it will no longer be an asset and may actually prove

583
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,500
a hindrance.

584
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:45,600
Children ask me, can I stay a teenager while mastering the appearance of adulthood?

585
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:52,660
If the child has a secure lock on his door, he may master what he likes in the privacy

586
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,200
of his atelier.

587
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,340
It is now 417 AM.

588
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,380
Will I be able to turn water into gasoline?

589
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,620
You may be able to gasify more than water.

590
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,840
Look at that word, such genius.

591
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,100
Anybody could qualify.

592
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,860
It has nothing to do with brains.

593
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,260
That is correct.

594
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:09,320


595
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:09,320


596
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:09,320


597
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:09,320


598
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:09,320


599
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:09,320


600
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:09,320


601
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:09,320


602
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:09,320


603
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:09,320


604
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,140
It's not intelligence, it's how you use it.

605
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,380
Once again, Dr. Drummond's sentiments are elevated and correct.

606
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:20,320
A subgenius has nothing to do with genius itself.

607
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,120
One chuckle is worth four claps.

608
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,220
They don't have to hear me.

609
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,800
There's nobody home.

610
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,500
When I'm clear, I'm not a lot of help.

611
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,580
If someone's in trouble, I can be here.

612
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,720
I was very confused.

613
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,380
I'm going to go there.

614
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,920
For you, Angel.

615
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,240
I'm going to hell when I die.

616
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,920
I like to see how I'm brainwashing myself.

617
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,860
Yeah, I could go to hell when I die.

618
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,760
Whose business are you in?

619
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,400
Everything you said, I'm turning it around as you speak.

620
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,400
I'm going to hell.

621
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,040
If I am chaotic, that's very powerful.

622
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,720
When you die, you're going to go to hell.

623
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,300
It feels like I'm going to hell.

624
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:39,300


625
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:39,300


626
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,340
It feels right brainwashing myself.

627
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,060
I'll hold your hand.

628
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,020
We'll go talk to the government.

629
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,420
How's that?

630
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,860
I'm not so interested in myself.

631
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,380
I'm going to teach them more chaos.

632
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,580
I'm physically and emotionally available.

633
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:11,580


634
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:11,580


635
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,240
I'm so physically and emotionally available.

636
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,300
I'm so physically and emotionally available.

637
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,520
When you're scared, how does it feel when you're frightened?

638
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,560
Are you un-won?

639
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,980
Yes, you've won a fabulous eight-hour day chained to this machine.

640
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,560
That's right, wage slavery, my friends, it's here, it's going to stay, and you are its

641
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,480
champion matrix.

642
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:39,980
You are number one on the poop scale, and you're the top of the heap.

643
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,760
Yes, computers are amazing time savers, aren't they?

644
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,420
But you can go in here, my friend.

645
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,780
No, no, I don't want to go in there.

646
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,680
Oh, yes, just take a quick look at it.

647
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,160
Flowers are so beautiful.

648
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,040
No, that's not for me.

649
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,440
This is the nature garden, my friend.

650
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,360
You have nothing to fear but fear itself.

651
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:02,860
It's okay.

652
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,660
Remember, fear is attracted to fearful things.

653
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,280
It is attracted to strength.

654
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,320
It is attracted to weakness, power, lack of power.

655
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,740
It is attracted to milk.

656
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,740
It is attracted to sex.

657
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:13,740


658
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:13,740


659
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:13,740


660
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:13,740


661
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:13,740


662
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:13,740


663
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,640
It is attracted to sour hot dogs.

664
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,160
It is attracted to French fries.

665
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:16,320
I'm afraid.

666
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,060
You're scaring me, man.

667
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,880
Oh, jeez of the idiot.

668
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,000
Are you afraid of me?

669
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,540
You are just disgusted by my presents.

670
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:30,080
I think they're nice presents.

671
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,300
I feel shame.

672
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,640
Don't feel obscene.

673
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,940
No one here hates your bowels.

674
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:43,380
We like the presents you brought to us today, Mr. Hyster-Physter, Mr. Grease-Lightning.

675
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:43,740
How are you?

676
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,740


677
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,740


678
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,740


679
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,740


680
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,740


681
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,740


682
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,740


683
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,740


684
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,740


685
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,740


686
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,740


687
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,740


688
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,740


689
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,740


690
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,900
Are you going to get out?

691
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,180
You are not going to drag me outside?

692
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,180


693
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,180


694
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,180


695
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,180


696
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,180


697
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,180


698
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,180


699
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,180


700
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,360
And your name is?

701
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,600
Gwendoline, get the antidote.

702
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,360
Oh, Gwendoline, give him the antidote, please.

703
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,880
Just put it in his neck.

704
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,460
Take a deep breath.

705
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,660
Give me.

706
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,740
No, no, no, please, sir.

707
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,700
Take a deep breath.

708
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:54,760
Gwendoline.

709
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,140
Please hurry up.

710
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,720
He is getting out of his loo.

711
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,100
Give me the antidote or kill me!

712
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:04,840
At the first sign of betrayal, I will kill him, but I promise to return the body intact.

713
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,540
That's all right. There is no synchronicity, my friend.

714
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:12,280
Things aren't going around in a neat circle. Don't worry.

715
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,180
We've got to crack the Lucite to get this body out of here.

716
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,780
We can bring Bob back to life if we can just crack him out of this Lucite.

717
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:24,560
I don't think so, my friend. This Lucite was made in 1998 at the propaganda units in Fort Meade.

718
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,840
You will never break through.

719
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,620
He said on the 20th anniversary of my death, you must break me out of the Lucite and I will smoke again.

720
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:37,660
He was drinking with Ronald Reagan in those days. You will not get him out. I'm afraid he is trapped forever.

721
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:41,140
We will lose him from the Lucite. We will lose him from the Lucite.

722
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,000
If you obey me, you will survive.

723
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,720
The exorcist will come in.

724
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,120
Get your hand off that switch, Tubby.

725
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,560
It's not really his voice. It is just a warning.

726
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,060
I am a machine vastly superior to you.

727
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,220
Oh, now you have him afraid of you.

728
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,180
Yes, Lord.

729
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,140
Yes, Lord.

730
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,020
Lord, down on your campuses.

731
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,860
I must reach oxygen switch.

732
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,840
Get down.

733
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,840
Think of the evildoers as mole people who cannot see the light.

734
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,260
Their eyes are too blind.

735
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,200
And think of Jesus as a superhero.

736
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,760
These people are crazy.

737
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,020
Must get knife out of boot.

738
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,700
They're sacrificing that girl.

739
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,700
This is horrible.

740
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,840
They're throwing her into the bowl of that giant pipe.

741
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:21,880
Oh, wait.

742
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:25,060
That's just a crappy special effect.

743
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,680
Wait a minute.

744
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,320
This is all...

745
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:27,540
Hey, man.

746
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:27,620
Hey, man.

747
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,520
Get your hands off my sex.

748
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,500
These rocks are brighter than they say.

749
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:29,540


750
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:29,920
That's my sex, Tummy.

751
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,040
Man, that's my sex, Tummy.

752
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:31,500
Those are...

753
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,220
Go get your...

754
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,100
Mad men of Borneo?

755
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,560
Those are...

756
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,420
Go get your own plastic girlfriend, buddy.

757
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:35,760
Guys in Hollywood make up.

758
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,640
This is...

759
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,000
What the...

760
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,340
What the...

761
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,200
The choice is yours.

762
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,080
Obey me and live or disobey and die.

763
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,920
You are a slave, Neo.

764
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,360
Like everyone else, you were born into bondage.

765
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,360
Born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch.

766
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,080
A prison for your mind.

767
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,120
A prison for your mind.

768
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:55,120


769
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,940
Freedom is more easily than money.

770
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,620
Freedom is a hard thing to do.

771
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,480
It's so much easier to be a slave.

772
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,220
And you can be a slave for Bob.

773
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,520
You don't have to think anymore.

774
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,400
You can just give your life to Bob.

775
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,840
So get in line.

776
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,880
You don't need to sign.

777
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,680
And forget about freedom.

778
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,680
Become a sub-Denny right now.

779
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,880
Freedom is something that's for people that want it.

780
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,160
We don't want that thing.

781
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,160
We want to go ahead and have the slavery that we know that is the true slavery under Bob.

782
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,780
Does Bob offer freedom from terror?

783
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,780
Bob offers you no freedom.

784
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,300
Bob offers you the terror of the gods.

785
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:30,780
Unrestricted, unsullied, and undiminished by any censors of the 20th century.

786
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:38,840
But Bob does encourage a cheerful mockery of fearmongering on the official level from the conspiracy's reeking bowels.

787
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,840
Monger mockers.

788
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,840
That's us.

789
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,120
Correct.

790
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,360
We find no fanatic.

791
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:49,100
This is a fanatical attack against fanaticism.

792
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,300
Mocker mongers.

793
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,080
Well, now I'm not sure I like this.

794
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,280
You love James Bohlen, right?

795
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:54,280


796
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:54,280


797
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:54,280


798
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:54,280


799
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:54,280


800
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,700
That's the word for this week, obviously.

801
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:01,780
Where ever you go, there you are.

802
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,520
That's something Davey.

803
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,960
He's still trying to figure that out.

804
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,180
That's deep.

805
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:05,480
That's kind of a sentiment.

806
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,540
It's like chasing your tail.

807
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,240
They have that in there.

808
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,280
You can't look at your own eye.

809
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,920
At the mechanic store where I go to, there's a little thing above the door that says thimp

810
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,180
and it also says, wherever you go, that's where you are.

811
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,260
Bob wrote both of those slogans, you know, in the old ...

812
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,920
Oh, that was his major employment slogan.

813
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,040
activity at the time he used to just write up slogans they'd print them up and sell them to

814
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:33,140
these novelty uh distributors i remember him back then he was quite different than he is now

815
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:39,340

00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:37,500
underscore

Neuroman? Yes, Neuroman. How's the virus?

865
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,640
Darn thing just seems to hang on.

866
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,660
I think I'll have to stay home again today.

867
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,720
No problem. Bob's here.

868
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,360
Oh, Bob? Who's Bob?

869
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,580
He's the account temp's temporary I brought in.

870
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,460
You know, I think this thing's starting to break up.

871
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,520
I could probably be in about noon.

872
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,540
What do you think? No, don't worry. Bob and I

873
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,740
are doing just fine.

874
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,200
The name of the game is

875
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,020
Ball Buster.

876
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,940
It's a family game.

877
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,240
Fun for children.

878
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,480
And for adults, it's exciting.

879
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,160
You make strategic offensive

880
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,780
and defensive moves.

881
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:34,440
Then try to bust your opponent's balls.

882
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,860
It's as easy as checkers.

883
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,800
But it's acting like pool.

884
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,360
You're a ball buster.

885
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,260
Ball Buster.

886
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,200
A great new game

887
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,240
from Hogan.

888
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,440
Let me have your attention

889
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,080
for a moment.

890
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,240
Are they all here? All but one.

891
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,260
But I'm going anyway. Let's talk about

892
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,060
something important.

893
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,300

894
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:04,780
real estate?

895
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,120
It takes brass.

896
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,820
Balls to sell real estate.

897
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,000
Because we're adding a little something to this month's

898
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,680
sales contest.

899
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,960
First prize is a Cadillac Eldorado.

900
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,220
Anybody want to see second prize?

901
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,140
Second prize is a set of steak knives.

902
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,820
Third prize is you're fired.

903
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,100
Hit the bricks.

904
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,060
Hit the bricks.

905
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,880
You hear me, you fucking faggots?

906
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,960
Hit the bricks.

907
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:29,900
Hit the bricks.

908
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,040

Brass ball.

911
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,660
Convert that motherfucker, Sally.

912
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,140
Make him sign the check.

913
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,260
Know what it takes to sell real estate?

914
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,500
Brass ball.

915
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,220
Get them to sign on the line, which is dotted.

916
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,660
My wife filled in a form.

917
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,400
Get them to sign.

918
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:54,200
And we have been played for the last year.

919
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,200
Get them to sign.

920
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,100
I don't want to buy land.

921
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,020
I don't want to invest in land.

922
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,440
I have nothing.

923
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,340
Nothing.

924
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:01,820
Nothing.

925
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,480
Hit the bricks.

926
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,300
Know what it takes to sell real estate?

927
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,640
Beat it.

928
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,360
Hit the bricks.

Know what it takes to sell real estate?

930
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:09,880
We are going out.

931
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:10,480
Beat it.

932
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,280
Fuck you.

933
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,360
I'll fuck you!

934
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,440
That's my message.

935
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,300
Fuck the lot of you.

936
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,040
Hit the bricks.

937
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:15,960
Hit the bricks.

938
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,540
You are going out.

939
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,240
I can't make a goddamn dollar with these leads.

940
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,240
With these leads.

941
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,060
I can't make a goddamn dollar with these leads.

942
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,600
With these, with these leads.

943
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,980
These leads are shit.

944
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,020
They couldn't buy a fucking toaster, they're broke.

945
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,140
They're deadbeats.

946
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:31,920
Deadbeats.

947
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,280
Woo!

948
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,320
Hey.

949
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:34,720
Hey.

950
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,240
Hey.

951
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,880
Hey, you listen to me.

952
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:39,960
Hey, I closed that cocksucker, cocksucker.

953
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,280
I don't think so, shell.

954
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,100
I think you fucked up my office.

955
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,660
I think you're going away.

956
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:46,860
Cocksucker, cocksucker.

957
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,380
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

958
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,820
I don't care whose nephew you are, whose dick you're sucking on, sucking on.

959
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,580
You are shit.

960
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,580
Fuck the lot of you.

961
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,960
You are going out.

962
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:59,160
Go to lunch, go to lunch, go to lunch.

963
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,340
Fuck the lot of you.

964
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,920
Go to lunch, go to lunch, go to lunch.

965
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,140
Brass ball.

966
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:04,960
Hit the bricks.

967
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,720
Know what it takes to sell real estate.

968
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,460
I'm going out.

969
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,100
Hit it.

970
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:08,780
Hit the bricks.

971
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,540
Know what it takes to sell real estate.

972
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,360
I'm going out.

973
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:11,940
Hit it.

974
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:12,820
Fuck the lot of you.

975
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,580
Fuck you, fuck you.

976
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,660
Oh, fuck you.

977
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,380
Hit the bricks, hit the bricks.

978
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:17,660
Eat it.

979
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,000
You are going out.

980
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,780
Put that coffee down.

981
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,540
Where did you learn your trade?

982
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,600
Put that coffee down.

983
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,780
You fairy.

984
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,360
Where did you learn your trade?

985
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,000
Fuck you.

986
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:29,880
Hit the bricks.

987
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,920
You company man.

988
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,260
Where did you learn your trade?

989
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,280
Trade, trade, trade.

990
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,120
It's right there.

991
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,240
You stupid fucking cunt.

992
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:37,660
Fuck.

993
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,180
Fuck.

994
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,800
You stupid fucking cunt.

995
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,720
What you're hired for is to help us.

996
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,880
Not to fuck us up.

997
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,040
Fuck us.

998
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:49,700
Fuck us up.

999
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,020
Hit the bricks.

1000
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,780
Know what it takes to sell real estate?

1001
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,440
Going out.

1002
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,180
Eat it.

1003
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:54,860
Hit the bricks.

1004
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,620
Know what it takes to sell real estate?

1005
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,380
Going out.

1006
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:57,980
Eat it.

1007
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:58,920
Fuck the life of you.

1008
00:42:59,020 --> 00:42:59,640
Fuck you.

1009
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,120
Fuck you.

1010
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:00,400
Fuck you.

1011
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:00,680
You.

1012
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,720
Oh, fuck you.

1013
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,480
Go to lunch.

1014
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,420
Go to lunch.

1015
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,180
Will you go to lunch?

1016
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:05,660
Beat it.

1017
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,380
Coffee.

1018
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:08,540
Beat it.

1019
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,440
No fucking good.

1020
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:11,840
Hey.

1021
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,440
Fuck that shit, George.

1022
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:14,820
Coffee.

1023
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:15,720
Beat it.

1024
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:17,420
Good.

1025
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:17,980
Good.

1026
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:18,520
Good.

1027
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:18,940
Good.

1028
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:19,800
You're fired.

1029
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:33,280
DJ John K's Slackin' Balls, dear friends, sent in by DJ John K.

1030
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:37,740
You are listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1031
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:43,640
Therefore, a subgenius is one who is under his own genius.

1032
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,340
Under his own particular tutelary spirit.

1033
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,240
That is correct.

1034
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:53,820
And technically, this organization cannot exist because it is composed of people who are not joiners.

1035
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:58,160
They are not joiners, tinkers, plumbers, watchmakers, fasteners.

1036
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,340
The only thing most subgeniuses have in common is that they are all different.

1037
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,300
And you can win.

1038
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:11,580
They are firemen on the railroad or milk delivery men, newsboys, winotype operators.

1039
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:14,200
They are insidious rituals aimed at controlling you.

1040
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,660
Regain your lost yeti powers.

1041
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:21,740
I know you know you have them, but you just can't remember how to use them.

1042
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:25,740
You've got to draw deep from within yourself.

1043
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:30,600
And as you undergo the unhallowed rites of glandscaping and acubating,

1044
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,400
forbidden shapes from the inside out.

1045
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,060
The shadows will be called forth.

1046
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:36,500
Okay.

1047
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,860
All right, all right.

1048
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:39,680
Will you relieve?

1049
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,920
It's 422 now.

1050
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,020
You can relieve your energy?

1051
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,080
Yes, time marches on.

1052
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,420
He's launched already.

1053
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,720
He's launched, he's launched.

1054
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,220
Okay, sorry that we were a little bit late there.

1055
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,880
Incredible inventions of free electricity, time travel, death rays, ozone generators,

1056
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,620
unlimited wireless power.

1057
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:01,820
You can look perfectly normal while mentally practicing the lost arts of yin-yang therapy.

1058
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,840
Exploding postman.

1059
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,560
You know, who go off when they deliver the man.

1060
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,420
Not legal in most things.

1061
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,600
Really subgenius rant.

1062
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,960
Radio controlled anti-gravity airships.

1063
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:11,440
Thought machines.

1064
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,940
Unlimited wireless power anywhere on earth.

1065
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,500
All.

1066
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,960
Exalted be the name of Bob.

1067
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,460
Slamb dunk the Dobbs head in you.

1068
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:22,320
Sex and real estate.

1069
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:30,920
I will present to you my seven winner plans for making you a real wiener.

1070
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,380
And it will happen almost every day.

1071
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:34,780
Almost at once.

1072
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:40,720
Of course, like any program, it depends a lot on you.

1073
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:52,660
So order my program that is Eye of the Storm JK 8990 and it retails for $29.98.

1074
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,860
So you take the high road and I'll take the low road.

1075
00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:00,840
But Reverend Howe, I heard an interview by a guy who said that the Church and subgenius was bigger,

1076
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,360
was better than Jesus and bigger than Jesus.

1077
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:05,860
Is that true?

1078
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:10,980
He is a little tiny God and he is a little sinctious plaster God.

1079
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,920
And Bob is a better than Jesus.

1080
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:18,660
But it's only this big and it costs $2.50 at the store.

1081
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:22,460
But it isn't even, I mean, being better than Jesus isn't a big deal anymore.

1082
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:25,900
You have to be better than Allah nowadays.

1083
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:29,260
Can Bob compete with Allah?

1084
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,780
Can Jehovah One compete with Allah?

1085
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:33,360
Can Jehovah One compete with Allah?

1086
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:35,960
Why don't normals care?

1087
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:43,900
Because I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times, none are so blind as those who have no eyes.

1088
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,040
Isn't it true, doctors?

1089
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,740
That is ever the truth that flows from Bob's grinning lips.

1090
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,800
But what's really abnormal and unnatural in normality?

1091
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,820
Maladjustment, I suppose.

1092
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,780
The terrifying thing to me is that whereas the normals cannot become like us,

1093
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:05,720
we can all too easily become like them.

1094
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:10,440
It is literally the next easiest thing in the world to become normal.

1095
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,700
Let us be thankful that we are not as are the normals,

1096
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:18,140
the pinks and the mediocre-tons,

1097
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:23,140
the gimme bobs and bobbies who swarm by the thousand,

1098
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,320
yea, even like unto the sands of the seashore.

1099
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,940
And don't further mongrelize the subgenius race by marrying a human.

1100
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:34,560
Stay away from mating with pinks and other beasts of the field.

1101
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:41,820
Use the normals, yes, even be friends with some of them in order to learn their weaknesses,

1102
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,280
but do not, I repeat, do not cross-fertilize with them.

1103
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:52,160
Bob is breeding his own new humans that are more like the oldest breed, humans with instincts.

1104
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:57,320
The flattening of the personality that comes down with the average conspiracy lifestyle

1105
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:00,640
has suppressed instincts down through the centuries.

1106
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:04,200
The lunar lander opens, the fairy-tube and the math-fixer

1107
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,820
are the only ones who can get to the moon.

1108
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:10,940
Other details include rotating primary combustion engines,

1109
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:16,740
pivoting antennae of a ship, and scale replicas of actual scientific equipment

1110
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,420
based on the lunar circles.

1111
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,160
Civilization for all its fancy trimmings is still just a rickety shack

1112
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,940
pinned in a bottle and leave it on the moon.

1113
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:30,920
With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times a day.

1114
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:31,840
I can even run a ship that's better than any human.

1115
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,120
My situation was truly horrible.

1116
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,920
Then, when all seemed lost, I saw light!

1117
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:47,040
Rumor has it that a yeti has the ability to take possession of your mind.

1118
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:56,900
And they walk upright like humans who have the powers of telepathy.

1119
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,780
And they walk upright like humans who have the powers of telepathy.

1120
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:00,600
And they walk upright like humans who have the powers of telepathy.

1121
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,000
fake

1122
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,000


1123
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,000


1124
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,280
real

1125
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,120
predictable

1126
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:23,780
original

1127
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,960
entertaining

1128
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,820
It's impervious to all poisons.

1129
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:52,580
If it is blown up, its cells will regenerate and multiply and it'll still be alive.

1130
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,780
A creature that will rule the universe.

1131
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:12,960
A spark that distinguishes us from the beasts of the field.

1132
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:30,920
You were just discussing what sort of people you are.

1133
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:31,980
People that are on other planets.

1134
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,700
And they walk up right like humans and have the powers of telepathy.

1135
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,660
So you're reflecting on theULAM.

1136
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:07,080
Dream.

1137
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:13,220
Or are you?

1138
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,520
Personally I'm learning from the

1139
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,280
witching of Inazuma.

1140
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:30,580
You seem to know all about Inazuma.

1141
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,360
Is that what I hear playing in the background?

1142
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:39,080
My ears were ringing after that for hours,

1143
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:42,940
and I thought I had seriously impaired my hearing.

1144
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,520
Did that hurt your ears?

1145
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:50,340
It did. It had made them ring like a full-fledged episode of Tinnitus.

1146
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:55,780
And it wasn't until I woke up the next day that I realized the sensation had departed.

1147
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,580
That's the way I was, man.

1148
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:00,720
But it sort of made it easier to sleep.

1149
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:05,420
It was like the white noise you need to sometimes fall asleep when the dogs are barking.

1150
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,920
The color it was, it was still a noise.

1151
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,540
And the noise that indicates hearing damage.

1152
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:12,480
Disturbia.

1153
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:19,400
I was only one year old when my family moved to Disturbia.

1154
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:23,560
At the ironically named Night of Slack revival in San Francisco,

1155
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,560
we of the Church of the Subgenius have vowed,

1156
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:30,500
to continue our one true great mission.

1157
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:34,120
No amount of religious or political persecution

1158
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:40,320
can sway us from bringing Bob's word to the endangered citizens of this planet.

1159
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:46,320
No mere bullet can stop the word of Dobbs from encircling this tiny globe.

1160
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:52,100
We are continuing his brave Subgenius Prophecy World Crusade with a frenzied hope

1161
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,680
that it's not too late for most of us.

1162
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:57,060
Well, these words were written many years ago,

1163
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:00,920
and now we know that it was indeed too late.

1164
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,920
And it is too late for most of you out there.

1165
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:09,200
Perhaps you listen to this show expecting entertainment or even enlightenment.

1166
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:16,620
If you do, you will be plagued by nightmares of this horrible event for months, if not years,

1167
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,580
and that's just too bad.

1168
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:26,200
Sometimes even Bob can't undo the terrible damage,

1169
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,280
the conspiracy has inflicted.

1170
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:28,740
Yes.

1171
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:34,620
Now if you send away, you can get a soft shot pepper pot pellet fist,

1172
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:37,200
rapid fire, continuous shooting,

1173
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,980
shoot 50 rounds in one loading.

1174
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:46,200
Soft vinyl pellets offer the vinyl solution,

1175
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,700
letting you create exciting indoor-outdoor action.

1176
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:56,180
Set up many targets and see how many you can knock down.

1177
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:00,340
In one loading before they get away.

1178
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,160
Get set.

1179
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:04,940
Get set.

1180
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,640
Get set.

1181
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,180
One pill.

1182
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,640
Do you think that we might be able to ask some more questions?

1183
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:16,020
Yes.

1184
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,320
I asked her if she knew something.

1185
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:19,760
What was her answer?

1186
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,040
Her answer was no.

1187
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:22,240
Yes.

1188
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,380
The answer was no.

1189
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:25,360
Any more questions?

1190
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:26,180
Yes.

1191
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:26,180


1192
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:30,500
No.

1193
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,460
No.

1194
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,360
What is your conclusion, Doctor?

1195
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:46,340
I don't know.

1196
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,980
What are you trying to prove?

1197
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:55,300
Next time, employees will have to do as they are told.

1198
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:56,160
Not only will they know what they are doing,

1199
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,160


1200
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,160


1201
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,160


1202
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,160


1203
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,160


1204
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,160


1205
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,160


1206
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,160


1207
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,160


1208
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,160


1209
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,160


1210
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,160


1211
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,160


1212
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,160


1213
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,160


1214
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,160


1215
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,200
but they will also know what they are doing.

1216
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,660
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

1217
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:07,580
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

1218
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:12,760
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

1219
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:19,460
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

1220
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:21,880
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

1221
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:34,240
That was about ten minutes.

1222
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:34,240


1223
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:34,240


1224
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:35,960
Come on.

1225
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:36,360
I'll fix it.

1226
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:36,780
Come on.

1227
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:37,120
Okay.

1228
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:37,180
Okay.

1229
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:37,220
Come on.

1230
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:37,580
Okay.

1231
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:37,680


1232
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:37,700
Come on.

1233
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:40,120
Okay.

1234
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:40,320
Okay.

1235
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:41,000


1236
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:41,000


1237
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:41,020


1238
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:41,020


1239
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:42,480
Oh, I'm going to go to the bathroom.

1240
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:42,720
Okay.

1241
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:44,380
Okay.

1242
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:44,740


1243
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:49,060
Okay.

1244
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:49,120
Okay.

1245
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:49,180
Okay.

1246
00:55:49,460 --> 00:56:03,880
diamonds are. If you could take me down there, can you give me a ride after the show? You're

1247
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:08,500
not going to tell me what you almost said? Oh no, the show is over. The show's going

1248
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:18,180
to be over very shortly. So now we're here on the train, moving along. Yeehaw! I'll join

1249
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:24,740
you in the club car. It's all so confusing. And now the show, unfortunately, is moving

1250
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:29,940
down the tracks at an unfortunate rate of speed. We'll be pulling into the station and

1251
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:35,460
the next show will begin. I just hope they open the door where I've got my luggage, because

1252
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:40,040
otherwise I'll be stuck on the train. The beautiful show person for the next show is

1253
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:44,040
already here. The band is getting limbered up. They're going to be the first off the

1254
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:47,960
train. And the light times that we know. So really

1255
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,160
amazing.

1256
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:52,860
As we get nearer and nearer to the old place, I feel an absolute tingling in my veins. And

1257
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:57,400
when I step off that train, I'm going to have the biggest, sunniest smile on my face for

1258
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:03,460
that old town. Hey, wipe that smile off your face. In time, soldier, in time. Don't deprive

1259
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:09,140
me of this wonderful moment. Let me prolong it. Okay, all right. Stretch it out there.

1260
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:16,940
Smile on my way to freedom. Smile on. Smile when you're smiling. With this rictus of

1261
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:17,260
flexibility.

1262
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,060
Somebody smile.

1263
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:20,920
I'm smiling with you. I don't know about the whole world, but...

1264
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:33,100
Bob is smiling with you. Well, at you is probably more like it. Yes, I, Stang, am giving credits

1265
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:39,780
now, because it seemed to flow, and I didn't want to interrupt it this time. But the new

1266
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:48,160
titles we heard this week were by Reverend Artemia Salina, and then several collages.

1267
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:57,640
By the great Fernanda Nande, Lee Murr. The amazing story of the Waco debacle was told

1268
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:06,860
by the late Bill Hicks from a bootleg, and that was followed by the song Conspiracy Theory

1269
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:18,140
from the album Jerusalem by Steve Earle. Puzzling evidence with Dr. Howell and Dr. Philo Drummond.

1270
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:27,380
Of course, lots of that there from KPFA and Berkley. Devo did I Saw Jesus, and also that

1271
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:34,820
great version of Gotta Serve Somebody. That was when Devo was Dove, a Christian band.

1272
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:42,200
You heard me preaching at Winterstar, and tons of ESO Swamp Radio live from WCSB Cleveland

1273
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:46,920
with Chaz Smith, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Princess Wee, and me.

1274
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:55,020
Brainwashing collages, friends, from the usual gang of idiots at alt.binaries.slack.

1275
00:58:55,140 --> 00:59:02,580
Notably, this time, Reverend Cobblestone and Reverend Jarto. Cobblestone did the longer

1276
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:08,460
ones, and Reverend Jarto did the shorter ones, and Lee Murr did the most ones. Praise Bob.

1277
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:15,640
This is the Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius. You can get more information

1278
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:16,900
about Bob and Lee Murr at the end of the show. Thank you for watching. I'll see you next

1279
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:16,900


1280
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:16,900


1281
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:17,280
time.

1282
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:58,320
Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob Paul! Don't let

1283
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:10,500
yourself get hysterical. Bobhead! Bobbob! Bobhead! Bobhead! Uh oh. Well, bye now. Stop

1284
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:10,620
it!

1285
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,220
I can't hold on.
