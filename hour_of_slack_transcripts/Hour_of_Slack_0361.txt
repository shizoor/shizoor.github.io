And thank you so, so very much.
What?
What happened?
Are you doing kind of trouble here?
Well, I don't know why you people seem to think this is magic.
It's just this little chromium switch here.
We must admit frankly and honestly that something is very wrong.
Listen.
Now, wait a minute.
I can't change attitudes.
I didn't apologize.
I didn't apologize.
Don't touch my bags, if you please, Mr. Customsman.
This is the sound of my brain.
Then I said, this is the sound of my brain on Don Henley.
Then I said.
What about Slack?
That's your key phrase.
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.
And now, the self-genius, our boss, Slack.
Yes, dear friends.
Well, we're back.
I think that's plenty loud there.
Forever in stange.
Well, yeah, you can hear little machines running under it.
Oh, pledge away.
Well, dear friends, welcome back.
Oh, we need the background music, or it's not like a regular show.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes, dear friends.
Welcome back to another subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack.
It's so nice to be back with you.
And our special guests here, Dr. Philo Drummond on vocals,
and Dr. Snavely Eklund on disintegrated.
And with a special second microphone that has,
it's the most naked, naked microphone for your naked ears and your naked soul.
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Well, what now, Dr. Drummond?
Well, you're the one that invited me here.
We came here to do a show.
I know.
You said, if you come on the show, I'll play the Swingin' Love Corpses for you.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
That's what you said.
You told me if I came here, that's what you'd do.
Oh, no, no.
It was like a...
And tonight, we've got in our studios Dr. Philo Drummond from the Swingin' Love Corpses.
They're going to be on tour for the next six months.
You'll be...
Yeah, man.
Yeah, yeah.
You'll be hearing about them everywhere.
Yeah, we're on tour.
And, Dr. Drummond, do you mind if I call you Philo?
No, man.
It's okay.
Yeah, everybody called me Philo or something like that.
Something like the Swingin' Love Corpses, man.
Yeah.
It's like the Swingin' Love Corpses.
I've been into the Swingin' Love Corpses since I was like 13.
I remember that.
Yeah, me too, man.
I was in there at least back that far, back when they was really cool.
In the early days, I used to listen to that band before I was a member, man.
Yeah.
You founded the band, right?
Yeah, that's right.
You and your brother.
Me and my grandfather.
And your grandfather.
My grandfather did it.
It was a long time ago.
It carried the tradition for years.
And this is...
These recordings we have tonight to play are from a live concert, I understand.
That's right.
That's the Stupid As They Want To Be tour.
The album Stupid As They Want To Be on...
What's the...
What record company is that?
That's Incipid Music Publishing Company.
Incipid, right.
Right.
It's on the Incipid label.
Really insipid.
Yeah, it's kind of a cheap nut.
Not a lot of people heard about it.
It's really a growing label.
It's a good one to buy stock in right now.
You ought to check that out.
I hear you.
I hear you.
It's a comer.
It's a real comer.
That's what they say about the Swingin' Love Corpses.
Well, this...
What about this song we're about to play here, Bummer?
Bummer?
Bummer.
Yeah, that's a bummer, all right.
Hey, where's this one?
Where's this coming?
I want to do a little scritch scratch.
Oh, here you go.
There you go.
Hey, it's like hip-hop radio.
There, do some scritch scratch there with...
Let's...
Hems from the Southwest, I believe.
Play it right now.
Hey, it's crazy.
It's cool.
It's like a giant planet here.
And, uh...
Flying through space at unbelievable speeds.
And we're just a little speck of protoplasm on the board.
And you can just slam into a bunch of metal at any time.
Just slam.
And mostly all we get today is doom, doom, depression.
Boom and destruction.
Poverty, chaos.
Death.
Degradation.
Filth.
Homicidal maniacs.
You know?
You know?
I fall like a dead man through the canyons of my mind.
20,000 people dying in an industrial accident caused by an explosion of a chemical plant in India.
Horror!
You're a bummer!
Horror!
Horror!
The ozone liner is...
This period of the farming right, the incidence of skin capture has increased to 100%.
The Dow Jones is falling! The Dow Jones is falling!
Falling!
The rainforest is being destroyed at the rate of 50,000 acres a minute.
Bomber!
Half of all species will be extinct by the year 2000.
Bomber!
Real f***ing bomber!
Uh oh, I'm not politically correct.
Uh, no kidding.
Bomber!
Yeah, he forgot about that one. Thanks, Darkie.
Bomber!
Our apologies. Bomber, man. Bad words on the radio, not meant to do it.
Bomber!
How about the, uh, Iraq has a hydrogen bomb?
Bomber!
How about the, uh, in Bangladesh?
3,000 people are killed in a typhoon in Bangladesh.
Bomber!
Bomber!
There's a trillion dollar deficit.
Bomber!
Kind of a bomber.
No, it's not alive.
I cut myself shaving!
Oh!
Bomber!
Bomber!
Bomber!
Bomber!
Bomber!
Bomber!
Bomber!
Bomber!
Baloo killer killed six million Jews in World War II.
It was a bomber!
Bomber!
Bomber!
The greenhouse effect...
F-fright, well...
...killed the dinosaurs.
Oh, yeah! Right.
When an asteroid hit the earth,
How...all the dinosaurs were killed as a, uh, a cloud covered the earth.
Real bomber!
Bummer! Bummer!
Help! I'm falling and I can't get up!
Bummer!
That song is a bummer.
No kidding. That is a bummer, man.
One, two, three, four!
Yeah, cause this is a fun show.
So dear friends, we've always tried to give you the most fun, fun kind of radio here.
The Hour of Slack.
That's always been the reputation of this show, is fun.
That I've always heard of anyway.
When you come to Dallas, it's like, what do you do? You know, you get on the fun show.
That's right.
And that's what I've always done.
And we've got members of two fun, fun bands.
Doctors for Bob, the original Doctors for Bob,
and, uh,
that's a,
uh, Dr. Snavely Eklund there.
Ah! My mind and your mind!
You all remember Snavely? Hey, wow, I remember that song. That was a great song.
My mind is not my mind.
My mind is your mind.
It was the days, dear friends, when you could go to a subgenius revival and there'd be the pure Doctor music.
The pure spirit music.
Music of Bob.
My mind is not your mind.
That was, it was performed in the spirit, in that no one who held an instrument had been schooled formally in those days.
The best Doctors sat in the audience while other ones played their instruments.
Like puppets.
In a play.
We would found the band and then start the show up on the stage and then we would relinquish our instruments to the audience.
One at a time to members from the audience until finally,
the band and the audience had transposed themselves and, and the, and the din was...
The din was unbelievable.
And then everyone was dead.
And, yeah, they died.
It was like knives in your ears, dear friends. It was such a beautiful, beautiful thing.
And unfortunately most of the Doctor bands learned how to play. You know, it happens to the best.
Most of them died.
Look at Devo.
Most of them died.
A number of them died.
And, uh, but not as Dr. Eklund. Dr. Eklund still lives. He never learned to play.
Never.
The best ones are dead though.
And the dead ones are best in the world of Doctor music.
But hell, there's only good Doctors and dead Doctors as far as I'm concerned.
I always hated, and you'll vouch for this won't you Doctor John?
Yeah, I'll vouch.
I always hated.
I don't even know what he's going to say and I'll vouch.
I've always hated the music that we did.
He has always hated that.
I can vouch for that.
I was in a Doctor band.
I was in Doctors for Wotan, the second Doctor band based on Doctors for Bob.
And, uh.
And he has always hated Doctors for Wotan and Doctors for Bob.
Well, no, I didn't mind Doctors for Bob after a while.
He hated them.
Well, yeah, he acted like he liked them.
I hated the band that I was in at the time that I was performing the music.
But the funny thing was when you played the tapes back it sounded okay.
Yeah, how about, what was that one?
Moans from the Toilets in Hell.
Moans from the Toilets in Hell.
Yeah, you know I don't play the old Wotan music much on this show.
You should.
It's kind of like The Roots, you know.
It is The Roots but it's got.
Going back to the pamphlet sort of music.
The problem is The Roots are just hanging right out of the ground and you cannot play

Yeah, you know it's a problem.
Erosion.
It's erosion to the soil.
You know that microphone you're on has a very, it has a flat quality.
I'll stand away.
I'll stand away.
And project my voice better.
How's that?
Yeah, I picked up that and it erased half the tapes Dr. Drummond.
And that's what made everybody the happiest.
I was happy.
When the tapes finally were erased and they shut up for a while.
What's this next, now that we're at a Swingin' Love Corpses concert, what's this next song coming up?
Nature.
I hate it.
John Sarge statement on the, for all the environmentalists out there.
Animal rights.
Animal rights activists.
You know what I'm going to do is.
Environmentalists.
We really are concerned about the ecology and about things like living.
Living.
Living.
Living things.
Like the Indians.
Living things.
Yeah, I like things too.
We're concerned about things.
Oh, I can tell.
Your concern really shows through in this song Dr. Drummond.
And we're going to talk about political correctness a little bit more after this.
Lovely anthem.
Well it's been a while since time began.
A bad struggle against nature, a force of nature against man.
Take down a great movement, a simple quicksand
Nature has the power, nature has the upper hand
Nature, I hate it!
Nature, I hate it!
Well the forces of nature come in many degrees
Maybe a forest by a peg or killer bees
Maybe an earthquake or maybe typhoon
Tornadoes, volcanoes, rings of monsoon
Nature, I hate it!
Nature, I hate it!
In the baby's dioxide
Blue glint of light

White powder of species
How does it make you feel?
Got your hole in the earth
Fill that hole with plastic
The way we treat our planet
Wonderland
Nature, I hate it!
Nature, I hate it!
So gotta wake up
And try to come back
To get to know you
Nature Where you go
Nature Where you go
Nature where you go
Nature Where you go
Nature Where you go
Nature Where you go
Nature, I hate it!


guitar solo

solo
solo
Well I wouldn't find nature
if I had my druthers
Wish I could control
the action of others
We should love nature
like one of our brothers
But you know it's not nice
to fool your mother
Nature
I ain't enough
My sister Veronica and I did this double act
And my husband Charlie traveled around with us
For the last number in our act
We did these 20 acrobatic tricks in a row
One, two, three, four, five
Splits, spread eagles, flip flops, backflips
One right after the other
Well this one night we were in Cicero, the three of us
And we were in this hotel room boozing and having a few laughs
And we ran out of ice
So I went out to get some
I come back, open the door
There's Veronica and Charlie
Doing number 17
The spread eagle
Then one night she says
Baby, what's the sense? You working every night
I don't get to see enough of you
So she offers to put me on an allowance
Just like that, an allowance
So finally I ask her
I said, baby, where does all this loot come from?
Did you rob a bank or something?
No, she says, I thought you knew better
I'm a hustler
Well, I wasn't shocked
I should have known
I'm a hustler

I've been around that kind of thing
She looks so college-y all the time
But I didn't tumble, I guess
Anyway, I wanted to bring her down
But to be perfectly honest with you, I was sort of hooked
I mean, where else could a guy like me get a hold of money like that?
Your love gives me such a thrill
But your love won't pay my bills
I want money
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want
I want my own seis
But I don't need your see'ny
She wants money
Put your partner back



What do you want?
She wants money
What do you want?
She wants money
Put herfahren

and on and on and on and on and on and on.
What'd you say?
This is stupid, man.
We're a lot better than this if we just stand around and just yak at each other.
Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah, but you were sitting there forging my name on all those FCC papers.
So, what about it?
Is that something that's bad?
I mean, is that like an illegal thing?
Yeah, it is illegal.
Just because the FCC is a federal governmental agency?
Yeah, but by admitting it, we guarantee disbelief.
Isn't that the greatest thing about the church of the subgenius, Dr. Drummond?
Isn't that the greatest thing about that church?
You mean that church that we were the first two cool guys who started a long time ago?
Well, after Bob.
We were the first two subgeniuses.
There was Bob, and then there was two subgeniuses.
And then there was you.
Well, yeah.
But we were the first two.
There was that other guy.
We killed him.
We don't even talk about him anymore.
No, well, he killed himself.
We didn't kill him.
Well, we might have.
We wouldn't even say his name.
We might have put him.
We might have put the bullets in the gun and put the gun in his hand, but he pulled the trigger, I guarantee.
That's right.
That's the important thing.
We might have strapped the gun in his hand and put a spring behind it, but he pulled the trigger.
The important thing is, you know, it's like he could choose between a glass of water or life.
And eventually, he just got thirsty.
He made the choice.
He got thirsty.
So, there it is.
It's that simple.
It was a philosophical way.
Back in the old days, we used to do stuff like that.
Whatever happened.
Dr. Drummond to the old days of the church.
In the olden times?
Yeah.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
I'm hearing odd things in the broadcast.
You know, there's somebody who jams our signal.
Oh, really?
Yeah, there's this, like, I don't know.
Is that the Citizens for Normalcy?
It's either them or the feds or the Criswell Baptist.
Some late group that really has some bad history.
It thinks that we're just a...
The Chihuahua.
The Trevinoist.
The Chihuahua?
Speaking of Chihuahuas, H. Ross Perot.
Yeah, that little...
Chihuahua haircut sporting goon.
There's been an argument about whether he resembles a Chihuahua,
like Ren of Ren and Stimpy,
or if he's more like the winged monkey that picks up Toto in Wizard of Oz.
I just want to know where he gets his haircut.
I think he just kind of sticks his head in a blender, you know?
H. Ren Perot.
Yeah, H. Perot.
And, you know, if you made Bill Clinton play Stimpy,
and George Bush could play Nickelodeon,
you'd have a feature film right there.
Yep.
Yep, by George.
Clinton would make a pretty good Stimpy, you know?
And Perot as Ren.
Yeah.
Think about it.
He could fluff Clinton up and sleep on him and stuff like that.
He'd make for beautiful bedfellows.
Bill!
Bill, don't you know the old ways are best?
The old ways are?
The old ways are the best, dear friends.
And Dr. Drummond and Stavely and I remember the old...
Well, we would be able to remember them had they not been so good, you might say.
What's that over-modulating I keep hearing, man?
I don't know.
It's because the people didn't send in their pledge money to the station.
And there's...
Knock that old nuclear generator there.
They have a gasoline generator here in the studio that keeps everything running.
They do?
They have the...
They have the...
They brought in the new EKG machine.
Oh, the toys.
So you can take one while you're doing your show.
The toys in the mail.
Phyla.
Yeah, Phyla.
Phyla, they called him back in the olden times.
Back in the old bear slapping fish amoeba flagellate times.
Yeah, I remember when you created amoebas.
Yeah, me and the old...
That was back in the good old days.
Yeah, that was the old days.
I remember when you created dog-eat-dog.
The whole concept of one life form would destroy completely another life form.
And then would be in return destroyed.
It was the only logical conclusion for the proliferation of life forms.
Is that eventually one had to consume the other else there would be too many.
Yeah, I'll tell you.
I've...
You know...
It's a natural selection.
This church has been around for a long time.
A long time.
Some people think.
Do you remember when they used to cut off their male organs?
Huh?
Who's dog?
What about that dog?
Dog.
Dog.
Dog.
Dog.
Dog.
Dog.












All that dog?
That one dog?
Yeah.
But, oh the...
Old dog...
I remember.
The old dog.
Dogs has...
I vote for both of them old dogs.
Dogs has always been my friend.
Both them old dogs, man.
Why didn't you do some nasty old dogs?
Right after the dinosaurs were killed out, those two dogs appeared.
And...
If it weren't for you...
Roughly at the same time as the conspiracy...
If it weren't for you experimenting,
and cause that explosion that...
That caused that...
It wouldn't be...
Set off that chain of vile creatureную...


volcanic activity that was another life you enough smoke into the atmosphere
that it killed all the dinosaurs that was that was you that did that I it was
another life I'm sure that's a soap opera years another life yeah horrible I
hate that show special love that show you live on that show you are you're a
character oh there's two wacky yetis of mutantas the ones who destroyed the
possibility of subgenius is ever having slack again yeah because they got too
hot and bothered they're right and they had to do it right next to the big
crystal of the arms on fire you don't have to lean into that bad microphone
dr. drum you know this is this show has gonna have a peculiar special sound to

generator cold fusion stuff it was a hoax it doesn't work no you don't put my
initials down all the way dr. drummond is gone I'm sorry let me apologize to the
FCC the station dr. drummond is gonna make a surrealist apologize to dr.

I'm kind of slack-filled right now.
Do you not, therefore, share 25% of the debt of the, the debt, I say, of the Subgenius Foundation?
There's, there's, all right, you own 50%, and then you own 25% of the debt.
No, my wife owns 25%.
And then I own the other 25%.
My first one.
My main one.
You own 75%, 25 of which is the debt.
And mine is the other 25%, which is the profit.
The debt.
The debt.
That's the key.
The President takes on 75% of the debt in a subgenius.
If 100 subgenius businessmen do it, then it's legal.
Right.
Right.
That is correct.
That is correctamundo.
That is a basic tenet in the Church of the Subgenius.
The fact that 100, the 101th, though, the 101st.
The 101th subgenius.
The 101th subgenius is the one that pushes it over to the critical, the critical mass.
The critical mass.
And then all the subgeniuses start doing it.
That's correct.
After the 101th doctor first washes his old one.
His sweet potato in the ocean.
The 101th doctor first washes his old one.
And then pretty soon they all do it.
And then the girls say, all right, I'm fine.
As long as you do that, we're all.
And it's the new age.
All of a sudden, Ashtar is in command.
Orthon is in his special.
I'm flipping my sweet patootie in the ocean and you're flipping your sweet patootie in the ocean.
And we're sucking up all the money.
All the garmang zozia.
And chakala magangangalala hawasanda.
And all the soul and anguish we could possibly enjoy.
He washed my sweet patootie.
Alashana basoya.
Oh.
Shalacandala.
Shalacandala de basoya.
624.
Read it, dear friends.
Well, should we go back to.
Bleeding head ecclesians 1423.
I'm coming up to the special part.
Quote me.
Quote me.
Bleeding head ecclesians.
1423.
And he shall come unto ye and ye shall be forced to reach for the washcloth of Gahangang.
And to thence cleanse thyself from that which has tainted thine soul.
I'm glad to hear that Reverend Stang used the perfect.
See, I can quote it.
You ask me another one.
And I'm proud that you used the correct pronunciation that only an educated neophyte could have learned after.
Years and years of.
Neophyte.

Neophyte or.
I don't know.
Quote me Exodus 20.
21.
I don't.
I don't quote the Bible.
I only quote.
The book of the subgenius.
A slave owner.
A slave owner can beat and kill a slave.
But only if the slave dies a slow and lingering death.
Exodus 21.
32.
Slaves are worth 30 coins.
But coins of what denomination?
That's correct.
Were they dimes?
Were they nickels?
Or were they coins?
Are they diamonds?
Are they nickels?



Are they diamonds?

Are they Jewish coins?
Mayhaps.
May they even be Mormonic?
They could have been more ironic.
It's sticky.
It's sticky.
The Mormons, of course, had that special.
That S special.
Coinage.
That Joseph Smith got on the copper.
From the copper plates.
You know, I'm related to him.
I'm distant relations.
Yeah.
Could you say that again?
I just.
Oh, yeah.
For the polygamous king.
I'm saying this over again for you that had to flip your tape.
Thank you.
I'm a polygamous king.





You.
Where was I?
About the moronic kingdom and the polygamous knuckleheads.


How we went.
And you started that.
And the Church of the Subgenius.
That cult.
Inherits.
Inherits this.
These tablets.
And you know.
We carry the tablets.
The Mormons were actually.
Came from a lost Israelite tribe who came to America.
And fought great battles which are recorded in the Book of Mormon.
Not to be confused with the Kaizoric peoples.
Yeah.
And the.
And of course.
When the.
It's.
When the.

It's odd that none of it can be substantiated through any.
Any.
Archaeological evidence whatsoever.
Although there was quite a bit of activity.
And hundreds and hundreds of thousands of.
The angels.
People.
Came and took it away.
Yes.
Right.
Because faith.
It's the faith.
It's the faith.
In the.
Copper plates.
And the blood.
Of the.
Believer.
Of the sacrificed lamb.
The sacrificed lamb.
Ah.
Yes.
The.
The.

Drinking up the blood.
Ah.

The drinking.
Because.
The drinking of the cup.
The one cup.
The sharing of the one cup of the blood of the risen yeti.
And it doesn't have to be the.
The living blood.
It can be the soup of.


The risen yeti of Dobbs.
Dobbs yeti.
Blood.
Resurrected.
As represented by the.
The money of the believer.
And spewed.
From the jugular veins of the dead yeti.
Oh.
It's so sad.
So sad.
But yet.
But what else do you do with a dead yeti.
From it we draw strength.
We draw strength.
We can draw.
Strength.
There you go.
And it's.
It's a party.
It becomes.
Like.
The sultan of Brunei.
Like the saucers.
Have you heard about the sultan of Brunei?
Yeah.
I've heard he lost his money.
He's already down to about 75 billion.
He's been gambling with J.R.
Bob Dobbs.
The sultan of Brunei said to be the richest man in the world with an estimated wealth
of 37 billion.
There.
See he's down from 75.
And.

It's not a good time.


There's a.
A bunch of people that is not.
I do not know.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
But.
And.
But.

There he is.
I can't believe.
He's there.
He's there.
He's there.
I know.
He's there.
He's there.
I'm not sure.
But.
He's there.
He's there.

He's there.

This is the most boring band.
If you've ever seen them live, they spend forever.
I keep thinking people are talking about me behind my back and stuff.
While I'm going down the freeway, those people in the car next to me, I know they're talking
about me.
I'm going down the freeway.
I'm going down the freeway.
I'm going down the freeway.
I'm going down the freeway.
I'm going down the freeway.
We were destined to make it right.
We're predetermined.
We are grown-up men
We are all past
The age of reasoning
It is our mission
And it is our task
It's obvious
Yet useless
We are born to save the universe
We are born to save the universe
We are born to save the universe
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Don't you worry
Don't have no fear
Or get uptight
Because the Indians fear
We can't fail
But we don't decide
We're in control
And we are born to find
We are born to save the universe
We are born to save the universe
We are born to save the universe

The universe
This time
And kids, you know, you can save the universe
If you haven't registered to vote
You need to vote
You need to do it pretty quick
You need to register by this Tuesday
October 6th
Or you can't vote on November 6th
Of course, half of you may be hearing this
After November 6th
And the conspiracy will have destroyed us
A vote for Bob is a vote against the conspiracy
Bob for world overlord
Bob for everything
Here's the lesson to be learned
Bob for Bob
The lesson to be learned
You're not going to read it
You're not going to read from some old book
You just found laying around the radio station, are you?
No, man
That's what they do on Welp
Jeez, what did you do?
Oh, God
I'm sorry, dear friends
With this particular episode of the Hour of Slack as an informal
You're the one that fed me
And relaxed
Please
If you don't mind
We don't need to be discussing bodily functions or other
Illegal things
You didn't say anything
Yeah, you didn't say anything
It was good, Reverend Spiney
Thanks
It was good
That's Snake Pudding
Man
Good stuff, boy
Good stuff, boy

Oh, Frank
You don't want everybody just to stick your finger in your nose
But don't you feel one more
I don't know how you feel one more
way or the other.
It's a picture of me, the wife, and all your brothers
driving in your car.
And you're looking at your neighbor by the nuggets
from his house just like you save her in the favor.
He's pulling, he's tugging, he's yanking on this thing.
It's a long, stride of steam still connected
to the brain.
Pick a booger.
Pick a booger.
Pick a booger.
Pick a booger.
Pick a booger.
Pick a booger.


It's the new day.
He's a slave to the master of his role in scientists.
The kids all want to have days of infatuation
because a pick a booger boogie is the new sensation.
Pick a booger.
Pick a booger.
Pick a booger.
Pick a booger.
Pick a booger.
Look at that.
What a lovely day, Dr. Drummond.
You ought to see the dance that goes with this, dear friend.
Sort of a finger dance.
A very special dance.
You have to kind of imagine in your mind what it would be like
if you were seeing a bunch of grown men on stage picking boogers.
Acting like it, of course, not the real thing.
We wouldn't be that gross.
We wouldn't be able to talk about that.
No, that'd be sick.
Sort of like the Russ Meyer movies.
Just the fact that we know that it was fake makes us realize that it's not sick.
But if it was real, then we would know how sick we really were.
You don't need to know anything about this.
Just how sick.
Hey, this tape's about to end.
Do you want to hear something I did with my computer?
Yeah, let's hear it.
This is an ad I had to do.
Let's hear something you did with your computer.
I did.
You were Reverend Stans.
Yeah, I had to do it.
I've got to show this off.
I did an ad.
Stansy?
Yeah, Reverend Stans.
We're making fun of John Rohde, your friend.
Yeah, Reverend Stans.
Now everybody who's calling in is against you.
I think you guys are a bunch of cruds.
You guys don't know what's going on.
Yeah, I thought it was kind of clever until all the Christians started calling in.
When they called in, now I'm bummed, man.
You guys, what kind of psychos are you?
What kind of crazy...
Thought you'd tried everything?
Well, we have!
And it's so nice.
We're doing it twice.
Yes, the world's first subgenius rant and rave is doubling back to give you R&R Squirrel.
The Association for Consciousness Exploration and the Smart Bar.
1575 Merwin in the flat.
We'll double your pleasure with the semi-new rant and rave, too.
Starting at 7 sharp on Saturday, October 10th, we unleash two subgenius master preachers.
Reverend Ivan Stang from Dallas.
And...
Little Rock's Sternodoc.
Plus, the double-barreled Reverend Mary Squared.
Au contraire.
Too much for any warm man to handle.
Plus, the twin attractions of the Devil Biker Bunnies from Naked Hill.
Two house music stars, New York DJ Larry T and Hey Fellow Singer Simone.
World beat drummer Free Percussion.
Coupled with the Cosmic Corridor to Ace's Mind Bomb.
And we'll all get married.
Where?
At the Mass Short Duration Marriage Ceremony.
Yes, it's all too much.
But remember, too much is always better than not enough.
Tickets are $7 in advance, $8 a day of show.
Available at Smart Bar, Record Rev, and Coventry Christmas Board.
Yeah, so we can play that ad on this station because that's an ad for an out-of-town show.
You can't go to it.
But just to let you know, what you can do with a little Macintosh.
Wow, that's cool, Reverend Stang.
I was talking into my Macintosh.
I just wanted to show off what you can do with your Macintosh.
Yeah, the Macintosh one.
My computer's on.
It's almost as good as yours.
Yeah, I had a Macintosh once.
Yeah, you threw it away in there because you've got such a good one.
Yeah.
See, it goes on.
See, you can do all that fancy schmancy stuff.
I know.
Oh, oh, is it?
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
Well, now what do we do?
We've got ten more minutes until we have to kill now.
Well, I've got this media barrage tape.
You know, it's like funny.
It's like collages.
Well, let's just talk, Reverend Stang.
Okay.
Well, I could play the rest of Pick a Booger and Johnny Got Robbed and Give Me Back My Fun Thing.
Okay, yeah, let's do that.
But you know, these tape decks sound peculiar tonight.
I think there is.
They both uniformly sound as if they're being broadcast all the way to Oklahoma City and back.
With the static and everything in between.
Yeah.
Yeah.

Yeah.


Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.









Yeah.
Yeah.
And then we took some more.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So we might as well.
I remember that.
Continue, you know, the same way.
What'd you say?
Yeah, we took some more.
Yeah.
Hey, did you hear that noise, man?
Yeah, but then the truck was full and we couldn't take any more.
That's a good thing you only took two because I saw what happened that first time.
That truck load.
Two truck loads.
And two bathtubs full.
Two bucket loads.
They were full.
I never saw so many dead cops.
That was a frightening thing.
You know, if you tried to do that today, if you tried to do that nowadays, they'd shut you down in a minute.
No, they still got chainsaw juggling.
There's an old dump truck full.
Yeah, dead pickup.
So dead pickups.
Well, hell, Tom Warner'd probably sign your contract.
That Tom Warner'd be showing up at your house going, sign here.
You got a truck load full of them?
I got a dump truck full of pickup trucks.
I got a heavy four-back barrel lifter and a quad.
I got a quad overhead cam double shifter.
And a pick-match, too.
That thing, man, it'll tear up.
It'll pick me up in an inning.
It'll do me down.
It'll tear a janer tongue right out of its mouth.
A 48 Buick is olive green.
Damn, were the days.
It was so easy back in the old days.
I remember when.
Before the diseases and the mental illness.
48 Buick.
It had lights in the wheel wells and quarter walls.
I had a wheelchair.
Burned cheap gas since you always stalled.
I remember when I was real tall like the dog.
I know J.R. Bob Dobbs for what he was.
I know the sub-denim for what they were.
Got 20 and 10-E with a vacuum tail.
There's a spare in the trunk, but it's full of nails.
They were there, but they were almost backwards.
And you put them upside down and the buttons would come out.
And then they'd throw them over and run on them.
And then they didn't do nothing like.
You're right.
All the kids on my block say it sure looks keen.
That was back when the church was just one old shed.
I remember when the church was just a walking around town kind of church.
You just got up and didn't even have any roots.
It was just like a pair of old pants.
You just put them on and wear them around town for a while.
And you take them off, throw them in the corner.
And nobody knew they were there.
And then we had that little shack.
And that was the first roots we ever had.
And nowadays you walk around on college campus.
You walk around with a Bob shirt.
And while they're all walking up.
Where'd you get that?
Oh, they don't show up in the conspiracy stories.
They don't knock you down, man.
Some colleges, they just knock you down trying to tear it off of you.
Well, I don't want to go into them for some of the adventures I've had on them campuses, Dr. Drummond.
I don't want you to.
I've been amazed at all you do.
Nobody else does either because it's sick.
It's just sick.
People, yeah, people, sure.
You know, KFJZ don't have anything like that.
They took them off over there when old George left.
People, sure.
When old Mr. Opinion left over there at KFJZ.
This is the sickest, sickest thing I've ever seen on KFJZ.
You don't think people ought to be able to start their own religion?
People.
People, yeah.
People, sure.
But this, this is sick.
The sickest, sickest thing I ever heard.
I ever heard on KNON.
They just kept...
KFJZ.
Saying they were doctors over and over again.
But then...
Then they called back.
This is different.
They talk about cattle mutilation.
People, yeah, sure.
Oh, back in them days, you could get on the air.
You could talk on the telephone with the listeners.
They'd call up and challenge you.
And you didn't have those sick boys, those ones that called in to cuss, cuss rappers.
No, you didn't have to worry about it in them days.
Back in them days.
Dr. Drummond, he was...
He was a little rooster back in the day.
Pass me that Sombutol.
I'm a damn it all man myself.
I need another swig of that Sombutol.
See?
Sombnambulators.
You can have your damn Joyjackers.
I'm going to stick with my Sombnambulators.
I need my Sombnambulators.
You crazy thing.
Well, I'm going to...
One screamer, two minutes.
Okay, well, we've got eight minutes now.
Eight minutes.
Okay, well...
All that wasted space for just...
Two minutes.
Think of what we could have been doing.
Well...
To what these airwaves could...
We could have been talking about political stuff, man.
What about this election coming up, Dr. Drummond?
I know that you're a good liberal.
And...
Why, of course.
I say, vote your conscience.
Not only that, just remember.
Who pays the taxes in this country?
You or me?
Well, I can tell you right now, it's not me.
Praise Bob.
So?
But, friends, you can't...
Whoever you vote on...
If you don't vote, you can't complain.
That's right.
You can complain, but if I catch you, I'm going to say,
Did you vote?
And then you'll be going,
Hold up, man.
Like, I don't believe like this.
It's like, everyone doesn't make any difference to you, man.
It's like, besides, I had a great show that night.
I don't...
There's nobody to vote on, man.
I'm like...
They're all like...
They're all like...
Yeah, man.
You just vote for me.
Yeah, I'll tell you how to fix this country up.
I'll tell you how to fix this country up.
There ain't nobody to vote on.
You know, you can even absentee vote in the next couple of weeks.
You go out there and vote before everybody else does.
So that you can start complaining then.
I vote for higher taxes and lower wages.
You know, if Bill Clinton becomes president,
and all of a sudden they take away your car, your guns,
your money, and give it to the nearest crippled,
minority, lesbian, blind person,
because they're the most needing,
then you can complain if you vote.
You can complain all you want.
If you vote, if you don't vote,
and George Bush is president,
and the next day you wake up in a concentration camp
for all those who weren't white males,
with a big bank account,
and a company of their own,
then don't complain.
If you don't vote, and Ross Perot is president,
and you wake up, and everything's completely...
Pain.
It's just pain.
It's gonna be pain.
It's gonna be like World War II.
Everybody's gonna be...
But everybody's gonna share the pain.
That's right.
We're all gonna share the pain.
This is our sacrificial religion, dear friends.
I'm sorry, when we cut your program, Mr. Medicare,
we only have five dollars left.
But...
I'm sorry, when we cut your program, Mr. Education and Welfare,
we only got ten bucks left now.
Nineteen dollars a gallon.
But we're sharing the pain, that's for sure.
Yeah.
We're all feeling the pain, aren't we?
See, I told you we'd feel the pain.
I didn't lie to you.
I didn't lie to you.
Now, if it wasn't for the volunteers, I wouldn't be here.
I'd be out mining my three billion dollars, or whatever it is I got.
I'd be out flapping my ears, flying around Dallas. I've been counting.
You're leveraging your address song.
Yeah.
Estáان y
Listen, when we clapped our fingers at the
vice president.
Yeah.
I quit.
Now, how about we use a victim's office.

Muckers on theirol logo, mor block, you got natuurpores you meta tree.
Oh.
Oh.
Where is old Stimpy?
Now, if the volunteers in all 50 states want me to run, then I will.
And I said I would, and now I'm going to run because they said they did.
I'm running.
Well, you want to pick a booger?
Sure. With Ross.
Dear friends, hey, where is the...
You probably, when you duped that for me, you probably didn't even rewind the tapes just to get them all lined up, did you?
Nope, just got a whole bunch of blank stuff at the beginning.
You're going to have to talk all the way through the rest of it.
Dear friends, you have been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack here in Dallas, Texas.
I'm going to give you a number to write to.
I don't know why you would want more information on this church, but you can get it for free anyway by dropping a line to
Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas.
Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas.
75214.
Oh, no, you better give the Swingin' Love Corpses a go, because those of you who aren't here, the least bit interested in any information cataloged or taped on the Swingin' Love Corpses is 338 Lakewood, St. Louis, Missouri, or Baldwin, Missouri, 63011.
You barely could remember your own address.
I couldn't remember my own address for a minute there.
I know the feeling there.
I thought that was just the pressure of being on the radio and actually speaking normally.
Yeah.
Well, thanks, Dr. Philo Drummond and Dr. Snavely Eklund, for showing up and providing background sound effects and medias.
And, you know, every now and then I probably ought to thank old Will Dobbs for coming down here and answering the phone, except that I think he manages to get his...
Yeah.
He makes his time work.
It was a great work, yeah.
He might join New York City up front or something.
I've been talking to him for this whole year, the next six years, but, and that, yeah, that thing where I mean his mom runs it like a crack in theales.
I write these like a part of the book that has, you know, an article on everything the doc writes about new mano, bad news.

He'll tell you when he needs to have it in forever.
