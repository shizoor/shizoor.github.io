1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:04,340
A slacker.

2
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,600
You know what I'm saying?

3
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:29,980
You know what I'm saying?

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:57,480
You know what I'm saying?

5
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:17,020
You know what I'm saying?

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:59,500
You know what I'm saying?

7
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:29,720
You know what I'm saying?

8
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:58,480
You know what I'm saying?

9
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:24,740
You know what I'm saying?

10
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,460
You know what I'm saying?

11
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,620
You know what I'm saying?

12
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,980
You know what I'm saying?

13
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:56,480
You know what I'm saying?

14
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,980
Thank you.

15
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,860
Thank you.

16
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,120
Thank you.

17
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,520
Thank you.

18
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,200
Thank you.

19
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,180
Thank you.

20
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,320
Thank you.

21
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,240
Thank you.

22
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,440
Thank you.

23
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,700
Thank you.

24
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,500
Thank you.

25
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,600
Thank you.

26
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,760
Thank you.

27
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,220
Thank you.

28
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,540
Thank you.

29
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,180
Thank you.

30
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,800
Thank you.

31
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,800
Thank you.

32
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,960
I don't have a taste of the boys I narrow

33
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:44,780
Surely with the force of my years of education

34
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,040
I can fend off the needs of the flesh

35
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,680
The blood of the yak on my lips I scream out

36
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,420
And I know that the face of my headthroat

37
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,820
Is a metal mask like the acid

38
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,020
of the blood

39
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,600
The face of my headline

40
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,900
The face of my lanoturnum

41
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:27,360
Haring down like a horrible machine

42
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,500
Crashing my fragile skull

43
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,580
La la la la la

44
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,140
I don't have a taste of the boys I narrow

45
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,700
Surely with the force of my years of education

46
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,060
I narrow

47
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,940
And I know that the flesh of my headthroat

48
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,060
Is a metal mask like the acid of the blood

49
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,100
The blood of my headthroat

50
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:02,460
Haring down like a horrible machine

51
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:02,460


52
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:02,700
La la la la la

53
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,020
Haring down like a horrible machine

54
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,540
Crashing my fragile skull

55
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,920
La la la la la

56
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,440
Haring down like a horrible machine

57
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,140
La la la la la

58
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,420
Thank you.

59
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,240
Thank you.

60
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,620
Thank you.

61
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,080
Thank you.

62
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,140
Thank you.

63
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,080
Reagan's Pollock, dear friends.

64
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,480
Reagan's Pollock from Trash Fish Entertainment.

65
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,880
Got that pencil ready?

66
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,660
P.O. Box

67
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,500
56497

68
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,220
That's Box 56497

69
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,560
Little Rock, Arkansas

70
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:45,560


71
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,580
72215

72
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:49,800
or

73
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,400
www.trashfish.com

74
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,500
That's the amino acids in the background, friends.

75
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:04,980
But now

76
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,340
Einstein's Secret Outlaws

77
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,640
covered various different classic songs

78
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,960
over their recent concerts wonderfully

79
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,640
and I recorded them

80
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,280
horribly.

81
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,360
Friends, we need new gear

82
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,100
and we can't get it on a preacher's salary

83
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,320
so anyway, check our website.

84
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,300
So friends, because I have crappy recordings

85
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,580
of Einstein's Secret Orchestra's great covers

86
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,540
here are the originals

87
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,300
and here

88
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,860
The Highwaymen.

89
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,600
I was a highwayman

90
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,280
I was a highwayman

91
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:45,620
I was a highwayman

92
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:45,620


93
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,740
Along the coach roads I did ride

94
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:52,580
With sword and pistol by my side

95
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,440
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade

96
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,360
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade

97
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,820
The bastards hung me in the string of 25

98
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,700
But I am still alive

99
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,620
I am still alive

100
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,080
I was a sailor

101
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,400
I was born upon the tide

102
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,860
With a sea I did abide

103
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,680
I sailed a schooner around the horn to Mexico

104
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,840
I went aloft to pearl the mainsail in a blow

105
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,260
And when the yards broke off

106
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,600
They said that I got out of the boat

107
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:45,600


108
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,020
I'd kill

109
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,480
But I'm living still

110
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,820
I was a dam building

111
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,100
Across a river deep and wide

112
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,660
Where steel and water didn't collide

113
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,320
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado

114
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,300
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below

115
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:21,760
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound

116
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,820
But I am still around

117
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,540
I'll always be around

118
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:33,300
And around and around and around and around

119
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,100
I'll fly a starship

120
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,240
Across the universe

121
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:56,740
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can.

122
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:02,460
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again.

123
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:08,520
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain.

124
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,820
But I will remain.

125
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:21,220
And I'll be back again and again and again and again and again and again.

126
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,660
You can't count on God for Jack.

127
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,540
He pretty much told me so himself.

128
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,700
They call you Lady Luck.

129
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,920
But there is room for doubt.

130
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:50,200
At times you have a very unladylike way of running out.

131
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,540
You're on a date with me.

132
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,800
The pickings have been lush.

133
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:02,340
And yet before this evening is over you might give me the brush.

134
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,520
You might forget your manners.

135
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,860
You might refuse to stay.

136
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,640
And so the best that I can do.

137
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,600
Is pray.

138
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,180
Luck be a Lady Tonight.

139
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,500
Luck be a Lady Tonight.

140
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,540
Luck be a Lady Tonight.

141
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,000
Luck – if you've ever been a Lady to begin with.

142
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,020
Luck be a Lady Tonight.

143
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,420
Luck – let a gentleman see…

144
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,380
How nice a dame you can be.

145
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,840
I know the way you treated other guys you've been with.

146
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,920
Let luck be a lady with me

147
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,120
A lady doesn't leave her escort

148
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,500
It isn't fair, it isn't nice

149
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,420
A lady doesn't wander all over the room

150
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,960
And blow on some other guy's dice

151
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,940
So let's keep the party polite

152
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,460
Never get out of my sight

153
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,020
Stick with me, baby

154
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,860
I'm the fella you came in with

155
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,400
Let luck be a lady

156
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,600
Luck be a lady

157
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,360
Luck be a lady tonight

158
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,300
Luck be a lady tonight

159
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,480
Luck be a lady tonight

160
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,100
Luck, if you've ever been a lady to begin with

161
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,080
Luck be a lady tonight

162
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,240
Luck, let a gentleman see

163
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,740
Luck, let a gentleman see

164
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,380
How nice a dame you can be

165
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,060
How nice a dame you can be

166
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,980
I know the way you've treated other guys who've been with

167
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,280
Luck be a lady with me

168
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:52,300
A lady wouldn't flirt with strangers

169
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,660
She'd have a heart, she'd have a soul

170
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,840
A lady wouldn't make little snake eyes at me

171
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,400
When I've spent my life on this floor

172
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,300
So let's keep the party polite

173
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,000
So let's keep the party polite

174
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,920
Never get out of my sight

175
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,340
Never get out of my sight

176
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,600
Stick with me, baby

177
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,500
I'm the fella you came in with

178
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,020
Let luck be a lady

179
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,520
Luck be a lady

180
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,300
Luck be a lady

181
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,860
Luck be a lady

182
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,960
Luck be a lady

183
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,480
Roll the dice

184
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,340
Roll the dice

185
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,660
Rub it up, rub it up, rub it up, rub it up

186
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,780
Right, ha!

187
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,800
Robert Alda and the Guys

188
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,160
From Guys and Dolls

189
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,380
The 1950s

190
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:40,600
The 1950s

00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,460
well, you're hearing in the background the

286
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,400
Amino Acids who played at our

287
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,400

TheAminoAcids.com

292
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,000
And now, friends, a song with

293
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,240
for some reason deep personal meaning

294
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,800
to me. I'm not sure why.

295
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,380
The King, Elvis.

296
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:08,020
The King, Elvis.

297
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:12,740
I won't get any older now the angels wanna wear my red shoes

298
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,680
Oh, I was watching while you're dancing away

299
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,300
Our love got fractured in an echo and sway

300
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,820
How come everybody wants to be your friend?

301
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,340
You know that it still hurts me just to say it

302
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:33,220
Oh, I know she's disgusted

303
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,580
Oh, why's that?

304
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,600
Cause she's feeling so abused

305
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,320
Oh, that's too bad

306
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,200
She gets tired of the lust

307
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,780
Oh, I'm so sad

308
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,480
But it's so hard to refuse

309
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:50,580
Can you say that I'm too old when the angels have stolen my red shoes?

310
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:56,060
Oh, I said I'm so happy I could die

311
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:59,620
She said, drop dead, then left with another guy

312
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:03,240
But that's what you get if you go chasing out the vengeance

313
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,560
Ever since you got me

314
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,900
The punch that does is defend my sentence

315
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,000
Oh, I used to be disgusted

316
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,500
When I tried to be amused

317
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,000
Since the winter got rusted

318
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
You know the angels wanna wear my red shoes

319
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,800
But when they told me about the sign of the bargain

320
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,860
That's when I knew that I could not refuse

321
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:32,760
And I won't get any older now the angels wanna wear my red shoes

322
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:40,060
I won't get any older now the angels wanna wear my red shoes

323
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,980
Red shoes, the angels wanna wear my red shoes

324
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:50,560
Red shoes, the angels wanna wear my red shoes

325
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,120
Red shoes, the angels wanna wear my red shoes

326
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,600
Red shoes, the angels wanna wear my red shoes

327
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,100
Red shoes, the angels wanna wear my red shoes

328
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,600
Red shoes, the angels want to wear my red shoes.

329
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,700
I'm walking in a wonder wonderland

330
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,420
All I got was saying

331
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:27,260
There's a nine pound hammer beating in my skull

332
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,200
Laying down tracks on the road to hell

333
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:30,760
Yeah!

334
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:04,940
Yeah!

335
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,080
Yeah!

336
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:06,540
Yeah!

337
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:06,600
Yeah!

338
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,220
Yeah!

339
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:07,980
Yeah!

340
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:08,800
Yeah!

341
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:10,720
Yeah!

342
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,960
Thank you.

343
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:36,360
The mathematics of the equation just don't add up.

344
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:43,780
It's a paradoxical situation.

345
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:56,300
And while my cock is in elation, my soul is in purgatory.

346
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:16,440
And praying to the demon god at Radio Shack to give me peace and make the neighbor's dog stop telling me to murder the innocents in the cracks of the sidewalks in New York City.

347
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,000

Proof that there's still hope in Texas.

352
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:45,380
And friends, stay tuned for yet another killer remix of a classic tune by Dr. Onan's Wotan Band.

353
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:56,080
Followed by a new, a traditional Celtic song about computer online affairs by Sister Mora.

354
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:56,820
Melodious.

355
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,100
A chop spin out.

356
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,340
Onan's Wotan Band.

357

Onan.

365

Onan.

366
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:21,920
