1
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:20,620
I know you don't have time to talk to your plants. Don't worry. You can go on about your business, whether that's to class or the office, or fixing dinner, or making love. They'll listen to the self-genius, our old swag.

2
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,800
Let's begin.

3
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,940
We're rolling. This is the good one. Take five.

4
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:46,600
Most folks have heard about it.

5
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,720
All right, that's good, Bob.

6
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,200
That's why folks call it finger.

7
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,620
That's why folks call it finger.

8
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,720
Sounds good, Bob.

9
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,000
That's why folks call it.

10
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,980
The self-genius.

11
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,980
Our old swag.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,600
Swag.

13
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,720
Perfect.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,980
The self-genius.

15
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,280
Our old swag.

16
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,860
Oh, that's not true.

17
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:52,920
Tonight, radio's distinguished series dedicated to man's imagination.

18
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,820
The self-genius.

19
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,300
Our old swag.

20
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:01,860
The self-genius.

21
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:01,860


22
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,840
It's our way of acknowledging our American heroes.

23
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,020
That's what you say.

24
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:14,440
We say you could act like a jackrabbit with frazzled nerves and a heart pounding like a trip hammer.

25
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,120
You gotta keep jumping.

26
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,220
You gotta keep punching.

27
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,260
Punch.

28
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,860
Punch.

29
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,340
Punch that grandfather.

30
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,300
Ugh.

31
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:22,820
Ugh.

32
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,800
The victim can stand only so much abuse.

33
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,700
The victim can stand only so much abuse.

34
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,100
The victim can stand only so much abuse.

35
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,020
Too many people die because they couldn't live.

36
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,860
The grandfather's journey is ended.

37
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:40,420


38
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:40,500
The grandfather's journey is ended.

39
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,380
He swam from the Pacific Ocean all the way up to Mount Fuji.

40
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,440
That's impossible.

41
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,660
Isn't it?

42
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,020
That's impossible.

43
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,020


44
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,440
This is beyond our present knowledge or understanding.

45
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,140
This is beyond our present knowledge or understanding.

46
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,680
Bob.

47
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:52,740
Bob.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,580
Bob.

49
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,140
Bob.

50
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,420
Bob.

51
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,340
Bob.

52
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:55,420
Bob.

53
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,140
Bob.

54
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,840
Bob.

55
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:57,840


56
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,180
Bob.

57
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,120
Bob.

58
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,800
Bob.

59
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:05,800


60
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:05,800


61
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,740
Ah yes, dear friends.

62
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:23,820
This is the hour of the slash.

63
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:29,240
And this is the hour of slack

64
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:34,520
And this is the hour of slack

65
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,760
But this is the hour of slack

66
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes, dear friends, and we barely made it to 1,000 hours of slack, but that's what this is.

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:03,060
We just barely made it because when we jumped into the new I-Van to drive down here to the station for the most important show ever since the first one on October of 1985 in Dallas, the car wouldn't start.

68
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,420
A dead battery, friends, with about half an hour till showtime.

69
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:18,740
But luckily our jumper cables and the WeMobile exist together with the I-Van in the same dimension and thus here we are just in time for the world to end and to read and play.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,800
All the submissions from our beloved listeners, contributors, and supporters.

71
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:35,260
You can hear what happened while you were on the couch watching Nick Van Pat on your TV in your living room while outside some hide while the saucers fly high while they do a drive-by.

72
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:47,140
And so, dear friends, with this new El Queso All-Stars intro music,

73
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:56,300
we'll be listening to the commemorative commentations on this, our 1,000th hour.

74
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,500
Now we introduce you to the host with the most Jesus-shamanically Marvin with a side of tongues,

75
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,740
like a psychic Burt Reynolds jumping his car through your neighbor's curly hair spreading slack everywhere.

76
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,040
That's me, dear friends.

77
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,580
And this is the hour of slack.

78
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,020
And this is the hour of slack.

79
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,120
But this is the hour of slack.

80
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,920
And Dave and we are here to...

81
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,600
We don't...

82
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,360
Oh, well now we have some head fuzz.

83
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,320
Lay your hands on the radio.

84
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,020
Lay your hands on the radio band at home and we're gonna look to God.

85
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,960
1,000

86
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,480
1,000

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,120
1,000

88
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,300
1,000

89
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,640
1,000

90
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,180
1,000

91
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,000
1,000

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,040
1,000

93
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,120
1,000

94
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,160
1,000

95
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,460
Bob

96
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,260
Bob

97
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:49,740
Bob

98
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,260
Bob

99
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,660
Bob

100
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:50,840
Bob

101
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:50,840


102
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:50,840


103
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,540
Stop all the way.

104
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,460
Stop all the way.

105
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,520
Stop all the way.

106
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,460
Stop all the way.

107
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,320
The hour of slack.

108
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,900
That marvelous fleeting interlude.

109
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,660
Like the moment between each wave in a mighty ocean,

110
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,260
where everything is suspended.

111
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:16,680
Every string of the conspiracy's power neatly nipped away by its unique shearing vibration.

112
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:24,020
vibrations allowing you to drift and float in the flippity-floppity zing-zang of slack.

113
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:34,040
Ah, how sad that there can only be one a week. But nay, no, that is not so. For all these 1,000

114
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:42,000
hours of slack have been carefully and dutifully recorded by our obedient sacred scribe number 273

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,520
and can be gotten in so many different ways. Read up in subgenius.com for the many and sundry ways.

116
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,160
Why, you could listen to nothing but the hour of slack if that was your desire.

117
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:03,560
The hour of slack, a confounding yet cunning confluence of fractious fragments of brilliant

118
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:11,440
madness woven together weekly for 19 years by a word wrangler the likes of which,

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:20,900
well, there are no likes of which. Bob inspires crazily talented artistes of every kind you never

120
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:28,340
heard of to spring forth with endless precious audio offerings of puzzling wonder. And Reverend

121
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:35,360
Stang has been queuing it up for all of us all of these years, purely for the glorifying and

122
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,880
pious preservation of it all, and for our listening pleasure, creating an easily attainable,

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:52,540
soothing form of slack. The hour of slack, 1,000 hours of slack, listened to continuously,

124
00:07:52,840 --> 00:08:00,980
one show on the heels of another, that would be a little more than 41 and a half solid days of audio

125
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:09,120
slack. What would that do? A thought that gives one pause. Perhaps there will be a radio marathon

126
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,880
and someone actually will do this.

127
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:22,200
Of course, maintaining a 19-year continuous archive of this weekly show would be no small feat.

128
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:31,280
But 41 days of slack is, at the very least, conceivable. The hour of slack,

129
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:38,800
where everybody is a star, no matter who you are, whether from near or whether far,

130
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,140
everybody is a star.

131
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:52,180
Where packaged, processed stars are nobody. The hour of slack. Each week I hear my beloved Stang

132
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:59,340
in his sacred studio above, lovingly whittling the profanity from the flagrant flowings of the

133
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:05,440
preachers, plucking the unallowable from what would otherwise never be heard. I hear the

134
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,980
ceaseless tinkerings of sound as he hones the show into the slippery seal of the show.

135
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:11,980


136
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,760
This may be the 11th hour of cosmic cacophony, but always it is to

137
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,540
truly a labor of loveщоose

138
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:36,520
Pennsylvania is the hour of slack. Here's to the next thousand hours! May they be as rapturous and rambunctious as the first, thou. Nay, may X Day come, and then all of the hours we live will become-... Hours of Slack.

139
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,720
When music arises in this movie, I couldn't imagine a Caribbean city without ocean music.

140
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:41,960
But once a pop snapper,サメンサーathanburgh is forced into this world. Don't give you your bracket against the scale of the wordiencies, because it wonderingly unw iceberging comes from Pluto.

141
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:41,960


142
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,680
Paulson, I just want to say that I endorse

143
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,940
Bob as my running mate in this year's election

144
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,920
and this is the hour of

145
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,660
slack in Dallas, Texas. You know,

146
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,080
I know where that is.

147
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,260
The hour of slack has brought lymph node,

148
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,840
pleasure, joy, sex, sex

149
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,760
hurt, sex dirt, excremeditation,

150
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,680
hours and hours of pooping,

151
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,360
chick, light at night,

152
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,320
stinky,

153
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,760
a surefire way to cut the hippies out of

154
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,640
my living room, an excuse

155
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,200
to do nothing on Saturday night,

156
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,120
a feel that purple giggles,

157
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,280
terrible earthy smells on my

158
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,680
index and middle finger,

159
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,120
terrible paranoia, the soundtrack

160
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,380
to a psychotic breakdown,

161
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,500
canyons and fungions,

162
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,000
the night sweats,

163
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,880
a surefire repudiation

164
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,320
of powerfully religions,

165
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,600
the grievous monkeys

166
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,000
versus robots,

167
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,960
the jinger device,

168
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,920
more slack than I can shake his dick at,

169
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,080
and all for the price

170
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,020
of my mortal soul.

171
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,020
Or triple my money back.

172
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,880
Thanks, Bob.

173
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,220
Thanks, Ivan.

174
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,000
And last, I have control of your radio tubes.

175
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,560
And I do, too.

176
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,060
Good. This is Ren Hoack.

177
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,540
And this is Stimson J. Catt

178
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,000
of the Ren and Stimpy Show.

179
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,460
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack.

180
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,260
Keep listening, you idiots.

181
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

182
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

183
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,600
Else I shall kill you!

184
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,020
Oh, the Hour of Slack.

185
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,200
All I can say is thank Dobbs

186
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,100
we've got it.

187
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,520
It was the reliable, cheap laughs

188
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,380
that made me first tune in, but

189
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,560
I soon found out that it was

190
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,680
so much more than just a radio show.

191
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,040
In between

192
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,920
the gut-splitting yawks were solid

193
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,120
nuggets of bright subgenius wisdom

194
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,060
to which I clung like an

195
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,860
ant hanging desperately onto

196
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,700
a floating matchstick and a claw

197
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,960
overflowing stinking

198
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,740
crapper.

199
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,920
Oh, with this silly little dog and prairie

200
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,040
squid show, Stang has taught

201
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,060
the Yeti spore to blow it

202
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:51,760
out our ass.

203
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,540
He gave us the recipe to take the

204
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,680
environmental psycho-venom of normal

205
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,760
life, top it with our own

206
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,780
spew, and hurl that toxic

207
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,900
pie right back into the face of the

208
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,020
con. And for a thousand

209
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,320
times out of the gate,

210
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,720
he has fulfilled his insidious

211
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,500
agenda of keeping the

212
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,100
Einsteins alive.

213
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,580
And every week

214
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,460
when we hear that agglomeration

215
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,520
of ranting voices echoing

216
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,500
through the ether, we know

217
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,220
with unassailable certainty

218
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,460
that we are not

219
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,120
alone.

220
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,520
And I, for one, can't

221
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,440
thank him enough for it.

222
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,560
Try getting a

223
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,240
laugh out of him after that, you

224
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,640
Dallas street mime.

225
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:39,540
Friends,

226
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,320
is your day-to-day ridiculous existence

227
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,300
at the hands of squealing self-important

228
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,160
normals wearing out your stinker?

229
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,540
Has the endless stream of Guero, Pander, and

230
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,480
Pablum on your TV set contaminated your

231
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,480
precious bodily fluids? Well, stew

232
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,560
no longer in your own bile, because the Church of the

233
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,700
Subgenius brings you the Hour of Slack

234
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,060
self-improvement course.

235
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,420
This series of 1,000 cassettes and

236
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,420
compact discs will allow you to maximize your

237
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,540
abnormality potential, eliminating wasteful guilt

238
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,480
from your life, and changing you into a spinning

239
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,380
rampaging example of self-actualization

240
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,460
at the expense of the normie worms, who,

241
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,140
as you've ruled your life while you were away.

242
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,300
Let's just see what a few happy users of the

243
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,200
Hour of Slack self-improvement course have to say.

244
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,560
My brain looks sort of like a smoker's lung.

245
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,520
It's not healthy for the children.

246
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,560
Would you like another lucky stroke?

247
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:23,660
Don't cry!

248
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,260
All this can be

249
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,780
yours today. Just send $13,013

250
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,140

00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,260
self-improvement course.

Please allow 999 weeks for delivery.

255
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,860
How the hell does he do that?

256
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,220
See from the Lymphoid Institute in Atlanta,

257
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,480
the first time I heard the Hour of Slack, like

258
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,680
many was on an ass-enjoying car.

259
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,080
Later, while building a large mural

260
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,060
out of waffles, the individual

261
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,620
the waffle holes became

262
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,920
pixels, and the syrup dripped

263
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,740
to make Bob's hair, and

264
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,160
with the insertion of what I'll call a pipe,

265
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,880
what was really more of an elephant's house.

266
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,960
I said, Bob, and Bob

267
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,900
turned to me and said,

268
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,860
nothing, because he was really made of waffles.

269
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,920
But thank you, Ivan. I've enjoyed the

270
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,480
Hour of Slack for these many years.

271
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,260
I hope to for years.

272
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,040
This is Doc from the Lymphnode Institute,

273
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,120
and the first time I encountered the Hour of Slack

274
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,400
I smelled like pizza,

275
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,280
and I was looking at God,

276
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,800
and realized that he had a pipe in his mouth.

277
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,780
And I became intensely panicked,

278
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,000
and realized that I must surrender

279
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,800
to this force, or it would

280
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,360
surely kill me.

281
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,760
And that's when I knew I was

282
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,700
listening to the Hour of Slack

283
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,840
on WREK Atlanta.

284
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,080
I like

285
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,200
Shane Ross Buddhism.

286
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,340
Because it's the world's

287
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,120
kindest religion. It's a

288
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,440
branch of Amida Buddhism. Amida

289
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,540
was the Buddha of boundless compassion

290
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,320
who refused to enter nirvana

291
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,380
until all sentient beings could enter

292
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,420
with him. So the teaching arose that

293
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,120
if you called on him in Japanese,

294
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,460
the name is Namu

295
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,520
Amida Butsu, in the name of Amida

296
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,300
Buddha, with true faith

297
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,420
you will eventually, no matter how many

298
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,440
incarnations it takes, you'll eventually get rid of

299
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,300
all the negativity and become pure,

300
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,480
enlightened. And Shane Ross,

301
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,400
a reformer, said that's asking too

302
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,440
much of people. Some people are just not capable

303
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,400
of true faith. They have a constantly

304
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,360
skeptical and questioning mind. They

305
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,260
should not be banned from release.

306
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,560
He taught that if you say Namu

307
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,660
Amida Butsu, whether you believe in it or not,

308
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,520
it will work. I like that. That's

309
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,540
my idea of a religion that doesn't give anybody

310
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,500
a bum trip. Most religions seem to

311
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,560
concentrate on putting people on bum trips.

312
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,480
You know, that's the only religion

313
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,440
in the world I know that never puts you on a bum

314
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,660
trip. If you've said it just once,

315
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,480
and I've said it three times, I'd say,

316
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,200
they can ask Namu Amida Butsu.

317
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,300
Guaranteed. He's like a

318
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,480
finance company in reverse. He wants to give you

319
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,380
something for nothing. How can you

320
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,500
reject a short-term, interim

321
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,600
savior like that? His only real competition

322
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,240
is J.R. Bob Tubbs.

323
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,460
Hello, brothers and sisters

324
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,440
in Slack. This is Reverend

325
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,600
Salatia. And

326
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,380
I tune into the Hour of Slack

327
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,280
every week, mostly

328
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,320
just to hear Reverend Sang

329
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,860
say, Ah,

330
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,300
yes, dear friends.

331
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,860
But in addition

332
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,700
to that, I also like

333
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,260
to subscribe to the show

334
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,880
because, um,

335
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,300
every shit and fuck

336
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,400
are sacred in this church.

337
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,780
And to not have

338
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,700
those included in my

339
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,600
Hour of Slack just doesn't get

340
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,080
me there. You know what I mean?

341
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,300
Bob. Bob. Bob.

342
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,540
Bob. Bob. Bob. Bob.

343
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,700
Bob. Bob. Bob. Bob.

344
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,580
Bob. Bob. Bob.

345
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:40,760
Bob.

346
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,300
Bob. Bob. Bob. Bob.

347
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,180
Bob. Bob. Bob. Bob.

348
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,180
Bob. Bob. Bob. Bob.

349
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,900
Bob. Bob. Bob. Bob.

350
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,720
Bob. Bob. Bob. Bob.

351
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:51,920
Bob. Bob. Bob. Bob.

352
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:51,920


353
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:51,920


354
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,660
One over twenty years, a bastion

355
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,180
of idiocy. A bastion

356
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,960
of... what is that?

357
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,480
Wax behind your head?

358
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,980
A bastion of brainiacs.

359
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,020
Oh, I see what it is. It's a little device.

360
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,520
I thought it was a piece of

361
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,680
candle wax stuck there by some

362
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,400
errant being.

363
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,720
Oh, yes.

364
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,780
Well, we're going to break here for a minute.

365
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:23,460
There's actually more of those recorded commentations from the Cabbage Gallery.

366
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:33,040
We heard there, we actually, the last person we heard from just before Reverend Salacia was Robert Anton Wilson, Pope Bob.

367
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:48,880
We heard Doc Ellis, O. Rex, Reverend Susie the Flusie, Ren and Stimpy, Lymph Note Institute, St. Pat Paulson, Princess We Are Doe, Norrell Preff, more and all of everything.

368
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:53,180
Father Guido Sarducci coming up, actually, and Dr. Timothy Leary.

369
00:17:53,220 --> 00:18:00,780
But we have letters here, friends, from people who have, oh, an ego plum did the music behind Princess We.

370
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,840
I should mention that.

371
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,020
We used to play a lot of ego.

372
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,520
Ego plum.

373
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,460
We've got, our egos are very plum, aren't they?

374
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:21,520
Your ego is like a big fleshy vegetable that can be plucked off of some sort of two-toed tree that wanders hither and yon, spreading lies and innuendo for 20 years.

375
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,580
For 25 years.

376
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,400
Airwaves with Piskama and Wendabar.

377
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,000
Another, with collusion.

378
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,020
Collusion with the Piskama.

379
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,920
Powers that aren't.

380
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,700
And confusion.

381
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,360
With J.R. Slon Dodds.

382
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,860
I mean, the king, the god, the godman, man.

383
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,740
The man with the.

384
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,480
Get with it, dude.

385
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,160
Twisted DNA.

386
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,900
Man, wooden woman, man, man, woman.

387
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,100
Into more rubber band-like shapes than anyone could imagine.

388
00:18:50,600 --> 00:19:01,560
I want to read, as we promised, I'm going to read some, we're all going to read some of the mail that came in when we asked for commentations on the hour.

389
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,900
Of a thousand slacks.

390
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:10,020
And this fellow here, this is, we don't know this person, nor is he employed by our ministry.

391
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,180
Jared.

392
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,580
Dread the lone yeti in Canada says,

393
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,700
I just have to thank, congratulate, and praise you all on the 1,000 episode.

394
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,120
I found out about the church when I downloaded and listened to a Frank Zappa interview with Larry King.

395
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,380
They mentioned the church for that interview.

396
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,960
And the rest is history.

397
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,760
I looked up subgenius on the web and found my new faith.

398
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,240
I can't begin to explain how much slack the church brings me in a day.

399
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:51,120
I was unemployed when Bob found me and wasting away in a slump of bad pills and bad sex.

400
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:57,100
I have since then found a new job where I use Bob's teachings daily.

401
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,160
My job is to motivate and teach people how to.

402
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:00,720
Sell!

403
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,120
And we are selling some total crap!

404
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:10,520
And praise Bob, without forcing and trying, I'm making all these pink boys selling and into it.

405
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,060
And I can get the best results out of my peers.

406
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,580
I am fooling those pink boys into thinking I am some sales guru.

407
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,140
And all praise due to Bob and the Haas.

408
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,440
Hour of Slack.

409
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,500
Hail the Hour of Slack.

410
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,920
I want to touch and feel every episode until Wotan takes me away.

411
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,140
Or the Exists come for us.

412
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:39,580
Well that is quite a fine alacrity, a piece of abnormal growth that is coming right out of the side of you again.

413
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,060
Very much so.

414
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,280
I mean within your own sight of course.

415
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:48,240
But this man that, is it a woman or is it a, what is it that sent this letter in?

416
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,440
That you just read?

417
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,180
Oh that, I won't make it.

418
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:51,640
I won't make it.

419
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,180
I won't make it.

420
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,840
We know only that it was a Yeti.

421
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,920
Only as a Yeti.

422
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,460
Okay, shall I read this letter from Ree Stang?

423
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,320
You asked for our comments at the end of the Hour of Slack.

424
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,280
I didn't know.

425
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,800
Is the Hour of Slack ending?

426
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:06,840
Oh, anyway.

427
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,400
No, no.

428
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,320
Ree Stang.

429
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,740
You asked for our comments at the end of the Hour of Slack.

430
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,980
I joined the church a few years ago after I knew who I was.

431
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,580
No, I'm sorry.

432
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,720
After I knew what it was.

433
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:29,900
But it was clear Bob was talking to me like art through Devo whenever I was asleep or in a cabin.

434
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:34,680
I'm not going to give away my age or how old I am right now.

435
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,720
I'll wait until later.

436
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,980
We need Bob now more than ever.

437
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:43,480
Mark Mothersbaugh once said that he's an enema for a constipated society.

438
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:53,480
I'm alarmed at the use and the, well, the lack of use and the care of the conspiracy religion are destroying our planet.

439
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,620
Those exes can't arrive one minute too soon.

440
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,900
I believe the exeans, he called them, are the exeans.

441
00:21:59,900 --> 00:21:59,900


442
00:21:59,900 --> 00:21:59,900


443
00:21:59,900 --> 00:21:59,900


444
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,340
He calls them the exeans, not the exes.

445
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,440
Oh, that might mean Christians.

446
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,560
That might be shortened.

447
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,500
Yeah, that's the way we shorten, like in Xmas.

448
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:13,580
The wearers of the crossed hockey stick stand to particularly procreate at a deliberately slow rate

449
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:20,060
using only the germs and the vibration method ordained by the Church of Nome.

450
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,480
I guess they're talking about the Eskimos again.

451
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,140
I hope I'm not reading this wrong.

452
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:29,100
Our ardor grows stronger with each glimpse at his

453
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:29,900
nakedness.

454
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,020
I hope I'm not reading this wrong.

455
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,020


456
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:37,560
Bob, although we know he's a plastered white-faced mannequin, is more than an icon.

457
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:43,740
But we're all going to have a last laugh when the saucers come from planet X.

458
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,540
He thinks they're coming from planet X.

459
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,580
That's so cute.

460
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,080
Coming from planet X.

461
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:49,520
They are.

462
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,260
Well, in a fashion, they're coming from there.

463
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,840
There's no location involved in this.

464
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,020
Right.

465
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:54,720
Evacuation.

466
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,680
That's what the news media calls it.

467
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,740
Just clear in this place and you're going to be a part of it if you want to.

468
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,020
Anyway, can you dig it?

469
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:08,900
In case the saucers and the church don't have any new address since I moved from, shall I say,

470
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,700
the state or could he be found there?

471
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:15,640
Move from pessimania, pessimism, here it is.

472
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:21,440
Deranged ex-bark 231 Hogan Avenue.

473
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,060
No, you don't need to give the entire.

474
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,720
No, we can move on.

475
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,300
New Halcyon.

476
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,860
We can move on to the next one there.

477
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,420
Yes, let's move on to the next one.

478
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,640
He's getting clogged up in the internet.

479
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:29,720
Let's move on to the next one.

480
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,200
Anyway, keep it up.

481
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,200
I guess they're talking about the erectile dysfunction problem there.

482
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,720
Keep it up and keep it happening.

483
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,340
You said it.

484
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:36,800
Close it.

485
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:45,900
Well, now here's a letter from Reverend Yukon Jack of W.I.C.A.

486
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,280
in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

487
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,240
All right.

488
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,420
This is oh, this is a touching one.

489
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,740
He says he first heard the word of Bob in December of 1986.

490
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:07,360
When my friend Charles in Garland, Texas, started sending me tapes of the hour of slack from KNON.

491
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,880
That's garlic tennis.

492
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:14,080
I started broadcasting it on my station in Pasadena every Sunday afternoon.

493
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:21,340
I began tape correspondence with the Reverend Eris Pagana in summer 1991.

494
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,660
After gaining inspiration from the shows, I began sending them to

495
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,460
her in Milwaukee.

496
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:36,580
She saw the wisdom of Bob and for a brief time, she aired them on W.M.S.E.,

497
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,920
a local college station in Milwaukee.

498
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:46,280
Bob then brought me and Eris together in 1996, and the broadcasts on W.I.C.A.

499
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,260
began and continue to this day.

500
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:55,740
Eris and I shared several great times at X Day Drills in Brushwood, where we ran W.B.O.B.

501
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,220
radio.

502
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:03,780
At the drill in 2000, Bob brought Eris and Reverend DJ together, and they were married

503
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,180
by the Reverend Stang himself in May 2002.

504
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:13,860
Although Eris is no longer on this plane, I know that she has achieved eternal slack

505
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,860
with Bob and Connie.

506
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,840
Bob helped all three of us realize our life's long-term dreams.

507
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,120
It can surely be said that anything is possible with Bob.

508
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,820
Have mercy and praise Bob and hail Connie.

509
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,200
I am Bob.

510
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:26,640
I am Eris.

511
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,080
I am Eris.

512
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:32,980
It's amazing that these people who have donated so much of their extra sweat and any other

513
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,160
glandular juices they can create.

514
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,080
That's right.

515
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:40,840
I was just going to say, are they as such, or are they just perhaps a projection of you

516
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,120
know what?

517
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,580
But you know, they do sweat and they put a lot of it into sending their feelings, their

518
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,560
thoughts, their doubts.

519
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,440
I can whiff it.

520
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:47,880
Perhaps.

521
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,800
Whiff it from here.

522
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,900
You've been down with it for at least four.

523
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,280
Whiff it.

524
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,460
Whiffing it.

525
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,180
And you've been indeed without it for quite a while.

526
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:56,180


527
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:56,180


528
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:56,180


529
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:56,180


530
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:56,180


531
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:56,620
Quite some time.

532
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,080
Anyway.

533
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,160
Oh, that's enough of these letters.

534
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,600
Let's skip over to these.

535
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,120
We'll come back to the letters in a minute.

536
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,760
We'll go back to the tapes.

537
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:07,500
I believe this is the hideous deformed Artemia Salina.

538
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,900
I just like to thank him for vibrating so hard.

539
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,000
That's all.

540
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:12,860
Slimy.

541
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,580
Oh, there we go.

542
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:13,940
Okay.

543
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:18,060
Hello, Reverend Stang and listeners of Hour of Slack.

544
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,280
This is Artemia Salina.

545
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,860
I just wanted to say congratulations on your 1000th show.

546
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,160
And to the viewers of the show.

547
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,980
To those who have been listening since the first show, I wish you a swift recovery.

548
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:36,540
And now a word of explanation about my voice, which some of you may have found to be a bit

549
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:36,940
unusual.

550
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:42,540
You see several years ago, I was involved in an unfortunate accident in which a large

551
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:48,440
quantity of hydrocarboplast-geoclase acid was spilled into a container of sulfurodiglase

552
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,240
dimethylhydrobromocrustoside.

553
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,560
The combination of these two otherwise inert chemicals caused a reaction,

554
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,300
which was quite violent indeed.

555
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:03,240
Though I am a man of science, the accident not only destroyed my voice books, but it also

556
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,800
damaged the part of my brain that makes me want to seek qualified medical attention.

557
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,520
Instead I sought the services of Dr. Noumanet, who has a recurring advert from the local

558
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,080
bargain hunter's periodical.

559
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:20,320
Dr. Noumanet offered to cobble together a cheaply made electronic voice books for me

560
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,720
in exchange for my eternal soul and the cost of materials.

561
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,140
Dr. Noumanet's voice books were not only a source of information, but also a source of information.

562
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:30,080
I was also convinced to refuse, and to this day it is my only means of audible speech.

563
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:37,780
Once again however, I wish to extend my congratulations to you for not fucking burning out after all this time.

564
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:39,580
Bob?

565
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:46,620
Hello Bob, this is Father Guido Sarducci, formerly Pope Maurice of the People's Catholic Church,

566
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,660
and all of my fellow popes from the People's Catholic Church.

567
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,680
Salute to the Church of the Sabbath Genius.

568
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,780
Carry on.

569
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,340
The hour of lack will ha-

570
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,120
over your own eyes so that if you worry about the fact that you are not able to hear the

571
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:56,120


572
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,580
message of the hour of lack, your mind will be hanging on the slide so that you never shut.

573
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,640
The hour of lack is a deadly danger that is slowly unfolding and will violently twist us.

574
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,480
The hour of lack may cause your toddler who never swore to suddenly disrobe and run down

575
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:04,880
the street screaming,

576
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,080
Locus!

577
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:05,440
Locus!

578
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,820
The hour of lack is responsible for the time you hold in your head for all share.

579
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,660
The hour of lack is only open wide lab rat.

580
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,700
The hour of lack is no longer for you, just running your goody.

581
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,340
Hello, this is Timothy Larry, reminding you that just as you need slack,

582
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,740
KNON needs your help.

583
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,060
Send in those pledges, and praise Bob.

584
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:25,820
Hey!

585
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,620
Bob?

586
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,600
Bob?

587
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:42,900


588
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:43,300


589
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,340
Bob?

590
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:44,340


591
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:44,340


592
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:44,340


593
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:44,340


594
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:48,260
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

595
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,400
This is Mr.

596
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,320
This is Mr.

597
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:55,800
This is Mr.

598
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:55,800


599
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:04,680
So this is my tribute to the black white folks and the hour of lack.

600
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,000
Praise Bob!

601
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:16,080
And watch them pounce upon themselves if they can't hide a person's dream.

602
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,420
Hello brothers and sisters in slack, this is Reverend Salatia.

603
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,780
Hello brothers and sisters in slack, this is Reverend Salatia.

604
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,460
Tune into the hour of slack every week.

605
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:34,020
Mostly just to hear Fernando Dandy Lee-mer say you rang.

606
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,020
Don't grin.

607
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,280
Don't grin.

608
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,560
Don't grin.

609
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:37,820
Ah!

610
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:40,500
Bob.

611
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,800
Please, please, Bob.

612
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,820
Oh, yes dear friends.

613
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:52,800
This is Li Li-Qing, a Chinese subgenius, and you are listening to the hour of slack.

614
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,620
Remember, Bob is the hour of slack.

615
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:55,700
Remember, Bob is the hour of slack.

616
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:55,760
Remember, Bob is the hour of slack.

617
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,360
is the comrades of all people.

618
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,960
Here in China, just like in America,

619
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,280
the people need slack.

620
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,580
In Chinese, we call slack le tian tai.

621
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,320
But it must be true slack,

622
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,260
not the bad slack of the conspirators.

623
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,760
Hi, this is Pat Paulson.

624
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,760
I'd like to endorse Bob as my running mate in this year's election.

625
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,960
Bob's a lot of... well, he's not fun, anyway.

626
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,640
But anyway, this is the hour of slack in Dallas, Texas.

627
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,000
One of my shoes got cow stuff on them.

628
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,960
J.R. Dobbs, Bob Dobbs, J.R. Bob Dobbs

629
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,300
was on the number one list of frauds and phonies for Time magazine,

630
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,700
and I didn't know who he was.

631
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,060
And J.R. Bob Dobbs is the creator of the Church of the Subgenius.

632
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,100
This guy, the Reverend Ivan Stang, is one of their...

633
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,580
Disciples.

634
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:46,580
Disciples.

635
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,040
Yeah, all right.

636
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:49,720
You know, it's funny.

637
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,440
I don't think Jesus had a disciple named Dopey.

638
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,540
Poor Bob.

639
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,360
Hi, this is Bob from Hack House,

640
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,060
greeting you in the name of Bob,

641
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,940
partly on behalf of Voice of Bob.

642
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,480
I'd like to share with you a little bit of the story of how I got involved

643
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,560
with Bob the Communist against the Nazis.

644
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,120
And that's exactly what happened, and that's...

645
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:16,240
Bob, he marks the beginning of something in my heart.

646
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,640
When he stripped in front of all these men red-hot pokers,

647
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,700
put in his body for me,

648
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,560
and I would certainly like...

649
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:23,840
I'd like to come.

650
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,480
Just go to persecution.com.

651
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:28,900
Persecution.com.

652
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,360
Let them know you're coming.

653
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,200
For I was hungry, and you gave me pot.

654
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,500
I was thirsty, and you gave me a hole.

655
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,800
I was a stranger.

656
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,920
I was naked, and you did it to me.

657
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,380
Persecution.com.

658
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,660
It's a vital form of physical relief.

659
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,080
I'm normally here to sell you.

660
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,740
The government wanting to get even.

661
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,960
Well, that's all for today, my friends.

662
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,220
Reverend Shane Smoker, and quite frankly,

663
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,800
the only reason why I listen to this show,

664
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,380
is to hear the...

665
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,540
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

666
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,560
See, I can't even bloody do it, but hell,

667
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,900
I think it's bloody funny.

668
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,680
Um, a thousand shows.

669
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,260
Well, stangy.

670
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:05,700
Stang!

671
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,300
Dave and Princess Wee.

672
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:09,880
Congratulations.

673
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,880
Bloody congratulations.

674
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,140
And, uh, praise Bob.

675
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,420
And, uh...

676
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,320
I really couldn't put my thought into this, did I?

677
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,580
I mean, this is quite a, um, a milestone.

678
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:29,800
Ah.

679
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,400
Um...

680
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,940
Still not a minute, though.

681
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,500
So, I'm just gonna, uh...

682
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,200
Oh, man.

683
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,740
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

684
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,140
I'm such an idiot.

685
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,060
Ha ha ha ha ha!

686
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,600
Hello, brothers.

687
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,860
And sisters in Slack.

688
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,920
This is Reverend Salacia.

689
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,100
And I tune into the Hour of Slack every week.

690
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,660
Mostly just to hear Reverend Stang say,

691
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,920
Superior mutants.

692
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,460
REVEND QUIT YOUR JOBS!

693
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,660
SLACK OFF!

694
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:14,540
The world ends tomorrow, and you may die!

695
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,800
But in addition to that,

696
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,440
I also like to subscribe to it.

697
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:19,900
PR News.

698
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,340
Because, um, every...

699
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,180
PR News.

700
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,220
And...

701
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:24,980
Cowboy!

702
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,860
...are sacred in this church.

703
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:34,540
And to not have those included in my Hour of Slack just doesn't get me there, you know what I mean.

704
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,780
So, uh...

705
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,040
Sit down. Don't sit down.

706
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,800
But at least set your dogs to find them.

707
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,540
RAAAAAAA!

708
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,100
I'm finding it difficult to breathe.

709
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,620
There's a subgenius Saturday night for ya.

710
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,440
And I say, as long as you're alive,

711
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,800
shout, make noise, or whatever,

712
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,800
because when you're dead,

713
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,460
you shut up like hell!

714
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,760
Just a walnut from a fire.

715
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,780
The oozing sauce.

716
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:09,980
The minions of the Hour of Slack luring their way towards the moss.

717
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,040
Hoping against hope,

718
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,160
they can get one fatal glimpse of the man himself.

719
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,500
The resin f- the rev-

720
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,640
Let me get this right.

721
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,120
I can read this right.

722
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,120
The Reverend Horace Smith-

723
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,340
Oh, no. I- Ivan Sting.

724
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,640
Of the Church of the Subgenius.

725
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:30,780
The Pro-Creative Cult-Meister of the Religion of Bob.

726
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,120
J.R.

727
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,580
Robert.

728
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,160
No. J.R.

729
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:35,820
Bob.

730
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,780
Dobbs.

731
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:41,340
A man who is more than a man. He's...

732
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:46,160
Part-Huma, part-Boomer, part-Boomer, and part-St-

733
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,020
Boomer.

734
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,020
And we-

735
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,520
And we're-

736
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:59,160
All the peoples of the world shall someday rise up and shout his name and be as disappointed as that little slackluster girl laying in the gucker.

737
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:03,120
Now I can tell things are gonna change.

738
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,020
But hey, enough of that.

739
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:05,980
Yeah.

740
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:12,320
I'd like to read a letter now if I may, should I not? No.

741
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,780
I will find her.

742
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,200
This, uh, singing in the background.

743
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,740
This is the voice of Mr. Fernanda Nande-Lemur.

744
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,680
This is him actually singing.

745
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:26,720
The...

746
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,900
When you listen to a man like this, you'll know he's more than a subgenius.

747
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,280
He is a true-

748
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,180
Man, that is really- that's just amazing, friends.

749
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,980
May the skin on my crawls go out.

750
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,680
Bob just wants to have fun.

751
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,920
Like dog-fuck.

752
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,540
As Mark Mothersbaugh plays here in the background.

753
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,720
Duck fat.

754
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,800
Not- no.

755
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,340
Bob's just want to have fun.

756
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,260
Oh, Bob's just want to have fun.

757
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:09,560
These are offerings of- not worship, what should we call them? Offerings of-

758
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,520
Off- offerings-

759
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,740
Of humility towards what has-

760
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,500
Of offing.

761
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,000
Miss-

762
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,520
Of humility towards what has to be in the offing.

763
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,180
Offing of all pinks of the planet Earth.

764
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,520
But with love in our hearts, you know.

765
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:28,220
We're not like blind milkmen wearing pancake makeup looking like so many mannequins packing out,

766
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,980
passing a little carnations for Bob.

767
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,500
No, we are-

768
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,460
Well, we're sorta like that.

769
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,820
We are the red carnation for Bob, and as we raise our fist in the air,

770
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,940
we're usually clutching at our own foreskins.

771
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:43,560
And we're not convinced yet, but we still believe that slack, any form of slack, given or misgiven,

772
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,060
is the best thing there is.

773
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:46,680
I'm sorry, I-

774
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,560
That's beautiful.

775
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,600
I could go on for-

776
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:48,840
That's beautiful.

777
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,600
I thought you were reading that from some letter that I'd handed you.

778
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:55,600
I thought you wanted me to cut it short as like a bad bowel movement, and so I did.

779
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,360
I-

780
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,080
I was cutting it short?

781
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,280
Well, you looked at me and I thought, Dave, will you wrap it up, please?

782
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,280
We've gotta get on to-

783
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,860
Oh, no, I just looked at you.

784
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,300
I was looking at you in puzzlement, like where'd that all come from?

785
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:05,920
Well, first-

786
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,100
Don't you have a letter there from another reverend to get a different reverend?

787
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:11,680
Yeah, right.

788
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,220
This piece of gaggies comes all the way from Sydney.

789
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:17,560
No, that sounds too cocky, doesn't it?

790
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,260
Anyway, I'll try it.

791
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:18,980
I'll try it real hard.

792
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,260
Sounds good.

793
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:26,980
Lama Cabo Dave, Princess Wee, Susie the Floozy, and all the dry web cockamamie bleebers down

794
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,380
at WCSB.

795
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,500
Thank you for all the slack.

796
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,400
No, that's-

797
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,680
I've gone to all the way-

798
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:35,700
It's fine.

799
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:35,860
It's fine.

800
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:36,560
Keep going.

801
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,280
Keep going.

802
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:37,600
Keep going.

803
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:37,940
Keep going.

804
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:44,200
His name's Reverend Chainsmacker, and he's a dildo do-raiser.

805
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:44,200


806
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:44,200


807
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,080
I wouldn't even remember my last name, how'd that hang out here?

808
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:47,080


809
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:59,220
I didn't know it was Iney Sbexok I can show you-

810
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,340
If you remember the fullatas line, it's strung out from broken Netflix.

811
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:05,060
And it, of course, is dumbo dope.

812
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,660
Well, let's just get all the way around.

813
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:08,660


814
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,800
The Waiting Room Party.

815
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,220
Clпис, we gotta stop.

816
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:17,520
It takes place on the audio frequencies of your inner ear.

817
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,760
It has hidden messages and meanings.

818
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,520
No commercialism.

819
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,440
Any heyday anky-panky of the right-wing Enlighteners.

820
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,680
And what's this?

821
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,420
The Akashic Records for 21.

822
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:37,220
And it's perfect with white wine and a bag of cheese.

823
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,720
Well, I guess that's more of a New Zealander somewhere.

824
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:43,800
Pardon me.

825
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,640
Boy, you got me.

826
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,900
That's beautiful.

827
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,140
Well, Princess Reedy, you have another letter from a reader?

828
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:51,320
Well, yes, I do.

829
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,400
I have another letter.

830
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,320
It's from a Charlie Fulton.

831
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,980
I'm going to pull this Soso Dada down in the background.

832
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,240
This letter says,

833
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,400
Greetings, Reverend Stang.

834
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:10,200
Just wanted to say that I've been listening to and enjoying The Hour of Slack since episode 836.

835
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,200
I always enjoy listening to Luminescence.

836
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,560
I love the Murr's cut-ups, the banter of ESO Swamp Radio,

837
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,520
while I miss hearing Professor Chaz Smith,

838
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,460
it's always great to hear Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

839
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,600
and great segments from Reverend Susie the Flusie,

840
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,520
and the Puzzling Evidence Show.

841
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,800
The Hour of Slack is one of the biggest reasons that I have DSL,

842
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,380
since none of the pink stations where I live carry the show.

843
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,140
Happily, my job allows me to keep a picture of Bob at my cubicle,

844
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,100
so I can keep some smalls.

845
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,140
I'm a semblance of slack in the office.

846
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,900
Praise Bob!

847
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,660
And that's from Charlie Fulton in Chico, California.

848
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,080
Thanks, Charlie!

849
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,400
Especially from a guy with a disease, you know, sending, you know,

850
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,560
wasting all his hard urine, squids, and his urine,

851
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,020
to send a letter through all the problems that you can get through sending a letter,

852
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,860
just to express that, I mean, the guy's got DSL for cripes almighty.

853
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:10,400
And you know, that can be nearly so flash, so flash.

854
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,200
Anyway, I was going to say that this is not a,

855
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,560
not an anti-local phenomenon,

856
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,700
it's a post-procreative inclusive web phenomenon,

857
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,920
meaning that you could catch it on your foot,

858
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:24,320
you could see it somewhere, like on the back gangly,

859
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,880
that are connected to your inner eye and so forth.

860
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,340
When we talk about the web, we're talking about the webbing in your body.

861
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:37,320
So I just want to say that Don Velo is not the real name of Dr. Sarducci,

862
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,940
but he was actually born in Ashtabula,

863
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,180
and he was a graduate of Lorraine High School,

864
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,260
and he was a friend of Dave Sheridan,

865
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,980
who was a fabulous furry,

866
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,460
Hurshute brothers.

867
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,180
History, friends!

868
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:51,940
Yes, history!

869
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,180
Long years of ancient, deadly history.

870
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:56,840
Histoire!

871
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,240
And for all those times and years,

872
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:03,860
everyone has been a defleccity for your beloved cockamamie organism.

873
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:20,420
That's Martin Mothersbaugh jamming away in the background in the early 80s

874
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:24,220
when he first got his Fairlight synthesizer, friends.

875
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:30,540
And maybe I should, I do have another letter and some more tapes to play,

876
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:35,940
but you know, I should do the shout-out, as we planned,

877
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,560
to all the stations, friends, that play the Hour of Slack,

878
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,820
that make this possible, that make us do this,

879
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:47,960
that force us to devolve into this every week.

880
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,860
Like a bleating goat.

881
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:55,760
We have, first, the ones that keep us on the internet, friends,

882
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,280
sensoryresearch.com or .net or .org.

883
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,780
Sensory research is how we keep, keeps us going.

884
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,380
Radio For All is another group.

885
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:12,220
And you know, Reverend Prostata Kontata

886
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:17,660
was the person who first set us up streaming MP3s to begin with.

887
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:21,240
And friends, I don't know what we would have done

888
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,640
without the great Saint David Bochner up there in Canada.

889
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:27,800
Bochner was the one who turned it into internet streaming

890
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,160
for years and years and years.

891
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,160
Only recently have I taken that job upon myself.

892
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:37,560
Before David Bochner, there was the great Reverend Juan Derrer.

893
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,540
And friends,

894
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:43,260
in the early days, of course,

895
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:47,500
who was it that first gazed at that picture of Bob with me and said,

896
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,380
let's work for this guy?

897
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,920
Dr. Philo Drummond, friends.

898
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,560
The overman, the original overman,

899
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:59,660
for whom we owe our knowledge of the Bob-legness.

900
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:05,500
We must thank Mr. Opinion and George Nolan of the ancient KFJZ stations in Dallas,

901
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,660
who were the first people to put us on the radio.

902
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,620
Actually, it's Fort Worth.

903
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:13,000
And where would the Hour of Slack be without Puzzling Evidence?

904
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:18,420
Puzzling Evidence, who had actually the first subgenius radio show predating Hour of Slack,

905
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,800
started in like 1982 with Bob Nelson's show,

906
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,540
which Puzzling Evidence took over.

907
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:29,620
And friends, Puzzling Evidence is where we learned how to do the weird editing that we do, many of us.

908
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:33,980
Glass Madness was the friend of Puzzling Evidence who had singing talent.

909
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:35,140
Lies!

910
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,160
St. Palmer Vreedes was a part of the show.

911
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:43,320
And Big Part then, as was the great Saint Gary Gaborg Fram.

912
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:50,220
And of course to this day, where would any hour of anything be without Dr. Howell?

913
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,840
Yes, Dr. Howell Robbins.

914
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:59,160
And lately, the good K-Rob, all together with Philo and Wellman on the KPFA show.

915
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:03,160
And friends, Reverend Susie the Flucy,

916
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:07,160
the woman who invented sax on WREK.

917
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:14,200
Byron Werner, Saint Byron Werner, he was the first media barrages.

918
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:18,660
And he actually invented the phrase Space Age Bachelor Pad.

919
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:22,580
Doctors for Bob from Little Rock, Arkansas,

920
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,720
seminally inseminated the very concept of doctor music and head launchings.

921
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:36,200
Hell Pope Huey was the first person to play our horrible tapes on the radio.

922
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,220
And contributed to them.

923
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:42,320
K-N-O-N in Dallas at one time was a great station.

924
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,980
And that's where we started in October 1985.

925
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,580
With Ranger Rita and even the help of Buck Naked.

926
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:59,140
The title Hour of Slack is based on a little one half sheet newsletter called Hour of Slack.

927
00:44:59,260 --> 00:44:59,740
Actually.

928
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:03,760
That Buck Naked once did before he was saved by a different religion.

929
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,680
Written on a chestmark then, wasn't it?

930
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,580
Entirely written on a chestmark then.

931
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:08,180
I've heard.

932
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:16,940
Friends, Reverend Bleepo Abernathy is the voice you hear saying the title of the show almost every week.

933
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,240
And he's actually the source of the celebrities.

934
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,540
He gave us those celebrities.

935
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:28,340
Reverend Erwin Chusid had us on WFMU in New Jersey for so long.

936
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:28,860
It was important.

937
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:35,120
Dr. Phineas Narco has always been a huge contributor and help to this show.

938
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,360
And the California show.

939
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,060
Jesus.

940
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:43,440
Jesus Devil Aqua has kept the subgenius foundation going in our darkest days.

941
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:50,820
And Mr. Fernanda Nandy Lee Murr is what makes the Hour of Slack sound like the Hour of Slack these days.

942
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,080
As somewhat similarly does the work of the great Norell Preff.

943
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:59,940
And other old doc binary Slack great men.

944
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,680
Such as Artemia Salina.

945
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,080
Heart Ignition.

946
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,100
And New Monet.

947
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:10,580
Can we forget Dr. Sinister of WCSB in Cleveland?

948
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:15,660
The great station who lets us call in and wreck his show.

949
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,660
Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

950
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,740
The ESO show with Chaz Smith.

951
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,700
Put us on the air all through the 90s.

952
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,800
And let us do the sloppy stuff.

953
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,820
How else would we know of the Oye Man?

954
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,700
Friends, we must thank so many contributors.

955
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,240
The El Queso All Stars.

956
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,000
Dr. Onan Canabite in the old days.

957
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,580
Pope David N. Meyer.

958
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,780
Brother Cleve Duncan.

959
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,160
Michael Pepe.

960
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,840
Dr. G. Gordon Gordon.

961
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:41,900
DK Jones.

962
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,440
Papa Joe Mama.

963
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:44,740
Dr. Legume.

964
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:47,540
Ed Strange had a subgenius show and helped a lot.

965
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:49,280
Craig Roll also did.

966
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,300
Friends, Deet and the bands.

967
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,740
The great bands of the Hour of Slack.

968
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:57,180
Starting with Doctors for Bob and Doctors for Wotan.

969
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,860
Followed shortly by Devo.

970
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,540
The Amino Acids.

971
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:01,420
Negative Land.

972
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,740
Little Theodore.

973
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,780
Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

974
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,660
The great King of Slack, Bill T. Miller.

975
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:08,840
Saint Anne.

976
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,320
And friends, the Swingin' Love Corpses.

977
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:20,060
And Dave, I think that you might remember an old comedy group that's probably we might want to give a tip of the hat to while we're doing our Slack credits.

978
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,740
By the name of the Firesign Theatre.

979
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:22,480
Indeed, indeed.

980
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,700
Firesign Theatre has pointed the way.

981
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:28,320
I don't think you and me would be in this room right now if it wasn't for the Firesign Theatre.

982
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:31,400
I don't think we could have an election if it wasn't for the Firesign Theatre.

983
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:31,400


984
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:36,680
The Firesign Theatre, which is taking up all the spaces on this bus there are, and so that's why we're...

985
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,300
Friends, some of you think, oh, they must have heard some Monty Python.

986
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:44,360
No, no, no. Monty Python was much, much, much later.

987
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,040
They might have heard some Goon Show.

988
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,440
Well, we might have, but we didn't.

989
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,100
What we heard was the Firesign Theatre!

990
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,320
Praise Reverend David Ostman.

991
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,380
Yes, dear friend.

992
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,100
The great Phil Proctor.

993
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,820
Phil Austin and Peter Bergman.

994
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:00,120
The...

995
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:01,860
Oh, oh.

996
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:02,760
David Ostman.

997
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:07,540
Oh, that was Devo doing the music in the background, and before that I think it was Onan Canobite.

998
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,560
No, now it's Onan Canobite.

999
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,200
Friends, the stations!

1000
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,120
The stations who've helped us out!

1001
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:18,420
Did I get around to the new station, WQFS in Greensboro, North Carolina?

1002
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:26,040
The great longtime players, WEFT in Champaign, Illinois.

1003
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,880
Gotta teach your heart, make a lot of money on real estate.

1004
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,100
Friends, believe it or not,

1005
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:35,620
in deep in Connecticut, WHUS plays the show because they dare!

1006
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:40,420
WICA, Wicca in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

1007
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:49,100
WMPG in Portland, Maine has played the Hour of Slack for nigh on to as long as WCSB here in Cleveland has.

1008
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:49,900
And they keep on going on that MPG.

1009
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,360
For like 10, 15 years.

1010
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:55,300
And thanks to Reverend Mike Townsend who put us on there.

1011
00:48:55,460 --> 00:49:00,100
In WCSB, I think it was originally first Reverend Toth Wilder got on.

1012
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,260
Got us on to that other WRUH.

1013
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:06,880
And then Mike Cole, Reverend Mike Cole helped keep us on.

1014
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,800
And Reverend Craig Callender.

1015
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:09,340
Yes.

1016
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,340
We must thank all of these folks.

1017
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:14,360
Praise Toth Wilder, Mike Coles, and Craig Callender.

1018
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:22,380
Out in Madison, Wisconsin, Sister Velveteen Sly on WORT has kept this show going.

1019
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:28,700
And friends, WREK at Georgia Tech in Atlanta not only plays the Hour of Slack,

1020
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:33,460
has the Suzy the Floozy Show, the Lymph Node Institute Show.

1021
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:36,260
Friends, where would we be?

1022
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:43,560
The South shall rise again with the help of WREK as well as WUTS in Sewanee, Tennessee.

1023
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,000
And WXEY in Kendallville, Indiana.

1024
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:53,040
And friends, let's not leave out KPFA in Berkeley.

1025
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,300
They don't play the Hour of Slack.

1026
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,540
They play the Puzzling Evidence Show.

1027
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,180
And we love them.

1028
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:58,680
I'm talking about them.

1029
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:04,920
And we love our subscribers who get the cuss-filled, uncensored internet shows.

1030
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:13,740
Dr. Tillis, Dr. Johnson, Reverend Crossan, Reverend Penton, Salacia, Cindy, Reverend Bill, Ely.

1031
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:17,480
Friends, the Hour of Slack thanks you all.

1032
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:23,540
We have done 1,000 billion years of hours because of you and this.

1033
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,680
This Dave.

1034
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,680
Think how many seconds have gone by since you've been on the show.

1035
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:39,520
I respect it, Lord관, absolutely a million.

1036
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:39,520


1037
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:39,520


1038
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,340
Just think about a little below, and it'll help you.

1039
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:40,900
Ah.

00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,800

1046
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:50,800


1047
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:50,800


1048
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:50,800


1049
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:50,800


1050
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:50,800


1051
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:50,800


1052
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:50,800


1053

Lu

1059
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,860
Think of yourself that way.

1060
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,600
Now drift slowly into a dream.

1061
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:01,940
A dream of your own creation.

1062
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,500
A huge...

1063
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:07,100
Man, that flying saucer, they look more like garbage cans.

1064
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:10,300
But the garbage cans of your own design have no fear.

1065
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:15,580
You make them with your mind and your lousy, dirty, stinking bucks.

1066
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,580
Is that all that's left of you?

1067
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,340
Oh, sorry. I'm just kidding.

1068
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,300
I forgot what happened.

1069
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,100
It's all right. It's all right.

1070
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,080
It's okay.

1071
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,000
It's been so 20,000 years.

1072
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:30,540
How many seconds has we been on the air for a thousand shows?

1073
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,560
That is a depressing thought.

1074
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,180
Yeah, when you think of it, nanoseconds, how long have we been...

1075
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:37,380
We never got out of here, man.

1076
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:39,220
I mean, you know, relatively.

1077
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,060
It's the show that refused to die.

1078
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,140
That's about it. You about got that right.

1079
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,680
Friends, let me read this one last...

1080
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,280
Actually, we have all kinds of filthy commentary that I could read.

1081
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:53,660
We got letters.

1082
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,380
They weren't exactly about the hour of slack.

1083
00:51:56,620 --> 00:52:01,460
Well, you can just indicate the word without actually slurring out the dirty word for the bad seven thing.

1084
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,280
This guy really gave me a reach around.

1085
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:08,680
This is someone named Mathael.

1086
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,040
Mathael?

1087
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,520
Yes, who said...

1088
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,020
I think the M and the R on his keyboard were screwed up.

1089
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:15,860
Maybe.

1090
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,780
You're like the famous painter Mathael.

1091
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:22,320
With the swinging love corpses in the background, Mathael typed...

1092
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,400
Mathael.

1093
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:23,940
I appreciate.

1094
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:29,420
I appreciate that the subgenius church makes a point of having people own their own truth.

1095
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:42,000
Congratulations on creating language that bypasses the filters people have that fool them into thinking they understand something just because they know a word for it.

1096
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:53,000
Bob, slack, the conspiracy, yakateesman, these are all useful terms because although people may not understand them, then they at least know that they don't.

1097
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,020
Unlike...

1098
00:52:54,020 --> 00:53:03,300
God, grace, etc., which most people have been fooled into thinking they understand, fresh terms help with a new view of ancient concepts.

1099
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:07,100
And he happens to like the...

1100
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:13,440
His favorite ones are the ones where Stang rants and reads from other tripped out writings.

1101
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:18,340
I have Revelation X and find it amazingly insightful and well articulated.

1102
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:20,980
Let's see.

1103
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I like the old subgenius.

1104
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:32,700
I like the subgenius recordings where it sounds like the terminology has been freshly created and I can hear the tenderness and love in the subgenius apostles' voices.

1105
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,780
Those would be the old tapes, I guess.

1106
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:42,560
I would like to learn more about the experiences, group trips, etc., that led to the articulation of church doctrine.

1107
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,080
What would he want to know?

1108
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:45,380
I'm sorry.

1109
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:52,540
Mainstream religions preach love but practice hate, worship bohemian prophets but enforce dress codes,

1110
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:57,240
and claim to own the whole truth but have virtually no living truth remaining.

1111
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:04,560
The subgenius church preaches hate, worships a clean-shaven idiot, and gives the surface appearance of nonsense,

1112
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:08,980
yet triggers loving truth to arise from within.

1113
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:16,920
It's amazing to me the cleverness with which sensitive souls have learned to thrive in a hostile world.

1114
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:21,000
Thanks for providing and exemplifying true slack.

1115
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,040
Oh, P.S.

1116
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:29,800
I had a dream that Ivan Stang is a reincarnation of an early influential Gnostic and a truly profound soul.

1117
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,440
Oh, that's a good note.

1118
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,380
Oh, boy.

1119
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,000
I told you.

1120
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:36,580
I told you.

1121
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:38,180
That guy gave me quite a reach around.

1122
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:38,800
I think so.

1123
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,060
Stang, what is that dripping from your...

1124
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,160
Is that blood dripping from your goatee?

1125
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,120
No, that's just...

1126
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,240
You said it was a reach around.

1127
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,780
You said you didn't have to actually chew on his organs.

1128
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,460
I'm sorry.

1129
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:53,460


1130
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:53,460


1131
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:53,460


1132
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:53,460


1133
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:53,460


1134
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:53,460


1135
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:53,460


1136
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:53,460


1137
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:53,460


1138
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:53,460


1139
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:53,460


1140
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:53,460


1141
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:53,460


1142
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:53,460


1143
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,780
What a strange man, too.

1144
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:59,520
I offer him kudos for his praise of the church and his 20 years in business.

1145
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:04,640
This one I had assigned for you to read when I first read the hour of slack.

1146
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,540
Oh, I don't go for the uterine devices.

1147
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:12,160
Only the gonococcal devibrators can be used this time.

1148
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:13,600
Anyway, at least until the 4th.

1149
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:19,680
Not of July, of course, but, you know, the 4th of encumbrance, which is coming for all of us pretty soon.

1150
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:20,840
After Thursday.

1151
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,840
Here's the gesticles.

1152
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:26,540
Oh, this was done by the gesticles in Australia.

1153
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,760
There's a bobby on the clothesline and a kitten on the grill.

1154
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,300
There's dog poop on the table, but I cannot eat my fill.

1155
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:40,940
There's a blank spot in my stink tank that says reserve for pamphlet one.

1156
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:45,360
I'd love to shove it in there verily, because it sure does sound like fun.

1157
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,040
Send me slack or plonk me.

1158
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,340
It's the only thing to do.

1159
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:50,680
I do not own a...

1160
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,900
I don't own a credit card, but I want to join with you.

1161
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:56,780
I've lived with Bob for years now, had a picture on my dash.

1162
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:00,080
It was there until it faded and my car was not but trash.

1163
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:04,680
I've touched myself to Connie and received a nasty rash.

1164
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:08,060
Now I've finally gotten around to it and offered up some cash.

1165
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:09,700
And he did.

1166
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:10,600
He did, in fact.

1167
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:14,220
Was it currency that you can actually use?

1168
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:16,560
I mean, the coin of the realm, not going to like.

1169
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:19,660
A lot of times you like to send monopolistic money.

1170
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:20,580
Poetry.

1171
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:21,000
Money.

1172
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:24,160
Sometimes they'll just send like a zygote on a tissue.

1173
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,300
Well, not a real zygote, a bloody zygote.

1174
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:26,840
Here's a good one.

1175
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,720
This one comes from a different...

1176
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,920
This guy writes, send stuff from a different address each time.

1177
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:33,200
Excreted inflation, perhaps.

1178
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:33,640
I don't know.

1179
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:37,020
This comes from a person that says, you know I know you.

1180
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,060
Dear Bob.

1181
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:39,940
Now listen to this.

1182
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:40,680
Okay, I'm listening.

1183
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,740
Dear Bob, you broke my leg.

1184
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,260
You gave me hype.

1185
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:48,240
After the restaurant tantrum went down, you gave me an address.

1186
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:49,860
Told me to meet you there.

1187
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:51,180
I came to meet you.

1188
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,120
There were two guys.

1189
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:57,020
One girl looking over I-5 south of Beacon Hill.

1190
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:59,100
The same two guys from the restaurant.

1191
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:00,180
One girl.

1192
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,560
They asked me into the house.

1193
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,500
I said, no thanks.

1194
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,360
The tall guy looked like an altar boy.

1195
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,600
Said, nice bike, 66 BMW.

1196
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:07,700
Let me take a ride.

1197
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,380
I said, no.

1198
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:10,660
He then said, well, give me a ride.

1199
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,640
He was six foot three inches tall.

1200
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,500
Jumped on my bike.

1201
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:14,380
Grabbed my...

1202
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,280
And squeezed hard as he could.

1203
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:18,240
Humped me five or six times.

1204
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,400
I had let him try.

1205
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,200
I had let him try on my jacket.

1206
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:20,980
It was too small.

1207
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,520
He stretched himself into it.

1208
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,920
After the ride, the three of them were around me.

1209
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:25,840
I said I had to go.

1210
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:29,320
When I got home, I had black and blue marks on me for a week.

1211
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,980
I lost my father at 16 years old.

1212
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,520
And I know you have no children.

1213
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:39,360
I'm adopting you as my father, Bob.

1214
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,040
And I will be your son.

1215
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,520
The son you always wanted.

1216
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,500
When you were a little boy, did some red-haired guy screw you over?

1217
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:49,020
I forgive you, Reverend James Doyle.

1218
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:53,740
Boy, that sounds, you know, like they call it Beacon Hill because of the strange, you know,

1219
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,360
beaming beacons that are going into the minds of the people in the restaurants.

1220
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,400
And we actually know some of the subhumans.

1221
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:03,680
We're not going to call them subgeniuses in this particular instance.

1222
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:10,480
Who were at the bottom of Beacon Hill waiting to spank him and torture him with a 1966 tricycle.

1223
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:12,080
It was not really even a bike.

1224
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,000
If only we could stop, Bob.

1225
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:14,920
My mind is going.

1226
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:16,700
Well, this guy is so far gone.

1227
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:19,380
The actual tissue in his brain.

1228
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:21,760
You're the corpus callosum is decomposing.

1229
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:25,600
And it's, you know, like practically brain dead and nobody told him yet.

1230
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:28,180
I'm not saying it's not great stuff.

1231
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:31,100
And we love his appurtenance and also his apertures.

1232
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,360
But we can't fit in there.

1233
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:33,460
You know what I'm saying?

1234
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,700
You got to send your you got to pay your pledge money, friends.

1235
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:37,340
That's all it is.

1236
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:39,880
Friends, we got to move on and move out.

1237
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:47,160
So I'm going to go back to the tape recordings of the live subgeniuses as they tell us their love, love, love.

1238
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,080
Because their mind.

1239
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:53,060
Is going swinging love corpses goes out in the background.

1240
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:57,520
And it is the lemur will help us.

1241
00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:07,060
Thank you, Church of the Subgenius for 20 years of misdirection, lies, squandering, insomnious.

1242
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,420
My mind is going.

1243
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:20,200
My mind is going.

1244
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:23,760
So my mind is going.

1245
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,580
Long call, Dave.

1246
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:31,240
Don't you know what they're doing to yourself?

1247
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:34,620
This is the Reverend Cardboard Box.

1248
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:36,400
That's right.

1249
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:37,820
Cardboard Box.

1250
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:41,800
Remember the Antipodean subgenius shown?

1251
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,800
No, not too bad.

1252
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:47,140
I listen to the Arrow of Slack whenever I damn well feel like it.

1253
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,180
Yo.

1254
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:51,580
I use some ducks.

1255
00:59:55,480 --> 01:00:00,840
During this period in Vàquan

1256
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:03,920

1257
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:03,920

1268
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,000
