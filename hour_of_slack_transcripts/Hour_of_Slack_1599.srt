1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:07,140
Bud Light presents the subgenius power of swag.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,980
Real American heroes.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,580
Today we salute you, real American heroes.

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,360
Don't stay in too long, or everyone will shout.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,840
Finish quickly and come back.

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,480
Ah yes, dear friends, tonight we're going back to 19X Day once again.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,780
This time we're listening to a soundtrack of a video.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,240
Yes, I just finished editing 19X Day the first day, Thursday.

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,360
And I was thinking after I finished it, well, the soundtrack would make a fine hour of slack

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,600
if I took out the stuff that requires seeing it to be interesting.

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,180
But then I realized I've already used some of that stuff on the hour of slack,

12
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,840
so what you're going to be hearing is a chopped up video.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,600
This soundtrack is mostly the Thorazine Urine Pod Crust performance

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,580
that I thought was great, except you've heard some of it.

15
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:19,360
And here now is, chopped up quite a bit, the rest of it.

16
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,060
Praise Bob.

17
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,020
Praise Bob.

18
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:45,520


19
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,580
Bob stole the song!

20
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,220
Bob stole the song!

21
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,380
Bob stole the song!

22
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,220
I think that song was called,

23
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,220
Everything is a dodo if you're brave enough.

24
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,140
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

25
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,940
Oh yeah!

26
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,120
Hey!

27
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,860
extras

28
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,200
Right, it's like the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

29
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,080
Because it's so random, that's why it's so important.

30
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,020
The stupider it looks, the more important it probably is.

31
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,020
Which, that would make me really important.

32
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,080
I need to pyroflatulate.

33
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,580
Does anybody got a lighter?

34
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,780
Oh, it went away, I can't do it now.

35
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,020
Everybody's lucky.

36
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,600
I can't do it in front of everybody.

37
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,160
It won't light if people are lucky.

38
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:54,660
Thank you.

39
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,060
Saucers in the sky.

40
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,240
Coming down, we're getting desperate on high.

41
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,200
All you motherfuckers out there, didn't pay.

42
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,280
You're gonna learn, come back to stay.

43
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,020
You're gonna die up in the flames of a gun line, in the infamy.

44
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,160
Hey, hey, didn't have rhyme in that time, but it's okay.

45
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,440
We're all gonna die anyways, well not us, because we went in and paid.

46
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,940
Thirty five dollars, thirty five dollars this is not a reasonable fee.

47
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:22,940
Pay now.

48
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,220
Salvation! Eternal salvation! Don't cheat, bow your soul, don't be like people who aren't like me!

49
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,580
Dave's not here. And I miss Dave.

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,700
I got your sunglasses.

51
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,700
Are you ready?

52
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,940
Let's jam!

53
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,560
Let's jam.

54
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,220
It's not jam, let's jizz.

55
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,880
Let's jizz.

56
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,340
Why would you prefer jelly?

57
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,880
I am a robot. What is jizz?

58
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,760
Exactly! As Princess Doug here said, why not both?

59
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,720
Why not both?

60
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,940
I expressed my feelings!

61
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,180
With touching of my arms, Trump, going to the bar with 50 cents.

62
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:58,820
Trump!

63
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,680
Trump is coming to the bank, taking back his scrum home from that bunch of crap.

64
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,100
Dad said, don't take so much from this, or your mom dies.

65
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,960
Son, instead of fucking with the dumb lads, take my hair and grow.

66
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:13,960
Scrum!

67
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,340
Scrum-a-lum-tchus, scrum-a-lum-tchus, scrum-a-lum-tchus.

68
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,240
Scrum-a-lum-tchus.

69
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,580
Scrum!

70
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,360
Hear me out!

71
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,580
I know you like to think your scrum don't stink.

72
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,360
I want to hold your scrum, I want to hold your scrum.

73
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:32,420
I want to hold your scrum.

74
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,960
I feel like you don't do that scrum for me, J.R.

75
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,120
Scrum!

76
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:35,860
Scrum!

77
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:35,860


78
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,260
Awesome!

79
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,620
Can't you ever feel like maybe you were too much into scrum?

80
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,400
Like maybe there's more to life.

81
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,380
I honestly think there's fun.

82
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,140
I think that, you know, if more people just tried it.

83
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,540
I worry about us.

84
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,360
If more people just tried it.

85
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:50,740
I think about our scrum.

86
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,220
No, if everybody's scrummed, we'd have world peace. Sure, but it's not cheap.

87
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,000
I love my people.

88
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:04,120
I think we have more people and parents, and I think the scrum will bring that about.

89
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,540
It's not because they've posted their phone number on the internet and it's easily accessible

90
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,220
and you know somebody's got to answer and they have to be polite for you because it's their job

91
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,540
and they might lose it otherwise.

92
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:23,160
It's not because if they don't say, yes, we accept your support, animal parent, that they're going to lose their jobs.

93
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,940
It's not that they comply because if they don't let us use their bathrooms as we pee all over their seats

94
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,200
because we might be any number of genders, they're going to lose their jobs.

95
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:40,720
It's because they want to answer because their alien landing sites have been their sanctuary.

96
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:52,020
I guess I'll have inside a pancake sink almost like dessert for dinner.

97
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,540
I'm going to have some of that, but what do you put on it?

98
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,380
What do you put on your pancakes?

99
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,680
It's on. It's all scrummy.

100
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,980
You put on the mind control syrup.

101
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,280
An extra scrum.

102
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,460
The moral of the story, it's really delicious. You need to check it out.

103
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,780
Womblehouse.com, our new sponsor.

104
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,440
Thanks, Womblehouse. Love your mind control syrup.

105
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,080
Bring on the aliens.

106
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,560
Thank you, Womblehouse, for hours of Thorazine.

107
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,620
Always busy, never working.

108
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,040
Call now.

109
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,240
Thorazine urine can be subscribed through your mobile cellular internet interactive device.

110
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,520
Subscription fees may vary.

111
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,000
We're all about sharing the love here on Thorazine urine.

112
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,020
Let's jam again later.

113
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,900
If you can hear this mic, boo me as loud as you can.

114
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,460
Oh, that's a fake fin.

115
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,140
That's a fake fin.

116
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,180
No fault for the draft.

117
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,540
What you need to do is put your hands together and clap.

118
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,360
Clap like you've never clapped before.

119
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,360
Say, I believe in it truly. I believe.

120
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,480
I believe it's true. I believe.

121
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,340
Club people. Club people.

122
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,240
Club people.

123
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,760
It's a real fit back here.

124
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,620
We need to see this.

125
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,980
It's a real fit truly.

126
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,780
Please stand up. Please stand up.

127
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,280
Please stand up.

128
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,720
It's a real fit truly.

129
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,820
Please stand up. Please stand up.

130
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,560
Oh!

131
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,180
I think if there's anything we need to do right now,

132
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,200
we need to invoke the power of Bob to take away your ability to walk.

133
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,880
Conspiracy be gone!

134
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:27,980
Thank you, Bob.

135
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,480
Can we have somebody step forward for Bob?

136
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,600
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss!

137
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,420
Cast off your conspiracy shackles.

138
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,860
What do we do?

139
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,180
What do we do?

140
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,980
We'll rule all of Fitzbrown. Don't step in it!

141
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,100
Terrifying creatures lurking in the dark!

142
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,080
Sinking out...

143
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,460
Flashing penises!

144
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,320
Beating

145
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,380
Mainenene

146
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,000
wouldn't let me

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,060
be

148
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,560
the

149
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,620
Okay.

150
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:42,400
There you e-

151
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:50,460
We need you folks! Talking to you! The two to seventy-eight people!

152
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,220
Cover your ears! Cover your ears, children!

153
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,500
Did you turn the 78 RPM?

154
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,680
Keep me on the podcast so no one can hear me.

155
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,000
It's about 33 to the third!

156
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,220
Thirty degrees to the third? That's my favorite game.

157
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,860
33 to the third!

158
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,520
What are you talking about? Illogical numbers? Don't you ever download a calculator?

159
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,620
Why are you trying to divide one by three? Why are you trying to do that shit up here?

160
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,840
There's not going to be any math in a few days.

161
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,160
Oh no. I hate this world. It can blow up soon.

162
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,460
It's good! Friends! Friends!

163
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,740
It's all going to blow up. I do hate this world. It can blow up soon.

164
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,880
We owe you heads up! We owe you heads up!

165
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:39,320
We have bombs! We have tech! And money! And crap! And boulders! And scrum!

166
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,680
But mostly crap! I do not want to, you know, use plug-

167
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,540
Come on, X-Men! Where the fuck are you?

168
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,420
We talk a lot about scrum! And scrum is pretty good!

169
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,320
It's a scummy bug, not that I'm proud of it! It's not that I'm proud of it!

170
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,980
I'm voting for scrum!

171
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,760
Make scrum great again!

172
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,680
Scrum is not as good as it used to be in both the ever-sistant movie production out of North America

173
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,560
and we gave little scrum jobs to immigrants.

174
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,840
It's hard to hurt other people!

175
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:09,800
I am?

176
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,220
No, not that either!

177
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:12,500
And when?

178
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,020
July the 6th at about 9.58 AM.

179
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,620
There won't be anything left!

180
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,880
Ash. Only ash.

181
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:32,720
Except for the toilet stalls here at Wisteria which will stand as the last testament to the fact that this planet didn't deserve to go on.

182
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,660
Though actually, I must say, from my first next day I've been impressed with the quality of these porcelain.

183
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,500
We call, Reverend Stan calls it a porcelain.

184
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,020
He calls those sweat lodges.

185
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,800
Well, I haven't been in one long enough to find out.

186
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,460
That's a lucky and very fortunate thing.

187
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,480
Stall one near my camp, if you're here you know where I am. Stall one.

188
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,020
Santa? Santa is that evil?

189
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,760
Best jacob I've had in the last two and a half years.

190
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,800
That's a evil thing!

191
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,140
But they fucked up. Somebody left the door open to the bathroom stall earlier.

192
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,200
All the good bugs that get in there and contribute to the fermentation process escaped.

193
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,240
Make sure you throw one!

194
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,100
More than you deserve, jacob.

195
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:21,140
We have jacob syrup, jacob pancakes, jacob horse meat, jacob cupcakes, jacob...

196
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,120
Stop making me drool.

197
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,180
Just bring it up here if you have it, I mean, come on!

198
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,280
We all want to see this super world destroyed.

199
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,840
Every one of us. Even the parts we like.

200
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:37,620
We have the parts we like, but those are the worst parts because they remind us of all the parts we don't like.

201
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,520
We have those bits of cutie.

202
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,340
They remind us of the endless crushing pain of being some genius in this world of pink little shits.

203
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,740
The beautiful things we all want to see destroyed the most are your friends.

204
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,280
I'll have what I'm having.

205
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,080
I'm the love of the...

206
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,420
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, the pizza on our throats.

207
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,980
Burn out eggs.

208
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,420
David is weak.

209
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,580
Everybody's cooking Thai.

210
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,720
Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, everybody is gonna fucking die, die, die.

211
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,560
Where's my pay?

212
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,820
$35 to save it.

213
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,700
It's on penis.com.

214
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,940
You too could be it next day.

215
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:17,100
You could take all these credit cards, send carrots, put them like Christmas cards so you can get stolen by the mailman.

216
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,260
In my backyard.

217
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,440
I also brew time control in my backyard. That's what you said, right?

218
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,520
No.

219
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,180
Oh.

220
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,680
Actually, time control in my backyard is where it's being brewed right now.

221
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,500
I got a root cellar just special for it. It's really nice.

222
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,400
The fermentation process takes a while though.

223
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,140
Not as long as scrub though and that's why you should...

224
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:38,980
I had some of that...

225
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,280
Mining scrum in your own backyard.

226
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,380
I had some of that time control you brought here. It was pretty good.

227
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,520
Hey, have you decided to mine scrum yet?

228
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:47,880
That's good time control right there.

229
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,800
I was wondering how the production is in your area.

230
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:56,100
Like we said before in the earlier podcast that you're trying to transport scrum and suck turtles.

231
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:05,860
Do not mule turtle scrum because later on in the storage process in your own root cellar and possibly your own backyard or your neighbors if you're inclined to do so,

232
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,700
it will turn into scrum and nobody likes scrum.

233
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,200
I want you to scrum all over my face.

234
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,700
Just scrum on my face.

235
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,400
Do it.

236
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,920
Do it.

237
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,180
Can I dry...

238
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,460
Can I dry scrum and...

239
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,160
scrum and...

240
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,260
scrum and smoke it?

241
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,600
You honestly can.

242
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,140
It's a very versatile commodity.

243
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,420
Usually you put it in your holes but you can also smoke it.

244
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,740
You have to scrape up the...

245
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,060
Which holes? Which holes?

246
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,160
Oh, how many holes you got?

247
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,480
As many holes as you have, there's no scrum for it.

248
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:46,840
As long as we can stop Bill 13013 which is going to ban production of scrum in North America.

249
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:57,440
That's P.O. Box 181 418 Cleveland, Ohio 4411 Ocho.

250
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,940
Did I get that right? Was that right?

251
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,420
I can't remember.

252
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,040
Alright.

253
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:13,020
100,000 years hot crust X-Tales special edition.

254
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,080
Oh.

255
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

256
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,400
Levelhouse.com, not stamps.com, but stamps.com.

257
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,220
Yeah.

258
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:33,500
For free information, write to P.O. Box 181.

259
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:39,500
1-8-1-4-1-7 Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

260
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,140
4-4-1.

261
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,420
I can't remember this zip code.

262
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,160
1-8-4-4-1-1-8.

263
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,780
I got really close though.

264
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,420
We're doctors.

265
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,740
We're doctors.

266
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,560
Doctors from Mills.

267
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,620
Mills.

268
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,380
And we're doctors from Mills.

269
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,160
So genius.

270
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:02,960
There she goes.

271
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:03,480
There she goes.

272
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:03,480


273
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:03,480


274
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:03,480


275
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:03,480


276
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:03,480


277
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:03,480


278
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:03,480


279
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,780
The dead person doesn't come back to life.

280
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,000
Ever.

281
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,980
But still you may pretend.

282
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,980
Lots of us do this when something hurts us.

283
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,680
So you may think to yourself,

284
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:30,120
well, I'll just make believe the person really didn't die.

285
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,240
He just went away on a long trip and he'll come back someday, you'll see.

286
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,980
But now, think about it.

287
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,900
That's not real.

288
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,040
Any more than most of the stories on TV.

289
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,280
Wishing doesn't make things come true.

290
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,020
Well, let's talk about the real world.

291
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,100
The world of life and death.

292
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,800
What is dead?

293
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:54,840
Bob?

294
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,140
Do you remember when you saw a squirrel lying in the road?

295
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,560
The body?

296
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,220
The body does not move or breathe.

297
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,200
It is silent.

298
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,100
It is peaceful.

299
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:11,380
There is no hurt, no pain, no life.

300
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,960
Where there is joy in life, there is also pain.

301
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,880
There's happiness.

302
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,340
But there are also tears.

303
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,720
You might be mad at so many people.

304
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,900
You may become grumpy.

305
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,060
Sometimes for, you know, just little things.

306
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,540
Well, it's all right.

307
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,220
It's all right to let go of some of your feelings.

308
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,580
You may feel better if you do.

309
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,680
Sometimes, after a person dies,

310
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,340
Yeah, it gets grubby, you know.

311
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,880
you worry, you know, like, maybe I made him die.

312
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,040
You remember the times when you were naughty or nasty to the person who died.

313
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,640
Now, those things don't make people die.

314
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,300
All of us act badly at times.

315
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,540
So remember, thoughts can't make people die.

316
00:17:59,540 --> 00:17:59,540


317
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:04,460
But even so, you may feel very sad that the person is dead.

318
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,400
You may want to know what happens when a person dies.

319
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,160
Well, it's like when your goldfish died.

320
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,940
Maybe you put its body into a pretty box and lined it with paper.

321
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,860
It's not that you overfed it, neglected it, forgot about it,

322
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,600
let it swim around in its own piss for hours.

323
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,800
With your friends, you dug a hole to place the box in.

324
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,060
You buried your goldfish.

325
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,200
Now you may want to pretend that the person is still living.

326
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,500
Friends often send flowers and come to the funeral home.

327
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,840
They do these things to show that they cared for the person who died.

328
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:48,240
And I'll say, Gatorade do these things to show that our children are living.

329
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,180
Our children are alive.

330
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,360
Our children are serving the people.

331
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,400
Our children are serving the people.

332
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,400
Our children are serving the people.

333
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,000
Our children are serving the people.

334
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,620
We love you, but it doesn't work for everyone.

335
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,060
Do not drink the Kool-Aid or the Gatorade.

336
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,240
You only killed me once.

337
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,040
That's really all it takes, just the once.

338
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,180
No, it's crazy.

339
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,720
But look at that, look at that hearse.

340
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,600
I would love to ride in that.

341
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,340
I mean...

342
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,480
You will one day.

343
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,060
As the driver.

344
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,620
Oh, yes, you will ride the hearse.

345
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,240
No, we had the 54 Chevy with the fins.

346
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,640
It was a Magic Midnight Blue painted.

347
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:25,980
Yeah.

348
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,820
It was a big Knicks hearse.

349
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,400
No animal, you too, will ride the hearse.

350
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,240
We would roll up to parties in that.

351
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:37,700
And my friend Gary, the big satanic chauffeur, would hop out.

352
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,220
He was like, oh, seven foot tall.

353
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,460
I shit you not, man.

354
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,600
One foot's longer than the other.

355
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,540
So he had the boots made separate.

356
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,820
You know, his bike was off and doing the biker boots.

357
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,560
It was amazing.

358
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,300
He'd get out in his leather chauffeur cap and his vest.

359
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:54,080
And he'd just slide out the back where normally the caskets were.

360
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,000
But it was just us.

361
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,660
Just us enjoying froth.

362
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,080
And we'd just go out and just join the party.

363
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,140
And people were like, what?

364
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,860
What kind of beast have you rolled in?

365
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,880
And we're like, what?

366
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:07,780
What?

367
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,660
I'm just saying, if you're not here on the Pleasant Saucers, it's really your own fault.

368
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,400
If you don't make it to XK.

369
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,540
That memory brought me happiness.

370
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,240
I have happiness.

371
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,220
I have a memory.

372
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,260
You have happiness now?

373
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,980
You must have had the hit by a bus.

374
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,280
You have a memory?

375
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,520
A brick memory.

376
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,080
Hit by a brick memory.

377
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,660
A memory and that brought you happiness?

378
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,260
The memory?

379
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,260
I have one memory and it brought me happiness.

380
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,040
Aww, that's so touching.

381
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,460
But now I can't remember what it was.

382
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,180
Look at it.

383
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:37,900
I'm fucked.

384
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,300
Oh, back to normal again.

385
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,320
This is so great.

386
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,340
You know it was happening.

387
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,520
You distracted me.

388
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,020
I had the perfect thought and you distracted me.

389
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:46,520
Once again.

390
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,780
Where's that absinthe?

391
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,340
That's what I need.

392
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:49,660
Yeah.

393
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:54,340
I'm talking about death with children by Dr. Earl.

394
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,140
Earl?

395
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,200
Earl, man.

396
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,600
I honestly don't think he's a real doctor.

397
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:04,660
The fact is this was not brought to you by me, animal overlord from Boston, Texas.

398
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,740
This was brought to you by Matt, the homeless mortician.

399
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,340
The best morticians are homeless.

400
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:15,100
It makes you give that extra edge of nervousness when you're around them, you know.

401
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:19,060
When you're around a normal mortician, you're like, yeah, they're around dead people all

402
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,280
the time.

403
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,600
But when you're around a homeless mortician, you're like, ooh, but he's got time on his

404
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:23,960
hands.

405
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,140
He's got that scale feel.

406
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:26,720
Yeah.

407
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,040
He's got that real deep scale feel.

408
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:29,740
Yeah.

409
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,040
Yeah.

410
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,080
The deep scale feel.

411
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:31,660
Yeah.

412
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,000
Yeah.

413
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,340
It's like, you don't want the free range morticians.

414
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:35,940
No.

415
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,400
No.

416
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,180
You know, when they got like nothing to do.

417
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:42,720
Well, actually, we have a friend who's a free range mortician and he does quite well.

418
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,400
On people or critters?

419
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,500
I've seen a few sleepy deer on the way here to Wisteria.

420
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,820
They're all taking naps on the side of the highway like they do.

421
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,420
Yeah.

422
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:55,220
He was a mortician in New York City after 9-11.

423
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,880
He put a thousand people into little shoe boxes.

424
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,240
That is free ranges again.

425
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,080
Yeah.

426
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,780
That's hardcore practice right there.

427
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,060
Yeah.

428
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:09,940
And he came to Agstay after that and handed out those little butt plugs they put in corpses

429
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:14,360
to keep you from farting at an open casket thing.

430
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,500
That is so nice.

431
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:16,840
Yeah.

432
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,400
Everybody had little necklaces made of butt plugs.

433
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:19,600
Oh my goodness.

434
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,340
It was like one of the sweetest things I've ever seen.

435
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:21,400
Yeah.

436
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,440
That's the most adorable.

437
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,180
That is the most adorable.

438
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,500
Thanks Reverend Seafood.

439
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,160
Oh, yeah.

440
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,640
Reverend Seafood of New York.

441
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:27,960
Yeah.

442
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,100
Come back to us.

443
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,380
And everybody at that Agstay was walking around with one of those clear plastic butt

444
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:33,380


445
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,540
With little plastic butt plugs.

446
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:34,920
And they fit.

447
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,100
One size fits all.

448
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,140
Why wouldn't you have it on your neck at that point?

449
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,800
It's obviously got a chain for safety.

450
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,060
You put it where it goes.

451
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,920
You put it where it goes and you walk through it.

452
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,640
Honestly, it is.

453
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:51,380
It had a little step-by-step pyramidal series of discs so that you could just walk through

454
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:51,380


455
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:51,380


456
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:51,380


457
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:51,380


458
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:51,380


459
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:51,380


460
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:51,380


461
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:51,480
it.

462
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,300
You know, it would fit any asshole.

463
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,680
The big ones are like this.

464
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,280
I bet there are enough assholes here for it to fit.

465
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,060
The little ones are.

466
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,260
About all sizes and shapes.

467
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:03,440
They're right out there waiting and listening to us now.

468
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,580
They're up here on the stage.

469
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,940
I'm pretty sure there's a few right there waiting.

470
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,060
Where's your perennial plugs when you need it?

471
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,520
I mean, I've got my pineal.

472
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,000
Your radial plugs.

473
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,140
Where's my pineal plug when I've got it?

474
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,760
I mean, I can stick something in my third nostril.

475
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,040
I might as well have a perennial and a pineal plug while we're at it.

476
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,360
Oh, my gosh.

477
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:21,360


478
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:21,360


479
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:21,360


480
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:21,360


481
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:21,360


482
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:21,360


483
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,860
I've got a tool kit in the car.

484
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,320
I don't believe you and it's okay if you don't prove me right.

485
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:26,860
A pineal plug?

486
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,340
Pineal plug.

487
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,640
I didn't know there was such a thing as a pineal plug.

488
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,080
There is now.

489
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,280
Is that playing right there?

490
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,100
Oh.

491
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:35,280
Isn't it?

492
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,300
Ain't this modern day stuff amazing?

493
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,440
See, see the play?

494
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,500
See, I can just stick a little box in that box and it makes me use it.

495
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,900
Plays the portable player.

496
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,620
Plays, plays, plays the portable player.

497
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,800
You don't even need a record player or a 16 millimeter projector or nothing.

498
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,300
They don't need us, no.

499
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:51,380
They don't need us.

500
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,200
No, they sure as hell don't, obviously.

501
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,020
They made that part clear tonight.

502
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,460
We've been eclipsed.

503
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,480
We've been eclipsed at the end of the old school.

504
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,680
Time for the ice floe.

505
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,300
Yep, yep.

506
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,140
That's right.

507
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:11,340
The old time subgenius bullshit's been supplanted by the new wave of...

508
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,700
We've been hung up to dry.

509
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,640
Step aside, Reverend whatever your name is.

510
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,860
Reverend Funny Name.

511
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,220
Reverend What's-Her-Face.

512
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:21,380
Reverend What's-Her-Face.

513
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:21,380


514
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:21,380


515
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:21,380


516
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,900
No more Milk Daddy no more.

517
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,540
It's the new era.

518
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:25,880
Yeah, God.

519
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,120
Yeah, we're gonna have to move aside.

520
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,260
Make way for the new.

521
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,860
Hey, I cast my vote already.

522
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,560
Hello?

523
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:39,900
Hello?

524
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:40,940
Hello?

525
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,320
Hello?

526
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:41,760
Hello?

527
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,060
Dave.

528
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,820
It's Dave.

529
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,920
It's Dave.

530
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,500
It's the real Dave.

531
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,640
There's zero sounds in the background.

532
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,380
He, he's going to die.

533
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:51,380


534
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:51,380


535
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:51,380


536
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:51,380


537
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:51,380


538
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:51,380


539
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:51,380


540
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,320
The Duck Dynasty swines.

541
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,600
You have to take that out, I suppose.

542
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:56,860
Me, me, me, me.

543
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,400
You have Duck Dynasty something in the background?

544
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,580
No, it's the AM radio, which I was looking for.

545
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,260
My usual radio show.

546
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,840
And then I got the swine hunts and I was just ready to change it.

547
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,080
But anyway, are we on the air?

548
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:16,480
Yeah.

549
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,740
What are you mumbling about?

550
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,920
We're on the air, man.

551
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,460
Yes.

552
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,280
Get your act together.

553
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,620
Stop out of it.

554
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,120
Shape up.

555
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,340
Oh, snappy.

556
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,340
Kick the Duck Dynasty swine out of your house.

557
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,560
I'm all bitter now.

558
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,660
I'm very bitter.

559
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,160
Yes, please turn down your radio in the background, caller.

560
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,900
What did you say, Peter?

561
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,440
I've eaten too much cucumber and cheese and I thought the Duck Dynasty was the news.

562
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,880
Oh, no.

563
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,020
It might as well be.

564
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,060
People would.

565
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:50,500
I don't know.

566
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:57,160
I don't believe Duck Dynasty than the, quote, lamestream news, even though they actually

567
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,580
do try to do something like news.

568
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:04,020
But it's just not as exciting as the lies.

569
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,920
Nor is believable, apparently.

570
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,040
It's piling up pretty big.

571
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,880
If you excreate me, I'm putting myself in the position.

572
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,960
Speaking of asterisks, hashtag, hashtag finality.

573
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,900
I'm losing my mind.

574
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,040
I had to go to work today.

575
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:22,880
Oh, no.

576
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,320
And at work, they were watching Fox News.

577
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,640
Excuse my language.

578
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,640
Am I allowed to say that?

579
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:35,460
But you're working at a newspaper and they're watching Fox News.

580
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,360
Well, it's while they were doing their, you know, InDesign, laying out the paper and all

581
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,260
that stuff like that.

582
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,600
But these people are still.

583
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:48,720
And, you know, you befriend these people and then they start telling you things like, he

584
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,500
was the worst president in the world.

585
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,560
And they won't tell you why, because they don't know.

586
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,200
We need a president who's a good businessman.

587
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,160
They won't tell you why we need a president.

588
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,620
Do we need a president who's a good businessman?

589
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,060
We need a president who is Superman.

590
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,960
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

591
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,460
Yeah, we need Superman for president.

592
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,400
Instead, we got.

593
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:15,020
Well, I sure can't call him Lex.

594
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:15,980
No, no.

595
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,040
Lex Luthor was a bald headed genius.

596
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,140
We've got the exact opposite.

597
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:27,260
A fuzzy headed, uh, I'm not sure what, you know.

598
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:27,980
What is it?

599
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,800
We need a president with heart, but we don't have that.

600
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,360
Well, we do, but we won't.

601
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,380
We've got more of a person with a desiccated liver, I think, rather than heart.

602
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,120
Well, let's hope.

603
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,740
No, actually, his liver.

604
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,100
The sad thing is apparently Trump doesn't drink.

605
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:52,580
He's been on amphetamines his whole life, but he, but he doesn't do drugs, right?

606
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,900
No, I mean, apparently.

607
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,280
Just the ones the doctor gives him.

608
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:57,520
Right.

609
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,180
Just, uh, yeah, well, that's not drugs.

610
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,360
If the doctor gives it to you, you know.

611
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,360
Well, no, whenever the Uber class takes drugs, it's, they've never taken drugs.

612
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,120
It's just an Uber class thing, you know.

613
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,600
Who's ever in charge of the rest of the bananas.

614
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,020
I have love of the sins of the rest of y'all pudniks.

615
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,580
I am pure.

616
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,920
They're not at all.

617
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:27,620
Well, they used to inject John Fitzgerald Kennedy with amphetamine vitamin concoction

618
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,560
once a week, pep him up.

619
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:35,400
He'd jump out of his wheelchair and run circles around the White House lawn while smoking

620
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,020
cigarettes.

621
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,720
Yes.

622
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:45,140
Did you know that, did you know that Adolf Hitler's cocktail was what gave him so much

623
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,700
spicy, red vinaigrette when he was the...

624
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,360
President of the new world order back in Deutschland.

625
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,780
What kind of a cocktail was that?

626
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:00,300
It consisted of cocaine, I believe heroin or morphine and some, some kind of speed.

627
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,680
And I guess that's what got him going.

628
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:06,520
He was famous for taking those before he'd do his speeches where he channeled, where

629
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,780
he channeled these entities of the fool order and whatnot.

630
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,100
Yeah, man.

631
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,120
Crazy horse deities and stuff.

632
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:13,740
Yeah.

633
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,800
Fool rising.

634
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,620
Fool, yeah.

635
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,540
Um.

636
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:24,280
Well, uh, yeah, that, that, those pep pills will really pep you up.

637
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:24,900
That's for sure.

638
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,900
There's no telling how many, um, I mean, okay.

639
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:36,280
Rush Limbaugh's famous for being on smack basically, uh, you know, uh, prescription

640
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:44,840
heroin, but wasn't he, I would have guessed that he probably was also doing Adderall or

641
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,680
some kind of amphetamine.

642
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,520
Yeah.

643
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:56,540
I mean, wouldn't you, if you were a big fat evil jerk on the radio who thought he was

644
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:01,380
God, wouldn't you take all the pills that made you think you were even more godly than

645
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:01,780
God?

646
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:05,160
Sure you would if you were Rush Limbaugh.

647
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:10,080
And meanwhile, you'd be talking about how they should all be locked up.

648
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,800
Those druggies and liberals and communists.

649
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,520
Oh, man.

650
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:17,520


651
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:17,520


652
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:17,520


653
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:17,520


654
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:17,520


655
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:17,520


656
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,860
We'd be locked up.

657
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,300
Yep.

658
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,460
See, you took the words right out of my mouth.

659
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:28,940
That's, that's, that was my Rush Limbaugh, the box, the impersonation, but you got it

660
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,520
better, so I have to give you kudos, whatever the hell they are.

661
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:36,800
No, you need to give me an ibuprofen, because it gives me a headache to shake my jowls like

662
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,060
that.

663
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,120
Violently.

664
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,620
Yeah, see, it hurts.

665
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,560
Yeah, it does.

666
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:47,220
That's why you, that's why Rush Limbaugh has to take Oxycontin all day long, because it

667
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:54,640
, you know, rattles you, hurts, gives you a headache, high blood pressure.

668
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:07,160
Well, you know, Dave, it's, it's interesting not being able to do the show at WCSB, because

669
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:14,440
they're not airing any show at WCSB, so I think they've heard reruns for the last month,

670
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,460
because the stuff I'm...

671
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,100
Oh, really?

672
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,340
Yeah, the discs I'm mailing them aren't getting to them.

673
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,140
They're not getting to them?

674
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,260
No, they're not.

675
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,860
We had this problem last year.

676
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,880
There's some kind of a... and we tried it differently, you know.

677
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:32,420
We sent, we sent it directly to WCSB last year.

678
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:38,420
Well, the university hijacks them first, and then sits on them, and probably listens to

679
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,600
them four times, and then they give them to the station.

680
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:41,880
Yeah.

681
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,840
This, this time we tried mailing them to a station member.

682
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,800
And no one's heard from him since.

683
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
He's just vanished.

684
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:57,600
As soon as he got that first hour of slapdisc, he just disappeared in a puff of smug or something.

685
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,920
Well, that doesn't mean necessarily that there's faulty role or foul play.

686
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:05,820
It could well be that he's, you know, he's working on the excludiments, the rudimentary

687
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:09,240
nature of, he's trying to decipher his own existence.

688
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,600
He's almost got that time machine finished.

689
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:16,080
And when he finishes the time machine, he can go back in time and assassinate...

690
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,960
Assassinate, uh, John, John Wilkes Booth.

691
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,760
Yeah, that's it.

692
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,160
Yeah, start with him.

693
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,080
I think, uh...

694
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,960
First you have to assassinate all the assassins, and then you start picking presidents.

695
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:36,640
On the, on the, that news channel that I referred to earlier, they were, they were calling Trump,

696
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:41,940
they're calling him Stonewall Jackson, the next Stonewall Jackson.

697
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,300
That's not necessarily good.

698
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,060
Stonewall Jackson, widely discredited as a president.

699
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,060


700
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,060


701
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,560
He's been called the next president lately by, you know, he's, it's like one of those

702
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,940
things where somebody, you know, actually, oh yeah, there were, there were the Cherokee,

703
00:32:53,940 --> 00:33:02,260
uh, uh, what, not migrations, the, uh, deportations, the Cherokee and Creeks deportations.

704
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,900
There were all this other stuff.

705
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,160
And he was not a good president.

706
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,180
He was not a good man.

707
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:07,880
He was insane.

708
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,000
Right, right.

709
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:14,280
Um, yeah, I've been hearing that comparison too by people who don't like Trump.

710
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,060
What about Trump?

711
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:16,460
He's not mad, John.

712
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,220
He's like Andrew, it's like, actually, I didn't say he's anything like Andrew Jackson.

713
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:26,000
I believe I heard puzzling evidence say that the situation is similar now to what it was

714
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,280
in Jackson's time.

715
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,060
But I don't know the details enough.

716
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:36,840
So I wasn't, I wasn't reading American history from that period.

717
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:43,820
I was reading Russian history from that period because it's more exciting and it's women

718
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,000
are more beautiful.

719
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,040
Yeah.

720
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,040


721
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:51,940
It's wonderful to take a ride in the Troika in the middle of the winter time, the gloss

722
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:58,760
over the panhandlers to ride off into the sunset and to show you off your gleaming hump

723
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,340
in the rain, just the way they did in the Arctic facts.

724
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:11,240
Well, those czars and Kings and emperors could collect hunchbacks and dwarfs and giants.

725
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,720
Peter the Great collected giants instead of dwarfs.

726
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:21,120
He was freakishly tall and he liked to have guys around that made him look more normal.

727
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,860
That's, that's, that's a common thing to do.

728
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:31,820
To make you try to make, you know, for those miscreants to try to make themselves appear

729
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,940
more normal to the others so they can control.

730
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:40,800
I would like to collect, I would like to collect albinos were I a King, because then I would

731
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,500
always feel like I had a great tan.

732
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,740
I've already got four.

733
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,040
I've already got four.

734
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,040


735
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,040


736
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,260
You've only got three.

737
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:52,260
I'd collect bald albinos so that my hair and tan would look great.

738
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:59,540
But isn't it true that really all we would have to do is to take more normalin and then

739
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,080
we would all be more normal?

740
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,020
I did that stuff when I was a kid.

741
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,440
There is such a drug as normalin?

742
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:13,740
There's a drug that was invented by Bleepo Abernathy.

743
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,700
That's more normalin.

744
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,020
Oh, okay.

745
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:16,020


746
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,000
You can Google it, man.

747
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,660
You can see the old commercials on YouTube.

748
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,200
Cut to more normalin commercial now.

749
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,700
Do you find yourself crying at funerals?

750
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:32,280
Do you ever feel clumsy when you're in an awkward situation?

751
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,660
When you laugh, do you often find yourself gasping for breath?

752
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:43,040
If so, ask your doctor when he can start putting you on more normalin.

753
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,020
More normalin is designed to allow you to enjoy the illusion of being normal.

754
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,020


755
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,020


756
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,920
The illusion of being the person you always thought you wanted to be, but may not have

757
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,600
been sure of.

758
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,860
If you ever thought you could be more normal, more normalin may or may not be the key.

759
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,480
Side effects may include, but are not limited to, simultaneous bleeding from the ear, nose,

760
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:03,680
throat, and rectum, bloody diarrhea and urination, frozen fingers, partial or full paralysis,

761
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,980
diphtheria, gout, morbid dental plaque, painful mixturation, sudden inexplicable vomiting,

762
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,320
tongue fur, enlarged nostrils, and a slight possibility of detached limbs.

763
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,800
More normalin.

764
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,140
It can help you be more normal.

765
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,000
More normalin.

766
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,640
Use only as directed.

767
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,460
Okay, yeah, see?

768
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,180
Take your more normalin, kids.

769
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:27,200
Actually, I thought that more normalin would make me do better in school, but it didn't

770
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,180
improve my grades.

771
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,700
It, in fact, made me dumber.

772
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,280
Me too.

773
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:34,240
Because it made you more normal, you know?

774
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,100
Yep.

775
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,840
I couldn't see the snowflakes for the trees.

776
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,360
I had to go to the bathroom practically every five minutes.

777
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,000
And then finally they just suspended me.

778
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:53,080
And I was dispelled for some, like, around four weeks or something like that before my

779
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,700
parents got involved with the PTO.

780
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,040
They said, what are you giving this guy?

781
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:04,280
And I said, well, we have him on a daily dose of 16 milligrams of more normalin.

782
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,180
And apparently he doesn't agree with them.

783
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,960
Like some kids, he's part of a test control group.

784
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,580
And so that's why we had him fired.

785
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:15,980
Well, you know, Dr. LeGim, Dr. LeGim, Dr. LeGim, Dr. LeGim, Dr. LeGim, Dr. LeGim, Dr. LeGim,

786
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,060
Dr. LeGim, Dr. LeGim, Dr. LeGim, Dr. LeGim, Dr. LeGim.

787
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:16,060


788
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:16,220
He's a great friend.

789
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:16,220


790
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:16,220


791
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:16,220


792
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:16,220


793
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:16,220


794
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:16,220


795
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:16,220


796
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:22,960
Dr. LeGim, who's about 10 years younger than me, was, he was a frail, wimpy little kid.

797
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:24,780
Yes.

798
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:29,140
And they worried about his frail little health.

799
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,000
So they gave him a new important drug called steroids.

800
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:41,120
And sure enough, the wimpy little legume bulked up sort of like Captain America after he

801
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,760
had his experimental steroidal drugs.

802
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,960
However, in the case of him, he was still alive.

803
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:45,960


804
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:45,960


805
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:50,740
case of Dr. Legume, instead of turning him more patriotic as well as stronger, it turned

806
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:56,040
him more into the Red Skull, or some kind of a supervillain.

807
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,140
Yeah, the glowing Red Skull.

808
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:03,080
It's great to have supervillains in the Church of the Subgenius. I wish we had more of them.

809
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,720
Need more.

810
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,800
There are no superheroes left alive.

811
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:16,500
There are certainly about 20 to 65 antiheroes who are regularly cloistered together to sing

812
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:22,820
songs and epithets of Days Gone By and the psalms.

813
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,280
Days Gone By.

814
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,360
Days Gone By.

815
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:30,100
The sad, sad psalms and songs of Days Gone By.

816
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:37,780
There have been many. When I think about the days of our lives, there have been many.

817
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:44,240
There have been many Daves, but none as lonesome as Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

818
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:53,240
Well, you know, my own broath hair is David, so I cherish and love the Davids in my life.

819
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,060
Yeah, like Janer?

820
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,940
No, not that one.

821
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,020
Yeah, that's a common name.

822
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:00,640
I could rattle off some evil. There's evil Daves. Well, those are Davids, though. Those

823
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,100
aren't Davids.

824
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,480
Those are Davids, not Daves.

825
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,040
Yeah.

826
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,080
So, this is...

827
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:11,620
He's trying to leave the name Dave altogether and calls himself Dee.

828
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,860
Ach, du lieber.

829
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:20,300
Well, at least it's not all Dugs. I'm sick and tired of hearing about Dugs tonight.

830
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:31,600
Douglases have a high reputation for acrimony, deceit, and malingering in the public squares.

831
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,540
No, you're thinking of Leos.

832
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,020
Oh, yeah, that's right, Leos.

833
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,540
Like Leos.

834
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:44,060
Leos, Derotes, Geronimus Botch, and Captain Flamingo. I remember all those guys. They

835
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:48,260
were all squared off quite neatly, I think. They ran over them with a train.

836
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:52,720
Oh, that made the greatest squishy noises, too.

837
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:53,960
Yes.

838
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,880
Squishing Dugs under trains.

839
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,100
Oh, yes.

840
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:05,320
Well, I've spoken to a lot of people recently, and not one of them thinks... I just spoke

841
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,780
to somebody who worked at the...

842
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:11,860
At one of the editorial booths. No, actually, one of the election booths.

843
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,260
Mm-hmm.

844
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,680
At one of the polling places.

845
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:14,240
Yes.

846
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:20,100
And she said every person who appeared to be a minority person was given some sort of

847
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,620
BS by the Republican-run, what's it called?

848
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:23,980
Yes.

849
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:24,400
What?

850
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,340
Yeah.

851
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,260
That really happened?

852
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:32,080
She said she had never seen... She'd been donating her time for many years, and she'd

853
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,840
never seen so many Duck Dynasty-looking guys vote before.

854
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:36,800
Mm-hmm.

855
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,420
And I said...

856
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:44,440
I can't believe that all those people wearing camo boots and Florentine hat knots and stuff

857
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,700
actually resurrected themselves to actually go and vote.

858
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:50,920
Wow.

859
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:56,780
There's personal up-your-face, limitary engagements and all of this. I think we was

860
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,940
lied to big time, and the election was sterling.

861
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:04,340
And she witnessed persons of color being harassed?

862
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,220
No, they were just like... She said almost...

863
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:12,820
I mean, every person, whether Hispanic or African-American or whatever, you know, type

864
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:19,640
of ethnics that were not in favor with the Republican Party, oh, your polling place has

865
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:27,800
been changed to 3245 can't find it. Oh, what's your middle name? We don't seem to have you

866
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:33,820
anymore. Oh, are you sure you registered here? They were all given some kind of problem.

867
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,360
We only allow dead people to vote here.

868
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,520
Yeah.

869
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,400
Only dead people vote here.

870
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:39,800
Ah.

871
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:48,180
Well, but you see, the funny thing is they said it was going to be rigged. I guess they

872
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:48,780
were bragging.

873
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,700
I guess they were talking about how they were going to rig it.

874
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:57,180
Yeah, they weren't warning. It wasn't a warning. It was more of a braggadocious thing.

875
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:05,320
Yeah, braggadocious statement. And I believe it now. I've heard many, many people say such

876
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:05,980
things.

877
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,620
It's just sour grapes.

878
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,040
Ah, you just, libtards just have a bunch of sour grapes. They're commies. You're lost.

879
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:19,160
Get used to it. You're lost. That means everybody gets to be a bully now. That's right. We're

880
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:24,220
all bullies, unless you're a wimp. You're either with us or you're against us. Beat

881
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:27,840
him up, boys. He's all alone. Gang up on him.

882
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,600
Why am I laughing?

883
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,840
It's the new way.

884
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,340
It's okay for kids to pick on hunchbacks and freaks and pencilheads.

885
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:45,200
Or pencilhead geeks. It's okay now for kids to call other kids. It's okay now because

886
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:52,920
we all voted for Trump so we can do anything we want.

887
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,680
We want.

888
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,620
Well?

889
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:06,000
I just wonder what all the Merkles and Perkles and the Brexels and all the, all the Universal

890
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,940
Universal Pandorics that live around the universe are not in Europe and so forth.

891
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,460
Africa and Asia, what they must think of the United States.

892
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,320
Who cares what they think?

893
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,100
They're subhumans if they're not Americans.

894
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:22,580
But sir, did you know that Mexico is part of North America?

895
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,540
No, it isn't.

896
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,240
Because I said so.

897
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:29,780
American exceptionalism.

898
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:34,900
What does exceptionalism mean to these freakish, these peeps?

899
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,780
That means they can do anything they want.

900
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:42,100
It means you can, that your idea of God means going around killing other people.

901
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,320
And you can do anything you want.

902
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,800
You can say anything you want.

903
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,600
Yeah, freedom, man.

904
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,540
Why do you hate our freedoms now?

905
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,420
Did you go to college or something, buddy?

906
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,400
Marxist professors.

907
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:59,340
Yeah, I can smell their stink all over you, buddy.

908
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,240
Educated.

909
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,280
Yeah, that's what, those are the ones we're going to wipe out.

910
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:04,880
This is you.

911
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,160
Year zero, buddy.

912
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,700
Oh, you got glasses, huh?

913
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,040
That probably means you can read.

914
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:10,740
Kill him!

915
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:19,660
I think Cambodia was a pretty civilized country, and that exact thing happened there.

916
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:24,360
And I remember a really super civilized country called Germany.

917
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,960
No, it can't happen here.

918
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:29,240
I'm telling you, my dear.

919
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,760
I've been checking it out a couple times.

920
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,860
Cream cheese.

921
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,620
Cream cheese.

922
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,080
My dear, that it can't happen here.

923
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,000
Because I've been checking it out.

924
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,340
I've checked it out a couple of times.

925
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,680
And I'm telling you, it can't happen here.

926
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,660
Who are the brain bullies?

927
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,280
Wah, wah.

928
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:55,400
Nah, nah.

929
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,720
Boy, those great old tunes of the past.

930
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,240
K-Tel presents Frank Zappa Hits.

931
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,120
For old deaf people.

932
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,740
Feel cool again and smart.

933
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,000
They're all charged with such special meaning now.

934
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:09,520
Don't you think?

935
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,140
What?

936
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:13,200
They're all charged with special meaning now.

937
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:17,040
They didn't know that 60 years or 50 years or whatever it was in the future,

938
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,380
that all God's children would have gone insane.

939
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,660
Well, tell me about it.

940
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:26,940
I've been looking at old subgenius writings from 1980,

941
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,780
and it sounds like it was written tomorrow.

942
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,220
And tomorrow's happening.

943
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:32,220


944
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:32,220


945
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:32,220


946
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:32,220


947
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:32,220


948
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:32,540
Deadlines.

949
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,420
It's creepy.

950
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:35,960
Kooky.

951
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:36,460
Weird.

952
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:37,120
Strange.

953
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:40,140
But, yeah.

954
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:44,960
The movie Idiocracy turns out to be an outdated documentary.

955
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,500
Yeah.

956
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,560
Yeah, perfect example, yeah.

957
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,860
My old movie, The World of the Future,

958
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:53,640
which you can see on Roku or YouTube.

959
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,520
I thought that was like a cartoon.

960
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,420
It turned out to be another outdated documentary,

961
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:03,720
the bozos did take over.

962
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:04,480
Yes, they did.

963
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,140
The orange-haired bozos.

964
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,540
Uh-uh.

965
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,940
Yeah, the tangerine orangutan, some are calling him.

966
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:16,120
Let's visit the world of the future.

967
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:19,220
Let's not and say we did.

968
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,580
Well, we can't help it.

969
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:21,940
We did.

970
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:22,600
I know.

971
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,460
I know.

972
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,800
And you know how we did it?

973
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,820
We didn't die.

974
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,840
I can't believe it's the year 2017.

975
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,700
I can't either.

976
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:31,400
I can't either.

977
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,400
That's when most of the people...

978
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:32,960
I can't either.

979
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,560
I thought I was going to die for sure.

980
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:38,080
Well, maybe not for sure, but I was going to die.

981
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,680
It turned out it's almost 1927.

982
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,000
Or 2017.

983
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,460
That's right, friends.

984
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,280
The calendars are wrong.

985
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,880
It's really 1917.

986
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,700
And in only 50 years, the aliens will arrive.

987
00:46:55,780 --> 00:47:00,400
In 1998, we shall overcome.

988
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,380
We shall overcome.

989
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:09,560
We shall overcome, because the world is just too horrible and useless to us.

990
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:12,640
I wish.

991
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,540
You know, if I was really...

992
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:19,120
If I was a good religious nut, I would believe that, but I'm uncertain.

993
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,420
I have doubts.

994
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,440
Is Bob really going to come through?

995
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,680
Can we trust a salesman?

996
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:31,180
That's like saying you can't trust a real estate.

997
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:35,040
developer, you know, to tell the truth to his people.

998
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,080
That's crazy.

999
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,060
That's just crazy talk.

1000
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:45,700
They have the powers of the gods, and they have the moral background and understanding

1001
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,840
and the stacks of the gods.

1002
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:51,040
So we cannot, oh, never mind.

1003
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:51,560
I'm sorry.

1004
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,240
I feel so wasted and unencumbered tonight.

1005
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,900
I'm tired of it.

1006
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:01,900
All I can think of doing is strangling people with orange hair.

1007
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:06,440
You know, don't blame all redheads.

1008
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,180
They can't help it if they've got a lot of Neanderthal genes.

1009
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,240
They have a lot of health problems that go with that, too.

1010
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,840
Poor, pasty, freckled things.

1011
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,460
They're not all evil, the redheads.

1012
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,720
I'm surprised to hear you say that, dear.

1013
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,880
I know some who are quaint.

1014
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:27,320
Quite nice.

1015
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,600
Oh, I'm just kidding.

1016
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,740
I'm just kidding.

1017
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,360
All you gingers out there.

1018
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:43,320
But it is true that the latest DNA studies of Neanderthal DNA indicate that red hair

1019
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,680
and freckles come from there.

1020
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:55,940
And a few health benefits, too, along with the insanity and secret psychotic nature of

1021
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:56,120
all.

1022
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:57,500
Redheads.

1023
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,240
I'm just kidding.

1024
00:48:58,380 --> 00:48:58,900
Just kidding.

1025
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:01,700
No, serious.

1026
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,260
I'm really just kidding.

1027
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:09,120
It's sad, but it could possibly be true.

1028
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:14,580
But I don't think so, because I know some redheaded people who are very nice.

1029
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:18,420
And I guess all you've got to do is share my political views.

1030
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,640
I think you're pretty nice.

1031
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,340
Well, no.

1032
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,860
People don't have to share your political views to be real.

1033
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:27,460
Really, really nice.

1034
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,240
Or my sandwich.

1035
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:33,820
What if they were to perhaps share my stock holdings?

1036
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,480
Well, it would be better if they shared their sandwich.

1037
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:37,680
Yeah.

1038
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:43,860
Shareholders should indeed share their sandwiches as well as their stocks and values.

1039
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:47,400
What about their lack of knowledge?

1040
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,800
Should they share that?

1041
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:52,040
Well, we don't have much choice in that.

1042
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,400
I mean, we're going to be.

1043
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:00,520
Hounded with their lack of knowledge for a while now, I think.

1044
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:01,180
I know.

1045
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:04,360
Maybe even eight years before they run stuff.

1046
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:07,680
Perhaps we're entering a thousand year dark age.

1047
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,020
Please let it not be so.

1048
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,840
A world of book burning.

1049
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,240
Well, burning of some books.

1050
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,460
Certainly the Bible.

1051
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,260
Nobody would ever burn the Bible.

1052
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:22,360
But, you know, Huckleberry Finn.

1053
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:23,760
That's got a bad word in it.

1054
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,540
We better burn it.

1055
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,680
Please, Connie, let that not be so.

1056
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,000
To kill a mockingbird.

1057
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,480
That's got a bad word in it.

1058
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,880
We better burn that.

1059
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,180
Please, Bob, no.

1060
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:33,940
You know, that evolution stuff.

1061
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,480
All those science textbooks.

1062
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,200
The Darwin thing.

1063
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,100
Yeah, come on now.

1064
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:39,280
People evolved from monkeys.

1065
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,940
How come there's still monkeys around?

1066
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,600
Answer me that, Mr. Smarty Pants, Mr. Intellectual.

1067
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,060
How come there's still monkeys if we evolved from monkeys?

1068
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:50,060
If my uncle is a monkey, then how come there's still a monkey around?

1069
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,100
Why aren't they all people?

1070
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:53,980
See, it doesn't make any sense.

1071
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:54,900
You're science.

1072
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,240
It's just another religion.

1073
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:56,940
I see.

1074
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:58,460
I know this.

1075
00:50:58,660 --> 00:50:59,480
I have faith.

1076
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:00,500
Well, the president knows.

1077
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:05,120
The president knows that academia is a hoax.

1078
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:11,980
That global warming is a hoax created by a bunch of greedy professors who work for universities,

1079
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:18,300
whereas the greedy scientists who work for the oil companies are not greedy scientists

1080
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:19,740
who work for the oil companies.

1081
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:26,600
But the greedy scientists who work for academia, they've created this vast hoax of which only

1082
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:36,120
God can change the weather and only God can, you know, I saw a photograph the other day

1083
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:42,120
of our president-elect posing with, quote, Dr. Wakeman.

1084
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:47,500
He's the guy who is famous for letting all the parents know that the reason their kids

1085
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:55,120
had autism was entirely because they were vaccinated, even though almost every human

1086
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,580
being has been vaccinated.

1087
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:00,160
And only 1% of them have autism.

1088
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:04,840
Obviously vaccinations must be the cause of autism.

1089
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,640
And that is the level of science we're entering.

1090
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:14,620
You know, I'm involved with, believe it or not, even though I'm a weird cult leader,

1091
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:20,180
I'm actually involved on the fringe with some skeptical scientific and atheist groups.

1092
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,120
And they're crapping their britches, boy.

1093
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:30,000
They're trying to keep a stiff upper lip, but they're basically losing it.

1094
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:37,380
It's because it's always been an uphill battle, but now it's just becoming almost hopeless.

1095
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,680
They're legislating ignorance and superstition.

1096
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,640
I love the way you said that.

1097
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:47,300
They're legislating ignorance and superstition.

1098
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:48,980
Yep.

1099
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,900
Well, that's nothing new.

1100
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:51,680
But...

1101
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,980
Things were starting to look up for a while.

1102
00:52:55,040 --> 00:53:00,740
If you're a libtard or a college-educated, know-it-all, scientific kind of stupid person,

1103
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,600
because you know smart people is really stupid.

1104
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,500
Bob said so.

1105
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:04,780
Bob said that.

1106
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,360
He said, if you're smart, then you're stupid.

1107
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,160
If you're stupid, then you're lucky.

1108
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,840
Because then you don't know anything.

1109
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,340
You don't know all the bad stuff.

1110
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,420
You just have fun.

1111
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:13,940
Drink beer.

1112
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,820
Go driving around real fast.

1113
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:19,380
Watch the game.

1114
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:20,560
Everything's cool.

1115
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:21,340
You know.

1116
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,000
Party pants.

1117
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,560
They come along and they just wreck everything.

1118
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:30,680
Trying to tell everybody, oh, well, now monkeys and fossils and time machines and all that

1119
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:31,320
crazy stuff.

1120
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,780
It just doesn't make no sense.

1121
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:34,400
I watch TV.

1122
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:35,500
I know what's going on.

1123
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,940
I got Facebook and Twitter.

1124
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,360
My friends tell me what's going on.

1125
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,420
I Google things.

1126
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,820
Google Hillary criminal.

1127
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:45,320
You'll see.

1128
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,740
There's no bias in that Google.

1129
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,900
Just Google Hillary criminal murderer.

1130
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:51,660
You'll see.

1131
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:51,660


1132
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,900
There's just acres of proof.

1133
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:54,980
All you got to do is Google it.

1134
00:53:56,260 --> 00:54:00,860
Of course, if you Google Hillary nice person, you'll see a bunch of communist propaganda.

1135
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:04,020
Communist Muslim propaganda.

1136
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,640
I need to work on my kiff.

1137
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:06,780
I don't have that.

1138
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,600
Yeah, I don't have that real well.

1139
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,380
The communists have been coming to take our guns for the last 30 years.

1140
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:17,140
It's taken them a real long time to get to our houses, you know.

1141
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,600
I guess because they have had to walk.

1142
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,660
But they are here.

1143
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:21,660


1144
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:21,660


1145
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:21,660


1146
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:21,660


1147
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:21,660


1148
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:21,660


1149
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:21,660


1150
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:21,660


1151
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:21,660


1152
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:21,660


1153
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:22,460
They are going to someday.

1154
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:26,900
It could be within the next 30 years, but it could be tomorrow.

1155
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,440
They're coming to get our guns.

1156
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:34,120
And everybody, is that true that there's more guns in America than there are people?

1157
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,820
I don't know.

1158
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,720
I'm sure there's more bullets than there are people.

1159
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,840
I don't know if that's a true false fact.

1160
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:44,560
I'm sure there are more.

1161
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,640
But it's not the guns.

1162
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,500
It's not the number of guns, Dave.

1163
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:49,460
It's the number of bullets.

1164
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:51,640
You only need one gun if you have a number of guns.

1165
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:51,640


1166
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,180
Not bullets.

1167
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,100
And if it's a big enough gun.

1168
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:59,380
It's just like Joe Stalin said, it's not who votes, it's who counts the votes that's

1169
00:54:59,380 --> 00:54:59,700
important.

1170
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:05,600
A better thing you've never heard of cobalt thorium G. The doomsday bomb.

1171
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,420
Man, I can walk.

1172
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:15,520
That's what that reminds me of, the doomsday machine.

1173
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:16,200
Yeah.

1174
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:21,520
We're sitting on a vast carbuncle right now and it's ready to explode in our faces.

1175
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:21,620
Yeah.

1176
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,180
We're sitting on a vast carbuncle right now and it's ready to explode in our faces.

1177
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:26,320
Oh, now nuclear war is a, that's a danger of the past.

1178
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,160
That could never happen here.

1179
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:36,600
Why, we've disarmed, uh, uh, uh, uh, like, oh no, actually there's just as many as there

1180
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,080
ever were.

1181
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:41,140
And now there's an, a redhead with his finger on the button.

1182
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,180
Yes, a madman.

1183
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,580
By definition.

1184
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:44,360
Yes.

1185
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,260
If it's a redhead, it's a madman.

1186
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:45,880
It's not a redhead.

1187
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,780
Oh, I didn't say that.

1188
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:47,180
I'm just kidding.

1189
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:49,000
He's an orange balloon orangutan.

1190
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,400
But it's okay to bully people now.

1191
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,500
It's okay to bully left-handed people.

1192
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:54,880
Chop it off.

1193
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:58,100
If they can't write their name with their right hand like everybody else, just chop

1194
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:58,980
off that left hand.

1195
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,200
They'll learn how to write right.

1196
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,860
Cause we're right.

1197
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:06,160
They can grow wings and fly with the right-winged people.

1198
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,420
Like Hawkman, Hawkboy, Hawkgirl.

1199
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:15,780
It's all, just, I don't believe the mainstream news.

1200
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,640
I believe DC Comics.

1201
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:20,520
DC?

1202
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:21,180
DC?

1203
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:21,720
Marvel is the name of the most patriotic comic book franchise.

1204
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:21,720


1205
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:22,340
Why you traitor?

1206
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:26,620
Marvel is the only patriotic comic book franchise.

1207
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,780
You've got the guts to prove it.

1208
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,380
Hey, Dave.

1209
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,100
It's almost an hour up of show.

1210
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:37,500
Yes.

1211
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,100
If we use the other shows.

1212
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:42,580
Have we spoken almost an hour?

1213
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:47,540
Yes, if you count all the stuff I've theoretically already played.

1214
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:49,900
You see?

1215
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:51,160
So you played this DVD.

1216
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:51,160


1217
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:54,860
So theoretically, but not in the physical realm of the world.

1218
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:58,940
As far as anyone who hears this is concerned, I already played it.

1219
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,220
Yes, this is time control.

1220
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,720
This is what we mean by time control.

1221
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:09,840
Actually, Dave, you know, the trickiest part of chimping this show

1222
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,460
is getting it down to under an hour.

1223
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:16,520
Because we almost always end up going somehow a minute or two over,

1224
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,240
and something's got to go.

1225
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,740
So usually it's my stutters.

1226
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:28,260
If I remove 50 stutters, that cuts down by about 30 seconds or a minute.

1227
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:33,900
Sometimes I just have to take out the PR news that was going to be in there.

1228
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:37,560
Sometimes I have to add a PR news.

1229
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:43,520
Anything to get it right around that money shot point, one minute.

1230
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,820
The Goldilocks spot.

1231
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,820
And you certainly don't want to hear a wrecking.

1232
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,680
Yeah, God, if only it was one minute.

1233
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,040
A minute of slack.

1234
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:53,760
Oh, we did that.

1235
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:56,980
They didn't sell either.

1236
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:00,760
I did a series of a dozen minutes of slack

1237
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:04,720
because an FM station, a rock station in Dallas asked me to.

1238
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:09,200
And as soon as I was in their office and pushed play,

1239
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:13,340
the first five seconds of the first minute of slack,

1240
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:19,040
everyone in the room knew Subgenius will never work on commercial FM.

1241
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:19,420
Right.

1242
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,260
It was just so obvious.

1243
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:27,440
It's like flesh pulling out a cross in the middle of a coven of vampires

1244
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,420
or a vampire suddenly waking up.

1245
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:37,820
So, yeah, we couldn't ever do commercial radio.

1246
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,220
Praise Bob.

1247
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:42,540
And that's why we never got as big as South Park.

1248
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:46,880
And that's why Parker and Stone are living Philo's life for you.

1249
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:47,400
Yeah.

1250
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:48,240
Yeah.

1251
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:49,220
Yeah.

1252
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:49,220


1253
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:49,220


1254
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:49,220


1255
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:49,220


1256
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:49,220


1257
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:49,220


1258
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:49,220


1259
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:49,220


1260
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:49,220


1261
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:49,980
Not mine, friends.

1262
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:52,220
I like it just the way it is.

1263
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,200
Under the radar.

1264
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:55,900
Underground.

1265
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:58,940
And living it all himself.

1266
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,000
Yeah.

1267
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:01,680
Yeah.

1268
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:02,340
Yeah.

1269
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,980
Well, we don't have to answer to anybody.

1270
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:07,480
Except the FCC.

1271
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:13,300
We actually still have to play by certain rules on the broadcast version.

1272
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:18,660
Now, friends, you know, the Internet version of this show is a whole nother thing.

1273
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:21,480
It's longer, usually.

1274
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,260
I don't have to worry about it fitting now in the Internet version.

1275
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:28,000
In fact, let's say goodbye right now.

1276
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,000
Bye.

1277
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:30,200
Bye.

1278
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:39,720
From PR News in Washington, I'm forcing tens of thousands of people to scrap their original plans and force more evacuations.

1279
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:41,720
President Obama practices.

1280
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,400
Give some value to Quebec.

1281
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:48,520
It starts from where we ate and all across the country.

1282
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,620
Obama speaking.

1283
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,680
Dow is to 7627684486105.

1284
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,020
From Washington, this is PR News in Washington.

1285
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:08,060
And now the Internet tag-on part begins where I can go ahead and talk about the fact that we're having a Slack Friday sale.

1286
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:08,560
Oh, that's right.

1287
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:11,120
That lasts all month long, friends.

1288
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,620
One month of Slack Friday.

1289
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:17,620
When you can buy a subgenius minister ordainment kit.

1290
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,780
For you and another one for your friend.

1291
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:24,220
Or your loved one or your pet.

1292
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,660
For the price of one.

1293
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:27,580
That's right.

1294
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:31,380
Instead of $35 each plus postage.

1295
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,700
It's $35 for two.

1296
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:39,220
That's like $17.50 each plus postage.

1297
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,280
What a horrible deal.

1298
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:41,100
What a great deal.

1299
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,100
It is great.

1300
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,000
What a fascinating way to spend a weekend.

1301
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,180
Oh, not just a weekend.

1302
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,500
It's a way to spend a lot.

1303
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:48,520


1304
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:56,700
Because, friends, when you get your subgenius membership pack, for one thing, it takes about a week just to read all the stuff in it.

1305
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:57,960
It's not a little package.

1306
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:07,040
It's got 25 separate pieces all hand-assembled by chimpanzees at the Subgenius Foundation Megafest Temple Lodge Manufacturing Facility.

1307
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,540
Very tired chimpanzees.

1308
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,380
Writing each other's own pictures.

1309
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,240
Chimpanzees named Ivan.

1310
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,080
And, yeah.

1311
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:18,380
But then, that's just.

1312
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:18,780
That's the beginning.

1313
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:22,100
Because you've entered a new world.

1314
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:26,520
You can now mingle with other subgeniuses if you dare.

1315
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:29,780
A lot of people choose not to.

1316
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:36,260
I'd say the majority never really want to meet another subgenius.

1317
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:43,100
But those who dare and do, sometimes, sometimes they finally get laid.

1318
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:48,040
And sometimes they find their.

1319
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:49,380
True yeti mate.

1320
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,440
It's happened again and again.

1321
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:54,980
And other just true mutants.

1322
01:01:55,380 --> 01:02:01,600
Virtual or true mutants that they dreamed might exist that were like them, but they actually meet them.

1323
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:03,000
One of us.

1324
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:03,900
One of us.

1325
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:04,900
Kubo Gobble.

1326
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:05,720
One of us.

1327
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,420
Kubo Gobble.

1328
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:07,980
Kubo Hey.

1329
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:11,560
You're one of us today.

1330
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:15,680
You can be one of us for $35.

1331
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,120
That's really cynical.

1332
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:19,180
That's a very cynical thing, isn't it?

1333
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:21,720
But, hey, let's face it.

1334
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:22,900
You know, we gotta stay.

1335
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,820
We gotta keep the post office box open.

1336
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:29,380
And I'll get that post office box in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1337
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:33,460
That's post office box 181-417.

1338
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:37,400
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1339
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:46,240
For those of you in prison who can't use the internet or PayPal, just get your buddy to send us $35 and give us your address.

1340
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:46,660
And.

1341
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:50,480
Well, actually, most prisons will tear up the membership pack.

1342
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:50,880
Really?

1343
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:51,760
Yeah, they will.

1344
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,280
Yeah, it's real hard to get a membership pack to prison.

1345
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:56,360
A book is not so hard.

1346
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:56,980
That's awful.

1347
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:59,100
But the membership pack has got a little pamphlet.

1348
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:01,640
And it looks like extremist material.

1349
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:02,640
Duh.

1350
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:03,720
It's supposed to.

1351
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,440
And they take it like that.

1352
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:12,180
And so, yeah, a lot of our prisoner subgeniuses have a lot of trouble getting this stuff.

1353
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:14,460
I've had to send.

1354
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:14,860
Yeah, it looks like.

1355
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,380
I actually do.

1356
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:18,860
I do send pamphlets for free occasionally.

1357
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:22,020
If they write a nice letter, I'll send it.

1358
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:24,320
But.

1359
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:27,380
Because most of them are in there for marijuana.

1360
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:28,940
Most of them.

1361
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,800
Except for the murderers.

1362
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,080
And there's one guy.

1363
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:34,500
Let's not talk about him.

1364
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:35,620
Okay, friends.

1365
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:36,720
Well, that's the thing.

1366
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,180
This is the internet section of the show where we can advertise.

1367
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:44,620
So go to subgenius.com or actually.

1368
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:45,040
Well.

1369
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:52,740
Well, until probably April or so, you can write us at our Texas office and send contributions

1370
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:53,580
for the show.

1371
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:57,540
If you're a musician, you do stuff better than Frank Zappa ever dreamed of.

1372
01:03:57,580 --> 01:04:07,020
Go ahead and send it to Stang at Post Office Box 807 Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

1373
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:08,420
Praise Bob.

1374
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:09,540
Praise Connie.

1375
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,080
Now, it's not important, but is it one or 12 words?

1376
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:13,740
Glen Rose.

1377
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:14,920
Is Glen Rose.

1378
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:15,020
Is Glen Rose.

1379
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:15,100
Is Glen Rose.

1380
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:15,800
One or two words.

1381
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:16,820
Two words, Dave.

1382
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,000
Yes.

1383
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:24,080
You must make the listeners aware of such things, because if not, they'll send it to

1384
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:25,020
Glen Rose, Arizona.

1385
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,640
Well, the funny thing, there's a Glen Rose, Arkansas.

1386
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:29,740
There is a Glen Rose.

1387
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:30,720
But here's the thing.

1388
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,760
Although it's two words, it's pronounced as if it were one word.

1389
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:34,460
Glen Rose.

1390
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:36,660
You don't say Glen Rose.

1391
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:38,480
You say Glen Rose.

1392
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:38,800
Glen Rose.

1393
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:42,300
As in, man, this parking lot is terrible.

1394
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:43,820
Well, this is Glen Rose.

1395
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:44,700
Boy.

1396
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:48,640
Boy, these clerks can't add and subtract at all.

1397
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:49,200
They love this.

1398
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:49,740
It's Glen Rose.

1399
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,000
Well, this place isn't open.

1400
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:54,620
It's only four o'clock on a Friday afternoon.

1401
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:56,280
You forget something, Princess Wee.

1402
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:57,360
This is Glen Rose.

1403
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:57,780
Yeah.

1404
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:06,180
Actually, we're quoting the late Pappy, who established himself in Glen Rose, only to

1405
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:14,200
spend the remainder of his life complaining about the stupid denizens of Glen Rose.

1406
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:19,860
But he improved Glen Rose oh so much in his years here.

1407
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,500
Well, they were only stupid compared to him.

1408
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,960
And that pretty much includes everybody.

1409
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:27,120
Everybody's stupid compared to Pappy.

1410
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:27,880
That's true.

1411
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,040
Especially me.

1412
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:35,040
But where do you think we get terms like subgenius?

1413
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:39,260
If you don't fit in somewhere, make a place where you do fit in.

1414
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:43,940
Yeah, even if you've got to use a hack or a meat muscle grinder,

1415
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,760
to find that place for the smack a hole in something.

1416
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:49,320
It's not important how you get there.

1417
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,900
The important thing is the moment of arrival.

1418
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:52,860
You got one.

1419
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:54,420
Gobble, gobble, gobble.

1420
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,100
Gobble, gobble, gobble.

1421
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:57,600
Gobble, gobble, gobble.

1422
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:58,640
One of us.

1423
01:05:58,660 --> 01:05:59,300
One of us.

1424
01:05:59,300 --> 01:05:59,980
One of us.

1425
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:00,360
One of us.

1426
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:09,240
Well, Dave, I'm afraid we've used up 41 minutes of show, some of which is Internet special.

1427
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:10,020
And that's fine.

1428
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:11,500
I like that.

1429
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:12,020
Mm-hmm.

1430
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:13,020
Yeah.

1431
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:13,020


1432
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:13,120
Mm-hmm.

1433
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:13,320
Mm-hmm.

1434
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:13,920
Mm-hmm.

1435
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:13,920


1436
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:13,920


1437
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:13,920


1438
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:13,920


1439
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:13,920


1440
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:13,920


1441
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:13,920


1442
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:13,920


1443
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:14,440
Internet special.

1444
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:16,100
But I can't think of anything to cuss about.

1445
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:16,620
I can't either.

1446
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:23,600
I could let Lucifer, a tyrant of many, many swear words, if you'd like.

1447
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:24,980
Sure.

1448
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:25,960
Go ahead, Lucifer.

1449
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:27,060
Go for it.

1450
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:27,560
Oh, okay.

1451
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:28,320
Loosen up.

1452
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,560
Cut, pussy fart, shit, fuck piss.

1453
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,940
That doesn't sound that impressive.

1454
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:37,700
I feel like saying this now because of the dirty sevens of the filthy sevens.

1455
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:40,900
I feel I can't say anymore.

1456
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:41,580
Right.

1457
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:43,380
Well, it's kind of pointless nowadays.

1458
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:46,420
Because kindergarten kids talk that way.

1459
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:48,380
Well, if you...

1460
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:51,800
And Christian schools, anyway.

1461
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:54,400
When nobody's looking.

1462
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:54,860
Right.

1463
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:55,960
The Martian schools?

1464
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:56,820
Mm-hmm.

1465
01:06:58,420 --> 01:06:58,900
Yeah.

1466
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,420
They're known for that.

1467
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:02,720
But really, Dave, we probably should...

1468
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:07,080
Well, we don't have to hang up, but we have to stop recording, so...

1469
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,920
Yeah, we have to break character now and hang up a codpiece.

1470
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:10,800
Okay.

1471
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,660
I wish I wore a mighty codpiece.

1472
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:13,180
I'd show.

1473
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:13,600
Come on.

1474
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:18,440
It'd be ten times bigger than anything you'd ever seen in your life.

1475
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,240
It's funny.

1476
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:23,100
My mother-in-law mentioned codpieces.

1477
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,200
She did just today.

1478
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:27,060
My mother was talking about codpieces.

1479
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:29,860
Wistfully.

1480
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:33,000
It's a weird place to dangle a fish, that's for sure.

1481
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:34,160
It is.

1482
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:39,420
I mean, if you think of the Monty Python routine where the fish slapping dance.

1483
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,520
Well, but the smell is right.

1484
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:45,820
Yes, the smell is accurate for that location.

1485
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,960
Not for all of us, please.

1486
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,780
I'm an avocado myself.

1487
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:56,720
Oh, avocado.

1488
01:07:56,780 --> 01:08:00,160
Rather strange industrial avocado, but still not a fish.

1489
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:03,820
Oh, we would love to mollycoddle you, Dave.

1490
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:06,600
You little codpiece.

1491
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:10,320
Us and Molly would mollycoddle your codpiece.

1492
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:13,280
That's a whole new...

1493
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:13,360
You're a little...

1494
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:17,260
We're a generation of strangely stringed together words.

1495
01:08:17,980 --> 01:08:18,820
Mollycoddle pieces.

1496
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:21,140
Coddling with mollycoddle.

1497
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:21,540
That's no coincidence.

1498
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:23,040
That's no coincidence.

1499
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,400
That was all planned ahead of time by Satan.

1500
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:30,000
He put dirty thoughts in people's heads and sell pornography.

1501
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:36,280
I had a great time yesterday seeing there was a polka song on called Saint Nick is Coming

1502
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:38,980
Soon, and it kept on repeating over and over.

1503
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:41,840
Santa, Satan is coming soon.

1504
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,360
Satan is coming soon.

1505
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:49,180
I felt better the whole rest of the day after just singing Satan is coming soon seven times.

1506
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:50,780
Well, we need change.

1507
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:52,300
That's what this is all about.

1508
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:53,880
People voted for change.

1509
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,000
We've had enough Jesus.

1510
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,080
It's time for Satan.

1511
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:57,560
Satan's a good businessman.

1512
01:08:57,780 --> 01:08:58,700
We need a good businessman.

1513
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:03,720
We don't need any of this giveaway, you know, love your neighbor, feed the poor crap.

1514
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:09,580
Let the poor pull themselves up by their bootstraps, and they can take their bootstraps and shove

1515
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:11,720
it in the codpiece, too, for all I care.

1516
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:13,340
It's every man for himself.

1517
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:13,340


1518
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:13,340


1519
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:14,920
We're bullies.

1520
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:16,060
This is a bully nation.

1521
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,500
A nation of finks and bullies.

1522
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:19,080
Oh, no.

1523
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:20,220
You're going to live with it.

1524
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:21,360
Oh, no.

1525
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,320
Yeah, suck it up.

1526
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:23,600
Oh, no.

1527
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:24,720
Get with the picture.

1528
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:25,540
Get with the program.

1529
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:26,080
Come on.

1530
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:27,960
Oh, you can't.

1531
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:28,900
Sad.

1532
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:30,340
Sad.

1533
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:32,140
Sad.

1534
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:36,660
I mean, think of how big our plates would have been if we had to have our plates with

1535
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:37,360
Beverly Clem.

1536
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:39,180
That would have been quite a story.

1537
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:43,340
I mean, that would be enough stuff to keep us busy as sadder as for a year.

1538
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:43,340


1539
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:43,340


1540
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:43,340


1541
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:43,340


1542
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:45,540
I mean, the whole world would have been sadder than we are now, and we would have been sadder

1543
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:45,540


1544
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:50,040
But now, it's even ten times worse.

1545
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:52,020
Now it is the age of Satan.

1546
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:53,560
Hail Satan.

1547
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:54,540
But, but, but.

1548
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,720
Damien is president now.

1549
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:58,760
I am the meek, and I want to inherit.

1550
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:02,320
The meek will inherit nothing, baby.

1551
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:09,840
Well, it doesn't bode well for the average sub-G who's walking around with a stereo

1552
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:13,320
with his pants hanging down and walking too far into the back end of the car.

1553
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:13,320


1554
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:13,320


1555
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:13,320


1556
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:16,740
No, but it never boded well for them.

1557
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,400
Ask Vaughn Bode.

1558
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:20,460
The late sub-G.

1559
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:21,860
Yeah, I was going to say Vaughn Bode.

1560
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:28,060
Actually, Vaughn Bode didn't live long enough to join the church, but his son, Mark Bode,

1561
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:30,640
contributed artwork to our book, Revelation X.

1562
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:31,180
How about that?

1563
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:36,840
I sat next to him at a sci-fi convention in the vendors section.

1564
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:38,060
Wow.

1565
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,880
He was selling comic books, and I was selling the truth.

1566
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,220
And he had a long line.

1567
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:43,300
He had a long line.

1568
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:46,680
And no one wanted what I was selling.

1569
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,060
Well, a couple of sub-genius quotes.

1570
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:56,760
A perforated foreskin and a bag of onion garlic flavored chips.

1571
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:58,080
Mm-mm.

1572
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:05,320
When was the last time he had a big steaming bowl of pork skin and garlic flavored cod

1573
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:06,120
piece chips?

1574
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,480
Well, that's too long.

1575
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,160
Well, no, seriously.

1576
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:16,700
We've been doing this now for 46 minutes.

1577
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:21,400
So this will be an hour and 15 minute long internet show.

1578
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:22,520
Wow.

1579
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:24,220
So we can say goodbye now.

1580
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:25,940
Okay.

1581
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:26,360
Okay.

1582
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:27,360
To the internet listeners.

1583
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:37,800
And because I got to go up and turn this into an actual MP3 and an Og Vorbis file, and one

1584
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,440
of them has to be under an hour.

1585
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,360
And I'm going to have to go poopoo.

1586
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:43,240
And have no cuss words.

1587
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:46,500
That's a lot of chimpanzee work, folks.

1588
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:49,000
But saying goodbye is so hard to do.

1589
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:49,440
I have to go poopoo.

1590
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:50,680
Right.

1591
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:52,260
And we all have to go poopoo.

1592
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:56,280
I'm going to go poopoo while I eat a poopoo platter.

1593
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,500
I will not poopoo that.

1594
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,020
Did you hear, damn it?

1595
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,520
Dave probably can't hear damn it.

1596
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,620
Damn it started barking.

1597
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:06,520
Yep.

1598
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:08,960
Here we go, boy.

1599
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:09,600
Okay, friends.

1600
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:10,420
With that, we're going to finish this episode of the show.

1601
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:10,420


1602
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:10,420


1603
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:10,420


1604
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:10,420


1605
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:10,420


1606
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:10,420


1607
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:10,880
We're going to fade out.

1608
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,280
We got to take the dog out.

1609
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:13,320
Okay, man.

1610
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:14,840
We got to take the Dave out.

1611
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:16,240
We got to take the Dave out.

1612
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:16,240
