1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:07,520
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard our McDonnell Douglas DC-88 space liner for today's mission to Mars.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,440
The captain has asked that you remain in your seats at all times.

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,420
And please, no smoking.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,820
Attention, please. Folks, this is Third Officer Collins speaking.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,780
I'm your tour guide today, and I'll be telling you about what's going on during the trip.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,040
Right now, we're on final countdown, and you can watch our liftoff on the lower screen in your cabin.

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,100
I'll speak to you again after we're in space.

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,820
Mission control, this is Mars 295 ready for departure.

9
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,120
295, roger. Countdown is going.

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,360
Going up in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

11
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,100
We'll meet again at midnight.

12
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,960
Well, we're back.

13
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,920
That was very disconcerting.

14
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,880
We're diving for coconuts in just a moment.

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,840
It's like being on one of those childlike toys where you're in the...

16
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,120
Childlike toys, yeah.

17
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,660
A toy where you're...

18
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,560
Childlike toys.

19
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,600
The kind in the playground toys, you know, that spin around, you push it.

20
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,740
Oh, those were interesting toys.

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,520
I always thought the thing about that that was interesting was they were apparently communally used.

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,200
Yeah.

23
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,840
And it was thought that they...

24
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,420
It was natural that there would be a place with swing sets and so on.

25
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:32,980
Right.

26
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,360
It was natural to have those bars that you climbed on and teeter-totter.

27
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,560
Natural to fall down and stuff.

28
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,120
Remember the teeter-totter?

29
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:46,020
Yes, and epic, horrible stories about some kid who swung completely over the swing and broke his...

30
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,220
And flew for two miles into the arsenal, the Army arsenal down the road.

31
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,300
What about the double-barrel Coliseum Jimmy Page baritone soprano?

32
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,020
Yeah.

33
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,020


34
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,020


35
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,020


36
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,020


37
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,020


38
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,020


39
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,020


40
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,020


41
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,020


42
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,020


43
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,020


44
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,420
A combination.

45
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,360
Wait a minute, are you trying to one-up us?

46
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,240
We are professional radio people.

47
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,200
One horn, not one statement, sir.

48
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,480
It's 406, man.

49
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,080
Oh, sorry.

50
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,580
He represents that remark.

51
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,160
Yeah.

52
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,920
That's his phone.

53
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,620
We are professionally evaluated radio professionals.

54
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:16,920
So what's...

55
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,540
I'm freaking out, man.

56
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,820
I have a question for the caller.

57
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,680
It's an ancient, ancient little bothery item that's flying around.

58
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,900
They are super bothery.

59
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,080
Okay.

60
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:22,840
That's where they're designed.

61
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,440
What's your favorite malapropism?

62
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,500
I beg your pardon?

63
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,020
What's your favorite malapropism?

64
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,020


65
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,020


66
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,620
Malapropism.

67
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,280
Too many syllables.

68
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,500
Are you a man or a woman?

69
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,240
Oh, that's pretty good, I guess, but I'm trying to find a malaprop aspect of it.

70
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,460
Anyway...

71
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,720
I don't know what that word means.

72
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,100
It means that you use a word that is not the right word.

73
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,180
Like, for all intensive purposes, you use the wrong word.

74
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,120
Like what Samuel Goldwyn did for business.

75
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,400
I like that word.

76
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:51,980
I think you're the right guy.

77
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,380
For all intensive purposes.

78
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,580
Intensive purposes.

79
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,980
That's a good one.

80
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,800
That's how this...

81
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,360
That's how this color feels.

82
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,200
It's when you use the wrong word, but it's more right than you could ever imagine.

83
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,980
Like if you went to the Ask Dr. Hal show and you said the wrong word, but it's more right than you could ever imagine.

84
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,280
It'd be up to me to have to fix that up.

85
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:19,300
If you ever go to the Ask Dr. Hal show and you need a question that will stop Dr. Hal, I have that question.

86
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,440
A secret question.

87
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,120
You wouldn't say it on the air, would you?

88
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,820
I've already planned it.

89
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,500
I wouldn't say it on the air.

90
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,460
I'm not going to waste it.

91
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,000
Exactly.

92
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,780
You would have to drive all the way.

93
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,240
It's probably worth five or six dollars is the question.

94
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,800
It all depends on whether you find a sponsor and generous audience members at the show.

95
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,640
I'm going to go there and I'm going to sell.

96
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,640
I'm going to sell.

97
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,960
What I'm going to do, I'm going to sell questions.

98
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,780
That's what I'll do, Dr. Hal.

99
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,240
I'll show up at your show with a little booth where I sell questions that will stump Dr. Hal.

100
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,060
And each one of them will cost at least 20 bucks.

101
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,580
And we'll be in it on the side.

102
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,660
Wow.

103
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,620
So that you'll know that...

104
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,160
Wow.

105
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,540
Wow.

106
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:57,760
Wow.

107
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:57,760


108
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:57,760


109
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:57,760


110
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:57,760


111
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:57,760


112
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:57,760


113
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:57,760


114
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:57,760


115
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:57,780
Wow.

116
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:57,780


117
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:57,780


118
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:57,780


119
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:57,780


120
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:57,780


121
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:57,780


122
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,080
You'll have to act like it stumps them.

123
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:00,920
It stumps you.

124
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,380
Okay, I'm ready.

125
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,220
And we'll generate tons of money from that.

126
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:04,840
See?

127
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,340
And I'll be your ringer.

128
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,220
Look, this is a great scam I'm putting together here.

129
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:17,180
Well, you're forgetting, though, that this undercuts the other scam where it seems like I can give everybody the answer.

130
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,420
Now it seems like I can't do it and there's no purpose.

131
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,040
Well, some of them want to stump you.

132
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,900
That's why they're there.

133
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,500
They want to give you the question that you can't answer.

134
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,540
At least one guy does.

135
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,540
When I'm there, at least one guy does.

136
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,040
Well, we'll see.

137
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,200
We'll see how it goes.

138
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,040
It's all a matter of timing.

139
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,240
See what comes out of the laundry, I suppose.

140
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,160
That's why I need a bag of questions that Dr. Hal can't answer.

141
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,780
You put me in a trick bag.

142
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,580
The bag of tricks.

143
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,660
Just like Felix.

144
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,880
Giant mosquitoes are going to drain me dry before I'm able to finish this broadcast.

145
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,420
It's working.

146
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,000
They are.

147
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,240
They're sucking the blood, the very life out of us.

148
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,480
The blood is the life, Mr. Renfield.

149
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,580
Can we get a can of ant spray in the radio studio?

150
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,800
No, that's what hurts us worse than it hurts them.

151
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,060
That's going to trickle down into the food system and cause you to have cancer when you're 85.

152
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,760
And children with multiple limbs.

153
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,460
You know, I'm so conservative sounding, Colin.

154
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,320
Yes, it's all going to happen.

155
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:33,420
And that horrible exercise in mutation from the grotesque amount of toxins in the environment.

156
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,220
The age of mutants has begun.

157
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,740
In the meantime, you can celebrate KPFA's 66,000th birthday by going to the kpfa.org...

158
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,680
http://ig.me.me

159
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,120
.me

160
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,440
.me

161
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:51,780
.me

162
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,740
.me

163
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,360
I've never been tipped on already.

164
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,540
You're the only one on my thing.

165
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:03,920
See you later, Mr. Renfield.

166
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,800
We used to have him.

167
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,240
It became time.

168
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:18,800
We really did.

169
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,160
The path came

170
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,140
to your house lately and I'm sure you know it.

171
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:27,140
Yeah, but here, you know, I have to take a break every 11 minutes and run out and throw wood in the burner.

172
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,780
He has to keep it stoked.

173
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,700
I'm going to go back there in a minute and throw some wood.

174
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,660
So it's tough.

175
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,180
So we'd like to move up to steam computers.

176
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,700
Steam pump computers.

177
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,820
And then on to electricity, which we will have one day.

178
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,560
I'm sure of it. I'm just sure of it.

179
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,620
I've heard electricity is dangerous, though.

180
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,300
It can kill you.

181
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah, it can leak out.

182
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,340
I know.

183
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,840
You've got to tape all the little slots and those holes in the wall.

184
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,880
I might be leaking right now.

185
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,460
You could be.

186
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,880
Hey, would you help us do less on-air fundraising by donating to KPFA?

187
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,440
Send your cards and letters to KPFA management and tell them that this show,

188
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:17,580
this show, the Puzzling Evidence Show, shouldn't have to do all the rules and stuff everybody else does.

189
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:17,980
Yes.

190
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,500
They should have a...

191
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,140
We have to be excerpted from those foolish...

192
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,620
The company should make us a big hammock.

193
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,260
Even the show before us should probably not have to obey all the rules.

194
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,360
You know?

195
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,200
If we just didn't have to do all the rules and stuff.

196
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,860
Yeah, they can't make us...

197
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,560
What if you had a show that was about not obeying the rules?

198
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,800
That's what we are.

199
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,180
How can you not...

200
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,900
How can you put rules on a show that the purpose of which is to not obey the rules?

201
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,980
This is all confusing.

202
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,740
I'm trying to write this down as fast as I can.

203
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,100
Yes.

204
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,800
It's not to us to have slavish attention to society's laws and...

205
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,020
It's so hard to keep up with the changes.

206
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,420
If you don't worry about the rules...

207
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,480
Primitive customs are not for us.

208
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,400
Ours is a high and lonely destiny.

209
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:07,700
Just remember someday when you're tuning in late at night and you don't hear the show like you should be hearing it

210
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,520
and you hear something else, then you had your chance.

211
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,280
I could have stopped that.

212
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,180
You had your chance to stick up for the show.

213
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,960
But no, I did not.

214
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,480
You could have called in.

215
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,940
You could have said that, you know,

216
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,960
I sat here and didn't do anything when they took the show away

217
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,480
because I never thought they'd come in here for me.

218
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,020
Right.

219
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,460
Yeah, yeah.

220
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,640
And you're talking about the show before us, which was over the crack of dawn?

221
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,900
Over the crack of dawn.

222
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,300
Over Barbara Golden's silver hour.

223
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,260
Yeah, that Barbara Golden.

224
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:35,740
Rose.

225
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,400
Wake up, feel Rosie, and then wake up at the crack of dawn and feel Rosie.

226
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,860
Leave Rosie alone.

227
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,440
She's just going to do her job.

228
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,740
It's just too tempting.

229
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:46,560
Yeah.

230
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,980
Well, anyway, the thing is...

231
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,580
I'm at the crack of dawn down here.

232
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,520
I stopped smoking that stuff here in the kitchen.

233
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,240
And then I feel Rosie.

234
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,560
It feels great.

235
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,560
Yes, I know.

236
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,900
That's just the way those things are.

237
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,680
Might as well pass that pipe over here.

238
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,340
Computer stuff's confusing.

239
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,080
That's what I'm saying.

240
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,060
We need new computers so we can bring up the new...

241
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,720
I wish I had...

242
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,360
I wish I just knew what a computer was.

243
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,260
It's like it's this thing that does these things really fast.

244
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:09,920
They used to have them.

245
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,620
Then you get a thing.

246
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,140
From PR News in Washington,

247
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,960
I'm shaking down drug deals,

248
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,780
dealers, and stealing and distributing several kilos of cocaine,

249
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,140
racketeering, not guilty.

250
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,520
U.N. officials say Massachusetts State Police bounced from a dump truck,

251
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,380
crashed through his windshield, and landed on the dashboard.

252
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,980
All but five House Republicans against President Obama.

253
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,740
Five House Republicans are dismissing both motorists.

254
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,320
House lawmakers are in agreement as a political stunt.

255
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,580
And it will provide about $425 billion

256
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,960
to help cover up patient abuse.

257
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,360
Delays.

258
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,180
Besides providing more money,

259
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,440
the bill would make it easier to falsify PR News Washington.

260
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,640
PR News.

261
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,940
The United States and the U.S. say this is PR News.

262
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:15,980
That was PR News, dear friends, from Lemur.

263
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,600
And before that,

264
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,060
we heard about eight minutes of the Puzzling Evidence show

265
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,580
with Dr. Howell talking and Dr. Philo Drummond

266
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,660
talking a bunch there.

267
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,900
This music in the background is Einstein's Secret Orchestra

268
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,020
from the Witch Disco album.

269
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,820
And speaking of Philo, I have a short story.

270
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,180
It's very short about Philo,

271
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,580
which I'm very excited about.

272
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,940
And I'm going to read to you kids.

273
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,160
It's called The Frop-Ridden Pipe.

274
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,440
Philo Drummond looked at the frop-ridden pipe in his hands

275
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,880
and felt slackful.

276
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,120
He walked over to the window and reflected on his polluted surroundings.

277
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,980
He had always hated the abandoned Salton Sea

278
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,680
with its dark, deep dilapos.

279
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,560
It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel safe.

280
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:17,560


281
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:17,560


282
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,020
He was a slackful.

283
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,240
Then he saw something in the distance,

284
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,720
or rather someone.

285
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,360
It was the figure of Bob Dobbs.

286
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,640
Bob was a mutated saint of sales

287
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:34,800
with a deformed exit wound and a hung third nostril.

288
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,800
Philo gulped.

289
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,800
He glanced at his own reflection.

290
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,740
He was a rewardian, a quirky jinkum drinker

291
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,260
with a wasted exit wound and a strapping third nostril.

292
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,460
His friends saw him as an orange, oily overman.

293
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,920
Once, he had even brought a beautiful Bobby

294
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,880
back from the brink of death.

295
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,540
But not even a rewardian person

296
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,360
who had once brought a beautiful Bobby

297
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,540
back from the brink of death

298
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,960
was prepared for what Bob had in store today.

299
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,400
The dust teased like a flapping prairie squid,

300
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,020
making Philo hardcore.

301
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,240
As Philo stepped out to drink,

302
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,800
Bob came closer.

303
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,400
He could see the better smile on his face.

304
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,660
Look, Philo, growled Bob with an unpredictable glare

305
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,340
that reminded Philo of a mutated prehistoric turtle.

306
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,100
It's not that I don't love you, but I want slack.

307
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,000
You owe me $2,494.

308
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,580
Philo looked back even more hardcore

309
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,300
and still fingering the frop-ridden pipe.

310
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,240
Bob, I'll obey you, but I'm not going to drink.

311
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,820
I'll drink, but with grave reservations, he replied.

312
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,460
They looked at each other with fropped feelings,

313
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,280
like two funny, frightened, face-raping bats

314
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,720
excremeditating at a pipe-smoking initiation

315
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,400
which had doctor music playing in the background

316
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,080
and two rapacious uncles trans-boogering to the beat.

317
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,460
Suddenly, Bob lunged forward

318
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,140
and tried to punch Philo in the face.

319
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,400
Quickly, Philo grabbed the frop-ridden pipe

320
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,340
and brought it down on Bob's skull.

321
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,900
Bob's deformed exit wound trembled

322
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,920
and his hung third nostril wobbled.

323
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:29,920
He looked insane, his wallet raw like a witty, wasteful wallet.

324
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,320
Then he let out an agonizing groan

325
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,300
and collapsed onto the ground.

326
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,400
Moments later, Bob Dobbs was dead.

327
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,060
Philo went back inside

328
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,660
and made himself a nice drink of Jenkum.

329
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,320
The End

330
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:55,660
Now friends, I produced that short story

331
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,260
in much less time than it took to read it.

332
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:03,100
And I posted it on one of the subgenius internet forums,

333
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,200
the one, the members-only one, called Scrub Genius.

334
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,220
And Reverend Susie the Flusie reacted strongly.

335
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,700
And she said,

336
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,300
I quote,

337
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,460
WTF

338
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,740
Well, actually she never uses initials like that.

339
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,540
She said the whole phrase.

340
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,000
I'll have what Stang's having,

341
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,000
full-body hallucinations.

342
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,740
And with no Monster Hunter inferences either.

343
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,700
Is this a new age of creativity

344
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,960
dawning here, Stang?

345
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,020
Well Susie, that would be nice, wouldn't it?

346
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,720
But actually, that was, yeah, creativity.

347
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,400
Yeah, sure.

348
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,920
That was actually written by computer.

349
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,820
There's a, Philo himself was telling me

350
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,580
I ought to look at this website called

351
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,420
plotgenerator.com

352
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,420
There's actually quite a number of them.

353
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,640
That was the one I used.

354
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,700
And when you go to plotgenerator.com,

355
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,460
it says you want to write a short story?

356
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,180
And then you just fill in some blanks.

357
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,200
You give them some names.

358
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,660
And a location.

359
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,200
And a few adjectives.

360
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,220
And a few random nouns.

361
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,300
And adverbs and stuff.

362
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,200
And then it writes the story.

363
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:29,480
I've noticed that it pretty much does almost the same story.

364
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,840
But you can have it end in a violent way,

365
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,920
a happy way, or a sad way.

366
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,240
Susie thought that that computer story

367
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,900
was more creative than what I've been doing lately.

368
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,500
So I wrote one.

369
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,060
Well, the computer and I wrote one for her.

370
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,180
This one is called

371
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,360
Hippie Filled Wisteria

372
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,440
A Short Story About X-Day

373
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,740
by Gray Harryhausen.

374
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,540
Because we have X-Day coming up,

375
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,400
the end of the world.

376
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,640
And of course, we're looking forward to the party

377
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,460
just before that at this Wisteria campground

378
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,180
where subgeniuses from the world over come and get in.

379
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:11,460
And they gather.

380
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,860
All ten or fifteen of them.

381
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,320
Well, actually, it's more than that.

382
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,420
We had 400 of them in 1998.

383
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,780
The first, what the so-called.

384
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,020
But those were the people who really believed

385
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,380
that was the year 1998.

386
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,620
We know that this year is really 1998.

387
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,420
Anyway, here is the story,

388
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,960
Hippie Filled Wisteria.

389
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,040
Susie the floozy had always loved hippie-filled wisteria

390
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,500
with its curvy, clever chem toilets.

391
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,560
It was a place where she felt frobbed.

392
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,980
She was a topless, irrepressible guru-pee drinker

393
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,120
with brobding nagging breastises and knobby penises.

394
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,420
Her friends saw her as a homely, happy hooker

395
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,300
with a heart of gold.

396
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,260
Once, she even jumped into a river

397
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,020
and saved a little dog named Snuckles.

398
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,400
That's the sort of woman she was.

399
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,020
Susie walked over to the window and reflected on her.

400
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,680
She was in her frob-redolent surroundings.

401
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,720
The smoky air teased like a geeking prairie squid.

402
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,660
Then she saw something in the distance,

403
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,520
or rather, someone.

404
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,380
It was the figure of Old Sequa.

405
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,540
Old Sequa was a schizophrenic, prehistoric turtle

406
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,180
or testudine with appetizing breastises

407
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,400
and indescribable penises.

408
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,000
Susie gulped.

409
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,480
She was not prepared for Old Sequa.

410
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,420
As Susie stepped outside and Old Sequa came closer,

411
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,900
she could see the joyous glint in his eye.

412
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,640
Old Sequa gazed with the affection

413
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,200
of 9,000 paranoid, greasy great jaggies.

414
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,360
He said in hushed tones,

415
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,180
I love you and I want sex.

416
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,140
Susie looked back even more horny

417
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,920
and still fingering the slimy pipe.

418
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,020
Old Sequa, I like reptiles,

419
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,220
but you're a little old for me, she replied.

420
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,020
They licked her.

421
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,120
They licked each other with stoned feelings,

422
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,180
like two lively late lizards

423
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,200
gagging at a very over-sexed ex-day,

424
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,920
which had anti-music playing in the background

425
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,060
and two hungry uncles ramming to the beat.

426
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,740
Susie regarded Old Sequa's appetizing breastises

427
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,440
and indescribable penises.

428
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,420
I feel the same way, revealed Susie with a delighted grin.

429
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,040
Old Sequa looked enslackened,

430
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:42,460
his emotions blushing like a punji-putrid pea-shooter.

431
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:49,200
Then Old Sequa came inside for a nice drink of gurrupee.

432
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,320
Gurrupee.

433
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,940
It's hard to pronounce. Gurrupee.

434
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,800
Gurrupee.

435
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,100
I was having...

436
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:00,160
You can't say it too slowly or it becomes a bad word.

437
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,720
Gurrupee.

438
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,680
Now, speaking of wisteria and ex-day,

439
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:14,520
there is a festival after ex-day,

440
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,700
an even bigger one, called Starwood,

441
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,260
in the same place, except that since the world is going to end,

442
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,900
we'll have to move Starwood to our escape vessel.

443
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,040
Yes. Yes.

444
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:32,020
But at any rate, I can't give prices on the air,

445
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,900
but let me put it this way.

446
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,660
If you are a salesman,

447
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,340
a subgenius, a dues-paying subgenius,

448
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,420
and you look at starwoodfestival.com

449
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,040
or subgenius.com events page,

450
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:53,780
you will find a way that you can save quite a bit on a Starwood ticket.

451
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,440
Starwood, like I say, is right after ex-day festival

452
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,980
at the same campground in southern Ohio,

453
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,600
real close to Athens.

454
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,700
And it's a much bigger festival.

455
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,180
As it says here,

456
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,380
this is a truly Dobbs-approved deal for a festival that's as weird as,

457
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,580
but not as crowded as, Burning Man and the like.

458
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,340
Great bands every night,

459
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,760
nutty workshops all day.

460
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,040
Many subgeniuses, including me,

461
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,260
have met their true yeti mates at Starwood.

462
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,300
And of course, it includes a subgenius devival led by yours truly.

463
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,580
On Saturday afternoon, before the start of the festival,

464
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:33,580


465
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:33,700
Bob and his band, the

466
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,440
The Big Star Bands and the Enormous Bonfire Climax.

467
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,380
Bob himself has even been known to show up.

468
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,240
So if you're interested in a special deal,

469
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,240
this is for subgeniuses only,

470
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,620
and see, you'll have to email me

471
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,880
to get the special deal from we.

472
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,900
Yeesh, that's card-carrying subgeniuses.

473
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,380
Right.

474
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,700
Which may or may not include Lonesome Cowboy Day.

475
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,960
He's just a very tall guy,

476
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,720
but I'd liked to be in this feeling with him,

477
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:11,720


478
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,400
and just face him today,

479
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,800
and just see what he's all about.

480
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,080
But then for three days,

481
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,080


482
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,080


483
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,120
to have just more out of the done и

484
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,160
to have that dying fall

485
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,160


486
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,260
which I'll talk about now after I finish this,

487
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:20,740
which I'm sure you'll now have time to do and

488
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:20,740


489
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:20,740


490
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:20,960
send it over,

491
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,580
get it on surranderm Pyros True eureka!

492
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,080
That's right.

493
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,800
And we've heard romantic Musik

494
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,640
about the Hebrews through some 모 calle

495
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:29,840
to go and then Argentina in.

496
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,540
These Walter Hallatellis his Ar Omar's

497
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:33,560
EFPC Mike będę

498
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:33,560


499
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,580
ipe

500
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,860
The British

501
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,180
The Tudors?

502
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,940
Yeah, I don't like them

503
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,520
What do you have against turtles, man?

504
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,920
Well, the necks

505
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,700
The floppy, squeezy necks

506
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,960
And the congenital syphilis of the brain

507
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,880
Which I wrote this song about

508
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,440
Yeah, yeah, what about the song?

509
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,820
What do all the world

510
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,520
All the world's leaders

511
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,420
All got one thing in same

512
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,980
No, the same

513
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,220
I'm sorry, I have to start again

514
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,780
All the world's leaders

515
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,700
All got one thing in same

516
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,220
See, I keep on saying it wrong

517
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,180
I'm sorry

518
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,620
They got congenital syphilis of the brain

519
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,540
And then I turn around, two to four

520
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,260
Congenital syphilis of the brain

521
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,560
Congenital syphilis of the brain

522
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,860
Congenital syphilis of the brain

523
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,740
So

524
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,060
Someday before I get

525
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,320
A tumor on the back of my neck again

526
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,280
I plan to

527
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,700
Have a party

528
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,760
And record that song

529
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,280
A jamboree

530
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,060
A hoedown

531
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:35,760
A hootenanny

532
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,720
Yeah, that's got a real ring to it, Dave

533
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,740
Congenital sickness of the brain

534
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,720
Congenital sickness of the brain

535
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,860
Yeah, I like that, it's catchy

536
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,960
And then, you know, it's got

537
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,720
And then you hear the single maracas shaking

538
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,400
Or maybe two

539
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,840
Just like a little bit of air there

540
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,700
And stuff like that

541
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,860
And then you hear those

542
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,040
Like tinny trumpets

543
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,240
Like in the Latin bands of the 30s

544
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,160
Like that

545
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,160
Something like that, you know

546
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,400
That's very songful

547
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:06,860
Yes

548
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,000
It sounds like you've got it all

549
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,600
All ready to

550
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,760
You've got it all planned out

551
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,500
Yeah, all you have to do is find somebody

552
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,960
Who can sing and play guitar

553
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,380
Yeah, and somebody stupid enough to

554
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:16,760
Yeah

555
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,080
Actually, I've been playing

556
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,900
You playing guitar in the background

557
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,180
We've been playing the Witch Disco

558
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,120
Well, it's the Witch Disco album

559
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,660
Oh, I love that album

560
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,540
Me too

561
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,220
So much

562
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,740
So much

563
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:31,940
So much

564
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,140
So much

565
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,140


566
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,140


567
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,140


568
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,140


569
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,140


570
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,140


571
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,140


572
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,140


573
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,140


574
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,140


575
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,140


576
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,140


577
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,140


578
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,140


579
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,140


580
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,140


581
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,320
That was back in the day

582
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,140
Well, it sounds like we've been real creative, Dave

583
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,260
Because you wrote a song

584
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,040
Well, I didn't exactly

585
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,400
I just read two short stories on the air

586
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,300
That a computer wrote with me

587
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,320
So you had to

588
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,620
Enlist the aid of the computer

589
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,900
Well, Philo told me about

590
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,340
A thing called plotgenerator.com

591
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,360
And I went to plotgenerator.com

592
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,120
And I said

593
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,600
Alright, we have a team

594
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,960
And they have a logister

595
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:03,960


596
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:03,960


597
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:03,960


598
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,500
They ask you to nail your first album

599
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,900
It's probably theボставь

600
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,040
That obviously

601
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,160
You do

602
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,900
All they call the lowest

603
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:10,900


604
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:10,900


605
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:10,900


606
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:10,900


607
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:10,900


608
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:10,900


609
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:10,900


610
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,200
It's a 19

611
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,400
It's going to be

612
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:11,620
Ah

613
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,300
18

614
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:17,520
My con.

615
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,700
Really good

616
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,480
Is it down here

617
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,440
Of course

618
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,780
80

619
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,920
Now it's

620
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:29,140


621
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,940
Honestly, I'm not sure

622
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:30,940


623
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,120
I feel we don't mercided them

624
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,100
To produce the album

625
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,080
After I did, I did one, this one stars Princess Wee.

626
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,660
And it's really more like the, it's not a short story.

627
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,480
It's like a blurb that you would see on the back of a book.

628
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,600
And this book is called Galactic Slack Pipe Wars.

629
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,140
Now remember, this was written by a computer just using a few nudges from me.

630
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,920
And here's the story.

631
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,400
It's about three paragraphs.

632
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,980
A long, long time ago in a slack, slack galaxy,

633
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,520
after leaving the faster than light planet, planet X,

634
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:09,120
a group of exos fly towards a distant speck.

635
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:13,700
The speck gradually resolves into an exos space cult compound.

636
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:18,500
Civil war suddenly strikes the galaxy, which is ruled by Bob Dobbs,

637
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,980
a subgenius overman capable of brainwashing and even slacklessness.

638
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:27,380
Terrified, a holy pink known as Ivory,

639
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:32,180
Ivan Stang flees the empire with his protector, Princess Wee.

640
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,020
They head for Dobbstown on the planet Earth Farm One.

641
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,700
When they finally arrive, a fight breaks out.

642
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,120
Wee uses her slack pipe to defend Ivan.

643
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:46,580
Wee and Pink Ivan decide it's time to leave Earth Farm One

644
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,260
and steal an escape vessel to shoot their way out.

645
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,940
They encounter a tribe of normals.

646
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,780
Princess Wee is attacked and the Pink Ivan is captured by the normals

647
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,380
and taken back to Earth Farm One.

648
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,140
The pink Ivan and Princess Wee return to Dobbstown.

649
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,000
Wee must fight to save Pink Ivan,

650
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:06,040
but when she accidentally unearths a demonic minister's card,

651
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:11,100
the entire future of the slack faster than light galaxy is at stake.

652
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:19,800
It even provided a computer reviewer named Enid Kibler who said,

653
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:24,500
quote, a subgenius overman, a tribe of normals and a holy pink.

654
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,260
Haven't we seen this somewhere before?

655
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,600
So

656
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,320
Okay, story time is over, kids

657
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,360
It's all gonna be facts

658
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,800
A robo-adult

659
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,580
Like that

660
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,640
Oh, boy

661
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,520
I'd give that necromancer

662
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,380
A solid F plus

663
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,440
Right

664
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,860
Well, in the first place

665
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,920
It says stuff backwards sometimes

666
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,740
Just to show that it can use the word

667
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,020
And I thought, you know, it's going along so swimmingly

668
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,880
And so wonderful and nice

669
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,160
And then all of a sudden it's like

670
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,940
I am a computer for like a brief second

671
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,560
So

672
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,160
That's my criticism

673
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,960
But I think you should write all your releases without you

674
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,320
Well

675
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,980
Now, if

676
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,960
I like to think that if I

677
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,780
Just read one of those cold

678
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,460
I'd suspect quickly

679
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,080
That it was computer generated

680
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,760
On the other hand

681
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,740
Most actual people

682
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,560
Cannot write

683
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,540
As clearly

684
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,260
As that messed up

685
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,800
Bizarre short story

686
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,320
Yes

687
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,500
As we know

688
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,740
It brings to mind the

689
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,780
Automated people who call you up

690
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,360
To try to get money out of you some way

691
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,080
And talk to you as if they know you

692
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,900
And say, do you mind if I just take a little bit of your time

693
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,780
And you say, I'm not interested

694
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,400
I'm sorry, I didn't hear that

695
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,500
They say, I'm sorry

696
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,820
Could you repeat that?

697
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,760
No, those are calls that you get, aren't they?

698
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,040
Because I don't

699
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,100
Ever pick up the phone

700
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,920
In fact, last week

701
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,160
I'm getting these on the empathic hotline

702
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,640
Actually

703
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,920
I can sense these messages coming in

704
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,060
I have my own message machine

705
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,200
In my brain

706
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,620
I have an MP3 player

707
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,100
Inside my head

708
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,120
Head

709
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,060
Yeah

710
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,220
Actually, Dave

711
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,920
You know, the Subgenius Foundation

712
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,580
Telephone answering machine

713
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,780
Always gets a lot of

714
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,740
Calls from incoherent drunks

715
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,440
But during the last month

716
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,120
Man, I don't know

717
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,580
I guess Mercury must have been in

718
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,300
Retrograde

719
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,320
Because we got

720
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,940
Double the number of incoherent

721
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,420
Drunks late at night

722
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,460
On the message machine

723
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,020
Or it was spring and a full moon

724
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,100
Right

725
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,500
Or it could be Russian

726
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,380
Syndrome in Russia

727
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,420
I used to like to talk about how

728
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,220
The winters would be so, so very harsh

729
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,060
That the first

730
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,400
You know, when it started going above 65 degrees

731
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,460
Or something like that

732
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,220
Everybody would take off all their clothes

733
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,520
And run around and get so drunk

734
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,380
That they'd have all these mortalities

735
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,480
From alcoholism

736
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,060
And some of them

737
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,360
Just from being bare naked

738
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,000
I guess it was enough to kill them

739
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,660
Well, now X-Day's not always like that

740
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,180
It isn't?

741
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:19,800
No, no

742
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,840
A lot of X-Day drills

743
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,400
It's hot

744
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,460
It's blistering hot

745
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,740
It's been a couple of years

746
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,860
Other times it's

747
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,980
Yeah, like you say

748
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,360
Frozen, you know, rivers

749
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,640
And naked alcoholics

750
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,740
Jumping in deliberately

751
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:37,100
Yeah, just like TSLA used to talk about

752
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,060
A whimslet of naked drunk alcoholics

753
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,740
Well, that's a weak comment

754
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,940
Well, apparently they must get

755
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,760
They must have a lot of spare time

756
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,720
In the trailer court on Saturday nights

757
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,440
Because that's when I get the drunkest

758
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,140
Most childish, silly

759
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,240
I mean, talk

760
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,740
Really incoherent

761
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:54,900
I mean, talk

762
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,180
Really incoherent stuff

763
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,560
So

764
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,020
It's stinky

765
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,160
If you're one of those callers

766
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,380
And you're listening, friends

767
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:01,900
Man

768
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:03,640
There's

769
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,780
You're not the only one

770
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,140
Let me just put it that way

771
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:06,900
Really

772
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,460
Yeah

773
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,460
These overly sequined pinks

774
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,740
Have totally given up the alacrity

775
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,820
To become human beings

776
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,720
And have inter

777
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,920
Intercontextual context

778
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,460
And intercourse with other humans

779
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,320
On a non-verbal level

780
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,540
He

781
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,980
Because now all they do

782
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,780
Is on Saturday night

783
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,900
They bring the booze home

784
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,480
Go on a computer

785
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,660
Or Facebook

786
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,200
And get stupid on everybody else

787
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,500
Then they can't see them

788
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,800
So they can punch them in the face

789
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,880
Right?

790
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:39,760
Oh, yes

791
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,780
There was

792
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,780
It's very sad

793
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,540
Some explanation

794
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,340
Very, very sad

795
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,480
Of that

796
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,700
Now I can't find my

797
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,120
I had the explanation for that

798
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,380
It had to do with

799
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,380
The lack of a sufficient number

800
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,260
Of large enough penises

801
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,940
It makes people very insecure

802
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,660
And they act out

803
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,940
And act up

804
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,520
On the internet

805
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,360
And

806
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,140
You know

807
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,520
It's habit forming

808
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,560
Actually

809
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,160
Much like short people

810
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,020
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey

811
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,280
You're not short

812
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,240
I'm a half an inch shorter than

813
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:17,700
Oh, you didn't want anyone to know that

814
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,760
I'm half an inch shorter than average

815
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,580
And I'm really, really sensitive about that

816
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,300
Okay

817
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:23,900
You are not

818
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,500
Are you really?

819
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,600
Well, no

820
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,400
Actually, I'm quite a bit short

821
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,320
More than half

822
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,720
Well, I don't know what average is

823
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,800
It's a fiction is what it is

824
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,700
Average is a fiction

825
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,540
It's a convenient

826
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,520
Mathematical calculation

827
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,420
Yes

828
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,260
Yeah

829
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:42,820
Yeah

830
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,840
That's all it is

831
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,020
And people should stay away from statistics

832
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,840
Because they can be skewed

833
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,340
By the correct skewer

834
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,620
You know how to skew things, right?

835
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,960
You can make anything

836
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,360
Seekable

837
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,240
And plausibly true

838
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,480
Doesn't mean it will ever happen

839
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,400
Oh, here's a good quote

840
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,020
That relates to skewing

841
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,600
Oh, no

842
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,180
I think he meant screwing

843
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:06,000
Slack is like skewing

844
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,820
I mean, whatever

845
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,900
The more you put in

846
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,980
The more you pull out

847
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,440
Dr. Legume said that

848
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,700
Naturally

849
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,520
Yeah

850
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,220
He's got a vociferous tongue

851
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,180
When it comes to those sexual hourums

852
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,940
Hourums?

853
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,680
What's an hourum?

854
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,940
Yeah, what's an hourum?

855
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,040
I don't know, but they're usually diverse

856
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,400
When they're called for in old Shakespeare plays

857
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,680
Diverse hourums

858
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,080
Oh

859
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,300
I always thought it was

860
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:43,160
You know, one of those liberal spellings of alarms

861
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,220
But what do I know?

862
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,520
It doesn't have anything to do with an algorithm, right?

863
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,480
No, hourums

864
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,580
Hourum, okay

865
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,920
You know, if I was Dr. Philodrumon, you know, you know how many hours a day you're taking a nap?

866
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:52,920


867
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:52,920


868
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:58,720
I would quickly look it up on my little smartphone and then say what it was as if I knew it

869
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,280
Of course

870
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,220
That's what you should do

871
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:06,520
Last week's hour of Slack was mostly Philo sounding really, really well

872
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,160
He actually is very well educated

873
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,160
He's an overman

874
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,320
He knows almost everything

875
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,860
But not everything

876
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,800
Dr. Hal knows everything

877
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,300
And in order to keep up with Dr. Hal and sound even smarter

878
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,840
Philo will often read from Wikipedia on his show

879
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,920
But he doesn't tell you that's what he's doing

880
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:31,700
And he's good at making it sound like he's just, you know, dropping these facts off the top of his head

881
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:35,160
That's why he's an overman and we're just a bunch of proles

882
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,480
It's real simple

883
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:37,580
Yep

884
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,280
You don't have to know this stuff

885
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,700
All you gotta do is have the right stuff

886
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,920
And when you do that, the world is your oyster

887
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,300
Or some sort of clam or something, I don't know

888
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,500
Dave, you

889
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:49,940
The world is your monster

890
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,480
And you're a...

891
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,200
A day, all day, all night job

892
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,980
You work for the new...

893
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,960
With the news media in some capacity, right?

894
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,480
Yes

895
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,180
Now, am I wrong or is, for instance

896
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,680
CNN terribly disappointed when, say, in Cleveland

897
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,640
When there's protests like there were this weekend

898
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,700
There isn't a terrible bloody riot

899
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,340
The reason I say that is

900
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,460
Starting this...

901
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,040
On Saturday, I was...

902
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,720
I don't do the television news, but I read the news

903
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:32,180
And I happen to notice that on the CNN conspiracy website

904
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,520
Their biggest headline was protests in Cleveland

905
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,800
As if they were dying

906
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,740
They were just dying to be able to say that there was bloody head-bashing

907
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,720
And terrible this and that

908
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,700
Violence in the streets

909
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:52,460
And today, they seemed so...

910
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,540
So disappointed and just...

911
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,040
It was driving them crazy

912
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,680
That they had...

913
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,800
They were forced to say, instead

914
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,260
Streets calm

915
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,420
And they dropped that...

916
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,640
They dropped that like a hot potato

917
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,060
As soon as they realized there wasn't anything really bloodthirsty

918
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:15,140
But up until then, it was as if they were doing all they could

919
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,400
To help make that something terrible happen

920
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,640
Well...

921
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,160
I guess it sells ads or something, but I mean...

922
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,460
Well, it's...

923
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,080
Well, maybe...

924
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,240
Maybe it's the ads

925
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,300
I think the fact that it's a selling story

926
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,240
Because we were told throughout the week

927
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,300
To wait

928
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,680
Because we are within the confines of the area

929
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,160
Of the zone here in northeastern Ohio

930
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,720
To see what the...

931
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,840
Wait for the verdict

932
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,400
Get ready

933
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,000
Everybody get ready for the verdict

934
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,860
Going to be another Hoopersville

935
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,480
Right

936
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,480
Or something like that

937
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,060
And...

938
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:43,660
Or Baltimore

939
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,300
Right

940
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,120
Which it was not

941
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,560
Right

942
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,700
But I don't understand myself because...

943
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,700
I don't know if I should say this or not

944
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,340
But I think...

945
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,400
I think those officers...

946
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,320
Maybe one in particular was quite guilty, yeah, but...

947
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,720
Well, it's a little funny that they kind of go...

948
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:07,720
Well, since we can't prove that any one single officer fired the killing shot

949
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,240
Then we're going to let them all go

950
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,460
Because, you know, come on

951
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,320
You know, anybody can make a mistake

952
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,420
Come on

953
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,180
It boggles the mind

954
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:22,320
And so I would predict in a normal city something might happen

955
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,040
Sometime, but I don't know

956
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,920
Well, I...

957
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,120
Like CNN, I'm...

958
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:37,800
All I'm going to say is that it seemed to me that CNN was really eager to have something bloody and horrible to report on

959
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,840
And then when they didn't, it was like, oh, they were so sad

960
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,700
That's the news media, man

961
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:48,720
They want you to be as paranoid and scared about the weather

962
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,100
About your neighbors

963
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,720
About going outdoors

964
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,320
Everything

965
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,160
Never at all

966
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,380
They just want to work you

967
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,880
They want to work you up

968
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,760
I was out on the street

969
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,320
All weekend

970
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,300
Everyone knows that old anachronism

971
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,360
It's an anachronism, it's not an anachronism

972
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,140
It's a truthful statement

973
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,560
If it bleeds, it bleeds, you know

974
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,420
Right, if it bleeds, it bleeds

975
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,180
And bleeds in that context is spelled B-L-E-D-E-S

976
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:21,180
Which, in the same way lead is spelled L-E-D-E

977
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,320
Which says, you know, you're not going to be able to do anything

978
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:22,420
And you're going to be able to do anything

979
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:22,920
That doesn't make any sense

980
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:29,340
Which shows you that the journalistic racket is full of crackpots, neosympathizers, confluent

981
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:34,480
and congruent thinkers, and a bunch of bad apples in a pear sauce

982
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,280
Oh, you left out auto spell

983
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,060
Auto spell

984
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,380
Yeah, auto spell corrections

985
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,800
That's why you see so many apostrophes these days

986
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:52,320
There is a subgenius who got so fed up with seeing unnecessary apostrophes that he said,

987
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:52,320


988
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:52,320


989
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:52,320


990
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,160
you know, because so many po-buckers don't want to look dumb

991
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,840
So they went in doubt, put an apostrophe

992
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,060
That way you look smart

993
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,400
So this one subgenius said

994
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,320
I forget which one

995
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,780
He said he's going around

996
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:11,340
He got so used to seeing excess apostrophes

997
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:18,960
That when he sees like the plural of a word without an apostrophe, he adds one

998
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,300
He said he almost got the crap beat out of him

999
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:22,300


1000
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,480
Because he did that to a store

1001
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:28,060
Like he, you know, like say it said

1002
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,320
Say it was two cousins hair salon

1003
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:37,080
He had to go and add an apostrophe to the

1004
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,880
Two cousins

1005
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,000
But he put it in between the N and the S

1006
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,620
So that it was especially wrong

1007
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,520
Actually he didn't do that

1008
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,960
There's a shop like that on Probability Pasture Road down the street from my house

1009
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,280
I drive by that two cousins with the

1010
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,900
Apostrophe between the N and the S

1011
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,540
Two cousins hair salon every week

1012
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:03,800
And I so want, you know, part of me wants to correct it

1013
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,500
But now I'm getting to where when I see things done correctly, they look wrong

1014
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,020
Yes, me too

1015
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,720
I go past places says Otto's exit

1016
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,140
And it has Otto apostrophe S

1017
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,800
Every time I see it, they make me think too hard

1018
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,700
They make me go through too many things

1019
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,980
They make me feisty

1020
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,860
They make me angry

1021
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,280
They go, well, what a bunch of shit

1022
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,980
And now they get me into ignoring it

1023
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,580
Now they get still registered

1024
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,920
Every time I see it though, it's like Otto

1025
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,880
Would you say that

1026
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,580
And now I want to correct it

1027
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:39,660
Would you say that you're what they call a grammar Nazi?

1028
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,440
No, but I'll tell you one thing about Otto's spell

1029
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,740
If you're in the news business

1030
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,280
Used and sued will not correct

1031
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,940
So if you say somebody used something

1032
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:55,600
And you, you know, had the little old dyslexia thing while you were typing fast

1033
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,340
And said so-and-so sued somebody

1034
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,180
You are the big heap of pool water

1035
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:04,600
Well, there, there, there

1036
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,280
Here, here, here

1037
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,600
Two, two, two

1038
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,140
Well, well, well

1039
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:13,100
No, there's only one well

1040
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,460
There's three twos and two there's

1041
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,800
And what was the other one?

1042
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:20,180
I don't know

1043
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:20,900
I don't know

1044
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:20,900


1045
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:20,900


1046
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:20,900


1047
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:20,900


1048
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:20,900


1049
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,220
Anyway, you know what I mean

1050
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,800
A bunch of hooey

1051
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,260
Most people spell bears for T-H-E-I-R-S

1052
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,260
T-H-E-R-E-S

1053
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,220
Well, you left out the apostrophe

1054
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:33,580
Bears

1055
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:37,000
T-H-E-I-R apostrophe S

1056
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,500
That's the way the new spelling is

1057
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,060
I even see people in opulent costumes

1058
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:46,400
With big huge haircuts and stuff like that

1059
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,640
Someone got like purple sequins on their face and stuff

1060
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,920
Using this to spell bears

1061
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,440
And I'm like, what's the same mis-

1062
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:51,880
Mis-

1063
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,660
Incorrect

1064
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,860
Using this

1065
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,420
And it really, really furigates me

1066
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,520
I don't know what I'm gonna do next

1067
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,280
It irrigates you?

1068
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:06,360
It irrigates my nostes, my fungal canals, and all the tubes I've got going

1069
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:11,560
Man, I could go into my irrigations and tubes, but I'm not gonna describe my Friday

1070
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,040
On the air

1071
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,760
Oh, come on, man

1072
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,380
I see an idyllic setting like children are playing birds or flying around in between

1073
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:18,960
their legs

1074
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,240
Maybe nipping at the wrong parts of their bodies

1075
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,880
It was like that, yeah

1076
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,660
It's like snow

1077
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,680
It's like Summerland

1078
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:24,960
Yeah

1079
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,280
Like Distraction Town

1080
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:27,520
No, it was not last

1081
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,500
In Glandlandistan

1082
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:34,660
Glandlandistan

1083
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,500
No, Glandlandistan

1084
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,480
Oh, I understand

1085
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,080
That's actually the name of a real place

1086
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:46,220
That's the name of the country that Princess Wee and I are exploring and colonizing in

1087
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,340
the planet Minecraft

1088
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:56,200
We have a land called Glandlandistan and we're building Distraction Town there

1089
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,400
It's based on Stang Ranch

1090
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,240
I think that's very noble

1091
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,180
Yeah

1092
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,160
Do you do?

1093
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:02,820
Actually

1094
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:03,840
Distraction Town?

1095
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:12,260
Now, Dave, we were bragging about X Day coming up and we sure hope there's some way that

1096
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:18,000
you can be there some of the time to do shows with Hal and me

1097
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,320
And Philo

1098
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:24,000
And Philo's going to be there and maybe Bishop Joey from the Church of the Last Lamp

1099
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,300
Really?

1100
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:31,360
Yeah, and he's actually in his real life, he's a famous San Francisco mime troupe guy

1101
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:35,400
So imagine how good a mime professional would be on a radio show

1102
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,420
Oh, wow

1103
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,360
You'd be the greatest

1104
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:37,980
You're on the stage

1105
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:44,020
As Wellman said last week, he just learned that from a record

1106
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:47,980
Anyway, I'm going to go to bed

1107
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:53,980
Anyway, we were bragging about this year Starwood is giving a special deal to subgeniuses

1108
00:42:54,780 --> 00:43:02,380
where it's like less, way less than half price to go to all week long Starwood Festival if

1109
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,400
you're a subgenius

1110
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,560
Card carrying Starwood, subgenius only

1111
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,640
And you know, I have to come up with a sermon every year, once a year I have to come up

1112
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:16,940
with one sermon because the only people who want to hear me preach for a whole hour are

1113
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:17,960
the people at Starwood

1114
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,860
And they actually pay for it

1115
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:23,840
You start it a year beforehand and you finish it the night before

1116
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,500
Well, sort of

1117
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:36,540
I decided that this year I'm going to do my sermon on the subject of astrology and autism

1118
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,620
Well, they go hand in hand like birds of a bush together

1119
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:47,780
Well, I think they were talking about it and an anti-vaxxer was going to...

1120
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,820
try to speak there, I don't know if that's going to happen or not

1121
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:54,280
It's absolutely not going to happen, no way

1122
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,800
Well, what I thought...

1123
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:03,140
Well, you know, some of these people are really crazy, you know, they think that vaccinations cause autism

1124
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:07,160
But obviously it's astrology causes autism

1125
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:14,640
Not so much astrology, but parents who have their kids' charts read before the age of five

1126
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,440
They really shouldn't do that

1127
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:25,160
I've been doing some research and for instance, like say a kid is born in Aries

1128
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:32,760
Say he's in Aries, well, he runs a risk of autistic... general... generalized autistic disorder

1129
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:40,820
Gemini's, if parents have their Gemini kids' chart read before the age of five, good chance of Asperger's syndrome

1130
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:45,700
Virgo leads to PDD or pervasive developmental disorder

1131
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,940
Scorpios get...

1132
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:52,180
Tourette's syndrome, Aquarius gets childhood disintegration disorder and so forth

1133
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,180
How about Libra? Please man, tell me

1134
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,980
Now, vaccinations actually do cause Tourette's syndrome

1135
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:03,140
And that probably explains a lot of right-wing talk shows and web forums

1136
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,920
Well, yeah, over-vaccination can do that for the flocks and the pollocks

1137
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,360
But what about...

1138
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:15,080
The funny thing is there are some things that cause a risk of autism

1139
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:19,540
There have been shown to maybe increase the risk of autism

1140
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:28,740
And unfortunately for the parents, it's not the conspiracy doctors giving you a vaccination

1141
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:37,460
It's things like your alcohol consumption, your obesity, your diabetes

1142
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:43,240
And ironically enough, measles can help...

1143
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,200
Seriously

1144
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:51,680
Childhood having measles can increase the odds of your kid being autistic

1145
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,620
Now, I'm not being funny exactly here

1146
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:59,540
Because I've got a... Princess, we and I have autistic friend

1147
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:03,180
We have a real good friend who's extremely autistic

1148
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:03,880
Yes

1149
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,420
We talk to him...

1150
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:09,620
He's the only other person besides you, practically, that we talk to every week

1151
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,120
Now, it's a somewhat more monotonous conversation

1152
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,820
But it makes a little more sense

1153
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:19,280
I mean, it's the same conversation every time

1154
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,920
But it makes more sense than this show

1155
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:23,500
Because basically, are you guys going to eat...

1156
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,280
We're going to have dinner next week again

1157
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,200
Yeah

1158
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,280
That's not the way he says it

1159
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,800
He says it in his own language

1160
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,940
But we know what he's saying

1161
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:38,400
And we always go, yes, we'll have dinner with you again

1162
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:42,600
And in his own way, he says, are you going to call...

1163
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,380
Is my dad going to call you and make sure?

1164
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,280
And we go, yeah

1165
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,540
Your dad will call me on Thursday

1166
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:52,560
And I have the same conversation pretty much every week

1167
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,120
Several times

1168
00:46:55,340 --> 00:47:00,920
But what I'm saying is I'm not making fun of autism

1169
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:07,020
But I might be making fun of anti-vaxxer superstitious numbskulls

1170
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,400
No offense

1171
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,300
No offense to the new age superstitious numbskulls out there

1172
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:15,060
Of whom I know quite a few of them, too

1173
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,240
That's why I hang out with the autistic kid

1174
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,140
Instead of the superstitious numbskulls, mostly

1175
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:27,680
I often wondered what would happen if you would interject a few insane giggles

1176
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,060
Like the mad professor type thing

1177
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:31,760
Yeah

1178
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:36,060
In between, instead of saying, dad will call you on Thursday

1179
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,500
Say, dad will call you on Saturday

1180
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:41,540
And then add a couple, like maybe three giggles right in a row

1181
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:44,920
And then go, oh, like that

1182
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,500
Well, you know why I talk this way?

1183
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:49,100
It's because my parents vaccinated me

1184
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:53,440
They gave me, I had smallpox vaccination, polio

1185
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,280
Remember, Princess, we, and you, I bet you're probably old enough

1186
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,940
Did you get polio shots?

1187
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:03,660
Or have they come along with the polio LSD sugar cube?

1188
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,660
Yeah, they did come along with the sugar cube

1189
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:11,180
But everybody else had Titan buns worrying about needles and stuff like that

1190
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:14,340
I was in the transitional year for those

1191
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:17,720
And it was a wonderful time for the kids

1192
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:22,860
Got to play with our plows and bed our plows

1193
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:27,760
Never mind, I still make some comment about the military industrial complex

1194
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,160
But once again, the fungicides are so strong, that's all I can smell

1195
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,880
So I just let it go

1196
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,780
The fungicides

1197
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:41,000
They're necessary, but they're, they're...

1198
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:42,140
They're very odorous

1199
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:44,260
And clampy

1200
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:47,740
They make my face all red every time I take a shower

1201
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:48,640
And damaging

1202
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,100
Well, you're not supposed to rub this stuff into your flesh like that

1203
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,460
Well, I don't, they just dip me

1204
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:57,480
Princess, we, and the helpers come and dip me in the fungicide

1205
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,340
Oh, I thought that was a baptismal font, but it's really a fungicide

1206
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:02,980
Why not both? Hey, man, it's both

1207
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:08,560
We, we, we, we vaccinate the kids and baptize them at the same time

1208
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,680
In the subgenius vaccination baptism

1209
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,580
I don't know what that's called

1210
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:12,580


1211
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:15,460
Of sheep dip, basically, is what it is

1212
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,700
It's not really a vaccina...

1213
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:21,360
My vaccination is when my food falls on the floor and I pick it up and eat it anyway

1214
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:22,980
Yeah, right

1215
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:25,340
Actually, I got that from Potter Nostril

1216
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,700
But it works, you know

1217
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:34,220
Nose pickers get, or have much stronger immune systems than non-nose

1218
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:37,540
Well, not nose, anybody can pick their nose, but booger eaters

1219
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,300
It's booger eaters

1220
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,160
Booger eaters have much stronger immune systems than non-nose

1221
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:41,160


1222
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,800
No, no, no, you're being silly again

1223
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,260
No, I'm not being silly

1224
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:49,900
There was a study, a medical study done in England about that

1225
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:50,740
You want me to buy the whole article

1226
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:52,540
Think about it, it makes sense

1227
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:58,160
You know, your nostril hairs are filtering all these impurities

1228
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:03,580
But some of them, you know, a little bit, little samples get caught in the boogers

1229
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:04,980
Which are salty

1230
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,480
And, you know...

1231
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,820
Well, now I have to give up eating boogers...

1232
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:12,260
Well, you can't pick your friend's nose

1233
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,040
Because I'm gonna get high blood pressure again

1234
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:14,620
Right

1235
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:21,520
I have to worry about my high blood pressure, which just was recently contracted from, what, eating boogers?

1236
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:25,560
No, no, no, from not eating enough boogers

1237
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:26,900
Oh

1238
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,820
Yeah, I don't know if this is actually...

1239
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:29,680
I think I'm gonna have to try that

1240
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:37,040
You should probably watch, because obscenity isn't necessarily bad words, it can just be disgusting thoughts

1241
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,600
I know, I'm like ready for a bucket right now

1242
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:41,240
Yeah

1243
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:41,800
Of snuffers?

1244
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:42,740
Disgusting!

1245
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,760
Yeah, I was thinking about...

1246
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:44,960
Not to throw up in

1247
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,540
Oh, throw up in, I was thinking about, you know...

1248
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:49,580
Of boogers, yes

1249
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:50,340
A bucket to drink?

1250
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:52,980
Oh, no

1251
00:50:54,560 --> 00:51:00,160
America's favorite project today is little boys and girls your age eating buckets of snuff

1252
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,220
So join with them right now

1253
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:05,440
Come on, moms, come on, dads, let's have some boogers

1254
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,800
Don't eat your boogers now, they'll give you autism

1255
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:10,800


1256
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:10,800


1257
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:10,800


1258
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:10,800


1259
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:10,800


1260
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:10,800


1261
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:10,800


1262
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:10,800


1263
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:10,800


1264
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,160
You'll get the autism if you didn't...

1265
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:13,300
And the guy...

1266
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,540
Quit picking your nose and quit chewing your fingernails

1267
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,100
You don't get the autism

1268
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:20,820
And the guy who's serving up the boogers, the dad, looks just like Bob Dobbs, you know what I mean?

1269
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,800
That's what I hate about those old PSAs

1270
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,160
They always show a guy who looks just like Bob Dobbs

1271
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:26,300
No, fuck

1272
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:31,960
He's got a pipe while he's bending over to rearrange the dressing wounds on his child, numerous

1273
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:40,200
You're assuming that's not Bob, you're assuming it's a guy who looks like Bob, why can't it...

1274
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:44,940
Half of those are Bob Dobbs, that's why we know who Bob Dobbs is

1275
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:54,800
He's that pipe smoking guy that was in all those magazine ads and TV ads and cigarette ads and especially pipe ads and hammock ads

1276
00:51:54,800 --> 00:52:00,300
PSAs for mom and dad and the kids, they had the Connie, was the mom in the USA that was Connie or is Connie?

1277
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:05,800
Usually, well, oftentimes, Bob worked a lot more as a model

1278
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:10,180
If it's got a pipe, there's a benefit in that

1279
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:19,720
It's about 50-50, and that haircut, it's about a 50-50 chance it's J.R. Bob Dobbs that posed for that old radio or ad

1280
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,200
Where you can see the pipe, you know

1281
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:27,460
Now, one who is not Bob is that Insight commercial guy

1282
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:35,460
That's somebody, one of the many, many Bob wannabes, I'm a Bob's, we call them

1283
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:40,180
Where they don't, you know, they want everybody to go, yeah, that's funny, like Bob Dobbs

1284
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:40,180


1285
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:40,920
Bob Dobbs

1286
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:46,820
But of course they don't want to pay royalties or anything like that

1287
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:49,160
Right, meaning you're going to be poor forever

1288
00:52:49,160 --> 00:53:05,800
But that guy does, after the first commercial, he stopped using the pipe probably because their lawyer went, uh, there's some dudes down in Texas or Ohio or someplace that could probably cause us some trouble if they could afford lawyers

1289
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:10,060
So let's take the, let's lose the pipe

1290
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:15,000
But if you lose the pipe, it's not bad, it's not bad if you lose the pipe

1291
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,300
Well, I've just, that's just what our legal department says

1292
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:26,480
I'm really glad to impress Reverend Stang by making that stupid actor in those, those sex pills look like bad

1293
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,180
There's a lot of, uh, wannabes out there

1294
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,560
Here's something, here's something Bob said about I'm a Bob's

1295
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:39,620
Quote

1296
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:53,680
If you can't make it as a prophet, scholar, artist, philosopher, media consultant, comedian, radio host, fortune teller, ascended master, trance medium, or panhandler, there's always alternative medicine

1297
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:07,880
So, you know, the losers still have one field where they can go and succeed and get, you know, be respectable among, well, other superstitious numbskulls and ninnies

1298
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,960
Alternative medicine

1299
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,400
Oh, I'm gonna get it

1300
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,380
Don't, don't hit me, Princess Wee

1301
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:16,680
Princess Wee likes many alternative medicine

1302
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,940
I know you do too, Dave

1303
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:23,820
Well, if they work, I'd rather have them than somebody injecting them with a needle or giving them to me

1304
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:27,760
What about the, uh, what about the third alternative? Health! Alternative!

1305
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,160
I'd rather have that than have the medical community use me as a guinea pig

1306
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,700
Sorry, Reverend Stang

1307
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,320
You'd rather not have them?

1308
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:39,940
I'd rather use natural methods than have them test their drugs on me

1309
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:39,940


1310
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:49,580
I don't think you understand the scientific method, Princess Wee, and I think that's a big problem with many, many Americans and other human beings

1311
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:55,800
Well, a bigger problem is that the pharmaceutical companies do not understand the scientific method either

1312
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,040
Oh, no, no, of course not

1313
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:02,720
It's the completion of tests, which is why they have the three-hour long disclaimers at the end of all their products

1314
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,680
Oh, they're totally lying cheap!

1315
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:06,300
They go leading to the idea of the limit, and they call it insanity

1316
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:08,420
Oh, you can, you can, yeah, you...

1317
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:09,480
Huh?

1318
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:15,920
You know our old friend Jesus Bevilacqua, before he had the hippie bookstore, he had a degree

1319
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:16,140
He was a disclaimer

1320
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:27,120
He had a degree in, uh, some area of medicine, and he went to work for a company that tests drugs for other companies who make drugs

1321
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:33,640
And, uh, after he finished, it was some heart drug, and he, he was, uh, involved in the testing

1322
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:37,520
And when it was done, he went to his boss and said, this is a true story

1323
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,740
He said, uh,

1324
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:43,060
I hate to tell you, this medicine is really not as good as the existing one

1325
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:44,720
And they went,

1326
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:46,600
Oh, what?

1327
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:47,820
What?

1328
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:52,180
Well, forget, just say it is, say it's just as good

1329
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:53,100
He went, but it's not

1330
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:57,560
And they're going, do we have to spell it out to you?

1331
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:00,520
We're being paid to test this

1332
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,760
Do we have to spell it out for you?

1333
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:08,080
You know, I was, I've, yeah, that's what they, that's what, that's what the, uh, that's what the people in suits say

1334
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:13,820
When you come to them and go, hey, there's no black people in this, uh, travelogue

1335
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:16,320
Do I have to spell it out to you, Doug?

1336
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,200
Hey, this medicine doesn't really work at all

1337
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:21,880
We can't give it our per-

1338
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,920
Do I have to spell it out to you, Steve?

1339
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:26,440
Yes, I've been exposed to this as well

1340
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:38,120
Right, yeah, and, uh, that's why Jesus Bevilacqua quit the medical industry and became a hippie bookstore owner and then a assistant sacred scribe

1341
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,060
Yes siree, Bob

1342
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:47,140
And that's why I turned down the job of becoming a, uh, up and coming business film editor in Dallas

1343
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:56,180
Because that anti-Semitic racist boss man thought I'd make a good partner for him

1344
00:56:56,180 --> 00:57:02,140
Just because I happen to know how to shoot a movie and edit one and write a script

1345
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:05,640
He needed somebody working for him who knew how to make movies

1346
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,100
He was good at selling movies

1347
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:13,740
He was good at selling the good old boys on what they, you know, he, they didn't have to spell it out to him

1348
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:14,400
No

1349
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,820
Well, you have to spell it out to me, friends, and when you do, I quit

1350
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:27,460
So there, somebody actually has some minor tiny bit of integrity stuck under their big toenail where it's irritating me

1351
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:33,060
And it's, and it's time to quit this stuff and go work on my toenails

1352
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:35,800
It's almost 10 o'clock

1353
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:36,500
Well, that I've understand it

1354
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:37,480
Here I am

1355
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:41,540
I'm saying, spells it all out for you right there in front of your face

1356
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:43,160
I have to spell it out for you

1357
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,100
You're in Dutch deep trouble

1358
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:45,640
Yeah

1359
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,500
You think too much, you think too little, well, it's all the same

1360
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,400
The company line, the product line, that's the only line

1361
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,380
The line is a line, but we're lying to you right now

1362
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:58,000
We're not really, well, we're lying to you

1363
00:57:59,040 --> 00:57:59,520
But

1364
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,440
That's why I think we, Bob

1365
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,680
But we admit that we're lying to you

1366
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,780
So we're the only honest religion

1367
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:09,700
Well, why not be?

1368
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:13,940
If there's only one, then that means you've got the market cornered

1369
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:20,240
Friends, we're making fun of anybody who can't tell we're making fun

1370
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:22,540
And therefore, we're also making enemies

1371
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:29,340
If you took any of this at face value, you flunked the common sense test big time

1372
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:33,620
And you need help, so check out subgenius.com

1373
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:37,760
And tune in next week on the hour of the hour

1374
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:38,720
Hour of Slang

1375
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:43,120
From the church of the subgenius

1376
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:44,900
Praise Bob

1377
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:49,100
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah

1378
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:53,100
Oh boy

1379
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,080
And with that

1380
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,160
Sounds like a lunatic asylum over there

1381
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:57,940
Yah, yah, well

1382
00:58:57,940 --> 00:58:59,100
That's us

1383
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,420
Oh yeah

1384
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:02,420
Okay

1385
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:06,040
Well, I just wanna say that I'd like to see Bob

1386
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,660
with a pipe burning hot

1387
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:10,140
full of coals of tobacco

1388
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,700
bend over to touch

1389
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:15,080
little Linda's garlic slipper

1390
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:16,900
and, you know,

1391
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:17,960
correct his daughter there

1392
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,040
and have the ashes

1393
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,180
fall all over her

1394
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:22,480
and the little boy

1395
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,500
and the dog, too.

1396
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:24,640
And then Mom got

1397
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,480
some on her foot

1398
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,280
and Bob laughs

1399
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,360
as they all scream

1400
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,500
how much they hate him.

1401
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:31,660
Gorshk.

1402
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:32,060
All right, okay.

1403
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:33,060
Gorshk.

1404
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:35,500
And so the day

1405
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,820
Dave is faded out

1406
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:39,600
and actually the Dave music

1407
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,200
comes up

1408
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:46,560
and we go out.

1409
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:49,340
Your music in the background here

1410
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:50,980
is Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

1411
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:51,580
Praise Bob.

1412
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,140
Houston, you're looking good here

1413
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:56,080
right down the center line.

1414
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,360
Friends, we're glad

1415
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,560
you listened to this show

1416
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,140
and we're even more glad

1417
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:04,960
that some listeners

1418
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,480
have done this

1419
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:06,040
and donated enough

1420
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,340
to help us keep on going

1421
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:08,880
for another couple of months.

1422
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,680
Not just this show

1423
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,340
but subgenius.com

1424
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:13,900
and all the other archive sites.

1425
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:17,420
But if you truly love Bob

1426
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:18,620
and want some of that

1427
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:21,000
slack back to rebound to you,

1428
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:22,360
you should go to

1429
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,900
subgenius.com front page

1430
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,440
or especially the radio page

1431
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,460
or the catalog store pages

1432
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,660
and help out financially

1433
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:31,800
as best you can.

1434
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:34,300
Now, we know what it's like

1435
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:35,240
to be on the brink

1436
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:35,460
of being a genius.

1437
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:35,660
We're talking about

1438
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:36,000
total poverty

1439
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,180
and we don't want any subgeniuses

1440
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:39,800
to make their own situations worse.

1441
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,440
But some of you

1442
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,760
still have jobs.

1443
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:44,740
Even five bucks

1444
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:46,120
makes a big difference

1445
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,100
even if it's only once a month

1446
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:49,660
from enough of you.

1447
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:51,020
Fifty bucks makes

1448
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:52,020
an even bigger difference.

1449
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:55,380
All we're saying is that

1450
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,920
blowjobs could go the way

1451
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:58,800
of Steve jobs

1452
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,880
if you don't pay Dobbs.

1453
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:03,280
We also take checks

1454
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,100
and money orders

1455
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:05,460
to subgenius.com

1456
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:06,340
and the genius foundation.

Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

1459
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,600
Thanks for anything you can do

1460
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,020
to help let there be slack.
