1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Boy, you know, Robert, your hobby is a lot more pleasant than mine, I think.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,320
Oh, yeah?

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,540
Yeah, collecting cool old music and stuff.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:14,880
And my hobby, at least especially lately, has been collecting kook literature.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,200
Indeed.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,420
All kinds of kook literature.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:27,240
And, boy, I mean, I've had to all day long, I've been wading through weird political extremist stuff from both ends.

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,640
I see you got your boots on there.

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:37,960
Oh, yeah, that's right, and they're encrusted with kook belief, which is okay for a subgenius, you know.

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,840
I mean, that's where we get all our material.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,180
Indeed.

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,220
We're not kooks, of course.

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:50,700
We just pick what we decide what we want to believe in, you know, out of these publications.

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,300
Publications about, oh, anti-gravity devices that have been suppressed.

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:07,360
Or, oh, God, boy, the right-wing hate material.

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,060
And left-wing hate material.

17
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,280
Both kinds of hate material.

18
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,920
Oh, oh, feed on that stuff.

19
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,620
Oh, God.

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,740
Be quiet about that, oh Lord.

21
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,520
Confess what you got.

22
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:39,620
Okay.

23
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,160
Well, it's trial and error.

24
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,920
They're running me fast, ain't I?

25
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:42,920


26
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,700
Got to�이e.

27
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:46,300
Can't take that as a line of attorney.

28
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:46,300


29
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:46,300


30
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:46,300


31
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:46,300


32
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,240
Tell me, you know, you know, what's really going on here at theихo.

33
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:47,560


34
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:47,560


35
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:47,760
If you don't stand up, I won't Legos next.

36
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,320
Immoral assistant.

37
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:53,320


38
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,520
I don't do that, baby.

39
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:55,520


40
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:55,620
Oh.

41
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,440
Oh, boy.

42
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:58,620
ists.

43
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,200
until he looked up.

44
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:07,860
And right above him, he saw a huge, monstrous, buzzing fly

45
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,380
whose name was Smith, too.

46
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,020
But Ant Smith didn't know this.

47
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,700
He only knew that he hated the fly because the fly could fly.

48
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,620
He couldn't fly.

49
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,060
He wasn't a flying ant.

50
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,900
And there were other differences that led to his prejudice.

51
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,460
So you can imagine how Ant Smith felt

52
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,100
when out of the corner of his runaway eye,

53
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,760
he looked back and saw this huge hand

54
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,340
arc through the air and capture Fly Smith and destroy him.

55
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,580
Ant Smith stopped in his tracks,

56
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,900
chuckled quietly to himself.

57
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,660
How was he to know

58
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,880
that he was a flying ant?

59
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:55,880


60
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,120
That that hand's foot would step on him?

61
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,620
And how was Mr. Smith to know

62
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,000
that he had just killed two Smiths?

63
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,540
Ant Fly Smith.

64
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,080
And one has to admit,

65
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,320
it was stupid to believe he was a flying ant.

66
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,860
Sorry you're off talk,

67
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,120
my old friend.

68
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:32,940
Don't meddle in the show.

69
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,440
Okie dokie.

70
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:34,440


71
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:34,440


72
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:34,540
parasite!

73
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:34,920
Yes.

74
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,860
All right!

75
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,620
B-O-B

76
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,720
B-O-B

77
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,200
Bob.

78
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,040
That's your key phrase.

79
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,040
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

80
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,460
We are controlling transmission.

81
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,540
Wake up, puppet boy!

82
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,840
Hey!

83
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,840
Little baby baboon.

84
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,940
Would you, could you, with a goat?

85
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,500
I would not, could not with a goat.

86
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:37,900
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

87
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,440
The subgenius power of...

88
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,200
What?

89
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,240
B-O-B

90
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,700
B-O-B

91
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,000
B-O-B

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,660
B-O-B

93
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,080
B-O-B

94
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,820
B-O-B

95
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,660
B-O-B

96
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:01,680
B-O-B

97
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,000
B-O-B

98
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,740
Welcome, potential initiates, and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

99
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,840
Yes, these giant pyramids are actually radio stations of a primitive nature, which broadcast...

100
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,820
I'll play rock and roll until I die.

101
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:17,820


102
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,080
...the library falls apart. I'll copy that old Procter & Berger movie.

103
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,720
Here's your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

104
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,800
Ha, ha, ha.

105
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,060
...in a life coming at you.

106
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,160
Big reward, you're not too late.

107
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,380
Just in time.

108
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,340
Put your hands on mine, your mind, your mind.

109
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,880
Boys and girls of every creed.

110
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:40,940
Yeah.

111
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,100
Religion and persuasion, oh.

112
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,680
It's time to get up.

113
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,740
Off your knees.

114
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,900
We soak up.

115
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,020
Soak it up.

116
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,680
Open the door and let me in.

117
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,080
Don't question who I am, no.

118
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,040
Just shake my hand and give me your name.

119
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,060
We soak up.

120
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,120
Soak it up.

121
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,360
Soak up.

122
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,440
Soak it up.

123
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,620
Soak up.

124
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,660
Soak it up.

125
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:13,860
Yeah!

126
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,800
Oh, yes, dear friends.

127
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
Ha, ha, ha.

128
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,840
So good.

129
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:37,940
So good.

130
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,880
This is Reverend Ivan Stang.

131
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:47,720
And tonight's hour of slack is underwritten by the Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company.

132
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:56,220
The Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company features Dobbs-approved church wear, including t-shirts,

133
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,400
buttons, survivalist uniform patches.

134
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:07,900
That's the Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company, serving the public since God knows when.

135
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,460
And he told me.

136
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,740
The P.O.

137
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,380
Box number is P.O.

138
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:12,720
Box.

139
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,700
Got that pencil ready, dear friends?

140
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,920
That P.O.

141
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,600
Box number?

142
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:22,400
For Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company, where you can get those Dobbs-approved t-shirts,

143
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:30,840
buttons, and survivalist uniform patches, is Box 595148 in Dallas, Texas.

144
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,440
75359-5148.

145
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:44,700
Thanks, Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company, represented here by Pope S. Cecilia, for

146
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,480
supporting KNON.

147
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,800
Help me, this is a good thing.

148
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:47,800


149
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,180
Somebody.

150
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

151
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,980
The record.

152
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,540
July 15, 1953.

153
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,540
Robbed, Doc.

154
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,440
Yeah, you have robbed me, but you say when have we robbed thee?

155
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,080
In tithes and offerings.

156
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,780
You are cursed with a curse for your sins.

157
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:17,780


158
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:17,780


159
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,620
you have robbed me, even this whole nation.

160
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,340
No, God wouldn't do that.

161
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,660
He's a loving God.

162
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,200
Besides, there's plenty of people

163
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,420
that have more money than I do.

164
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,500
I need mine.

165
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,720
Scott, you made your choice.

166
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,820
When you rejected my word, you rejected me.

167
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,960
And to your eternal sorrow,

168
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,620
you have found that I only could you afford

169
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,320
to give to God that which was his,

170
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,820
but you could not afford to do otherwise.

171
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,460
The Senate still stands.

172
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,540
Cast the unprofitable servant into outer darkness

173
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,360
where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth.

174
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,180
Sir, please, give me just one more chance, sir.

175
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,280
I don't want to go to hell, sir.

176
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,400
Sir, no, no.

177
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,960
Let go. I don't want to go to hell.

178
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:07,840
No!

179
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,100
It's been the next 20 years just slaving away

180
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,180
till I had a stroke and I passed away.

181
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,340
At the end of time, there was a judgment day.

182
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,640
I saw the Lord look at me, and I heard him say,

183
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,660
I am the Lord of mercy.

184
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,760
I don't forgive our sin.

185
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,560
My home art paradise.

186
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,600
Thou art welcome in.

187
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,300
My nobleness.

188
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,360
My only request, Jadar,

189
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,320
is that thou don't repent.

190
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,580
Hit it, boys.

191
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,880
I said, Lord, my body might be dead,

192
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,040
but I'm still in the mood to get a little head.

193
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,600
Maybe I don't know when I'm lit.

194
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,420
Well, I've been abused and I've been confused,

195
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,680
and frankly, Lord, I'm not amused,

196
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,940
and I don't believe we've been properly introduced.

197
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,220
I got a pain in my heart that I just can't beat it.

198
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,100
The sons of man call me hyperclete,

199
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,220
and if God is all, I'm pretty damn small,

200
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,440
but I got me a tongue about 10 feet tall.

201
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,940
That's why I'm willing to risk it all,

202
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,860
because I know a tongue can't be licked.

203
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,480
From ancient times unto the present day,

204
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,500
low from the fall of Rome to the USA,

205
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,780
from Cain and Abel to James Earl Ray,

206
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,280
you've heard the righteous cuss and the sinners pray.

207
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,380
Let me clear my throat!

208
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,440
It was another fall well into the holy year

209
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,840
when I swaggered into the bakery

210
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,480
to get some grass.

211
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,880
I had to get some graham crackers for my oral consumption.

212
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:16,540
Amen!

213
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,020
Genesis was playing on the hymn box,

214
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,240
and I was wearing a coat of many colors

215
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,100
with a matching tithe and vestibule

216
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,660
and a pair of scandals.

217
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,200
Hallelujah!

218
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,480
Hey, I come from a swinging kind of church.

219
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,320
For communion, we serve wafers and wine cooler.

220
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:31,940
Amen!

221
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,880
Anyway, my offering was in earnest.

222
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,680
Schuller, you jest,

223
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,260
Jim the baker preached with a devil-may-care attitude.

224
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,820
We haven't had any since the resurrection.

225
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,040
And besides,

226
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,880
the friar was defrocked.

227
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,540
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

228
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,920
Well, I don't want to turn this into a sermon,

229
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,900
but God only knows why they didn't break that bread for me.

230
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,840
And he told me

231
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,940
they couldn't raise the dough.

232
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,180
Thank you, thank you.

233
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

234
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,060
That was, uh...

235
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,380
You know, I don't know who...

236
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,880
Oh, I don't know who that, uh...

237
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,280
that, that...

238
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,200
These little...

239
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,160
These little funny take-offs on, uh...

240
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,280
fundamentalists.

241
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:29,940
I don't know where...

242
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,660
Who left that tape in my box?

243
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,280
But somebody left it here in the, uh...

244
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,240
subgenius box at KNON

245
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,740
with no name attached.

246
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,880
Unmarked comedy tape.

247
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,000
And before that, there was an excerpt from

248
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,200
Told the Judge by Doctors for Bob,

249
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,980
which I can't, uh...

250
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,540
I can't let you hear even the chorus of.

251
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:50,940
It's...

252
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,700
I'd have to edit too many censored bobs into it.

253
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,140
This is the ology of the is-ness

254
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,860
being the revelation of Mr. Bob.

255
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,540
Mr. Zed.

256
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,620
And Bob brought me into an high place

257
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,800
above the roads of the city.

258
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,820
And I saw motorists in wondrous numbers

259
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,420
who drove chariots pulled by neither horses nor oxen,

260
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,700
and they turned not as they went,

261
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,420
and thus they slew many of my countrymen.

262
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,600
And I said unto Bob,

263
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,380
Who are the drivers of these chariots,

264
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,280
who see not that which path is before them,

265
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,600
and who are like unto the world when in their haste?

266
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,820
And Bob spake, saying,

267
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,940
They are the followers of the norm,

268
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,340
the pishai, the pimongus,

269
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,300
those who live in fear of themselves

270
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,920
and whose minds are fettered unto deepest evil.

271
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,580
They knoweth not the way,

272
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,660
and the ways of slack,

273
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,700
and thou mayest see by their driving.

274
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,900
And yea, they desire it thus,

275
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,800
for they be not of yeti,

276
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,540
but of pink seed.

277
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,620
Serve them not.

278
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,320
And I said,

279
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,700
Verily I will not serve them,

280
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,520
for have they not sought my life

281
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,520
and the lives of my kin with their chariots?

282
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,980
Have they not taken my gold and my women?

283
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,680
And do they not revile thy name and mine?

284
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,360
And Bob said,

285
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,820
Thou speakest the very truth.

286
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:48,180
The pink boys have done much else besides that of which thou lamentest.

287
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,580
They hath befouled Gaia, the mother earth,

288
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,760
as thou hast read in the books of Nag Hammadi,

289
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,260
with their foul vapors and phylunguents.

290
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:06,660
They have loosed the madness of the blind Azathoth upon the world's innocent.

291
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,340
They have launched heads now,

292
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,640
not of metal but of flesh,

293
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,220
in defiance of the edicts of the doctors,

294
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,820
and

295
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,120
and

296
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,180
ay, hath they spread false doctrines

297
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,720
to smother the divine meaning of the year zero.

298
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,640
Yea, in their arrogance they even slew me,

299
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,760
proving that they can take not and joke.

300
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:34,000
And Bob then smote me mightily upon the forehead, saying,

301
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,500
Go thou amongst the blind faceless ones,

302
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,140
the servants of the elder gods,

303
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,940
and make witness for the sake of thy kinfolk.

304
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:49,100
Spread the good news of slack eternal among those subgeni who knoweth not my name,

305
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,160
and end for evermore the reign of the Picts.

306
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,640
Perform thou the salute.

307
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,980
And he smote me again, and I fell down and knew no more.

308
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,580
And when I awoke at sunset I saw that I had been trodden underfoot

309
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,400
by the passing multitudes as I lay in a swoon,

310
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,500
and I swore a mighty oath,

311
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,900
and I cursed as I swore,

312
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,360
and I betook myself to my hearth.

313
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,540
May the power of the fist of Bob

314
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,620
and the wrath of Jehovah One

315
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,840
come down upon thee,

316
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,180
and remain with thee throughout all eternity.

317
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,560
Amen.

318
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,180
Slack.

319
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:31,880
Bob.

320
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:42,960
And thanks to hair doctor Chris Gross.

321
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,900
Then vermo fulg, therefore light appeared,

322
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,380
as loa, roaring sound rushed through my ears,

323
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,200
and to my awl, therefore, the,

324
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:11,320
light of all was focused across my genitals.

325
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,560
I had endured prison, endured it well.

326
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,860
I spoke my peace in the face of hell,

327
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,400
stood toe to toe with God and jeered,

328
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,580
and dropped my drawers while mankind cheered.

329
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,680
I remained defiant through the world of the dead,

330
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,140
but lo could I endure the Universal.

331
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:36,680
I was the first to die.

332
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,960
Pressure mounted.

333
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,520
Sweat poured off my face.

334
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,120
At stake was the future of the human race.

335
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:24,960
I became thelungsman,

336
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:24,960


337
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:24,960


338
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:24,980


339
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:24,980


340
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:24,980


341
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:24,980


342
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,040
And then at last there was a final thrust

343
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,060
as well as new digoест,

344
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,900
This rang out across the universe.

345
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:48,540
Hell was doused and death was licked.

346
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,380
The sword proved less mighty than the...

347
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:52,740
Mob?

348
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:58,080
The souls of all mankind did submerge into a universal one.

349
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:04,200
For the final prophecy therefore at last had come.

350
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,160
For the prophets staff therefore it is never budged.

351
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,400
I say behold me fools for I have...

352
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,680
Called the gods!

353
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,840
Called the gods!

354
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,020
Friends, now we have work.

355
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,760
For you from our sponsor.

00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,480
The pink and pleasant plastic icon company of Del Rio, Texas.

357
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:45,080
I don't care if it rains or freezes.

358
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,040
Long as I've got my plastic Jesus glued to the dashboard of my car.

359
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,400
You can buy him phosphorescent.

360
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,080
Glows in the dark, he's pink and pleasant.

361
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,120
Take him with you when you're traveling far.

362
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,220
Hallelujah friends, yes you too can own one.

363
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,840
For only $1.98.

364
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,220
No COD's please.

365
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,060
Del Rio, Texas.

366
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,340
Hallelujah and friends if you send in this week $2.98.

367
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,720
You'll get in addition to your pink and pleasant plastic icon.

368
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:24,840
You'll get a genuine, stimulated pink plastic baby Jesus television light for your television set.

369
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,920
With a halo that glows and rotates.

370
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,400
Easing eye strain and bringing in better reception.

371
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,580
And friends.

372
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,600
No COD's please.

373
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,140
And friends.

374
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,120
If you do send in for this week.

375
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,120


376
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,140
Without fail.

377
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,120
And put in 50 cents extra for stamps.

378
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,540
Hallelujah friends.

379
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,260
We'll receive each day next week a different, a different member of the Holy Family.

380
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,260
With a halo that glows and rotates.

381
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,200
A television light antenna.

382
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,940
Imagine friends.

383
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,800
The envy of your neighbors.

384
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,380
When they come in to watch Mitch Miller at your house.

385
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,680
And they see the entire Holy Family sitting on top of your television set.

386
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,120
With their halos glowing and rotating and that's what a holy family is.

387
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,120


388
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,120


389
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,120


390
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,120


391
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,120


392
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,120


393
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,120


394
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,120


395
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,120


396
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,120


397
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,940
easing our strain and bringing in better reception.

398
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,580
Friends and neighbors, hallelujah.

399
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,660
What better place for a family altar

400
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,220
from the top of your television set?

401
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,300
You can buy a sweet Madonna

402
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,440
Dressed in rhinestones

403
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,220
Sitting on a pedestal of abalone shell

404
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,120
Going 90, I'm not weary

405
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,340
Cause I've got my Virgin Mary guarantee

406
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,760
I won't go to hell

407
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,720
All together now

408
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,680
I don't care if it rains or freezes

409
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,560
As long as I've got my plastic Jesus glued

410
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,100
To the dashboard of my click

411
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,560
We heard bits of Jerry Falwell in there

412
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,200
from his old-time gospel radio show.

413
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,100
And I've got to relate to you

414
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,260
my personal dealing with that organization.

415
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,340
I had to get some information

416
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,440
from Falwell's people for my job.

417
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,060
Now, I won't go into the specifics

418
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,100
about what the information

419
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,280
was or why.

420
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,120
Suffice it to say, the intention

421
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,400
was to expose the gaps

422
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,820
in Jerry Falwell's reasoning.

423
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,140
First, trying to get in touch

424
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,100
with someone who knew

425
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,020
what I was asking for

426
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,000
was like trying to get

427
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,720
a personal audience

428
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,900
with Herbert W. Armstrong.

429
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,500
Damn near impossible.

430
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,380
After a dozen phone transfers

431
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,480
to different departments,

432
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,860
I was finally talking to someone

433
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,680
who seemed to know

434
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,020
what I was talking about.

435
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,500
And they promised

436
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,180
it would be in the mail

437
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,560
as soon as possible.

438
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,680
Tuesdays later,

439
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,600
I got the envelope.

440
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,980
At last, a chance to glimpse

441
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,160
the twisted machinations

442
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,380
of the Falwell brain.

443
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,400
When I opened it,

444
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,140
I stared in shock.

445
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,360
You're not going to believe this.

446
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,840
Okay, okay, I'll tell you.

447
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,420
Inside were the receipts

448
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,300
and the current bill of this woman,

449
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,220
don't know who,

450
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,380
from Baltimore,

451
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,200
who, get this,

452
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,220
had pledged $400

453
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,320
to the old-time gospel hour.

454
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,220
And that was a year in total

455
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,480
and it had a due date

456
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,100
on the bill.

457
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,960
And if that wasn't outrageous enough,

458
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,160
the bill was like

459
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,840
a computerized utility bill,

460
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,560
but with a big difference.

461
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,320
At the bottom,

462
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,780
there was a quote from the Bible.

463
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:16,660
I...

464
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,820
Frightening stuff,

465
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,380
this electronic church.

466
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,240
A freedom-crushing,

467
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,460
self-fulfilling prophecy.

468
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,560
You think the subgenius foundation

469
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,000
is joking when we say

470
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,520
that groups like Jerry Falwell

471
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,380
and Jim Baker

472
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,160
and his Praise the Lord Club

473
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,120
and Jimmy Swagger,

474
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,000
are the ultimate deceivers,

475
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,740
leading the dupes into believing

476
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,480
they're following true Christianity

477
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,980
when in fact they're trucking

478
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,880
on the road to hell?

479
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,420
And I don't mean they're funky.

480
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,240
Wake up.

481
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:54,020
Bob is truth and Bob is lies.

482
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,380
Bob is cakes and fruits and pies.

483
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,640
Bob's my hassle, Bob's my watch.

484
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,980
Bob's my sandwich, Bob's my crotch.

485
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,200
Ah, I've to try it!

486
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,420
By the way,

487
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,960
thanks for the tip about the bananas.

488
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,740
They beat the hell out of carrots.

489
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,460
And so, once again,

490
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,040
the forces of evil gathered

491
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,280
over the radio station,

492
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,460
pus einzig.

493
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:34,460


494
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,660
the church of the subgenius show as an antenna to come from the outer world of darkness and evil

495
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:47,200
to infect the world which was the home of the human race this time they hoped to take over

496
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:54,940
completely and having established their hegemony to wipe the surface of the earth clean of mankind

497
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:03,440
and its annoying the elder gods from outside the spectrum were plotting against

498
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,660
and tonight they make their move

499
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:14,060
every political group claims that under them the people will run things but when the people find

500
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:18,820
out what's really going on they'll just run they'll rise up because the people will only

501
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:25,580
take nonsense like this well i don't know for a few million years then maybe they'll forget about

502
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:33,140
it maybe but not likely what else could it be here in the 80s nothing more than isn't it just 60 plus

503
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,240
20. clearly

504
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,720
wheels anything else is just a game next move on hello caller how long have you been listening and

the liver in the middle of the night might be or the face the liver this lady will talk to you in

513
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,460

514
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:43,200
well i can't explain it either doctor but just look at that beautiful glow and she's swimming

515
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,720
along here it makes me want to pack up the sound effects in an old plastic bag and i just don't know

516
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,520

i'm gonna go pretty fast

530
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,020


531
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,020


532
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,020


533
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,540
help me somebody

534
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,280
um

535
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,360
slip

536
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:54,020
friends, those of you who are regular listeners would recognize that as an imitation of the

537
00:27:54,020 --> 00:28:03,180
great Pope Li Jing, Pope of all China, really the acting high priest of all Asia for the

538
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:09,180
Church of the Subgenius, dear friends. A real person, not a made-up character. I mean, he's

539
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:16,060
real. And he's a good friend and a good subgenius. Unfortunately, he lives in a country where

540
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:23,520
they don't let you leave without a real good excuse. And he wants to get over to the U.S.

541
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:32,300
where he would have the freedom to practice his subgenius religion. You can do it in China,

542
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:38,220
but you have to, it's like they have a government subgenius religion. You're not allowed to

543
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:45,800
worship Bob. You have to worship some, I don't know, it's kind of a different setup over

544
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,040
there.

545
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:54,340
And Li Li Jing, as I do, loves his homeland, but he does need to come to school here. That's

546
00:28:54,340 --> 00:29:01,820
really all he needs to do is to come to a university in the U.S. and improve his education,

547
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,200
which he wasn't able to get because he was of college age during the Cultural Revolution,

548
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:13,640
dear friends, in China, and served in the Army with great courage.

549
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:14,740
But,

550
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:24,100
but, but, he needs a bit of help. He needs, just on paper, a financial sponsor for his

551
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:31,160
university education for one year. And actually, this is, theoretically, now, this would just

552
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:40,200
be bucks that would, if he, for some reason, were not able to actually earn the money himself,

553
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:46,040
which I have no doubt that he would, because he is, believe me, a harder worker than he is.

554
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:52,640
He's a harder worker than you or I, dear friends. I've worked with the guy for several weeks.

555
00:29:53,060 --> 00:30:00,520
And, so we, and I could do it myself. What he needs is somebody to sign a piece of paper

556
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:08,180
saying that if absolutely necessary, they could provide up to 11 grand. And I could

557
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:13,320
sign it. I could truthfully sign a paper like that, but I'd kind of be up that mighty creek

558
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,460
if something went wrong.

559
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,540
So,

560
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:21,300
so I would, I would love to have someone share the, the slight possibility of this burden.

561
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:26,400
And if anybody wants to do that, they should call the Willa Dobbs and leave their phone

562
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:34,100
number, and I'll talk to them tomorrow. That phone number is 823-7490 or 828-9500. Now,

563
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:37,740
this Li Li Jing, friends, is the ultimate cool dude.

564
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:44,880
And, uh, this, well, I'm not trying to make you give an impersonal donation to a bunch of

565
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,980
preachers who say they're feeding starving kids. This is a one-to-one deal where you're helping a

566
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:57,560
fellow subgenius move from the Chinese conspiracy's grip into the United States conspiracy's grip.

567
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:03,940
And this is a true, I mean, this is not some charity thing. This is a true subgenius in every

568
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:12,080
way. He's not some hustler from Taiwan, nor a Hong Kong mafia guy. Uh, but a, he's the Peking

569
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,720
equivalent of you or I with a family.

570
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:21,560
This is a man who has a brain and a, although probably a injured one, and a, a, a great sense

571
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:27,700
of humor. This is a man who instantly transcends vast cultural gulfs by sheer intuition, body

572
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:35,160
language, and intelligence. Uh, if not incredible psychic powers. Li Li Jing, the Pope, friends,

573
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:42,700
of one quarter of the world is who we're talking about. Uh, this is our only inroad to, to

574
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,860
the, uh, the technocracy of the world.

575
00:31:44,880 --> 00:32:12,980
And, uh, the, the future, the, the far future. So, um, call 823-7490 or 828-9500. If you want to, uh, share a bit of the, uh, the, like I say, the burden on paper for this worthy Chinese subgenius, uh, who has, uh, who can get into a school in the U.S. if he can but, uh, prove that he has friends over here. That's, that's all he needs to do. And, uh,

576
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,360
Oh, yes. Praise Bob. Who helped me somebody?

577
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:39,660
In search of Bob. A radio play in percepto vision.

578
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,500
Our story begins.

579
00:32:44,880 --> 00:33:07,000
In the war ravaged hill and dale of Europe. During those turbulent years, many stories circulated about a strange man with a pipe and a grin. Could this be the man we are thinking of? I'm here now in Europe with a man who was there.

580
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,400
Yes. I was there.

581
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,760
Can you tell us about it?

582
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,180
Oh, yes, I can tell you about it.

583
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,200
All the villages were burning.

584
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,320
Left were the Germans.

585
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:27,160
The right side were the Americans and the English.

586
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:35,100
And there was a circle, a group of men and women, watching.

587
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,160
Something.

588
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,920
They were screaming.

589
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,100
I went there.

590
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,600
In the middle was a man.

591
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,460
With a pipe.

592
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,540
He was all nude.

593
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,140
And he was being whipped.

594
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:51,760


595
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:51,760


596
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,700
It was terrible.

597
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:07,820
.

598
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,220
.

599
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:10,220


600
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:10,220


601
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:10,220


602
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:10,240
.

603
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:10,400
.

604
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:10,560
.

605
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:10,820
.

606
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:10,900
.

607
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,220
.

608
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:11,220


609
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,220
.

610
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,360
I couldn't believe it.

611
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:15,760
.

612
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,300
.

613
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:19,340
.

614
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,820
Blood gushing down.

615
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,760
And then...

616
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,760
then it happened.

617
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:33,480
.

618
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,860
One of the soldiers came to me.

619
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:38,740
.

620
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,060
.

621
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:40,060


622
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:40,060


623
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:40,200
.

624
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:40,260
.

625
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:40,260


626
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,540
He looked me in the eyes and he said,

627
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,020
you seem to enjoy this, don't you?

628
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,880
He gave me the whip

629
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:56,220
and pointed at the bleeding back of this man.

630
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,460
I had to hit him and they looked at me

631
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,980
if I hit it hard enough.

632
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,260
I had to draw blood.

633
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:16,300
Then he turned around and looked me in the eyes.

634
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,300
It was unbelievable.

635
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,540
It seemed as if everything became silent.

636
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,940
His hair was impeccable.

637
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:32,340
He was smiling and his pipe was smoking.

638
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,240
And now you are showing me the real blood.

639
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:37,240


640
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,800
Showing me his drawing, this picture.

641
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,280
And indeed, it is the same smile,

642
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:52,040
the same pipe, the same power.

643
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,340
This must be the man.

644
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,520
This must be Bob.

645
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:16,460
Could this be J.R. Bob Dobbs in Europe?

646
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:19,800
Possibly.

647
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,080
Still certain criteria have to be met.

648
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,300
Never found me yet

649
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,280
Oh, friends.

650
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,320
I have to cut in and explain where that one came from.

651
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,900
And it will be continued.

652
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,200
That wonderful documentary

653
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:41,860
that was recorded in the Netherlands, in Amsterdam,

654
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:47,560
by Inhibiting Factor and the Dutch fellow,

655
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,140
I can't remember his name,

656
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,340
and I didn't bring the cassette case with me.

657
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:57,760
So once again, credit goes off out into airwaves

658
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,220
that we're not hooked up to.

659
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,880
But there's a subgenius show in the Netherlands.

660
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,960
I don't think it's regular exactly,

661
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,240
but whenever Inhibiting Factor comes out,

662
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:07,240


663
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:07,240


664
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:07,240


665
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:07,240


666
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:07,240


667
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:07,240


668
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:11,020
our friend in Chicago gets out to Amsterdam,

669
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,380
which is every three or four months, apparently,

670
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,060
they do a big subgenius special.

671
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,660
And that's why we've been getting mail

672
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:23,260
from the Netherlands a lot lately.

673
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,760
So they're head and frockmeisters there.

674
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:32,100
And Will is, you can listen to Will sing.

675
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:32,920
Isn't that beautiful?

676
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,660
Isn't that a lovely song?

677
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,700
That's great, Will.

678
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,100
Never found me yet

679
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,700
Jesus' blood never found me yet

680
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,880
Never found me yet

681
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:50,500
Jesus' blood never found me yet

682
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:55,400
This one thing I know

683
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,380
For he loves me so

684
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,300
To Dwayne Johnson

685
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:18,320
For he loves me so

686
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,240
To Dwayne Johnson

687
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,500
For he loves me so

688
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,520
To Dwayne Johnson

689
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,500
For he loves me so

690
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:31,820
time. God bless you and a little children.

691
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:35,260
That's a hell of a testimonial I see Fred.

692
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,900
I'm over read Snavely and Eklund.

693
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,760
And we were at the Hall of High School library

694
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,280
today and we put lots of subgenius literature

695
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,620
in all of the books. All around we have Dobbs hit miniature Dobbs hit

696
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:55,360
uploading everywhere miniature Dobbs hit everywhere you go there's a miniature Dobbs hit.

697
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,820
Begin by settling back

698
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,940
comfortably. Get as comfortable

699
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:09,120
as you can. Well we're getting

700
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,480
comfortable now. Hey I feel better already Paul.

701
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:17,520
We're here in Telegraph Avenue and the music's cool. Oh wow I can feel

702
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,920
it coming on. Must be a whole trip here.

703
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,440
It's like being on acid right? Yeah.

704
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,140
Here we are in front of

705
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:27,660
the school bus stop.

706
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,400
We're going to park here very carefully and very quickly so we can run across the street

707
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,660
and plaster Bob's little face all

708
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,680
over the billboard.

709
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,260
We're back here at the studio trying to clean up the mess after the explosion but

710
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:51,180
we did get Bob all over two billboards right by Tower Records

711
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:55,160
and we did take an authenticating photograph which if it comes out I will send to you.

712
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,800
And you can see Bob spread out all over Berkeley.

713
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:03,120
And all the other things I've got them all plastered up everywhere

714
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:07,160
I've been telling everybody about them. I've been mumbling

715
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,660
about subgenius and everything to many people.

716
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,640
Look at that cloudy planet go by.

717
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,260
Gee this is really inspiring and I'm glad to be talking to you here

718
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:23,260
from Star Deck One and... My Lord! Yes?

719
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:26,580
Yes Elric? A floating ship is about to crash into us!

720
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:30,500
Oh pay no attention to it. So done! Yes my Lord!

721
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,300
These droids get so upset when

722
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,720
the least little thing goes wrong but anyway

723
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:42,520
it's a... Wow that is pretty awesome.

724
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,840
Look it's... Well Doug we found Bob.

725
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:51,220
Do you want to say anything to Doug? He's really appreciated

726
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:54,700
I think because he's really great. Hi there Doug.

727
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,020
I'm Bob. I'm better

728
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,880
than you've ever heard of.

729
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,420
Believe me I am. I'm a native.

730
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,760
Thank you.

731
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:15,040
He isn't here. No use loser than clams. No use

732
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,860
loser than clams.

733
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:51,060
I'll be right back.

734
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:51,200


735
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:51,200


736
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:51,200


737
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:51,200


738
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:51,200


739
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:51,200


740
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:51,200


741
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,080
Have any effect on me?

742
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:00,840
Why am I thinking these things?

743
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,340
I am not loser than clams.

744
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,260
I am not loser than clams.

745
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,320
I am not loser than clams.

746
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,360
I am not loser than clams.

747
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:18,360
I am not loser than clams. Why should it matter

748
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,620
Where I am going

749
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:24,400
Or where I have been

750
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,580
Will it bring me peace?

751
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,360
Is there a decision

752
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,200
Or a conclusion

753
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:38,060
I can feel comfortable in?

754
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,400
Will I ever be able to sleep?

755
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,760
I am not lucid and clams

756
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,360
I am not lucid and clams

757
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,040
I am not lucid and clams

758
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,440
I am not lucid and clams

759
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,480
I am not lucid and clams

760
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,780
Maybe there's something deep

761
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:01,240
Inside my head that's pounding

762
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,440
Trying to escape and surface

763
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,200
Maybe, just maybe

764
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:12,980
That something pounding hard is ugly

765
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,640
Better left alone

766
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,940
Than taken

767
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,260
And hammered within

768
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,100
Maybe, just maybe

769
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:24,600
My mind just can't hold back

770
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,300
Whatever thoughts are down there

771
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,240
Trying hard to surface

772
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,040
Maybe, just maybe

773
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,400
I'll let it loose

774
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,060
And then we'll see what happens

775
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:43,620
In order to lose

776
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:46,300
I am not lucid and clams

777
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,020
I am not lucid and clams

778
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,380
I am not lucid and clams

779
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:48,800
You didn't imagine

780
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:48,800


781
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,200
I am not lucid and clams

782
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,760
If I could someday

783
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:58,640
Get set for this

784
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:58,640


785
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:58,640


786
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,300
Get away from

787
00:43:59,300 --> 00:43:59,300


788
00:43:59,300 --> 00:43:59,360
That high

789
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:01,380
The mooring

790
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:07,040
The cow

791
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:07,460
The garden

792
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:10,140
That I and the cat

793
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:10,220
Yeah, it'll do

794
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,400
You know it's a long way

795
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:11,400


796
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:11,420
The food

797
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:11,420


798
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:11,780
At thehas

799
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:11,780


800
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,220
A man's crazy

801
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,900
I'm a lovely person

802
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:16,980
I'll believe you

803
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:31,740
Maybe just maybe there's something deep inside my head that's pounding

804
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:36,100
Trying to escape and surface

805
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:41,340
Maybe just maybe there's something pounding

806
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:48,680
Heart is ugly, better left alone than tampered with

807
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:55,260
And maybe just maybe my mind just can't hold back

808
00:44:55,260 --> 00:45:01,880
Whatever thoughts are down there trying hard to surface

809
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:07,100
Maybe just maybe I'll let it loose

810
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:10,840
And then we'll see what happens

811
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:11,320
Maybe just maybe there's something pounding

812
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,940
We're gonna lose

813
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,080
I am not lucid and clam

814
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,580
I am not lucid and clam

815
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:46,280
I am not lucid and clam

816
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,080
I am not lucid and clam

817
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:56,000
I am not lucid and clam

818
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,160
I am not lucid and clam

819
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:02,460
I am not lucid and clam

820
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:06,480
Oh, that was Zug's rift.

821
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,300
Once again, that's Zug's rift.

822
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,240
And I couldn't believe it.

823
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:16,040
Once again, I was in one of those big chain record stores.

824
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:22,000
And sure, just scanning the cassettes, I usually never buy anything.

825
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:27,140
But there was another commercially available Zug's rift record.

826
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,340
And this was a best of.

827
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:32,360
It's called Looser Than Clams by Zug's Rift.

828
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:36,280
And you can find it in stores right now.

829
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,300
Although his older stuff you might be able to find in places like...

830
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,980
Metamorphosis and VVV and so forth.

831
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,400
Here's another letter from a dear listener.

832
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,560
This one's from...

833
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,160
Willie Heckleson, Mr. Bill.

834
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,840
And he says,

835
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,260
Dear Reverend Stang,

836
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:03,120
I had a dream that I thought I should relate to you.

837
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,220
It goes as follows.

838
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,080
My brother, Clay in Austin,

839
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,080
who has a slack band,

840
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,640
and I were heading to a devival.

841
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:17,440
We were in a half track with enormous speakers on top

842
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,880
that were blaring slack tapes.

843
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,560
As we approached the site, which was a cove at a lake,

844
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,020
we were flabbergasted at the number of subgeni there.

845
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:30,260
You met us at the gate to direct us to the stage area.

846
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,440
You got in the vehicle with us and we proceeded...

847
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:35,600
fropping.

848
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:40,060
As we reached designated area, the devival was starting.

849
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:40,980
D.K.

850
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:45,520
Jones began, followed by Pope Meyer of the Great Pacific Northwest.

851
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:50,740
After that, you took charge and the whole gathering of 20,000 started chanting,

852
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,680
praise Bob, gimme Bob, and suddenly...

853
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,200
Bob appeared.

854
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:01,980
He walked from the stage to the beach and continued to walk on out across the water.

855
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,320
He walked the water.

856
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:09,460
He walked about a hundred yards, then stopped and turned.

857
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:10,760
Then...

858
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:15,680
He miraculously grew until he was approximately 100 feet tall

859
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,120
and started to speak with the crowd totally silent.

860
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:20,380
Stunned.

861
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:26,060
As he spoke, airplanes appeared in the skies above, obviously pinks,

862
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,660
and started to drop bombs.

863
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:32,900
Bob leisurely removed his pipe, caught the bombs in his mouth,

864
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:38,400
and spit them back at the pink boys, causing the crowd to cheer madly.

865
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,060
Unfortunately, I then woke up.

866
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:42,440
There's only this much I could see.

867
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:42,440


868
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,180
But I felt great.

869
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,420
I had to relay this wonderful religious experience with you,

870
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:49,140
especially after the wonderful way you did my...

871
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:52,200
Oh, people that buy PSA lately.

872
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,920
Okay, great, that's the guy with the food co-op.

873
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,500
Wish I had the number right on- by me.

874
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,320
Also, I've enclosed a tape.

875
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,460
I know you'll love it.

876
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:01,880
Oh, well maybe that was the uh,

877
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,480
Which one was it?

878
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,000
They float around, there's so many of them, God...

879
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,020
There's literally a thousand to set.

880
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:14,780
Oh, well, brother, we're so glad to hear that testimonial of that mighty dream,

881
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,260
that fantastic dream, which tells the truth.

882
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:24,720
Surely, I think you saw a precognitive vision of either the subgenius movie

883
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,540
or the big party of X-Day itself.

884
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,440
And where will we hold that party?

885
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:36,200
Well, actually, I'm going to think that I'm going to tape where we talk about that very, very thing.

886
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,680
And I'm going to slide that in.

887
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:42,200
That's a sudden, you can just jump from one subject to the next.

888
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,260
Because it's composed of people who aren't joiners.

889
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:53,400
And I think an awful lot of subgeniuses never have joined up, so to speak, just because of that.

890
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:54,840
And that's fine.

891
00:49:55,260 --> 00:50:00,160
You know, they know that on X-Day, when the bombs start to fall and the earthquakes

892
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,320
and the tribulation money starts falling from the sky,

893
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,180
they'll be paying their dues.

894
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,060
$20 membership dues to the church, that's for sure.

895
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:15,420
It's the only way to get a good seat on the escape vessels of the sex goddesses, baby.

896
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:17,900
So, you know, we're...

897
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,240
And if it doesn't happen, then great.

898
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:21,780
Bob postponed it.

899
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:29,420
So, well, that's, of course, the standard excuse employed by many a religious organization.

900
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:35,220
I mean, if the prophecies that they make don't come true, then it's just been postponed.

901
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:35,640
Yeah, but the difference is...

902
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,780
For us, it'll be a great party no matter what.

903
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:39,600
Oh, sure.

904
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,580
We're going to have the biggest party on Earth in 1998.

905
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:48,700
And there's a toss-up as to whether to have it in Lapland or...

906
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:50,140
What was the other one?

907
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,000
Tierra del Fuego?

908
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,680
Tierra del Fuego or the Antarctic Peninsula, yeah.

909
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:54,180
Right.

910
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:54,860
Because...

911
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:59,700
Or on the ranch in Argon, belonging to a famous author who shall remain famous.

912
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:00,640
Oh, yeah, right, right, yeah.

913
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,880
Well, we've got to check with the merry pranksters about that.

914
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,180
The great...

915
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,360
Grandfathers of the...

916
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,640
Grandmothers of the subgeniuses.

917
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:17,320
So, I've heard, although I was not there, that you made a previous appearance in Boston

918
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:20,520
and met with some rather controversial response.

919
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,140
Do you want to comment on that?

920
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,380
Well, yeah, yeah, they say through...

921
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,580
Nah, we don't need to comment on that.

922
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:29,240
Well, anyway, that was from the last trip to Boston.

923
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:32,500
We did a quick phone interview with...

924
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,220
Um...

925
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:34,300
Um...

926
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:36,180
Um...

927
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:36,180


928
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:36,180


929
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:36,180


930
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:36,180


931
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:36,180


932
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:36,180


933
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:36,180


934
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:36,180


935
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:36,180


936
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:36,180


937
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:43,360
Reverend Tim, the mighty Reverend Tim, who has a, I guess, an irregular sort of a subgenius

938
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:48,500
type show out there on radio station I don't know what.

939
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,360
It is painful to think about it.

940
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:59,800
It's all coming back to me.

941
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,600
Why are you here?

942
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:06,040
Why do you want to know about this?

943
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,800
Man, this J.R. Bob Dobbs.

944
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,440
Who is he?

945
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:18,040
The foundation in Dallas has sent me to find out more about the origins of this man.

946
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:25,520
We know that during this time, it was the age of the final solution.

947
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:34,540
The Axis, as well as the Allied forces, were collecting up the subgenius from both sides.

948
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,960
Commodities were scarce.

949
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:40,200
There were no salesmen about.

950
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,580
This is a recorded fact.

951
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:42,800
Hmm.

952
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,980
Indeed, something very strange happened.

953
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:50,060
What happened?

954
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,320
After I whipped this man,

955
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,080
I had to vomit.

956
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:01,040
My whole stomach was coming out.

957
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,800
I felt sick like a dog and...

958
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:10,200
When I opened my eyes again, I was alone.

959
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,160
Everybody was gone.

960
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,200
Except one person.

961
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,340
This man with his pipe.

962
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:22,680
Bleeding.

963
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:25,740
Half nude.

964
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:29,360
Looking at me.

965
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,780
I gave him my shirt.

966
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:36,960
He thanked me.

967
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,460
And then he gave me a ballpoint.

968
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,900
I had never seen a ballpoint before.

969
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,860
I think it was one of the first ones.

970
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,540
I still have it.

971
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:49,000
Let me see.

972
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,260
I must have it somewhere here.

973
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,600
Look, here it is.

974
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,180
Yes.

975
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,140
I keep it with me all the time.

976
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:56,820
Indeed.

977
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,180
Made from molded plastic.

978
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,160
Yes.

979
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:01,660
Yes.

980
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,800
It was a new material then, you have to remember.

981
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:06,880
Actual weight loss.

982
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,920
But did he sell it to you?

983
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,900
Of course he sold it to me.

984
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:17,300
Of course, I paid dearly.

985
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:20,000
I paid.

986
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:23,560
And I think I'm still paying.

987
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,160
I never stopped paying.

988
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,480
????

989
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,380

We live in so much danger.

1014
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:37,240
Boys and girls in the line.

1015
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,460
Come and get your big reward.

1016
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,620
You're not too late.

1017
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:41,740
Just in time.

1018
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,800
Just put your hands on mine, your, mine, your mind.

1019
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,900
And when everybody has gone to bed.

1020
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:54,800
And children are asleep.

1021
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:55,440
Yeah.

1022
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:55,740
Yeah.

1023
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:57,720
Yeah.

1024
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,940
Sit up late and watch TV.

1025
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:03,300
And soak up.

1026
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:03,500
Yeah.

1027
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:04,500
Soak up.

1028
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:06,480
Soak up lots of pain.

1029
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:06,860
Yeah.

1030
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,980
Little Junior on the bus.

1031
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:46,940
Oh, friends, stay tuned for Ron Lindsey's show coming up next with Soul Oldies down Memory Lane.

1032
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:52,040
And I should mention another show that's on earlier in the day on Sundays.

1033
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,220
And that's Beyond Bows and Arrows.

1034
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,520
They just left a little thing in my box.

1035
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:00,080
And I thought I might as well mention something about it.

1036
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:08,720
That show's main goal is correcting the many false stereotypes which exist pertaining to those of them who are labeled American Indian.

1037
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,620
Now, those Indians, friends, they want everything.

1038
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,480
We've already given them so much.

1039
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:19,680
The BIA, Bureau of Indian Affairs, government houses, smallpox, malaria.

1040
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,820
What would we ever ask in return, friends?

1041
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:24,920
Only their land and their children, that's all.

1042
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:25,400
That's all.

1043
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:25,420
That's all.

1044
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:25,920
That's their culture.

1045
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:31,660
But that's Beyond Bows and Arrows at noon on Sundays.

1046
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:34,120
Noon to one here on KNON.

1047
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:40,580
I used to live on the Lakota Sioux Reservation in Rosebud, South Dakota.

1048
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:45,440
We were the only honkies for miles and had a lot of Indian friends.

1049
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:50,160
And you'll notice that I tend to use the word Indian rather than Native American.

1050
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,840
It's not accurate, of course.

1051
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,240
But all the cool old.

1052
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:00,680
Respected elders and medicine men and young firebrands said Indian.

1053
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,180
In fact, they said Indian.

1054
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:07,160
And the only time I ever heard the phrase Native American on the reservation

1055
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:14,980
was when the white anthropologist fools and documentary filmmaker vampires were around.

1056
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:22,000
Well, dear friends, this has been another, and still is actually, another hour of slack.

1057
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:25,260
The only org.

1058
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:33,720
And of the church of the subgenius, dear friends, which you may write for more information at.

1059
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:40,860
Do you have that quill dipped in innocent baby's blood, friends?

1060
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,360
Ready to write that number?

1061
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:50,680
Yes, it's P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

1062
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,380
Beautiful Dallas, Texas.

1063
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,280
Great tourists.

1064
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:55,900
Spot, huh?

1065
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:59,020
Seven, five, two, one, four.

1066
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:03,420
That's Bob at Box 140306.

1067
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:06,280
Dallas, Texas.

1068
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:10,920
Seven, five, two, one, four.

1069
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:11,640
Hmm.

1070
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:20,860
Come on and drench me, drench me, drench me in my finest array.

1071
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:24,720
Cause just in case you haven't heard today's Dormido Day.

1072
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,960
Of all the, uh...

1073
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:29,920
Oh I would never say...

1074
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:30,360
Have I seen it before?

1075
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:30,560
Lip muc—

1076
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:37,820
Oh child!

1077
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,740
Uh, I am good.

1078
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:41,040
I am a ball bear.

1079
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,780
Douglas Verschke?

1080
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:43,560
No, he's not.

1081
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:43,560


1082
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:55,420
He's not?

1083
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:07,600
This is KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

1084
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:09,480
Praise Bob.

1085
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:11,400
And stay tuned for Ron Lindsey.

1086
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:11,600
Ron Lindsey.

1087
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,520
Ron Lindsey.
