1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
Oh, you want slack? I'll give you slack.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,260
You'll affect it immediately.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,180
Soft.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,660
I am the first person to make this fabulous journey.

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,600
Suspended in the timelessness of inner space

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,280
are the thought waves of my first impressions.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,240
They will be our only source of contact

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,580
once you have passed beyond the limits of normal.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,740
Magnification.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,900
Magnification.

11
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,180
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

12
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,880
which reaches from the inner mind to...

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,560
The subgenius.

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,760
Hour of Slack.

15
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:00,920
The subgenius.

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:00,920


17
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,560
Why should the people who want to make it and sell it

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,780
be burdened with an edict from social engineers?

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,620
Thanks for pushing that, Bob.

20
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,680
The light's on, but you never know, it really might be broken.

21
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,260
Shut up.

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,240
Dear friends,

23
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,740
have you ever faxed someone from the beach?

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,360
Have you ever produced a radio show from a hellhole?

25
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,740
A pit of hell?

26
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,920
We're not announcing the sacred number this installment.

27
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,420
Something's wrong, we're not all talking at once.

28
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,320
That's right.

29
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,080
I hate this junk.

30
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,140
Come on, Paul, eat up, it's good for you.

31
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,580
I'm sick of this stupid cult.

32
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,640
We never really talk about it in any way.

33
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,120
We should.

34
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,220
We should.

35
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,220


36
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,220


37
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,220


38
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,220


39
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,220


40
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,220


41
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,220


42
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,220


43
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,000
It's just all a bunch of fancy words that we just repeat over and over and over.

44
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,560
The flea marketplace of ideas.

45
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,920
That's where we got this religion.

46
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,640
That's only fair, and it's only the American way.

47
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,680
No record is the law.

48
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,220
Which way?

49
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,040
Left.

50
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:10,820
Ah!

51
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,620
I thumbed through the want ads in the Shelby County Tribune

52
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,080
when this classified advertisement caught my eye.

53
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,180
It said take immediate delivery on this 57 Chevrolet half-ton pickup truck

54
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,600
we'll sell or swap for a height of bed and 35 bucks.

55
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,660
Let's call 140 Ring 2 and ask for Bob.

56
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,220
Well, I called Bob.

57
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,100
I called Bob up on the telephone.

58
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,820
He says, hello, this is Bob speaking.

59
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,080
I says, is this here the Bob got to pick up truck for sale?

60
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,720
He says, yeah.

61
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,680
I says, where are you?

62
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,460
He says, 14 East on County 12.

63
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,080
Turn right on the one lane gravel road.

64
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:39,980
You can park in the yard.

65
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,700
Beware of the dog.

66
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,380
Wipe your feet off.

67
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,840
Knock three times and bring your billfold.

68
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,520
Well, I tooled on East on County 12.

69
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,060
Turn right on the one lane gravel road, and I parked in the yard,

70
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,120
and a German Shepherd come out and grabbed onto my leg.

71
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,020
Then I knocked three times and wiped my feet.

72
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,720
The dog let go, and the screen door opens.

73
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,140
Bob come out and says, what do you want?

74
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,360
Says, come see your truck.

75
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,180
He says, follow me.

76
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,860
We don't need to explain to most of you.

77
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,480
That's Bob.

78
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,420
That's our JR Bob Dog.

79
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,720
The world's first short duration personal savior.

80
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,960
A disposable personal savior.

81
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,360
And he's not the kind of personal savior who's so well connected.

82
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,240
Well, he wouldn't care anyway.

83
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,000
Bob Dog is not going to die for your sins.

84
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,860
Sorry to have to tell you that.

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,700
He will not die for your sins.

86
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,340
Because he does not care about your sins.

87
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:26,340


88
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:26,340


89
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:26,340


90
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,720
He does not want to talk about your sins.

91
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,440
Bob Dog comes and comes again and again to justify your sins, my friends.

92
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,020
To rationalize your sins.

93
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,960
He brings not forgiveness, nay, but an excuse.

94
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,040
So your sins, sin more.

95
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,480
It may be your last chance, but you better sin hard, boys and girls.

96
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,580
Now, like any other church, we're selling something.

97
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,160
Hell yeah.

98
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,340
In our case, we're selling a lot of things.

99
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,340
We're selling something for nothing.

100
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:58,900
Yeah!

101
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,080
Now, take your money like we will.

102
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,680
Take your money, really, in a way, it's nothing.

103
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,040
Where as slack, slack.

104
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,720
Now, that's something, brothers and sisters.

105
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,880
It's a lot more palpable, really, when it comes down to it than money or fast cars or big houses.

106
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,720
Those things are wonderful, but you know they ring hollow after a while.

107
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,380
Just ask Elvis if he can find him.

108
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,000
Ask Marilyn.

109
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,260
Ask, uh, Kurt.

110
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,560
Ask Charlie.

111
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:41,120
But Bob comes to replace that, not just with slack, but with pure, unadulterated slack.

112
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,080
Pure slack.

113
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,380
As Bob said, too much is always better than not enough.

114
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,740
Also, related to that, Bob once said, friend, don't just eat that hamburger.

115
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,180
Eat the hell out of it!

116
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,900
Don't just overdo overdoing something.

117
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,700
Overdo the hell out of overdoing it, goddammit.

118
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,120
Whoa!

119
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,160
And so, but at this point, you may be saying, well, that all sounds well and good, Reverend

120
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,100
Stein, but what is slack?

121
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,860
What is slack?

122
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,320
Well, I got some news for you.

123
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,180
Old Bob Dobbs, he ain't gonna tell you what slack is, no sir.

124
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,120
The conspiracy will try to tell you what slack is.

125
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,640
Oh yeah.

126
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,440
If you'll be, it's real simple, if you'll be their good little clown, they'll give you

127
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,280
all the false slack you could possibly want.

128
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,620
Old Bob Dobbs is gonna make you decide what slack is for you, but most people would not

129
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:44,860
know true slack if it crawled up their ass in the form of an evil snake and then curled

130
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,920
up and died up there.

131
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,160
Not that slack frequently takes the form of an evil snake crawling up your ass and dying,

132
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,100
but I think you get the point.

133
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,100


134
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,100


135
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,100


136
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,100


137
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,100


138
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,520
I think you get the picture.

139
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,080
Look, though, people get all kinds of ideas about slack.

140
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:03,040
They say to themselves, oh, if I could just get a raise, then I'd have slack.

141
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,400
Oh yeah.

142
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:10,420
Oh, or other people might say, oh, if only I could, if I looked like Whitney Houston,

143
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,900
then I'd have slack.

144
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,200
Or they might say, well, hell, if I could just get a raise, then I'd have slack.

145
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,080
Friends, for most people on this planet, slack is the only thing that they can do.

146
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


147
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


148
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


149
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


150
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


151
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,400
It's nothing more than one decent meal.

152
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,480
There was a sad time on Dobbs Town, and fever was on the face of the land.

153
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,180
Why must we carry this fire?

154
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,600
We shall all die soon.

155
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,340
The government takes ten percent of our farm and it will be the end.

156
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,520
But then the minions of Bob came, overwhelming all.

157
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,440
He's gonna die.

158
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,060
He's gonna die.

159
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,060


160
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,060


161
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,060


162
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,060


163
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,060


164
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,060


165
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,060


166
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,060


167
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,160
And lo, Bob was exalted over all, over man and beast.

168
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,740
The swaying palanquin of Bob was borne through the seething mobs

169
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,980
toward the glittering palace,

170
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,920
while rogue eunuchs spitted and disemboweled those

171
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,600
who were unfortunate enough not to get out of the way and die.

172
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,580
Swinging braziers of incense,

173
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,840
the Wotanites came crashing through the edges of the mob,

174
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,420
trampling young children underfoot.

175
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:57,180
The culmination of the conspiracy's grip on your essence

176
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,780
becomes a matter of trust.

177
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:05,740
Confuse and frustrate parents and other authority figures

178
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:11,620
as you fill the holy coppers of Bob's sacred trousers.

179
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,300
Delight in the visage of the one true slackmaster

180
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,460
as your own life burns away.

181
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,600
And your hate lust is quenched

182
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,340
in an endless ejaculation of loathing and scorn.

183
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,080
Come on, Frank.

184
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,040
Dog's name is Frank.

185
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,920
Well, we all went past the chicken house,

186
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,600
threw the hog pen down in the tractor shed,

187
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,900
and then wound up in back of the barn field cow pies.

188
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,420
And sitting right there in a pool of grease

189
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,640
was a half-ton Chevy pickup truck with a 1960 license plate,

190
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,740
a bumper sticker that says,

191
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,300
Vote for Dick,

192
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,900
and a gorilla box full of rusty parts.

193
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,440
And Bob says,

194
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,000
What do you think?

195
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,260
Well, I kicked the tire,

196
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,100
and then got in the seat,

197
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,600
and sat on a petrified apple core,

198
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,000
and found a bunch of field mice living in the glove compartment.

199
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,020
He says,

200
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,760
Her shaft is bent,

201
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,500
and the rear end leaks.

202
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,000
You can fix her quick with an oil or rag.

203
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,840
Use a nail and starter.

204
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,580
I lost the key.

205
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,240
Don't pay any mind to that whirring sound.

206
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,100
She used a little oil,

207
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,300
but outside of that, she's cherry.

208
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,500
I says,

209
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,200
What'll it take?

210
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:06,400
Says,

211
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,000
What do you got?

212
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,200
Says,

213
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,360
$28.15.

214
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:08,900
Says,

215
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,880
You got a deal signed here.

216
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,540
I'll go get the title and the can full of gas.

217
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,500
I put a nail in the slot and fired her up.

218
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,020
She coughed and belched up a bunch of smoke,

219
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,080
and I backed right through the hog pen into the yard.

220
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,200
Well, Frank jumped in,

221
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:19,880
bit my leg,

222
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,160
and I beat him off the crowbar.

223
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,260
He jumped on out,

224
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,040
and the door fell off,

225
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,280
and the left front tire went flat.

226
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,180
I jacked it up and patched the tube,

227
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,720
and Frank tore a piece of my shirt off.

228
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,320
And then Bob come out and called him off,

229
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:29,480
says,

230
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,560
You better get on out of here.

231
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,480
I went left on the one-lane gravel road,

232
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,020
went 14 west and counted 12,

233
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,760
took two full quarts of 408 oil,

234
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,960
just to get her to the Conoco station.

235
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,500
And I pulled up to the regular pump,

236
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,120
and then Harold Sykes and his kid come out,

237
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,400
and says,

238
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,960
I've seen better stuff at the junkyard,

239
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,440
and where'd you ever get that truck?

240
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,480
I said,

241
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,840
That's a long story, Harold.

242
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,060
I said,

243
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,140
Thumbin' through the want ads

244
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,700
in the Shelby County Tribune

245
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,160
when this classified advertisement caught my eye.

246
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,200
It said,

247
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,020
Take immediate delivery on this 57 Chevrolet half-ton pickup truck

248
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,460
with a seller swap for a high to bed of 35 bucks.

249
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,620
Call 1-4-0-RING-2 and ask for Bob.

250
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,900
Well, I told Bob.

251
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,920
Praise Bob!

252
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,780
You are now online with the fast track to Slack,

253
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,140
the subgenius hotline.

254
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,620
An infinite or just short of infinite variety of selections

255
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,480
await your punch of the number

256
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,060
of your choice.

257
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,480
On your touchstone phone.

258
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,660
If you're new to the Church of the Subgenius

259
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,940
and need an instant introduction to the teachings of Bob Dobbs,

260
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,560
punch 1.

261
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,040
If you want catalog information on purchasing subgenius products

262
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,080
and upcoming events,

263
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,840
push 2.

264
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,600
For weekly rants by great subgenius preachers

265
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,820
such as Jane or Hypercleets,

266
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,700
Ivan Stang,

267
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,480
Dr. Howell,

268
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,140
and others,

269
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:36,980
punch 3.

270
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,200
For Connie's confidential confessions,

271
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,900
untamed hot talk sessions

272
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,380
with the high anti-virgin Connie Dobbs,

273
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,100
punch 4.

274
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,760
If at any time you would like to switch to another,

275
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,580
menu selection,

276
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,980
just punch that number.

277
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,420
That's 1 for introduction,

278
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,420
2 for catalog and current events,

279
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,240
3 for hellfire ranting,

280
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,540
and 4 for Connie Dobbs' ultimate erotic phone affair.

281
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,620
You are now embarking on what could be

282
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,380
the most startling adventure of your life.

283
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,880
Hi.

284
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,020
You know, I just had a mystic feeling that you were gonna call

285
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,800
women's intuition, I suppose.

286
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,560
I thought we'd talk about pets today.

287
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,040
Wanna see my pussy?

288
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,020
This is Fuzzles.

289
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,840
Bob, that's my husband, Bob.

290
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,620
Well, he's out of town again.

291
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,360
He calls him Pud.

292
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,960
Yes, Bob and I have a lot of fun with this little puss.

293
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,300
But enough about cats.

294
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,000
You know what I like even more than my cat,

295
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,820
even more than my anteater?

296
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,380
My prairie squid.

297
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,320
I think I like my squid even more than my beaver.

298
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,660
Ah, you know, there's a special feeling between a woman and a man,

299
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,480
and a prairie squid, like mine.

300
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,020
Now, where did that little rascal crawl up to?

301
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,020
Here, Long John.

302
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,600
Come on to Connie.

303
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,520
Baby, up here.

304
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,560
Come on, hop up.

305
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,440
Here on my lap.

306
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,620
There we go.

307
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,660
Oh.

308
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,660
Hmm.

309
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,920
It tickles when he nuzzles me like that.

310
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,520
Bob breeds him specially to do that, of course.

311
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,960
No, no, not yet, Long John.

312
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,520
I call him he, but Bob calls him her when he uses her.

313
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,420
Him, her.

314
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,580
There's only one kind of prairie squid, and that's both.

315
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,540
Boy, you act like you've never seen a prairie squid.

316
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,420
Much less, well, you know.

317
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,440
What?

318
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,460
You don't?

319
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,500
Well, I'll just have to broaden your education.

320
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,620
You wouldn't mind sharing him with me, would you?

321
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,140
Oh, I don't think the squid would mind, would you, Long John?

322
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,060
Whoops.

323
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,760
Oh, I don't want him to get excited yet.

324
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,880
He'll squirt his ink all over the sofa, and he'll be good for nothing for at least an hour.

325
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:34,900
What?

326
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,000
An aquarium?

327
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,300
Oh, heavens, no.

328
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,740
These are land squids.

329
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,660
Why, aren't you the city boy?

330
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,400
I'll bet the only prairie squid you ever saw was a little shaved and bearded.

331
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,960
Dead and wrapped in cellophane at the market.

332
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,640
Those are gross.

333
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,880
Now, see how much more cuddly they are alive than in the frozen meat section?

334
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,760
Oh, warm and furry and slimy.

335
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,200
And look, I'll gently turn it over and part its hair.

336
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,480
I'll give it a trim.

337
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,600
See, that's the part Bob uses.

338
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,240
He's de-beaked it already, of course, or he'd be singing in the boys' choir now.

339
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,780
Oh, you have to de-beak them first before you, you know, at least men do.

340
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,200
But it doesn't hurt him if you tickle him first and use a good de-beaking tool.

341
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,680
But let me show you a little tantric trick Bob and I found in the Kama Sutra.

342
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:23,680
You get out some bait, Dobs brand prairie squid bait, of course, and spread it on your...

343
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,660
Oh, shoot, let me just get these pesky old clothes out of the way.

344
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,760
Ah, feels good to air out.

345
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,980
And I'll just spread some bait here where I want him to crawl.

346
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,360
Here, you want to spread it out for me?

347
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,080
Oh, that's good.

348
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,240
You have a gentle touch.

349
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,880
Oh, look, he smells the bait.

350
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,720
He's trembling.

351
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,040
He's getting all hot and eager.

352
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,820
He's going for it.

353
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,740
Oh, yes.

354
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,660
Good boy, Long John.

355
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,400
Oh, look, he's swelling up.

356
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,600
That's his protective, whatchamacallit, that's expanding.

357
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,100
Get all those tentacles going.

358
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:55,860
Yes.

359
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,460
Now, look, you come around here behind it and use that end while I got this end doing.

360
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,900
Oh, oh, oh, you shameless squid, you.

361
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,540
Oh, oh, oh, I think I'm going to explode with pleasure.

362
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,740
Oh, come to mama.

363
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,780
Come to mama.

364
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,780
No, don't worry, that's just ink.

365
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,740
That'll wash out.

366
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,820
Here, what are you doing?

367
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,940
Give it back.

368
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,160
I'm not finished yet.

369
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,320
I said we could share.

370
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,340
I didn't say you could have it.

371
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,400
Hey, where are you going?

372
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,020
Come back here.

373
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,720
Well, he's gone with my squid.

374
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,140
Oh, well, he'll be back.

375
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,900
I've got the dabiking tool and he didn't give me a chance to tell him that the beet grows

376
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,560
back overnight.

377
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,880
Oh, well, it'll serve him right.

378
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,540
Guess he'll find out the formerly hard way.

379
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,500
Bye.

380
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:35,900

381
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:36,840

385

386
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:39,340


387
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:39,460

388
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:39,560

389
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:39,620
.

390
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:39,620


391
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:08,500
What are you, what are you, what are you?

392
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,860
What are you?

393
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,140
What are you?

394
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,060
What are you?

395
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,420
What are you?

396
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:12,700
What are you?

397
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:12,700


398
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:12,720

399
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:12,720

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:12,720


401
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:12,720


402
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:12,720


403
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:12,720


404

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:12,720


420
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,320
I'm a chip of the old clock

421
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,420
A piece of the rock

422
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,560
What you feel but you don't see

423
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,740
You're the crack in my security

424
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,820
What are you?

425
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,240
What are you?

426
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,440
What are you?

427
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,680
What are you?

428
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,040
What are you?

429
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,380
What are you?

430
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,620
What are you?

431
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,940
Yes, what are you?

432
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,240
I'm support without peace

433
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,340
Play without scenes

434
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,140
Am I communicating?

435
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:43,940
You're my flesh that lies waiting

436
00:16:44,540 --> 00:17:08,080
You're my flesh that lies waiting

437
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,580
I'd love no logic

438
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:18,580


439
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:18,580

00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:18,580

00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,120
What are you?

442
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,420
What are you?

443
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,600
What are you?

444
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:21,720
What are you?

445
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,020
Yes, what are you?

446
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:30,640
Am I communicating?

447
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:37,760
Am I attracting anxiety?

448
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,980
guitar solo

449
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,460
guitar solo

450
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,780
guitar solo

451
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,180
guitar solo

452
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,240

guitar solo

459
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,460
guitar solo

460
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:29,980
Oh yes, yes, yes, dear friends, that was Snakefinger, the late Snakefinger, live in Chicago with a song called Yeti, What Are You?

461
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:37,020
And prior to that, let's go backwards on tape here, let's rewind conceptually

462
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:42,440
and see what we've been listening to here on the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

463
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:55,640
Uh, yes, and uh, okay, before that, um, a little, we got, you got to hear for free what some people used to pay $2.95 a minute for,

464
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:05,200
the Subgenius, uh, hotline, uh, which still exists, but I can't give you the number because this is probably not a commercial station

465
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,980
and, I don't know, they'd kill us.

466
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:13,800
But, uh, you got to hear a little bit of Mistress Connie's confidential hotline, phone affair.

467
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:22,740
Uh, yeah, boys, I hope, uh, I hope you paid attention to what she was saying about those prairie squid and de-beaking and so forth.

468
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:30,580
Um, before that, we got to hear a little bit of the great C.W. McCall with his song about Bob called Classified.

469
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:36,540
Um, and, God, this music is so inspiring, it makes you want to say everything real big.

470
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,120
All right, I'll say it big.

471
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:45,060
And before that, we had Einstein's Secret Orchestra Radio, ESO Radio from, uh, WCSB in Cleveland,

472
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,160
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chaz and Princess Weardo.

473
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:58,740
And, uh, by the way, the, uh, little, uh, back-masked Bob chants in the female voices,

474
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:06,140
that's Reverend Velveteen Sly and her friends, uh, Spring or Heidi or somebody.

475
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,000
They're in...

476
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:11,380
In Madison with W-O-R-T, a great wart on Wisconsin.

477
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,920
Uh, KPFA subgenius show, A Sad Time in Dobstown with Puzzling Evidence,

478
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,320
Dr. Howell and Gary Gabrog, friend, from November 1983.

479
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,460
Yes, them were the good old days, friends, when they used to still talk about Bob.

480
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,180
Well, when Wellman allowed people to talk about Bob.

481
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,220
Um, and, uh, A Long Stretch of Ranting by yours truly.

482
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,820
Actually, that's, uh, part one of Subgenius 101.

483
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:42,120
Uh, rant, uh, as delivered in Boston, uh, during the Slack Crusade Devivals

484
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,220
with, uh, Brother Cleve Duncan supplying the background gospel music.

485
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,100
Isn't that amazing?

486
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,140
And, uh, well, I guess that's it.

487
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,600
Let's, let's get back into those, uh, those live recordings of actual Subgenius Temp Show Devivals,

488
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,320
uh, as we traveled across this great land last month.

489
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:04,840
Um, and here is more about those events and that event.

490
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,800
Uh, thank you.

491
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:12,100
At this event, uh, Lonesome Cowboy Dave will be available to be tortured, pelted with,

492
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,380
uh, coins, tomatoes, uh, eggs.

493
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,380
Pieces of holy artifacts.

494
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,620
Holy artifacts, pieces of the one true cross.

495
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,280
The thigh bone of Saint Josephus.

496
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,820
The holy toe bone of Saint Germain.

497
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,340
The bear, the claw of Anshi Bear.

498
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,220
The buttock of Witchy Tartai Woman.

499
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:35,340
All of these things can be thrown, tossed, uh, can be used to pelt.

500
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:43,340
Lonesome Cowboy Dave, uh, who will, uh, be chained up there by Dr. Chaz, uh, live.

501
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,820
Long, long confused.

502
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,100
In person.

503
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,160
The little murdered woman.

504
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,640
For your edification and cruelty.

505
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,260
And you yourself will be strewn with religious artifacts.

506
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,620
The Reverend Ivan Stang.

507
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,940
Oh, but Princess, we want building.

508
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,860
Where is this revival of Tomorrow Night?

509
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,580
The Subgenius Devival?

510
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,800
Why, it's at the Cleveland Institute of Art.

511
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,680
Art Factory Building.

512
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,820
The Cleveland Institute of Art.

513
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,480
Oh, I guess this religion is just an art thing, huh?

514
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,340
It's just some...

515
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,960
Fronted by the CIA.

516
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:17,940
Performance art.

517
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,100
Or, uh, is that what it is?

518
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,800
So they can just get up there and act weird and crazy and...

519
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,700
They keep their names down.

520
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,280
That's why they're holding it CIA.

521
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,620
You see, it's a subnemonic mnemonic.

522
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,600
That's what you remember.

523
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,380
When it comes up later, they took your name down.

524
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,220
Come out.

525
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,700
Come out and be seen and have your picture taken.

526
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,060
Bye.

527
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,740
Bye.

528
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:48,220
I want to hear some pervert music!

529
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,160
I have two favorite words.

530
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,080
Horny and orgasm.

531
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:16,000
Well, what's wrong with saying chick, chick, chick, chick?

532
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:21,700
I was horny up against a chick when I went to see Ozzy Osbourne.

533
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,100
I'm just kidding.

534
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:29,080
But, I was horny up against a chick when I went to see a punk rock band called The Accused.

535
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,840
I positioned myself in a big crowd.

536
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,300
Up against her.

537
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,900
Got close to where she was.

538
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,300
Positioned my leg up against hers.

539
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,700
She turned around and looked at me once but didn't really pay attention.

540
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,820
I think it was much of anything.

541
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:49,620
But then I went and told a couple guys that knew who she was.

542
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,500
I was horny up against her.

543
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:56,480
And it must have gotten back at her because one day when I was walking around at the mall,

544
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,460
she gave me a funny look.

545
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,180
Horny with two smother-me chicks.

546
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,820
What's a smother-me?

547
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,500
A smother-me chick.

548
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,880
I'm a squeaky voice.

549
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:14,820
Perfect!

550
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,160
Dang me. Dang me.

551
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,500
They ought to take a rope and hang me.

552
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,180
High from the highest tree.

553
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,320
Woman, would you wait for me.

554
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,940
Mmm, ding-a-meem.

555
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,280
Ding-a-meem.

556
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,320
They oughta...

557
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,240
I thought I was gonna...

558
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,180
I thought I was gonna...

559
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,980
High from the highest tree.

560
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,500
Woman, would you wait for me.

561
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,700
Whoa, friends.

562
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,400
Who says white people don't have rhythm?

563
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,360
That was an excerpt from the Joe tape.

564
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:03,280
One of the four Joe tapes that we know of by Joe Offricht

565
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,800
of the Temple of the Dead.

566
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:09,080
of Dionysus Sabazio, of which he is the cult leader.

567
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,860
He claims that he has a dozen members,

568
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:20,400
but those members may be members like we are of his fan club

569
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,140
in that we may be listening to his tapes

570
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:30,340
and laughing at them in a different way than Joe intends.

571
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:34,340
But does that make Joe any less bulldada,

572
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,280
as we say in church jargon?

573
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,540
Nay, I think not.

574
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,980
I think, in fact, that it makes Joe all the more bulldada.

575
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:47,020
And if there's anything we've ever played on this show

576
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:52,540
over the 15 years, 10 years, something like that,

577
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,900
I can't even remember.

578
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,280
It's been so long we've been doing this show.

579
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,140
We've rarely played anything

580
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,320
with quite so much of a presence.

581
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,340
We've never had so much potential to offend

582
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,760
as the Joe Offrecht tape.

583
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,300
But by the same token, you know,

584
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:13,600
for some of us, that stuff's real, real funny

585
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,520
because we're real, real sick, man.

586
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,720
We're sick.

587
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:22,140
We vomit on Christmas, as Janer used to say.

588
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,180
Well, I believe now it's time to go to side two of show

589
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,760
or we'll be soon.

590
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,860
So what?

591
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,140
What is that?

592
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,380
Well, let's see what Joe has to say.

593
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:33,960
Yeah.

594
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,220
Joe Offrecht is perhaps...

595
00:29:59,220 --> 00:29:59,780
Is he...

596
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,280
Is he...

597
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:00,320
Is he...

598
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,400
Is he a madman or is he the only free man among us?

599
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,860
Listen to this.

600
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,660
I mean, as Bleepo Abernathy said,

601
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,880
it's like a tape you might have made when you were 13

602
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,700
but would be horrified to find that anybody knew about it.

603
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,020
And yet this guy just sells his tape.

604
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,160
Pretty cool spur.

605
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,560
Oh, the moon shines tonight.

606
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,060
I'm pretty cool.

607
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,180
You're a覺得 cool.

608
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,040
Thank you, Joe.

609
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,260
Thank you, Joe.

610
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,960
Thank you.

611
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,180
Thank you.

612
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,620
Thank you.

613
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,700
Thank you.

614
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:58,060
Look, that eight-year-old, some genius children.

615
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,220
Little girls that came up to me,

616
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,720
And they said, Reverend Stank, who do we hate in that swing?

617
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,560
And I said, why, girls, of course you know we hate them!

618
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:17,800
The authors, the mediocrities, the pink boys and false prophets,

619
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:22,880
the barbies and cans, the soft aculacs, the cage dwellers,

620
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,640
the sheep in wolves' clothing.

621
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:29,360
And wouldn't you rather be a wolf in sheep's clothing, dear friends?

622
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,320
I certainly would.

623
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,040
What we hate, I told those little girls,

624
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:37,160
is the normal, ordinary, garden-variety human beings.

625
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:42,180
And among them, the ones we hate most are our rival religious nuts.

626
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,500
Because, you know, those folks love to talk about how they love God.

627
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,580
Oh, yeah, they love God.

628
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,900
But you know what they really love?

629
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,240
What they really love is the idea of you and me going to hell

630
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,700
and burning for eternity.

631
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,500
And those little girls said, yes, that's right, Reverend Stank.

632
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,720
And Bob shall come and slay them all

633
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,940
and harvest their souls on next day

634
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,020
when the aliens come to save us.

635
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:10,840
Praise Bob.

636
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,260
But, you know, it's true.

637
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:17,000
The normal, smug yuppies and po-bucker nutsies

638
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,100
that are seemingly shopping all around you

639
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,660
in those swank strip malls and so forth

640
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,960
actually form a vast,

641
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,340
conspiracy against you.

642
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,420
Yes.

643
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,760
Yes, the pigs.

644
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,580
The stinking pigs.

645
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,200
The humans.

646
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,740
You know, even though they are,

647
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,440
but bovine, mindless stereotypes,

648
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,620
actual living stereotypes,

649
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,880
as dumb as they are yet,

650
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,360
they could destroy the world.

651
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,760
Now, you think about it,

652
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,940
I'm sure that many of you, just like myself,

653
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,540
you read the paper or look at the news at night,

654
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,160
and this world looks like,

655
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,020
it's going to shit.

656
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,560
Well, think how bad things are now.

657
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,860
Think what they aren't telling you.

658
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,700
And meanwhile, they're calling,

659
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,440
they say, they like to say that

660
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,380
the church of the subgenius is a cult.

661
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,340
A scary cult.

662
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,140
Like those dangerous, branch-shaped idiots.

663
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,420
Oh, no, we'll have to send the army in to stop them.

664
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,100
Oh, it's a terrifying thing.

665
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,980
I ask you, dear friends,

666
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,480
isn't your job a cult?

667
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,140
Isn't your job a cult?

668
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,880
If they can get you to work yourself to death

669
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,780
on something you don't even care about,

670
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,980
how is that any different from Jim Jones

671
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,140
talking 900 people into killing themselves?

672
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,480
Now, all we're trying to do is talk 9 million people

673
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,460
into sending us $30 a piece.

674
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,240
I don't think that's so much to ask.

675
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,900
And another thing, these unrivaled cults like to,

676
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,900
oh, they like to worry about family value.

677
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,760
Family value.

678
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,080
You have a breakdown of the American family.

679
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,340
They say, and they're right.

680
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,340
They are absolutely right about that.

681
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,080
The American family is breaking down.

682
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,520
But they say it's because of a bunch of pornography

683
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,860
on the internet,

684
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,140
or half-naked girls prancing around on MTV,

685
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,220
or stupid, sexy gag sitcoms like Married with Children.

686
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,380
I'll tell you what,

687
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:18,240
the American family today is 9 to 5 jobs.

688
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,120
That's right.

689
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,660
God, kids these days,

690
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,020
this poor little kid gets up,

691
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:25,380
they wake up in the morning,

692
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,340
their mom and dad gives them,

693
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,100
if they got both,

694
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,080
gives them kind of a simultaneous hello and goodbye,

695
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,060
and head off to work.

696
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,140
Drop the kid off with some robots or scarecrows

697
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,260
at the daycare center.

698
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,260
I sympathize.

699
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,300
Not trying to lay a guilt trip on you,

700
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,320
but then, you know, mom and dad come home

701
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,540
about 7 o'clock after a long drive back on the freeway,

702
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,440
pissed off, probably drunk,

703
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:50,700
and they give those kids a little peck on the cheek,

704
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,940
kind of a simultaneous hello and goodnight.

705
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,120
And they say that pornography is a crime.

706
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,180
He is up the family.

707
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,500
Bob Dobbs says,

708
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,700
legalize pornography and ban work.

709
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,580
This is a war, dear friends.

710
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,320
It is a war.

711
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,440
It is us versus them.

712
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,560
This is the last ditch battle for the mind.

713
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,740
It's the last final resistance against creepy normality.

714
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,280
And I got some news for you, some sad news.

715
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,040
Belief in some old man with a long, white beard.

716
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,120
Some Disneyland up in the clouds.

717
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,420
Ain't gonna save you.

718
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,240
Most of you probably figured that out already,

719
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,880
but for those who haven't, I'll prove it.

720
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:35,680
God.

721
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,360
God.

722
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,060
God, wherever.

723
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,740
God, I dare you to kill me.

724
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,360
I've been doing that every night for a couple of weeks now.

725
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,320
I'm gonna do it again and again and again.

726
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,060
That's an old atheist trick.

727
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,220
It always works that way.

728
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,120
But now you're saying, well, that's a bummer, man.

729
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,700
Who's gonna save us?

730
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,040
Who's gonna save us?

731
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,600
Well, you know, Moses parted the Red Sea.

732
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,360
Oppenheimer split the atom.

733
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,660
But J.R. Bob Dobbs cut the crap.

734
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,040
Now speaking of cutting the crap, speaking of cutting the crap, if we could cut the,

735
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,300
let's cut this showbiz crap for a second.

736
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,260
Just shut off that video.

737
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:24,340
I'm gonna cut it.

738
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:24,340


739
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:24,340


740
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:24,340


741
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:24,340


742
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:24,340


743
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:24,340


744
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:24,340


745
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:24,340


746
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:24,580
This is what I'm gonna do.

747
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:24,580


748
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,180
TV will rot your mind.

749
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,460
Ain't it wonderful?

750
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:32,680
And Brother Cleveland could kind of keep it kind of a low, blue thing, kind of, because,

751
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,400
because friends, I have a, I have a confession to make.

752
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,800
Now I've been doing, what I've just been doing is what I call Subjeetius 101.

753
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,980
It's just a good little quick introduction to the church and so forth.

754
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,160
I'm sick of doing it.

755
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,160
And I've got, so I've just got to get straight with you about something.

756
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,320
Now, for, especially for you church old-timers.

757
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:54,320


758
00:36:54,320 --> 00:37:00,540
You may be surprised to learn that some mornings, all too many mornings, I get up and I look

759
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:06,720
in the mirror and I say to myself, Reverend Stang, you're an idiot.

760
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:13,800
I say, Reverend Stang, you have been busting your ass for 15 years for slack.

761
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,080
Makes a lot of sense now, don't it?

762
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:22,040
Man, you've been busting your ass for 15 years on an anti-religion religion.

763
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,300
Oh, but that wasn't bad.

764
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,260
That wasn't crazy enough.

765
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:32,740
It also had to be an anti-art, art project and an anti-science, scientific experiment.

766
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:40,200
But, as if that wasn't stupid enough, it also had to be an anti-business, business.

767
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,680
And look what it got you.

768
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,760
I say to myself, you look like a bum.

769
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,960
You're addicted to some weird Tibetan herb.

770
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,100
You haven't had a normal job in years.

771
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,420
You don't even own a tie.

772
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:57,080
And you haven't exactly given your kids their choice of colleges.

773
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:02,340
And on top of that, your wife thinks you might well be completely insane.

774
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,940
Friends, have you ever had the blues?

775
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,140
I mean the serious, serious blues.

776
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,320
Where you felt truly, totally and utterly slack.

777
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,600
Where you felt like everybody was out to get you and they were all assholes.

778
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,880
Have you ever felt that way?

779
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:26,980
If you haven't felt that way, then you are probably not a sub-genius.

780
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:37,060
Now, people come to these devivals, some people come to these things, frankly because they are damaged people and they need slack.

781
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:42,060
Others come because everybody else around them is damaged and they need slack.

782
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:46,280
But either way, you feel kind of alone.

783
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:51,280
It can be a cold and hard thing, friends, you know, to be...

784
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,180
But I'll tell you something.

785
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,200
I got news for you.

786
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,960
You are alone.

787
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,080
We are not going to bullshit you about that.

788
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,520
This is not...

789
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,460
We are not even gathering together here to all be alone together.

790
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,000
Like some cutesy little damn new age pink boy nerd support group.

791
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:14,360
No!

792
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,160
No, sir!

793
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,540
And besides, you know, think about it.

794
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,440
Look around at your fellow sub-genius types around here.

795
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:29,180
Do you really want companionship with these sub-genius ne'er-do-wells in Noah's Ark?

796
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,840
Chances are, chances are you just as soon be left alone.

797
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,440
You just want more options.

798
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:42,500
And you lucky bastards, that's just what J.R. Bob Dobbs is good for.

799
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,380
Because...

800
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:48,260
You can be alone with Bob!

801
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,740
You can be alone with Bob.

802
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:59,880
As a matter of fact, Bob Dobbs is probably the only personal saver that you can be alone with.

803
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,040
He and most all those other personal savers are always following you around, breathing down your neck.

804
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,220
They're always watching you.

805
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,160
They're always going, oh, did you sin too much today?

806
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,100
Does everybody think you're cool?

807
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:17,740
Are you going to be able to make them bill payments this month?

808
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,480
Did you remember to kiss my ass?

809
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:26,700
With Bob Dobbs, you do not have to worry about any of that because Bob Dobbs doesn't care!

810
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:34,760
Bob Dobbs does not give a good golly gosh darn about your pathetic failures and sins.

811
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,980
He does not even care if you kiss his ass.

812
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,420
He does care about your money.

813
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,340
But your sins, he doesn't even care.

814
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,860
He doesn't even consider them worth forgiving.

815
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,240
However, friends, he will justify your sins.

816
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:55,560
He does bring an excuse and that is why, late at night, when I look in that mirror again,

817
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,120
I say to myself,

818
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,940
Yes, you're a idiot, Reverend Stank!

819
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,480
Praise Bob!

820
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:05,720
I say, yes, you've been busting your ass for 15 years on an anti-religion religion,

821
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,240
an anti-art science, an anti-science art, and even an anti-business business!

822
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,080
Praise Bob!

823
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:15,040
And I say, yes, you look like a bum!

824
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:15,740
Praise Bob!

825
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,140
Yes, you're a prop addict!

826
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:17,840
Praise Bob!

827
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,000
No, you haven't had a normal job in years!

828
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,200
No, you don't own a tie!

829
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:22,780
Praise Bob!

830
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:28,680
And I say, no, your kids don't need their minds destroyed by college anymore than you do!

831
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,320
Praise Bob!

832
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:35,020
And most of all, I say to myself, no, I am not insane!

833
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,380
Everybody else is!

834
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,120
Praise Bob!

835
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:47,460
And I say, if they can't take a joke, that is a true thing right here,

836
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:52,740
if they can't take a joke, and they sound harsh, but that's about the only thing,

837
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,080
that's the only philosophy you can live by, dear friends.

838
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:01,940
So don't worry about failure in the conspiracy world.

839
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:06,940
Oh, they'll try to humiliate you night and day, but that's only because they lack

840
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:10,560
the sublime cosmic knowledge of the forbidden sciences.

841
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:18,060
By which we know that the only thing that never fails is failure, the only thing that

842
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:23,180
never works is perfection, and the only workable philosophy is...

843
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,420
If they can't take a joke, thank you very much.

844
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:32,160
Now, the conspiracy tries to tell you that a failed experiment is somehow bad.

845
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:39,940
They try to convince you that you're a loser if you're not rich and cute or smart, and

846
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:45,420
worst of all, they try to make you think that it is somehow unhealthy to be depressed,

847
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:55,980
pessimistic, occasionally consumed with hate, and blundering around seeking slack in strange places, dear friends.

848
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:04,060
But those are actually perfectly appropriate responses to a world that is so f***ed up

849
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:08,180
that even the Church of the Subgenius makes sense by comparison.

850
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:10,880
That's f***ed up, man.

851
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:11,940
Ready, Bob!

852
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:24,180
The idea that it's somehow normal for everything to always be all cheery and lovey and hunky-dory and slackful,

853
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,200
that is a lie!

854
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,100
It is a black lie.

855
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:33,580
They act like the world already is that way so that you'll stop trying to make it that way!

856
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:37,440
Because that makes it look kind of lazy and stupid now, doesn't it?

857
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:43,940
And that's why I like that old bumper sticker slogan that I invented the other night that goes,

858
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:47,540
I'd rather be killing optimists.

859
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:52,940
Because that way leads to a life of quiet desperation.

860
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:59,180
We subgeniuses prefer a life of ear-splitting desperation, dear friends!

861
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,800
We must have slack!

862
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:07,220
We must have slack when we are getting forced to bed a gross path of...

863
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,400
of false slack!

864
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:14,440
We are being ripped off every day and we're not going to sit around being polite while we're being f***ed!

865
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,840
And you know when they won't let you have the slack that you need,

866
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:24,260
have they given you any choice but to obtain slack through hate?

867
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:31,020
Because you think that the Christians, our dear friends the Christians and the New Agers,

868
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,840
they like to channel their false love.

869
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,420
And that works fine for them.

870
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,400
Since they comprise 95% of the overpopulation.

871
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:45,340
But by the same token, we subgeniuses choose to channel our hate!

872
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:52,740
Yes, we tap into that pure primal hate force of the universe, dear friends.

873
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,960
And we transmute it from stupidity into slack.

874
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,580
Just like I have to transmute it from my mood from stupidity into slack as the day wears on.

875
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:07,400
Even though, of course, as you know, slack is the inner force.

876
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,920
The energy that powers the universe.

877
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:16,940
It is also true that tiny, invisible, seething, self-contained hate particles

878
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:21,780
form the hidden matter, the missing matter of the universe,

879
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,300
the hidden mass for which quantum physicists still search.

880
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:31,300
Hate and failure are part of nature, my friends,

881
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,980
and they can be unsuspected paths to slack.

882
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,380
Now, the life of a...

883
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,340
of a subgenius, marooned as we are in a sea of...

884
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:42,940
humans...

885
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,020
It can be... it can be kind of rough.

886
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,060
Now, some of you may think,

887
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,000
but how can you say that, Reverend Stang?

888
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:54,540
I always figured the subgenius preachers had the second best job next to Bob Dobbs.

889
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:58,400
Preaching to drunk sinners in nightclubs night after night.

890
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,640
And there's quite a fair degree of slack in that.

891
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,660
But still, friends, I will be the first to admit

892
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:09,480
that devoting your heart, mind, and soul to Bob Dobbs

893
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,440
will not solve all your problems.

894
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,980
But it will help you to blow them off!

895
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:23,340
And sometimes when it gets that bad, that's what must come first.

896
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:30,160
Besides, you know, you may have no inkling yet what slack really is for you.

897
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,380
You may think you do.

898
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,560
No, if I had such and such, then I'd have slack.

899
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:38,740
Oh, if she loved me, then I'd have slack.

900
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:39,940
Oh yeah.

901
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:45,000
And friends, you start working too hard for slack.

902
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:48,200
Now, I'm as guilty... I've been as guilty of this as anybody.

903
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,500
I've been through a serious set of...

904
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,900
Well, I'll explain how this works.

905
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:57,740
You end up... you got this thing that you think is going to bring you slack.

906
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,300
Some project, some lifestyle, some something

907
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,340
that you want to get done.

908
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,640
And you start working on it, working on it.

909
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:07,940
And it's slack when you're working on it, because it's not a conspiracy.

910
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:12,360
But you build up to an obsessed fever pitch,

911
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,500
reaching for that gold ring,

912
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:18,160
trying to smoke the pot of slack at the end of the rainbow.

913
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,640
And you OD!

914
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,300
It backfires!

915
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,200
The snowball starts rolling back down on top of you.

916
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:32,500
And friends, that's when J.R. Bob Dobbs steps into your life and saves your ass.

917
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:33,660
What?

918
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,840
And he doesn't do it by answering your prayers.

919
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:36,600
Nay, no sir.

920
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,500
He doesn't even pay any attention to your prayers.

921
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,300
He does it by totally f***ing you up!

922
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:41,760
Yeah!

923
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:43,640
Now let me explain.

924
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,020
What he does, and he doesn't do this deliberately.

925
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:48,700
This is just the sort of thing that happens around Bob.

926
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,660
He has to get his perfect slack from somewhere.

927
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,000
So he makes everything break down.

928
00:47:55,140 --> 00:48:00,580
Suddenly there's this whole string of terrible failures, disappointments, disasters.

929
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,800
You know, it might be your health.

930
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,720
Your sweetie throws you out.

931
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:06,540
Your cars break down.

932
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:09,500
You lose your actual good job.

933
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,860
Both your dogs get sick at once.

934
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:16,160
And whatever it is, a whole bunch of sh** happens.

935
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,220
And your cherished plants are shot to hell.

936
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,340
And there's nothing you can do.

937
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,920
Your hands are tied.

938
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:27,160
And best of all, it's not your fault.

939
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,120
And you're slow.

940
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:33,080
And you look down at that treadmill you've been on.

941
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,400
And it's broken down.

942
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,900
There's smoke pouring off of it.

943
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,420
And it's all been for nothing.

944
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,360
It's all been for nothing!

945
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:45,060
And suddenly, the grin of Bob slowly creeps over your face.

946
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,640
Because at that moment, Bob has enlightened you.

947
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:49,400
Yes!

948
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,360
You suddenly say to yourself,

949
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,880
Praise Bob!

950
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:57,640
Everything went totally to sh** in the very nick of time!

951
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,940
Now I can relax!

952
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,020
In fact, I have to relax!

953
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,360
I guess I'll go see a movie or something.

954
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,620
And then you go,

955
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:07,260
Well, that's funny.

956
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,360
Now that I've calmed down,

957
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,120
I'm suddenly able to see the incredibly simple solution

958
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,420
to that seemingly insurmountable problem that I was struggling with.

959
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,820
And it was in front of my dumbass face the whole time!

960
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:24,580
Why, that glass, it wasn't half empty after all.

961
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,340
It was half full.

962
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,000
And besides, I was looking at somebody else's face!

963
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:42,420
And that's what you do when you don't know what you think.

964
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:46,120
WIRELESS John

965
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:46,580
To your right.

966
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:46,580


967
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:47,120
Neither.

968
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,100
Okay.

969
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,580
kind of slack you had in mind.

970
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,860
Uh-uh. In fact, you could almost

971
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:05,300
call it forced slack.

972
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,880
Shove down your crawl

973
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,900
against your will for

974
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,180
your own good by Bob.

975
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,740
But, yes, it is true

976
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:15,920
slack all the same. It may whoop

977
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,940
you upside the head like a mugger

978
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,840
sneaking up behind you in a dark alley.

979
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,780
But, if it knocks you off that

980
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:24,000
treadmill of false slack, then you better be thankful

981
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,920
for it, my friend.

982
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:27,980
Because, you know, you can't know what

983
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,920
slack is until you got it. And you

984
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,780
can't share it, or

985
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:33,800
we prefer to say invest it

986
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,600
until you have it.

987
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:37,140
And your slack

988
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:39,160
must come first.

989
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,880
Don't feel guilty if you

990
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,100
can't deliver slack to

991
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,900
your friends around you. If you don't have it yourself,

992
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,260
you've got to get it first.

993
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,640
It may not be what the

994
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,800
conspiracy, or for that matter, the

995
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,840
church of the subgenius made you think

996
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,740
it was. That's between you and Bob.

997
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:57,860
As Bob Dobbs

998
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:58,180
said,

999
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,860
you will pay

1000
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:03,740
to know what you really

1001
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:05,820
think. And we

1002
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:07,600
will sell you the knowledge

1003
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,040
of what you truly believe.

1004
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:11,620
And I'll tell you what I believe.

1005
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,840
In fact, I'm going to cut all

1006
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,200
the bullshit and tell you

1007
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,900
God's honest truth, what's in my

1008
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,720
heart right now. What I truly

1009
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:20,140
believe.

1010
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,640
I believe I'm going to get off this stage

1011
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,180
and smoke me a damn prop stick.

1012
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,680
Repent. Quit your job.

1013
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:30,840
Slack off.

1014
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,460
You have been driven to the brink of insanity

1015
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:34,180
by the conspiracy.

1016
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,520
I'm going to cut

1017
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:37,920
everything.

1018
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,440
Bob is your only

1019
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,720
hope. You're a lot

1020
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,220
closer than you even think.

1021
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,680
Bob is the way. Bob is

1022
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,520
the path. Believe or

1023
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,140
die.

1024
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,120
Bob is not the answer.

1025
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,240
And neither is anything else.

1026
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,660
Bob. Screw

1027
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,660
Bob. What did he know?

1028
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,700
Don't believe anything Bob tells you.

1029
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:05,240
Blast for the heap of the anti-Bob.

1030
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:06,600
That's right. Bob is a

1031
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,780
loser. Bob ripped me off for all

1032
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:10,520
my slack. Bob is a

1033
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,340
big boy. Bob is a big

1034
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,560
boy. Bob just takes it off

1035
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,440
himself. He gets all the women.

1036
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,660
He gets all the rock. He gets all

1037
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,060
the slack. Bob

1038
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,240
Gilbo.

1039
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,280
Gilbo.

1040
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,120
Gilbo. Gilbo.

1041
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:27,200
Gilbo.

1042
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:28,500
Gilbo.

1043
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,100
Bob is a conspiracy

1044
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,580
Nazi. Bob faked his own

1045
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:34,160
crucifixion to lead to be resurrected

1046
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,920
and become your personal savior.

1047
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,680
Bob is in the back of his limo right now

1048
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,960
getting ahead from your girlfriend.

1049
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,580
Grab your favorite Tom Club and whack

1050
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:44,120
his head off. Whack it!

1051
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:46,560
And place it in the trophy cage right

1052
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,660
next to the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

1053
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,560
That's right. Bob is a sinner

1054
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,480
just like you. The second

1055
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,960
coming to Bob will be a slaughter.

1056
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,520
With the Bob's from a day of Bob Dobbs

1057
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,160
leading the flock. Bob!

1058
00:52:59,300 --> 00:52:59,980
Gilbo!

1059
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:02,800
Gilbo!

1060
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,200
Gilbo!

1061
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:07,220
Gilbo!

1062
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:08,380
Gilbo!

1063
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:09,840
Gilbo!

1064
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,240
Gilbo!

1065
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:12,540
Gilbo!

1066
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,980
Bob! Forgive me Bob!

1067
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,560
Oh Bob! I have sinned against you!

1068
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,500
I was possessed by the anti-Bob!

1069
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,380
Please forgive me!

1070
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,180
Please Bob!

1071
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:26,500
Please Bob!

1072
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:30,000
Please Bob!

1073
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:35,340
Please Bob! Please Bob! Please Bob! Please Bob!

1074
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,320
If they would love him

1075
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,020
much to do funny, we would never have any problem.

1076
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,560
He is the king of all kings!

1077
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:05,160
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1078
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:09,280
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

1079
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:11,920
send a self-addressed stamped envelope to...

1080
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:12,840
Got your pencil ready?

1081
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:19,260
Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1082
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:26,360
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1083
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:29,240
Stay tuned and praise Bob!

1084
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,500
So the conspiracy wants to keep you on either side of that fence?

1085
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,740
I'm not going down in that radio sewer! I don't care! I want my money!

1086
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,240
Paul, here, we'll show you. The Church of the Subgenius wants you to straddle that fence.

1087
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,300
Paul, here, we'll show you. The Church of the Subgenius wants you to straddle that fence.

1088
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:52,480
Stop pulling smoke!

1089
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,920
Well, Glass Madness, then, exactly how do they get the fur out of their teeth?

1090
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,400
There is no fur. The guinea pigs remove it.

1091
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,620
They have a tiny, tiny zipper that a person can't remove,

1092
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:04,100
but the guinea pig, in his own free will, can show you where the zipper is and take it off.

1093
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:08,000
Well, the incoming shells, you can see a few mortars are hitting around the edge of the studio now.

1094
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,660
Well, a few more incoming shells here.

1095
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:13,380
Well, we do have a few mortar attacks occasionally at Green Hill.

1096
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:17,840
It can be tough, and of course, the Bolivian Army uses the roads to practice their mortar shell attacks on,

1097
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,180
and it can make it really hard.

1098
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:22,800
They do. They put tiny faces on the trees of the Yocatisma.

1099
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,320
In fact, whoops, watch out, that was coming pretty close.

1100
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:26,140
Okay.

1101
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:29,220
Don't worry. The studio's protected.

1102
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:31,600
This glass in front of me is bulletproof, is that true?

1103
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:31,920
Right, right.

1104
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:38,200
Now, high above Green Hill, the doctors discuss exactly what happened on Earth so long ago.

1105
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:40,200
...turning them out, and you see life the way it was.

1106
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:45,380
As the bus stops on the side of the road, an Inca family rushes to dress into a small, pint-sized dollhouse.

1107
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:49,100
The child of Inca robes with hats and silently sits, irresistibly,

1108
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,320
offering you a light bulb for pictures to pose.

1109
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:55,440
The llamas, of course, wound up by tiny keys in the back of their rear quarters,

1110
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,660
buzz happily around the grounds.

1111
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:01,940
In time, slack will be dispensed by machines on campuses

1112
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:05,540
and close at hand to educational institutions of all kind.

1113
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,800
Into the pit of silence.

1114
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:14,520
We ask ourselves, along the River of Holy Addresses,

1115
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:18,120
is the band that dare not speak their name, and why can't you by their record?

1116
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,020
Well, we don't know.

1117
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:21,920
We don't know, Doctor, but we've been able to open up the experiment and get the funding we needed,

1118
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,400
so we thought we'd show you this dance that they do here, outside the Mimico Caves.

1119
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,000
Blue, the color of the non-band church.

1120
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,900
I don't care if this is a stupid radio show, I'm still not going down there.

1121
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:36,420
Well, Doctor, how do you think the monster can be excited to come toward the electrical field?

1122
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:40,840
The monster must be stimulated first, by every means known to science.

1123
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:41,400
Hmm, yes.

1124
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,380
Ah, yes, let's tickle its underside here.

1125
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,880
No! I absolutely forbid it!

1126
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:48,920
Well, I'm an American, and you can't tell me what to do.

1127
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:52,980
I'm going to tickle the bottom of this monster, and then I'm getting in my plane and going back.

1128
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,400
Too many Americans behave like this overseas.

1129
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:56,980
Now, give me that monster!

1130
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:57,500
Oh!

1131
00:56:58,180 --> 00:56:59,620
And once again here...

1132
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:00,860
Not the Guibo Costas.

1133
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,200
Yes, the Guibo Costas. You've seen them before.

1134
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:08,080
And then, of course, there is the sacred stone of the S-lalalalala!

1135
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:19,000
Yes, carved out of one hideous block of stone, this reproduction of a 1953 Chevrolet was apparently carved by the Incas thousands of years before General Motors ever even knew what they were.

1136
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:19,900
A wheel was.

1137
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:24,900
Okay, and now, here comes your heliopter to lift you high into green hell.

1138
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:30,620
Looking down into the valley, you can see the beautiful, lush tropical groves, as bromeliads of all varieties are floating down from the cliffs.

1139
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,980
Look at those beautiful orchids, and the ferns bigger than a Volkswagen.

1140
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,940
Yes, friends, this is it.

1141
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,640
The land where the Incas became bigger...

1142
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,320
Than you.

1143
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:39,740
Than you.

1144
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:45,480
That's right. You thought you were the most advanced civilization that's ever hit this planet? Well, blow it out your kawoozie, buddy.

1145
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:47,640
I demand the right to see the monster right now.

1146
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,000
You can't hide it.

1147
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:49,000


1148
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,300
You can't hide this creature from me all night.

1149
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:55,780
This monster is the property of the American people, and I'll thank you to take your hands off it.

1150
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:58,660
Look, they look more like claws. What is this, anyway?

1151
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,100
Yes, I own everything now.

1152
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:03,160
Wait, they've got Dino Boy tied up in the station.

1153
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:03,580
Yes.

1154
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:04,000
Oh, no!

1155
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,520
Dr. Cabot family, he's mine now. I keep him like this.

1156
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,400
You fiend!

1157
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:13,480
Yes, I must do this. I must. Bob tells me.

1158
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:14,880
Please let me go! Help me, Bob! Help me!

1159
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,080
Bob tells me. That thing...

1160
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,840
The thing that only a few weeks ago we...

1161
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:18,520
We are all friends.

1162
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:18,980
Bob tells me. That thing...

1163
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,520
Help me, Palmer! They're trying to get this...

1164
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,780
Yes, that all over now.

1165
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,340
I want my share of the money!

1166
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:23,680


1167
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:27,160
See? All monsters want the same thing.

1168
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:33,280
Having already received more than his fair share of the money, Dr. Friedius is screaming weanling for more.

1169
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:37,500
We have no need to discuss such confidential information on this radio show.

1170
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:42,040
We do not discuss Dr. Friedius' very, very private business on television.

1171
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:42,580
There's... There's Funto out there!

1172
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:45,660
I mean, on the radio. We know not talk about such things.

1173
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:46,180
Quiet, everybody!

1174
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:46,960
I'm heavy.

1175
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,500
Funto was just outside the ship.

1176
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:48,980
No, no, no. Come on.

1177
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:51,420
Meanwhile, poor little Gary trapped on a chair.

1178
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:55,720
These decomposers, as we call them in the destructuralization age.

1179
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,100
Come here, little one.

1180
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:57,900
Hello!

1181
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:57,900


1182
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:04,960
Here the Asian Indians blow psychedelic snuff up their nose from 45-foot pipes they make from bark of trees.

1183
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,520
They call it Yo-Ho-Bo.

1184
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:07,280
Yo-Ho-Bo.

1185
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:07,680
Yo-Ho-Bo.

1186
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:18,340
Yes, friends, that last little bit there was, of course, the puzzling evidence, Dr. Howell subgenius show from KPFA.

1187
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:26,020
In them days, back in November 1983, it had Glass Madness and Gary Gbrogfran and Palmer Vreedes.

1188
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:30,100
It was just the whole band that dare not speak its name.

1189
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:37,060
And it's so fun to occasionally dip back in deep into the archives, heard jiggling around here,

1190
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:40,940
to pry out some of the old stuff.

1191
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:44,120
The old... The old crazy stuff.

1192
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:48,060
Let's see one... Take one last look at what Joe has to sing to us here.

1193
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:52,860
This next one is called the Kindergarten Orgasm Dance.

1194
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:57,440
In the kindergarten I had orgasms.

1195
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,980
Back in the kinder I had orgasms.

1196
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,300
Kindery in the kindery.

1197
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:07,200
Back in the kinder I had orgasms.

1198
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:15,480
Oh, my underwear.

1199
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:17,760
Oh, my underwear.

1200
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:19,900
Oh, my dress.

1201
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:21,900
Oh, my dress.

1202
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:27,500
Oh, and by the way, friends, for those not listening on the internet,

1203
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:33,240
sorry I have to so blatantly cut out the cuss words and so clumsily.

1204
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:42,920
But that's the kind of equipment and time and laws, conspiracy laws, that we have to deal with here

1205
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,980
at Post Office Box 1403-06, Dallas, Texas 7524.

1206
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,120
And I guess that's it for this show.

1207
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:54,240
I'm gonna get up.

1208
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,480
I'm gonna move out of here.

1209
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:56,940
I'm gonna do what I said I was gonna do.

1210
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,660
I'll have a good one.

1211
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:19,220
I'll have a good one.
