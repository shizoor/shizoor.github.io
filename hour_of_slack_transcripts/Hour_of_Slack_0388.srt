1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
When will you believe?

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,040
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,960
I'm gonna bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,720
Materialized.

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,460
The first step is that you make the art.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,260
The second step is that you...

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,140
you mail the art somewhere.

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,920
And then...

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,860
You destroy the art in the mail.

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,720
So that's the key.

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,180
Make the art, destroy the art, claim the art.

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:45,860
You will make much more on that art piece than you would have in any other way.

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,300
Don't you think it would be a good idea for you to turn the radio on?

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,160
Yes.

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,220
If you'll turn the machine on...

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,960
Well, it is a beautiful world out there, all right.

17
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,320
Take, for instance, the city of Chicago earlier this month.

18
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,580
It was filled to overflowing with Wookiees, Warlocks, and Japanese robots

19
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,280
as thousands flocked to the annual World Science Fiction Convention

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,340
at the Hyatt Regency Hotel.

21
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,280
But at the cheaper hotel across the street,

22
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,380
a group of people too weird for most science fiction fans to comprehend

23
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,940
were holding a little convention of their own.

24
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,900
These wackos call themselves the...

25
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,280
First Church of the Subgenius.

26
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,100
And they include in their, to say the least, eccentric membership...

27
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,380
Bob.

28
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,600
Bob Bob.

29
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,380
Bob Bob Bob.

30
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,040
Bob Bob.

31
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,840
Who do they believe in?

32
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,000
A mysterious character named Bob.

33
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,160
Let up your pipe, let go the smoke.

34
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,100
This is slack, it ain't no joke.

35
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,180
Prisby to Bob, lift up your drink.

36
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,900
And you will pay to know what you think.

37
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,040
But he ain't no man, he ain't no god.

38
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,900
I don't wanna walk the path Bob tried.

39
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,940
He ain't no man, he ain't no god.

40
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,040
I don't wanna walk the path Bob tried.

41
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,500
I don't wanna walk the path Bob tried.

42
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:22,840
I don't wanna walk the path Bob tried.

43
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,820
Wow, there's so many colors.

44
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,540
This was the last thing I expected to hear,

45
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,780
because by then we were well aware just how limited

46
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,760
was the number of different sounding synthesizer timbres.

47
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,720
Yet somehow we had pulled a rabbit out of the hat, so to speak,

48
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,080
and created an illusion even good enough to fool Bob,

49
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,860
who knew his instrument very well.

50
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,780
Even now, there is no man alive who believes more devoutly than I do

51
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,460
that they must not reproduce.

52
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,440
They must not reproduce!

53
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,400
They must not reproduce!

54
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,780
This is the beginning of the end of the world.

55
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,460
A world that has no end.

56
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:07,860
A world that will never be interrupted.

57
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:07,860


58
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:07,860


59
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,520
A world that is still.

60
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,020
A world that will never be forgotten.

61
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,900
Welcome ladies and gentlemen to...

62
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,500
...The...

63
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,000
...The...

64
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,140
...The...

65
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,420
...Dream Monitor.

66
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,000
Music.

67
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:21,940
Circle.

68
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,160
In.

69
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,120
...In.

70
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,200
...In.

71
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,180
...In.

72
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:28,180


73
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:28,840
...In.

74
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,260
...In.

75
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,380
...In.

76
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:30,860
...In.

77
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,140
...In.

78
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,440
...In.

79
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,040
...In.

80
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,300
...In.

81
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,060
...In.

82
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,020
...In.

83
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,940
You should just be talking into consciousness now...

84
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,580
...and you just wanna keep still while you warm up.

85
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,540
...and you just wanna keep still while you warm up.

86
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,580
Assuming the system doesn't cut in on us...

87
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:05,920
Assuming the system doesn't cut in on us...

88
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,040
...it ought to take about three minutes from...

89
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,380
...now.

90
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,900
Excuse me.

91
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,000
You heard him.

92
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,340
about how Mighty Mouse was indicted for sniffing cocaine, I suppose.

93
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,480
Yes.

94
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,320
Now, so did...

95
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,980
It's just the sort of thing that we're all so used to in here in the 80s.

96
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,460
Yes, it's the 60s all over again, only more of it.

97
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,840
Yeah, Mighty Mouse, little lights.

98
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,160
And it's all here, available on the show.

99
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,200
Everybody adjust your minds.

100
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,120
Relax and float down the street.

101
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,940
It's showtime.

102
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,460
It's time for that show that's for kids from six to 60.

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,640
Dr. Philo Drummond is our guest.

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,080
Yes, we have Philo Drummond at the end.

105
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,260
We can't hear Dr. Philo.

106
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,340
Dr. Philo, over here.

107
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:53,540
Yes.

108
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,520
Oh, we can.

109
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,400
Oh, never mind.

110
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,660
It doesn't matter.

111
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,760
Nothing matters anymore.

112
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,720
Am I here?

113
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,120
Well, what's your question, caller?

114
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,580
Well, I was just wondering...

115
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,440
You thought Ivan Stang was going to give a better show than we do, huh?

116
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:08,920
Well, I'm not sure.

117
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:08,920


118
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,480
Is that what it boils down to?

119
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,640
Well, you know, you don't have to kid me in a corner about it.

120
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,800
Where's the kill button here?

121
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:14,700
No, no.

122
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,140
Where's the kill button?

123
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,300
It's right over there, doctor.

124
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,000
There, that should teach these callers what happens when they get too big for their butchers.

125
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,420
I was just kidding, caller.

126
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:22,900
I don't...

127
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,700
Too late.

128
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:23,980
Sorry about that.

129
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,700
You snuffed him.

130
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,520
He's gone.

131
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,840
I was just looking around and hit that button.

132
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,060
Well, you just looked at him and he blew up.

133
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,080
I want to clear...

134
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,380
I don't want anybody to think there's any rivalry between Reverend Stang and myself.

135
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,060
Oh, no.

136
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,820
No, no, no.

137
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,840
But, uh...

138
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:38,920
I don't know.

139
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:38,920


140
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:38,920


141
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,760
I mean, there's only so much I can say.

142
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:47,900
My lawyers really caution me not to say very much about the situation because it could

143
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,080
be damaging in the upcoming situation.

144
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:56,340
I won't refer to it or really lead you on as to think it could be anything more than

145
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:56,580
that.

146
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,360
Meow, meow, meow.

147
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,560
Meow, meow, meow.

148
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,840
Look, that one's spraying over the show.

149
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,200
Oh, no.

150
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,740
Oh, no.

151
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:08,900
Oh, no.

152
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:08,900


153
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:08,900


154
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:08,900


155
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:08,900


156
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:08,900


157
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:08,900


158
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:08,900


159
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:08,900


160
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:08,900


161
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:08,900


162
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:08,900


163
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:08,900


164
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:08,900


165
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:08,900


166
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:08,900


167
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:08,900


168
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:08,900


169
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,900
I'm not taking your円.

170
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:38,900


171
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:38,900


172
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,820
atmosphere so sterile of mental stimulation that the child's mind just doesn't grow.

173
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,380
Well, I won't have that.

174
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,360
We're trying to help people here, not make more basket cases.

175
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,640
Now we hear Dr. Philo.

176
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,660
Now we can again.

177
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,800
Yes, our guest.

178
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,700
This year, for a solid year of shows.

179
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,060
You listeners don't know how lucky you are.

180
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,840
And going into infinity.

181
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,360
How he was forced into sex aboard a flying saucer.

182
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,240
And about the result.

183
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,780
We'll be seeing the film of that sex is right.

184
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,820
Ouch.

185
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:23,380
Recently at my local newsstand, I pervaded a magazine and said Elvis Presley is alive

186
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,820
and the sightings have begun.

187
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,640
Are these the sightings that were spoken of in the book of the clone Elvis?

188
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,380
Those are indeed those self-same sightings.

189
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,700
Yes, there's a spore of Elvis.

190
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,120
A smelly trail that we've been following.

191
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,140
Actually, he's in Minnesota from what I understand.

192
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,920
The weekly world news indicated that he was found in Minnesota.

193
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:50,680
He has gone completely bald, which was somewhat dismaying.

194
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,040
Only from a...

195
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,900
Onto a vital world.

196
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,700
What's going on?

197
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:04,860
Some may learn faster than the severely retarded, but they are all under retardation.

198
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,380
Oh.

199
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,040
Oh.

200
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:07,480
Oh.

201
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,800
Who is that baby?

202
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,380
There he is.

203
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,300
He's just a tiny little baby.

204
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:27,300


205
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:27,620
dov, don't vocalize.

206
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,480
He's in corrid.

207
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:28,480


208
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:28,480


209
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:28,480


210
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:28,480


211
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:28,480


212
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:28,940


213
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:30,280


214
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:30,680
Outro?

215
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:30,680


216
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,400
Oh, nobody copies us.

217
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:31,400


218
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,860
belum nonmo.

219
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,800
Now I wet my pants Time is 6BI 0TB

220
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,340
Entry of Noah Safar

221
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:37,340


222
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:37,360
0TB

223
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:37,600
0TB

224
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:37,600


225
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,740
nuclear reactor. Here we pull out the control rods and the graphite blocks do

226
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,200
an inadequate job of absorbing the neutrons which spin out at a kinetic end.

227
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,600
Spinning backwards creating friction, reverse friction. And causing this local

228
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,000
time distortion. Causing the phases to actually burst and fire.

229
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:04,440
Changing economy, one thing's for sure, sales people must be able to deal with all kinds of customers.

230
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,900
All else equal, stand the best chance of hitting your sales target.

231
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,640
There is another world. We are not then alone in our battle.

232
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:23,380
In a country where freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Constitution, anything is likely to develop.

233
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,520
Enter the Church of the Subgenius.

234
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:32,580
The second question is what's happening? Is this a miracle? What kind of a miracle?

235
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,320
Is this a parable?

236
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:40,180
What's the point? Is this a letter? What's the big idea? What's he trying to communicate?

237
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,040
The Church of the Subgenius is what you might call disorganized religion.

238
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,460
We have to make clear from the beginning that we are not really the founders.

239
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:55,240
We were just hired to promote the word of our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

240
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:03,680
Okay, that then brings me to this. It is the Subgenius Foundation is the publishing and PR firm of the Church of the Subgenius.

241
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,420
So would you tell me then what is the Church of the Subgenius?

242
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,940
Bob founded the Church mainly to help unmask the conspiracy.

243
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,720
And we're talking about the conspiracy, the one behind the other conspiracy.

244
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,860
Hear, hear! If you have no goggles, turn away!

245
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:29,080
We know that we've got to have those instruments. They're our only chance.

246
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,340
Dear friends!

247
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:41,480
God in his wisdom put microbes on the earth to give us head colds and to protect us from Martians.

248
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,360
Dear, dear friends.

249
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,520
You...

250
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,760
Excuse me, dear friends.

251
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,720
Beg your pardon, dear friends.

252
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,560
Oh, go ahead.

253
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,860
No, dear friends. You go ahead.

254
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,020
Oh, no. No, dear friends. Let me step aside.

255
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,280
No, no.

256
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,860
Oh, dear, dear friends.

257
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,720
Oh, go ahead.

258
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,700
Oh, my dear friend, I know you've had bad times.

259
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,220
And troubles. And troubles, friend.

260
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,400
Yes, yes. Worried brows.

261
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,680
Burrowed. Burrowed and worn with care.

262
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,820
Burrowed hips. Burrowed thighs.

263
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,300
Thighs covered with the grooves of care.

264
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,700
Ah, it is indeed a sad state.

265
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,140
Oh, indeed. California is its name, friend.

266
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,380
And here we are.

267
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,560
First show on our show. How much show do you want in that, uh... What's that?

268
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,920
How much show do you want?

269
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,880
How much show do you want here?

270
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,200
Oh, I'll take, uh... I'll take two of them.

271
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,020
Pass that show over here.

272
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,080
If Mighty Mouse can do it, so can we.

273
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,240
Hey, caller. Want some show?

274
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,020
I think you have my father there.

275
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,840
Oh, no. That's who this guy is?

276
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,920
Well, you mentioned something about an alien, some sexual experience.

277
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,900
Oh, yeah. Alien sexual experience.

278
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,820
Now, come on. We're none of us that alien.

279
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,700
I'm convinced I am the, um...

280
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,460
You're my daughter?

281
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,100
Yeah.

282
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,660
If she were my daughter...

283
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,180
Daddy!

284
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,240


285
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,520
Daddy!

286
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,320
Hi, daughter.

287
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,060
I know. I was just listening on tetanus speed.

288
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,240
Have you had your tetanus shot?

289
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,340
Yeah, have you had it?

290
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,120
What a wonderful thing.

291
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,360
You know, that's what I sent you out for 12 years ago, and you never returned.

292
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,500
Was that why I was left in Kingston?

293
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,380
Well, I don't know where you actually ended up, you know?

294
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,140
I mean, it was up to you to get out there and get that tetanus shot.

295
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,120
Well, you're the one that dropped me on the planet.

296
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,360
I wouldn't have done it if you hadn't, uh...

297
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,400
You dropped her on the planet, Steve.

298
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,660
Are you the one that was screwing them out, the alien?

299
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,160
Look, those are some aliens over there.

300
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,200
I think we may have a, um, an actual, um...

301
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,880
It's what we call a contactee.

302
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,320
It's either a contactee or it's a total...

303
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,120
Did you say sex aboard a flying saucer?

304
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,340
Yes, according to the...

305
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:49,420
Isn't that what you said?

306
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,080
Whoops, uh...

307
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,840
You said it first, and I think I'm the, uh...

308
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,260
the, uh, outcome of your experiment.

309
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:01,860
You are one of these new race of humanoid-like creatures.

310
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,120
Well, I'm a...

311
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,040
That is... Is that correct?

312
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,800
No, I'm of the old race of humanoid-type creatures.

313
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,640
Oh, the old ones.

314
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,420
They keep sending me back.

315
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,980
It's said that they walk among us.

316
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,860
They go, you don't have to go back, like...

317
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,960
Walk among us. I've had one of those. They're good.

318
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,360
I had three at once one time.

319
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,720
Do you... Does your hair glow in the dark?

320
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,840
Yes, it does. It's so do my eyes.

321
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,240
Just rub some of this under your arms here.

322
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,260
Oh, well, uh...

323
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,100
It feels great.

324
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,120
What's it smell like? I can't see it from here.

325
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:32,820
It's kind of like... Me neither.

326
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,060
Ice blue secret.

327
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,180
Boy, it sure does work.

328
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,560
It's somebody's secret.

329
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,240
Strong enough for a man, but made for a woman.

330
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,120
Well, I think there's three desperately horny men sitting in an itty-bitty studio over there.

331
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

332
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,800
My friends, Bulldada Time Control Laboratories,

333
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,040
in conjunction with the Subgenius Foundation,

334
00:14:54,040 --> 00:15:02,800
in conjunction with Turn My Entire Mind, Soul, and Body Into a Sledgehammer,

335
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,620
Eternally Hammering Against an Anvil of Normalcy,

336
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,920
in conjunction with that thing that had a 7-Eleven for a head...

337
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,920
proudly present the final solution to the entertainment problem.

338
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,320
Ladies and gentlemen, the laziest man in show business,

339
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,020
the godfather of...

340
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,740
the godfather of anti-music,

341
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,900
Mr. Toll the Judge,

342
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,100
the amazing Mr. Me, Me, Me.

343
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,200
My friends, this man needs no introduction.

344
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,020
Ladies and gentlemen, the Jayner device,

345
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,320
alias Jayner Hyperclades.

346
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,080
Come on out here, Jayner. You're beautiful.

347
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,020
Let's have a big hand.

348
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,140
Make my sincerity and humbleness

349
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,120
become the absolute master of the universe.

350
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:01,240
Surely the cattle must bow to my kindness and mercy,

351
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,120
or heads will roll.

352
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,220
Enlarge me.

353
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,240
You've got to turn to J.R. Bob Dobbs tonight, my friends.

354
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,700
He has the power.

355
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,480
But you cannot run from your own legs, my friends.

356
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,520
How are you going to run from your own legs?

357
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:32,320
If you use your own legs to run from them with,

358
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,840
where are you going to run away from?

359
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,940
Never thought of that, did you?

360
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,440
You can't run from your own legs.

361
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,600
You cannot swallow your own throat.

362
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,660
You cannot see your own eye.

363
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,400
You cannot think about your own brain.

364
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,860
That's part of the problem.

365
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,300
You cannot run from your own legs.

366
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,660
You cannot hide from this man, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

367
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,240
because he's stupider than you are.

368
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,940
His face has been mimeographed and put up in more places than yours has.

369
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,460
He smokes more froth than you do.

370
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,640
You cannot hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs.

371
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,220
You cannot hide from God, because he's bigger than you.

372
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,620
He's bigger than all infinity.

373
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,120
He's bigger than all reality.

374
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,300
Help me, somebody.

375
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,760
Preacher, my legs are on fire.

376
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,040
She ain't got no legs.

377
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,560
Pull the lever and down you go.

378
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,800
Enlarge me.

379
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:39,540
Let me tell you the story of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

380
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:44,540
Bread of man and yet he, he walked with the gods.

381
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,000
He wore a silly grin.

382
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,520
And he smoked.

383
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,920
He smoked a stupid pipe.

384
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:55,740
He fought the conspiracy every day of his life.

385
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,780
He wove the stench of many a man.

386
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:09,380
Fathered many children with his mighty glance.

387
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,580
He founded the religion in which we all believe.

388
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,520
Brought us all the slack.

389
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,700
That everybody needs.

390
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:29,960
Bob was the greatest salesman the world had ever seen.

391
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:35,580
He could sell the farts after he ate all the beans.

392
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:40,640
He could sell a pile of sugar to a lonely fly.

393
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:46,340
All of us who knew him figured he would never die.

394
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:56,080
Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs.

395
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,240
He was a real man and brave.

396
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:07,260
Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs.

397
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,460
He's lying dead in his grave.

398
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,640
Without Bob what are we gonna do?

399
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,720
With a man from wedded ex-comerchant.

400
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:28,780
Arnold racist stuck in jail when old Nate Bob raised a bale.

401
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,440
But now he's dead so we're doomed.

402
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,660
What to do?

403
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,020
What to do?

404
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:42,220
He founded the city known as Dobbs Town.

405
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,660
Deep within Malaysia.

406
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,500
It was rarely found.

407
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,800
There he studied forbidden science until that fateful day.

408
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:58,220
When he came unto his flock in the city by the bay.

409
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,280
Few had ever seen him.

410
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,500
Few had ever dared.

411
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,320
Most had no occasion.

412
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,060
Others just plain scared.

413
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:18,620
Hundreds came to Frisco for the event of the age.

414
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:23,920
When the holiest smiling one would step out on the stage.

415
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,400
Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs.

416
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,600
He's gonna ruin the world.

417
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,040
Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs.

418
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,940
To the left and he looked to the right.

419
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,720
They stepped out with confidence into the ride spot.

420
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,880
You can see it!

421
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,460
All the cheering fans as he strode up to the bike.

422
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,180
It's him!

423
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,920
When the great assassin's bullets sent him to his rural grave.

424
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:56,100
Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs.

425
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,220
The crowd saw their savior had come.

426
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:07,060
Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs.

427
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,980
Was greeted by the flash of a gun.

428
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,100
Without Bob we have blood in a fear.

429
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,580
As we swiftly approach that fatal year.

430
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:28,140
For in 1998 he would have set the record straight.

431
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,160
But now he's dead so we're doomed oh my dear.

432
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,960
Well this has been the story of J.R.R.

433
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,200
Bob Dobbs.

434
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,280
Some call him Messiah.

435
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,200
Others call him fraud.

436
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,720
I hope that before 98 that the word gets out.

437
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:57,860
That Bob Dobbs was the only guy we couldn't do without.

438
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,880
The end times are upon us.

439
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,200
And things don't look so good.

440
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,920
Bob Dobbs had the answer but was seldom of us.

441
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,440
We're in a heap of trouble.

442
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,980
Our books are in the red.

443
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,100
There is no joy in Mudville.

444
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,600
Now that Bob is dead.

445
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,240
He's dead!

446
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,720
So we pray to find Jesus.

447
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,840
To do battle for Bob's soul.

448
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,660
We put dog in a pea dog.

449
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,180
For strength that ain't our own.

450
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,620
We pray to he who needs no name.

451
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,760
That we may need no slack.

452
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,500
And we pray to Wotan.

453
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,060
Please send our body back.

454
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,840
Bob Dobbs.

455
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,600
Bob Dobbs.

456
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,580
Our lives are worse without you.

457
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,240
Bob Dobbs.

458
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,420
Bob Dobbs.

459
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,580
Oh dear what will we do.

460
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,040
Without Bob we are in a time fix.

461
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:19,380
When the exes come to kill us just for kicks.

462
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:26,240
If we were not in his grave all these sub-geni would be saved.

463
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,340
But it is so our chances are nicks.

464
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,780
But it is so our chances are nicks.

465
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,000
But it is so our chances are nicks.

466
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,500
But it is so our chances are nicks.

467
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,940
But it is.

468
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,560
But they wrote the script for microbe for Epidemiolaic.

469
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:03,560


470
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:03,560


471
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:03,640
Beauti fact, i forget to tell.

472
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,280
sao that a-

473
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:05,620
Pバイ.

474
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,600
Wowajlords to this.

475
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,040
Slack.

476
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,880
Slack is something we all need,

477
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:22,120
and I know that lots of people out there listening right now

478
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,720
are feeling a terrible shortage of Slack.

479
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,980
A shortage that can be enough of.

480
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,140
That's right, that's right.

481
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,660
And we can help them to get Slack.

482
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:33,220
On this stage in Frisco

483
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,080
Dread doves lay smoking

484
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,220
With eight bullets in his head, man

485
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,000
Dread doves lay smoking

486
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:48,700
Control your strings, put them to use

487
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,400
Five will be your best excuse

488
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,380
Five for me and five for you

489
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,300
No matter what, a little dove will do

490
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,380
But he ain't no man, he ain't no guy

491
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,380
I don't wanna walk the path Bob tried

492
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:12,260
He ain't no man, he ain't no guy

493
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:19,360
I don't wanna walk the path Bob tried

494
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,720
But it's not for, obviously, not for everybody.

495
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,400
I mean, some people, there's gotta be

496
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,120
those that are up in the spaceships laughing

497
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,700
and those that are down below being tortured.

498
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,740
Elsewise, what are the subgeniuses

499
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,360
gonna have to learn?

500
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:34,900
What are they gonna laugh at?

501
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,600
I mean, we ain't been hatin' for all these years for nothin'.

502
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,500
There's gotta be some kind of a reward.

503
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,800
And so what defines a subgenius?

504
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,220
Well, it's abnormality.

505
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,000
Therefore, there's no definition for a subgenius.

506
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:53,400
In fact, if there were a typical subgenius,

507
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,980
then that would best be excommunicated real quick.

508
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,980
Hopefully burned at the sink.

509
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:04,000
Because if any two are alike, one must go.

510
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,860
Or be reprogrammed or deprogrammed.

511
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,380
Either way, bring them back.

512
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,560
So friends, I mean, those of you who really do

513
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,220
are true abnormals, rich or poor, old or young,

514
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,760
hip and groovy and all that,

515
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,720
or just kind of square nerds, doesn't matter,

516
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,980
or whole cowboy types,

517
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,140
don't marry a human, friends.

518
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,600
If you do, don't have kids.

519
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,100
Find that mutant that's meant for you,

520
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,660
and continue to help taint the genetic pool.

521
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:42,300
I mean, we've got to keep doing that,

522
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,000
or the marching morons are gonna take over.

523
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,040
I mean, subgenius is obviously the word.

524
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,320
It doesn't mean geniuses.

525
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,480
It's anything below.

526
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,920
You know what it is.

527
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,180
God, how can I even try to define these things?

528
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,880
Subgeniuses can't be defined,

529
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,360
but the pink boy out there,

530
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,520
oh, you know the pink boy, the pink girl.

531
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,940
Actually, we call them its,

532
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:12,300
the little normally warmlies, you know.

533
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,860
They're powerful because of their numbers,

534
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:20,740
but they're the ones that are stereotypes, friends.

535
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,400
Stereotypes, every one of them a walking stereotype.

536
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,360
The one next to you at work, you know.

537
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,040
Yeah, actually, on most jobs,

538
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,660
the one at the very top is a rogue, unsaved subgenius,

539
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,140
and the janitor is,

540
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,360
but it's the people sort of in between that are,

541
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,920
they're the ones who, they're so dumb,

542
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:46,020
they have power to destroy the world.

543
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,580
That has nothing to do with the day after.

544
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,860
No, but you don't have much time left.

545
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,940
Your weakness from your catatonic state

546
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,080
changes into a giant bat

547
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,540
that flies away into the night,

548
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,340
seeking the only way out.

549
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:03,640
seeking the only way out.

550
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:03,640


551
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,960
Seeking nourishment on which he can survive.

552
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,440
Seeking nourishment on which he can survive.

553
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,400
Human God.

554
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:10,660
Human God.

555
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,620
If I have to witness this one more time,

556
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,440
I think I'll puke.

557
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,800
One of these mornings

558
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,440
Yeah, don't show us the witness any one more time.

559
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,060
Bob comes creepin' in the room

560
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,540
and remove the entire top of the graveyard.

561
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,180
One of these mornings

562
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,800
Okay, now we're taking the top of the head off.

563
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,140
Don't hurt the president.

564
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:35,880
Old Man Bob comes creeping in the morning.

565
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,540
One of these mornings,

566
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,600
Old Man Bob comes creeping in the morning.

567
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,760
We find it out in the morning.

568
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,280
My Lord, my Lord,

569
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,520
what shall I do with you?

570
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,780
What shall I do with you?

571
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,780
Oh, little Bob, little Bobby Dog.

572
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,100
Little City Bob.

573
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,840
He's creeping in the rain.

574
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,800
Little Bobby Dog's creeping around the rain.

575
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,160
Now, if that isn't scary, what is?

576
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,560
Creeping down the drain.

577
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:19,960
But your lawyer won't do you no harm.

578
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,980
What an ugly little Bob.

579
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,080
There's something bad for such a kid.

580
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:28,860
They need to get off.

581
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,340
Oh, no.

582
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:39,080
We have a number of very important goals to accomplish together in this first lesson.

583
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:44,000
Our overall goal, of course, is to get you your all-important first job in radio.

584
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,320
To begin your education in the broadcasting business,

585
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,000
the written text accompanying this recorded lesson

586
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,440
will teach you how radio stations operate

587
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,960
and what will be expected of you in your first job as an announcer.

588
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,860
But before you can get your first job,

589
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,800
your voice must be clear.

590
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,200
You must be trained to a professional level.

591
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,420
As you will see, this involves more than merely strengthening your voice

592
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,620
and increasing its resonance.

593
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,940
In this first lesson, we will teach you how to avoid provincialisms in your speech,

594
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:15,020
how to correct nasality and other voice faults,

595
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,560
and how to develop a new approach toward enunciation of words.

596
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,300
In this lesson, we will give you your first practice in delivering commercial messages.

597
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,160
We will teach you how to announce from written scripts.

598
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,040
We will discuss the most common mistakes in English,

599
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,060
and how to avoid them.

600
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,100
And we will give you the first of several intensive lessons

601
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:37,720
in the correct pronunciations of words which are most often mispronounced

602
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,840
and which you will often find in the process of announcing.

603
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,900
Let's begin.

604
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,040
But before we put your voice to work, do your aah and...

605
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:54,720
I said I wasn't going to rant, but I think this guy's thing...

606
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,820
This is something we just started getting recently.

607
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,020
It's a little news article.

608
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,940
It's a newsletter called Self Reliant Men.

609
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:06,260
And at first, I thought that it was one of these women-hating magazines

610
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,400
like the International Patriarchy.

611
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,620
But it's not.

612
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,920
The reason I thought that is because the guy who does it is very old.

613
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:18,880
It's somebody named S.R. Pohasky, retired captain, U.S. Marine Corps.

614
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,640
And he's like 70 years old.

615
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,100
And it's called Self Reliant Men monthly newsletter.

616
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,840
He wanted to trade magazines with us.

617
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,980
And ours is like 100 pages long.

618
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:33,300
And I glanced at his first issue and thought,

619
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,580
it sounds kind of square.

620
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,640
I don't want to offend this nice old man.

621
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,320
So I wrote him back and said, well, I don't think we want to trade exactly.

622
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,740
So he started sending and he was going, oh, no?

623
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,260
And he starts sending...

624
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,560
I mean, this guy, at 70...

625
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,480
Okay, let's see.

626
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,380
The kingdom of heaven is within you, beloved disciples of awareness,

627
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,260
about whom I carry no attachments,

628
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,820
no caring whether you find the first and final.

629
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,240
Or if you fail yourself and do not find the first and final freedom.

630
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:07,240
Bulk you all in love and respect and agreement

631
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:14,200
under the terms of your privilege to be slave to time and sex pain staining.

632
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,020
Now, he'll say that again.

633
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:17,640
Here it is.

634
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,220
And here's his advice to Self Reliant Men.

635
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,860
Wet, wild, and wonderful, as long as it gets plenty of soap and water,

636
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,120
plenty of warmth and dry habitation,

637
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,820
plenty of endless effort from you,

638
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,320
plenty of time to preserve and protect and defend until death do you part.

639
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,980
And she ends up holding onto the bulk of the fortune of the USA.

640
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,880
The merry widow and her devoted and doting time slave.

641
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,280
These are wonderful times, brothers.

642
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:47,800
Never have the sex pain stainers had so much influence upon what takes place

643
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:52,160
in all the secret places of business, government, industry, church, education, sports, media manipulation.

644
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,400
Pay no attention to the lunger staining her facade.

645
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,760
You know, on Michelle's

646
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,040
300th investigation, quite frankly, she's finally becoming the widow of a new chair.

647
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,040


648
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:11,360
we do love them brothers but we must temper our love with pure unadulterated and impossible to satisfy lust

649
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:19,960
for only by seeing the truth of why you really love her and why you knock yourself out trying to please her

650
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,820
will you start to release

651
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:30,960
she is a trap she is the bait and she is the trap which keeps us all bound to time

652
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:39,240
she is heaven on earth with a hell of a pain stain oozing out from between those great scissor legs

653
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:44,700
now this is a retired U.S. Marine Corps guy

654
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:50,280
now I realize that you're not going to learn and change your behavior until you feel the truth

655
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:55,360
so get out there and get all these experiences with love romance and courtship and marriage and infidelity

656
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,320
and wives getting fat and stuff like that there

657
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,160
laughter

658
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,000
laughter

659
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:07,100
get down and get in there and poke and while you're at it take a poke for old J.C.

660
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:07,700
laughter

661
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:15,840
see your savior doing the deed in your imagination with his time toughened pain pole

662
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,440
really working her up to a proper lather hey it can happen

663
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,620
laughter

664
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:27,580
and then this guy's great and then try to feel things from her side of the quote issue unquote

665
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,120
laughter

666
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,800
God women are hot for sex pain

667
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,780
too because it makes them feel good to weep when they see that moment of truth when some

668
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:44,720
uh dumps her or steals from her or goes up and dies on her leaving her alone to raise the little mud puppies all by her own

669
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,140
laughter

670
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:56,160
that's part of her pain stain it is put into her it is put into her female psychorphony to love you you dump

671
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:56,780
laughter

672
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,780
laughter

673
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,380
laughter

674
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,940
why else do you think they can go out there and expose themselves to that pain stain?

675
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:00,940


676
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:00,940


677
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,620
they can't help themselves to all the top gun stupidity that makes up the male psychorphony

678
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,100
laughter

679
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:14,760
they cannot help themselves anymore than we can help ourselves and that can only lead me to advise us all to develop an attitude adjustment

680
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,440
laughter

681
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,200
and what shall be a proper attitude adjustment for a normal functioning soul brother to his soul sisters

682
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:26,800
why let's look to our elders brothers let's look to those who have gone before us and have regained for themselves the first and final freedom

683
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,820
let us have for one another an infinite compassion

684
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:30,940
laughter

685
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:50,100
that's love brothers so really you know the self reliant men monthly newsletter turned out to be one of those I mean almost threw it away and blew the guy off and it turned out to be one of the best ranting you know I mean that's just this is the clean version

686
00:35:51,380 --> 00:36:00,940
why grace is poured into thy lips huh I guess whatever Christ says those who hear it will find grace won't they therefore God has blessed me with grace

687
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:00,940


688
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,360
forever

689
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:01,680
music

690
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,180
the clouds of girls drift across the stage

691
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:25,220
girls soft and bright girls fast and funny girls with dreamy looks and pouty looks girls with languid smiles and impeded grins girls with unruly bangs and neat velvety chignons

692
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:30,740
girls with eyes slanted a little and girls with eyes slanted a lot

693
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:30,920
music

694
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:36,560
Amid all the girls, one stands out in Twilight's office.

695
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,640
The first city of the future will be built in Sweden.

696
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:46,940
It will be called Jarfalla, have about 100 residents,

697
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,200
and be accessible by subway or highway from Stockholm just 12 miles away.

698
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,920
No gasoline-powered vehicle will be allowed here.

699
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,340
Noiseless electric minibuses moving at a soothing 20 miles per hour

700
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:05,120
will pass within 150 yards of everyone's house,

701
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,760
carrying passengers and baggage for free.

702
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:16,020
Oakshores is a private membership, prisoner of war resort refuge,

703
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:25,200
now being carefully developed on picturesque north shore of Lake Naciamendo.

704
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,780
Lakeside lots for sale with low down payments,

705
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:34,840
and no neighbors are excellent long-term buyers.

706
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:42,740
Yet, dear friends, the man of violence and superior force was not a war lover.

707
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:47,460
A war lover like General George S. Patton,

708
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:54,240
whom Monsignor Ike understood, liked, tolerated, and used badly,

709
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,720
is a killer.

710
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,700
And Ike could not be a killer, because he had been raised,

711
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:06,320
as his mother told a biographer, to choose good.

712
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,300
Yeah, yeah!

713
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:13,040
And that's where I went. I went to the bathroom, and I had a CAT scan while I was there.

714
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:16,440
That's right. Every time you go in that bathroom, you get an automatic CAT scan.

715
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,560
CAT scan machine that you use a quarter in back there, you know, it's right behind me.

716
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,100
It's perfectly safe. No more than a very small amount of radiation.

717
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,700
That was fun. It was great.

718
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,200
Oh, I think it's almost done.

719
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:31,780
That's preserved in the bathroom, too. It's next to the cathode ray machine.

720
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,680
See if that brain is done yet back there. I think it's got another couple of minutes before the alarm goes off.

721
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,940
We call this thinking from the backside of the brain.

722
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,860
The hindbrain, or buttocks of the brain, which often needs to be injected.

723
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:52,600
The doctors decided to use huge needles whose length is appropriate for the site of injection,

724
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,900
and the deposits of fat on the offending brain.

725
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,360
Not only that, they also need to get thinner bottoms for the subgenius body.

726
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:57,500
The subgenius body is a part of the body that is the subgenius body.

727
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:57,500


728
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,760
So they must get thinner bottoms by aerobic training the subgenius way.

729
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,820
Subgenius gluteal aerobics. We leave no stern untoned.

730
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,920
No stern or untended.

731
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,380
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

732
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,340
Since you were checking BST-2,

733
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,480
why?

734
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:22,420
The checklist in the accompanying booklet is for comparing us with our competitors.

735
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,140
The

736
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:52,340
Well, let's stop screwing around.

737
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,320
Oh, yeah.

738
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,340
Please.

739
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:58,080
I can't say that word on the air.

740
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,280
Would you hand me the screwdriver?

741
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,400
Would you supply the correct word for this sentence?

742
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:01,820
Certainly.

743
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,100
All right. Oscar does some funny...

744
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,300
What?

745
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,700
I don't think that's...

746
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:08,900
Thumps.

747
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,920
Some funny thumps?

748
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:11,540
Yes, yes.

749
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,660
I didn't understand that.

750
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,620
He blank, he smells peanuts.

751
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,380
Oh, he blank, he smells peanuts.

752
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:17,980
That's right.

753
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,440
He crazy, he smells peanuts.

754
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,200
He crazy, very good, very good, Mr. B...

755
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,360
Yanamoto.

756
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:23,700
B. Yanamoto.

757
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,940
B. Yanamoto.

758
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,160
Irene Yanamoto.

759
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,000
All right, here's one for you, Mr. Punter.

760
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,620
Okay.

761
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,960
Jack, blank, Oscar for doing tricks.

762
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,640
Uh, Jack...

763
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,260
Oh, I can't say that on the radio.

764
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,000
Oh, you're right.

765
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:39,820
Spanked.

766
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,000
Spanked?

767
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:41,600
Ow!

768
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,860
That was the government alternative.

769
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,700
It was just sent in on the heart line, Larry.

770
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,660
Dear friends, your free volume contains these five books.

771
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,140
Great Lion of God by Taylor...

772
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:53,820
Taylor Godwell.

773
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:58,920
Bless the Beasts and Children by Sergeant Louis Illuminato.

774
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:04,680
Kim, a Gift from Vietnam by Frank W. Chinaman.

775
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,640
And I Chose Prison by James B. Bennett.

776
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,460
Hey, when you said Kim, Mr. Armand...

777
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:11,800
Yes.

778
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,080
...the echo in my life went out.

779
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,720
Oh, that, no.

780
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,640
I was a very strange thing.

781
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,900
I just wondered if that was an incantation or anything.

782
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:21,260
No, that wasn't.

783
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,540
I was just jiving.

784
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,720
Just jiving.

785
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,560
Yeah, no, I didn't mean nothing by it.

786
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,360
It had no...

787
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:32,540
No, just because I sometimes say things backwards doesn't mean anything.

788
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:33,940
Oh, he's doing it again.

789
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:34,720
He's doing it again.

790
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,840
There's no occult significance.

791
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:37,860
Oh, there's no occult.

792
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:38,220
There's...

793
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:38,580
It's happening.

794
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,420
Anything occult is so out of sight...

795
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:41,740
Yeah.

796
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:42,860
...acculted.

797
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,240
That's a bit of an academic joke.

798
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,800
You can't even see it, so it doesn't exist.

799
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,440
That's right.

800
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,320
Who am I?

801
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,900
I'm Dr. IQ.

802
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,300
That's who you are.

803
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:52,520
That's who you are.

804
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:52,520


805
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:52,520


806
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:52,520


807
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:52,600
That's right.

808
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,280
Yes, yes, yes, indeed.

809
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,800
It sure is a lot of fun having you on the show.

810
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,600
IQ Eisenhower.

811
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,280
Right.

812
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:57,620
Ike.

813
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,380
Ike.

814
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:58,480
Ike.

815
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:58,580
Ike.

816
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:58,700
Ike.

817
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:58,860
Ike.

818
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,060
Ike.

819
00:41:59,060 --> 00:41:59,220
Ike.

820
00:41:59,220 --> 00:41:59,360
Ike.

821
00:41:59,360 --> 00:41:59,380
Ike.

822
00:41:59,380 --> 00:41:59,380


823
00:41:59,380 --> 00:41:59,380


824
00:41:59,380 --> 00:41:59,380


825
00:41:59,540 --> 00:41:59,900
Ike.

826
00:41:59,900 --> 00:41:59,900


827
00:41:59,900 --> 00:41:59,900


828
00:41:59,900 --> 00:41:59,900


829
00:41:59,900 --> 00:41:59,900


830
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:00,460
Ike.

831
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:01,180
Ike.

832
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:01,640
Ike.

833
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,140
Ike.

834
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,220
Ike.

835
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,020
Ike.

836
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:26,640
Ike.

837
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,580
Ike.

838
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,220
Ike.

839
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:28,940
Ike.

840
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:28,980


841
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,200
Ike.

842
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:30,320


843
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:30,860
Ike.

844
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:31,740
Ike.

845
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,640
Ike.

846
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,500
Ike.

847
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,020
Ike.

848
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:36,860
Ike.

849
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:37,460
Ike.

850
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:37,840
Ike.

851
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:38,240
Ike.

852
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,020
Ike.

853
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:39,060


854
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:39,060


855
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:39,060


856
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:39,060


857
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:39,060


858
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:39,060


859
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:39,060


860
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:39,060


861
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:39,060


862
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:39,060


863
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:39,380
Ike.

864
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:39,840
No.

865
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,640
Well, dear friends, if you don't have shoes that don't fit...

866
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,260
No, if you do have shoes...

867
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,220
If you do have shoes that do fit...

868
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:51,560
I have an interesting little article here that's in Science Renewal Report about that

869
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:56,160
that says that the fact that most people in the United States have at least one pair of shoes

870
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,240
that are too tight for them...

871
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,600
I'm not trying to make a value judgment here.

872
00:42:59,660 --> 00:42:59,800
No.

873
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,980
...that are too tight for them is responsible for a third of their sexual fantasies.

874
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,240
Shoes...

875
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,440
That's very interesting.

876
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,900
I don't know what tight shoes has to do with my sexual fantasies.

877
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,400
It's very simple.

878
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:16,100
It's just a matter of the fact that there are various electrical outlet points at the bottom of the foot

879
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:20,660
which, when squeezed by an over-tight shoe, will send the chi or the life force into strain.

880
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,160
I wear women's shoes.

881
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,600
Do you want to fight about it?

882
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,260
No, I don't want to fight about it.

883
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,200
I want to give you your opportunity as an individual to...

884
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,660
I don't feel that they give me any kind of sexual fantasy.

885
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,560
I mean, I just wear women's shoes.

886
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,820
Do you want to fight about it?

887
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,720
I think that...

888
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,240
Well, you're wearing a pair of red.

889
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,780
You're wearing a pair of patent leather four-inch heels.

890
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,900
And I think that it does...

891
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,040
That's right.

892
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,040
...place how...

893
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:40,140
So what?

894
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,460
Your center of balance is off by four inches, man.

895
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,540
You might just as well be...

896
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:43,560
Nonsense!

897
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,400
Stand up from the bar here!

898
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,800
That poor man.

899
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,480
That's really sad, you know.

900
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,280
People who can't hold their liquor shouldn't come to these bars.

901
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,500
He would have hurt his head, but he had his hard hat on.

902
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:55,940
That's true.

903
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:59,280
You know, Dave, this is a good time for us to take a few minutes of time out here

904
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,520
and mention to the folks that the program's coming to them from steel hats.

905
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,820
The sun never sets on a steel hat.

906
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:05,440
That's true.

907
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:05,940
That's true.

908
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:09,000
Steel hat Nebraska is where all of these fine goods are made.

909
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:09,920
Yes, it is.

910
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:14,280
And we would suggest that if you are ever in or near steel hat,

911
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,480
a fine little town of 500 on the north...

912
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,500
It's been bought by the Gay Liberation Front, I might say.

913
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:19,780
Steel hat?

914
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,560
Steel hat?

915
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:20,940
Yeah.

916
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,040
It's a company town now.

917
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,260
Yeah, there's more of them than there are of them,

918
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,760
and so they bought it from them.

919
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,460
Well, that's sad.

920
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:32,200
Well, if you're in steel hat and can get with it, you know,

921
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,240
why come by and see the steel hat plant,

922
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,920
because the folks down there will be loving it.

923
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:36,080
They'll love it.

924
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:37,840
They'll love to...

925
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,160
And don't miss the demonstration, the steel hat demonstration.

926
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,020
Oh, yeah?

927
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,400
Yeah, you get to wear a steel hat,

928
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,660
and they hit you with a sledgehammer.

929
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,440
Oh, right on the head?

930
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:44,800
Yep.

931
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:45,440
Oh!

932
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,320
Boy, that's fun.

933
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,820
Do that to me, will you?

934
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,220
Okay.

935
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:51,760
Oh, tickles.

936
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,460
Do you know that...

937
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,540
You're not even wearing a steel hat.

938
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,620
No, I'm not.

939
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,240
I forgot my steel hat.

940
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,020
Oh, you dummy.

941
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:58,520
Oh, boy, I'm not so dumb.

942
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,360
I'm Dr. IQ.

943
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:00,140
Oh, boy.

944
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:00,860
Ask me a question.

945
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:01,860
Go ahead, ask me a question.

946
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:02,960
All right, all right, I have one.

947
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,120
Who can stand but cannot walk?

948
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,780
Standing in our yard,

949
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,800
when the sun comes out, he will go away.

950
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,160
Oh, that's a good one.

951
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:11,980
That's a good question.

952
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,400
Okay.

953
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,020
Comes from Little Billy.

954
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:14,500
Yeah, okay, let's see.

955
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,320
Bob...

956
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:16,880
Mortimer Mole.

957
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,980
Yeah, it's my old friend Mortimer Mole, isn't it?

958
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,360
It's him in the back.

959
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:22,660
No?

960
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,220
This man is ridiculous.

961
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,200
No, no, that's not...

962
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,400
It's my show, you guys.

963
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,400
All right, all right, all right.

964
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:28,340
Now, there's an example.

965
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:30,340
You guys, you announcers can't pick on me.

966
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,020
It's my show.

967
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,300
Mistake, mistake.

968
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,720
I'm supposed to come out looking like this smart guy.

969
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:35,920
Look, I'm your teacher.

970
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,680
I'm supposed to teach you how to get into radio.

971
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,780
You got a BHD?

972
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:40,780
I got a BHD.

973
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,960
I got some STP, but we can't use it during work.

974
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:43,640
No, we can't do that on the air.

975
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,160
You can't even talk about it on the air, please.

976
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:45,960
Oh, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

977
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,340
The voice of your conscience speaking.

978
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,060
It's not trash.

979
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:50,860
This is...

980
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,600
This is valuable scientific assistance.

981
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:58,560
Our job as sub is to suck every dime we can.

982
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,280
Hey, that's somebody else's good, buddy.

983
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,260
Hey, get your...

984
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,840
Put your belly in.

985
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:06,280
In my pocket.

986
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,340
Suck it on my pocket.

987
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,600
If you knew what I'd put in my pocket, you wouldn't be doing that, I'll tell you.

988
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,220
And your mama.

989
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:19,760
Yeah, I had something in there this morning that was probably...

990
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,560
Let's go over that again.

991
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,460
I got a monster there this morning.

992
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:25,640
In my pocket.

993
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:26,000
Yeah.

994
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,140
What kind of a monster?

995
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,880
Greasy, slimy, stinky, sweaty...

996
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,720
And I wasn't glad to see this.

997
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,000


998
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,280
Monsters.

999
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,220
Come, come.

1000
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,740
You can't expect us to believe.

1001
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,780
That here in the 20th century, why we put a man on the moon.

1002
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,920
Well, that's where it came from.

1003
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,280
It actually clung to the spaceship on the way back.

1004
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,140
And it lived through re-entry.

1005
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:49,120
And then fell into some kind of swamp.

1006
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:50,960
And lived on.

1007
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:54,300
A fetid half-symbol of itself.

1008
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:55,740
Its former glory.

1009
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,140
A shambling mound.

1010
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:04,140
Esmerged in the stinky, stinky, sweaty, swampy areas that it fell in.

1011
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,720
When it left the...

1012
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,420
It was.

1013
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,580
It originated as Bob Sock.

1014
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,380
But microorganisms grew in it.

1015
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,140
But microorganisms in it.

1016
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:13,560
And it became alive.

1017
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:15,800
It gained an...

1018
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,260
Toe jam.

1019
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,460
Unholy simulacrum of life.

1020
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:22,160
It's like the cellular organisms in the toe jam.

1021
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,080
In the right concentration.

1022
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:25,920
With ozone.

1023
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,080
At exactly the right re-entry trajectory.

1024
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:35,180
Aligned with the tiles on the spaceships.

1025
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,400
Um...

1026
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,540
Protected covering.

1027
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:41,980
The grout on the Glomar Explorer's tile became loose.

1028
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,260
And upon re-entry.

1029
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,840
The Glomar...

1030
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:50,160
The Glomar Gaddafi burned as it re-entered the atmosphere.

1031
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:50,760
The...

1032
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:56,880
That's right.

1033
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:03,800
The jail cells filled together enough energy to deflect the hurtling spacecraft from its no-fated rendezvous.

1034
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,500
With the upper atmosphere.

1035
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:09,020
The bodies of the astronauts who died in extreme agony.

1036
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,780
Were recovered by the National Recovery Organization.

1037
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,480
The things it took to build those basic building blocks of life.

1038
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:19,380
When injected with the right amount of...

1039
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:20,400
Injected into the body.

1040
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,060
Super high concentrated...

1041
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,180
For the needle of sufficient...

1042
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,440
Electrical discharge.

1043
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:24,960
And...

1044
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:25,620
And...

1045
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:28,720
The slight electrical discharge is only static electricity.

1046
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:29,720
And it was unbelievable.

1047
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,100
It was just like...

1048
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:32,040
New life.

1049
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,540
Based on the toe jam and crustaceans of that old...

1050
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:36,040
Sock.

1051
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,560
Those of you out there who have...

1052
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,220
You've heard of the Scientologists.

1053
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,280
You've heard of the Moonies.

1054
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,500
You've heard of the Holy Rollers.

1055
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,340
The Snake Handlers.

1056
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,820
This is like all of those all rolled into one.

1057
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,120
A thousand times worse.

1058
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:47,720
And yet...

1059
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,200
True.

1060
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,560
With so much...

1061
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:49,960
I mean...

1062
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,100
We can save that many more souls.

1063
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,240
What about the money?

1064
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,360
What about the money?

1065
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:55,980
Uh...

1066
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:56,900
Really now.

1067
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,260
Are you guys in this...

1068
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:58,560
Uh...

1069
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,000
Cult business just for the bucks?

1070
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:01,460
It's not the money we're after.

1071
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:02,860
It's not the money.

1072
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,320
It's really not the money.

1073
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:04,760
It's...

1074
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,200
It's...

1075
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:05,660
The soul.

1076
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,280
Yeah, it's not the whole...

1077
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,360
The entire soul either.

1078
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,620
It's just the part of your soul that gets rubbed off.

1079
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,580
And the dollar bills say...

1080
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:13,980
The...

1081
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,460
The bit of your soul which...

1082
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,980
The signature on the check.

1083
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,640
Yeah, I think we're being sold a bill.

1084
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:22,520
It's feeling good.

1085
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,560
This is a joke.

1086
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,420
But it is a very serious joke.

1087
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:29,260
We are the first non-tax exempt church around.

1088
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,940
We're the first industrial church.

1089
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,920
We want to be proud to pay our taxes.

1090
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,240
And let people know...

1091
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,180
We're not trying to...

1092
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:35,800
We're not trying to...

1093
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:35,940
We're not trying to...

1094
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,640
Escape by on the tax thing anyway.

1095
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:38,880
We don't want to fool anybody.

1096
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,480
Isn't it a fact, really,

1097
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,780
that you've invented this whole thing?

1098
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,420
That you've thought up all these little gimmicks?

1099
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,980
And you're taking advantage of a lot of ignorant people

1100
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,220
by getting money out of them?

1101
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,140
People who believe in you?

1102
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:51,560
And you're...

1103
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,200
See, we're not saying anything

1104
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,400
that none of these other modern-day,

1105
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,040
new-age religious cults aren't saying.

1106
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,180
The only thing is,

1107
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:02,040
we're not denying it that we're in it for the money.

1108
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:05,060
And we're not disputing any of your belief systems.

1109
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,820
Because we believe in just about every one of them anyway.

1110
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,420
Sir, we absolutely believe in everything.

1111
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,140
We believe in it wholeheartedly.

1112
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,220
You know, Bob's been sorting it out

1113
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,580
and sifting through all the different Bibles of everybody

1114
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,600
and picking out the parts that apply.

1115
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:21,020
The only thing is,

1116
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,160
we believe that it takes,

1117
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,560
in this modern-day, a-go-go society,

1118
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,100
it takes some semblance of a sense of humor

1119
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:30,260
to delve through all the murky bull

1120
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,700
that you're going to get

1121
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,100
in the process of seeking the truth

1122
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,080
and awareness of the truth.

1123
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:35,180
And we're not denying it.

1124
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:35,180


1125
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,400
We're not denying the awareness that you want in your life.

1126
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,680
See for yourself if it's all we say.

1127
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:42,440
A trial seminar.

1128
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,560
So you can weigh our claims

1129
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,080
against your experience.

1130
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,880
People can be trained to run it.

1131
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,280
When and where you choose.

1132
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:05,780
We don't need a name.

1133
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:07,280
We need a name.

1134
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:09,560
It's a good thing.

1135
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:09,600
It's a good thing.

1136
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:10,300
It's a good thing.

1137
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,760
It's a good thing.

1138
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,600
What I really liked was the little turtles

1139
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,840
that they painted the backs.

1140
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,000
They'd paint the backs

1141
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,660
and they'd paint them like different colors

1142
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:24,840
and nobody knew at the time

1143
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,780
that it caused a long, slow, painful death

1144
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,160
to those turtles to paint their backs that way.

1145
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,520
They would have to grow

1146
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,140
with the paint on their backs

1147
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:34,540
and the little shells,

1148
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:35,180
the little planks.

1149
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:41,840
plates of their shell couldn't expand properly, causing unbelievably intense pain over the

1150
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:47,100
duration of their entire life. But that was just secondary to the enjoyment that the little

1151
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:54,940
child got, witnessing that struggle for life that that small little reptilian creature

1152
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:55,640
exhibited.

1153
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:59,720
It began innocuously enough with three days of mind-numbing procedural debate and

1154
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:03,120
jury readings of committee reports, like most conventions, all about as interesting as a

1155
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,560
mole on the Pope's behind. But at the end of the third day, the First International

1156
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:10,860
Congress of the Church of the Subgenius erupted into a full-fledged riot over the forced resignation

1157
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:15,880
of church leader Reverend Ivan Stang. Involved in the recent no-sex scandal, the cult violence

1158
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:20,880
which left over 35 dead and scores more injured or missing lasted over 36 hours.

1159
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:24,100
Yeah, we finally got rid of that guy. I was glad about that.

1160
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,480
None of the dead or injured belonged to the church.

1161
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:30,620
When interviewed about this, several old men stated...

1162
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:32,040
What's that?

1163
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,060
How did you get rid of that guy?

1164
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:33,100
How did you get rid of that guy?

1165
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:43,800
Well, it took a combination of perseverance, power, um, personal power, and...

1166
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,400
Poison oak?

1167
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:51,820
Poison oak. Yeah, we actually took poison oak. We, we tortured it.

1168
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:56,640
Your subgenius says the only thing we have in common is that we have nothing in common

1169
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,360
with the conspiracy.

1170
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:02,580
You serious? The same people busted him?

1171
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:02,860
The same people in the movie industry.

1172
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:02,860


1173
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:02,860


1174
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:02,860


1175
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:02,860


1176
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:04,260
It's fixing to bust you.

1177
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:11,780
The folks that run this country is that handful of manipulating white folks and none of them

1178
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:12,500
live in California.

1179
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:15,060
This is a trick out here.

1180
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,920
All of them live in that northeast corner of the United States.

1181
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,300
the movie industry

1182
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,540
the movie industry don't do nothing but make the trick

1183
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:26,460
the big money comes from back east

1184
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:28,440
and three families back east

1185
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,400
control 85% of the movie houses

1186
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,020
television

1187
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:36,440
you serious television ain't nothing but

1188
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,300
to manipulate you

1189
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,120
and they got you believing it's for entertainment

1190
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,760
you see it's not for entertainment it's to rip off your head

1191
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,640
and those of you that's silly enough

1192
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,500
to have one of them television sets in your house

1193
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,620
especially around your children

1194
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:51,880
you better read a book called Subliminal Subduction

1195
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,380
and see what really be going down with them television sets

1196
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:00,640
America the beautiful

1197
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,840
anytime a dude want to tell you how beautiful his wife is

1198
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,540
or someone want to tell you how handsome their husband is

1199
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:06,900
they married to some ugly folks

1200
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,600
anytime you got to tell about

1201
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,580
man I got some of the prettiest children

1202
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:12,560
something wrong with them

1203
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:17,160
because beauty is not nothing that have to be discussed

1204
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,360
beauty speaks for itself

1205
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:24,840
and we got to run around singing songs about how beautiful America is

1206
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,160
America ain't never been beautiful

1207
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:30,760
never been beautiful

1208
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:37,180
and somewhere it takes a small amount of intelligence to understand

1209
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,600
that anytime you got a system

1210
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:44,140
that we got to go all over the world trying to ram this system

1211
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:46,240
down people's throat with a gun

1212
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,620
something wrong with it

1213
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,040
because anything good you don't have to force on people

1214
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,240
they will steal it

1215
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,120
and if you don't believe it

1216
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,080
one night before you go to bed

1217
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,720
take some diamonds and put outside the house

1218
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,300
and next to it

1219
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,400
put some doo-doo

1220
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:09,800
then go to bed

1221
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,160
when you wake up in the morning

1222
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,620
see which one going to be gone

1223
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,720
and if you want that doo-doo removed

1224
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,600
you're going to do the same thing we're doing

1225
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,480
all over the world

1226
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,820
you're going to take a pistol and say

1227
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:20,880
get that doo-doo

1228
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,420
the cat's going to say

1229
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,660
oh I woke up this morning wanting some doo-doo

1230
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,240
thank you very much

1231
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,760
y'all live in a country where you silly enough to say

1232
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,840
oh yes we have a freedom to vote

1233
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,400
you serious

1234
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,620
they don't even play games with you

1235
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:41,600
they tell you when you come out and vote in November

1236
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,220
that don't count

1237
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:46,020
the president is not picked till December

1238
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,480
by a group of electoral colleagues who are going to vote for him

1239
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:48,480


1240
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:48,480


1241
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:48,480


1242
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,700
these are most of y'all don't even know who them punks are

1243
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,880
we have a freedom of speech

1244
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:58,540
try it

1245
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,860
yeah try it

1246
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:03,460
try to pick on somebody other than poor folks

1247
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,920
try it and see what happens to you

1248
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:11,580
in his dead ninja's eyes

1249
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:14,260
when Trent dance like Smokey

1250
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:18,040
in his great t-shirt

1251
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:22,220
Trent dance like Smokey

1252
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:26,180
piss your money away

1253
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:29,820
there won't be no any day

1254
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:33,720
Bob will sell you all the sun

1255
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:37,540
he's on line with Jehovah one

1256
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:39,580
but he ain't no man

1257
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:41,620
he ain't no god

1258
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:45,560
don't wanna walk the path Bob tried

1259
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,480
he ain't no man

1260
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,540
he ain't no god

1261
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:56,680
I don't wanna walk the path Bob tried

1262
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:05,300
and we don't want that to happen

1263
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,760
the central of many

1264
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:07,600
the lord said

1265
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,380
behold the behemoth

1266
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:15,580
USS behemoth coming about

1267
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,380
this is Jacksonville

1268
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,480
yes the strength of his loins

1269
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,900
is of that of a caterpillar tractor

1270
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:25,240
his thighs are like back holes

1271
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,440
and the great strong gentleman

1272
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,960
just at about this time

1273
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,960
a solar storm is hitting the earth

1274
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,260
unparalleled magnetic frequency

1275
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:35,440
it doesn't really mean anything

1276
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,300
giant sunspots are causing a bombardment of the upper atmosphere

1277
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:40,760
by an increase in the ultra-low

1278
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,720
from nothingness into this big bang

1279
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,460
and then everything is accelerating away from itself at the...

1280
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:47,460


1281
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:47,460


1282
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:52,280
at a rate of speed that was produced at that primal big bang

1283
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,880
and here we are now

1284
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,640
in fact radio transmission may be affected

1285
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,880
like we talked about earlier

1286
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:02,860
just a little speck in the nanosecond of the...

1287
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:04,540
but we got most of this show out

1288
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:06,240
minute of space time

1289
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,900
and the longer you let the universe ferment the better it becomes

1290
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:10,940
mmm yum

1291
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,280
taste the universe

1292
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,820
it's quite true ladies and gentlemen

1293
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:17,220
the shows after us may not be receivable

1294
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:17,460
is that my show?

1295
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:20,540
because there is a solar storm and it started now

1296
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:23,980
have friends you can get more information

1297
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:25,320
if you dare

1298
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:28,020
come on in

1299
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:31,120
push open that vault door

1300
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:33,420
walk into that church

1301
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,920
it's easy you can do it by mail

1302
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,480
yes just write us a postcard

1303
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,360
and I'm gonna give you that address

1304
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,120
get ready

1305
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,280
just drop us a line saying

1306
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:54,800
dear sirs please send us information about your church

1307
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:57,500
go ahead do it

1308
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,280
here's the number

1309
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:04,000
Bob write to Bob at

1310
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:10,060
P.O. Box 140306

1311
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:14,220
Dallas Texas 75214

1312
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:15,680
go ahead

1313
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,000
I'll do that again

1314
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,720
Box 140306 Dallas Texas 75214

1315
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:27,920
hehehehehehehehe

1316
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,120
you'll be surprised

1317
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,140
you'll be real surprised

1318
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:34,140
you can't second guess us Bob

1319
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:34,720
you can't

1320
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,480
we're always staying one jump ahead

1321
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:41,720
is Bob saying like Heisenberg did forty odd years ago

1322
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,100
that we can never know what the hell is really going on?

1323
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:46,840
I think not

1324
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:54,140
Bob however is cognizant of the fact that besides the shabby little lies we feed ourselves from day to day

1325
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,100
as we struggle to cope with techno-boredom

1326
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:01,180
we're all being force fed a gross problem of our truths

1327
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,880
sensationalized statistics and downright propaganda

1328
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:10,940
by a vast monolithic network operated by and for the conspiracy

1329
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:14,680
they are pulling the wool over our eyes

1330
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:15,960
constantly

1331
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:20,140
I might point out that a lot of people worry about the one world government

1332
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:22,560
that the conspiracy is trying to get across on us

1333
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:26,760
and we suspect that the only thing that can fight a one world government

1334
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,420
is going to be a one world religion

1335
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:30,480
and of course that's what the subgenius

1336
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,320
the church of the subgenius is here for

1337
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:36,320
the church of the subgenius is surely the church of the future

1338
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:38,720
or at least what's left of it

1339
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:43,140
the world as we know it will end in 1998

1340
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,600
but Bob will have to fight

1341
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,460
and we don't have to worry about that

1342
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:01,620
if we do

1343
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:02,020
Bob

1344
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:04,580
Bob

1345
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:04,800
Bob

1346
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:04,820
Bob

1347
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:04,840
Bob

1348
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:04,860
Bob

1349
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:04,880
Bob

1350
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:04,900
Bob

1351
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:04,920
Bob

1352
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:04,940
Bob

1353
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:04,960
Bob

1354
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:04,980
Bob

1355
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:05,000
Bob

1356
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:05,020
Bob

1357
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:05,040
Bob

1358
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:05,060
Bob

1359
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:05,080
Bob

1360
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:05,100
Bob

1361
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:05,120
Bob

1362
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:05,140
Bob

1363
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:05,160
Bob

1364
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:05,180
Bob

1365
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:05,220
Bob

1366
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:10,820
alone. Oh, here they are now, the miracles of the Old Testament, and all these and more

1367
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:15,260
are so inextricably interwoven in the invisible background war between Jehovah and the exes.

1368
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:24,540
Here we see Conan the Barbarian. Yes, it's true. The subgenius convention is in a hotel

1369
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:30,500
in Chicago at this very moment. They cannot get into the hotel. It started off as an innocent

1370
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:37,200
convention. It has turned into the last holdout of the subgenius. No, look, if you're going to get

1371
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:37,540
through this.
