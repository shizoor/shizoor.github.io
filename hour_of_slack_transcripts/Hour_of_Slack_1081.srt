1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,700
Remain seated and come to order. The court is again in session.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,700
Your behavior, to say the least, has been most strange.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,440
I want to warn all who are here that the police have orders to arrest anyone creating...

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,840
The subgenius power of...

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,600
Your Honor, this is preposterous.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:20,980
Yes!

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,840
I'm rational.

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,280
Who else is pixelated?

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,860
Why, everybody is pixelated, except...

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,200
The subgenius power of...

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:30,980
What?

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,580
Your Honor, this is absurd.

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,480
It was twisted around to sound imbecilic.

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,000
No objection.

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,900
There's a theory that our universe is the creation of another universe.

16
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,460
Only one more hour to go.

17
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,260
That it's a gigantic experiment in some kind of computer program.

18
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,180
There is a...

19
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:56,740
Perfect.

20
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,180
...specially reputable theory for that.

21
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,280
That cuts it, hardware boy.

22
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,360
So that guy, you know, he may have been...

23
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,820
No skinny pink boy is going to tell me how to say things on my show.

24
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,300
What is that?

25
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,440
What kind of sound is that?

26
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,140
I should see a video game.

27
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:26,840
Fanaticism consists in thinking some one matter so overwhelmingly important that it outweighs everything else.

28
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:26,840


29
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:36,660
I have nothing against Canadians.

30
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,220
I'm playing Bob and Doug right now, as a matter of fact, to show my love for Canada.

31
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,180
What about us?

32
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:43,620
Get out.

33
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,660
I've got the wives of 10,000 earth-rape old men.

34
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,460
10,000 earth-rape old men.

35
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,260
Philo has the flatulation of them.

36
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,680
So, Hoser, what are you talking about?

37
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,520
We're going to close back on, huh?

38
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,460
Way to go.

39
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,040
No, that's optional.

40
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,920
10,000 earth-rape old men.

41
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,120
And then...

42
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,020
Go pick your nose.

43
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,300
The acidic amino acids will be here tomorrow night!

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,040
Ah, yes, dear friends.

45
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:19,140
But tonight, you're listening to Hour of Slack number 1080,

46
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,920
of which I am your host and pair partner, Reverend Ivan Stang.

47
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,520
And we're going to continue with the...

48
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,920
Part two of the five-part...

49
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,200
What?

50
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,980
The amino acids are already inside of you now.

51
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,780
Yes, the amino acids are already inside of you now.

52
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,360
But this background music is, in fact, from their new album due out in June,

53
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,100
Humanity Will Fall Like Hens.

54
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,480
But tonight's Hour of Slack show is a real Hour of Slack show.

55
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,280
It's got all the normal Hour of Slack...

56
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,640
But it's from the abnormal station of KPFA from January 10th,

57
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,200
when we did a...

58
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:02,740
Five-hour epic starring host Izzy Isn't and host Puzzling Evidence,

59
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,780
both of whose shows we used up,

60
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,620
with Dr. Howell, who actually arrived later in the evening,

61
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,440
Philo Drummond, yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

62
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,120
Reverend John Shirley, Gary Gabrogfran,

63
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,880
Michael Pepe, Princess We Are Dough,

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,300
Chaos McBobcat Drummond,

65
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,220
that's the new Mrs. Drummond,

66
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,180
Phineas Narco of NationalCyndical.com,

67
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,740
Kay Robb, somebody named Walter,

68
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,600
and the Uber Goober Booby Baby on keyboards,

69
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,040
plus Bishop Joey from the First Church of the Last Laugh.

70
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,720
And so, let us go into that very world.

71
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:48,100
Reverend Stang, I have to return to my apocalyptic theme

72
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,860
because I am the purveyor of the SignsOfWitness.com website.

73
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,460
I'm reporting for it.

74
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,160
I've got to ask...

75
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,440
I'm going to ask you this.

76
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,940
What will the apocalypse be like?

77
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,620
We know what the party is going to be like a little bit before,

78
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,260
but when the actual end comes,

79
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,680
could you describe a little bit what it would be like?

80
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,360
Well, it will depend on how...

81
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,000
Besides a blessed relief, I mean.

82
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,960
Well, individuals who never irritated any subgeniuses in any way during their lives

83
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,100
will have it much easier than those who...

84
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:20,900
Are we going to go back to the old...

85
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,340
Because they'll die instantly, practically.

86
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,080
Yeah.

87
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,760
Like switching off a light.

88
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,400
At some point in their lives, irritated a subgenius or inconvenienced one.

89
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:39,200
However, inadvertently, will suffer pains associated with hell,

90
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:46,200
the Dante-style hell, as well as modernized versions of subgeniuses.

91
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,240
It's going to be a widespread belief.

92
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,500
Just think how quickly you'd go through the airport, through security.

93
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,260
Oh, it's Reverend Stang going right through.

94
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,440
You know, oh, you'd have to...

95
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,280
Would you like to sit in first class, Reverend Stang?

96
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,200
Oh, well, there won't be airports after the end.

97
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,960
Well, there may be airports, but there'll be the kind of airports

98
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,920
where you're waiting in line with 5,000 other people for...

99
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,100
And there will be radio like this one.

100
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,880
You don't have to do this show 24 hours a day because there's nothing else to listen to.

101
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,060
We'll hate it.

102
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,180
Gotta throw it up in Barcelona.

103
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,760
That's just like us.

104
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,200
That was the way it used to be.

105
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:24,780
Yeah.

106
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,200
There was nothing but this show for 24 hours a day.

107
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,100
And how far we have fallen.

108
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,140
It's only eight or five hours a day now.

109
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,960
People will pay for the show.

110
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,740
I only do the show one hour and a half a day.

111
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,440
You can only abuse your body most of the time.

112
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,060
Michael Jackson.

113
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,700
Michael Jackson.

114
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,540
Michael Jackson.

115
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,240
Michael Pepe.

116
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,340
Michael Jackson.

117
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,940
Michael Jackson.

118
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,180
Michael Jackson.

119
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:55,180


120
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:55,180


121
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:55,180


122
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:55,180


123
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,540
I think a broke friend is making these noises this time.

124
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,440
A mysterious device.

125
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,620
They're live.

126
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,060
This isn't a Bob Nelson background tone.

127
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,560
It's not one of Wellman's movie soundtrack collections.

128
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,180
But it made the mascara snake joyful.

129
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,000
It's not something Don Joyce is providing.

130
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,200
It's just not you, Gary.

131
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,280
You know, Gary, that hair, it's just not you.

132
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,800
It's just not me.

133
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,980
It has a life of its own.

134
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,440
Those shoes, those just aren't you, Gary.

135
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:33,880
Not you.

136
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,940
They're not you, Gary.

137
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:40,640
You know, it's getting so the teenage girls only grab the bottom half of my hair now

138
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,240
and they leave the top half alone.

139
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,260
What do you think that means?

140
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,560
It's growing farther down toward your crotch.

141
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,500
That's a little hint.

142
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,560
The rest of you are all cops.

143
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,780
Just a subtle hint.

144
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,340
Faces in the crowd.

145
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,740
Just a scruzzle hint.

146
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,040
Nine to five, nobody.

147
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,440
It's their way of saying, not you, Gary.

148
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,620
Are you here?

149
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,800
You're the guys at Red Curbs on Star Trek.

150
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,540
Get out!

151
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,220
You haven't stayed.

152
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,580
You've seen Idiocracy yet?

153
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:12,920
No, I have not seen Idiocracy, although you're the third person in about three days to mention it.

154
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,620
I just, as soon as it's downloadable, I'm sure I'll have a copy.

155
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,160
What is downloadable?

156
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,340
Oh, well, as soon as I'm home, I'll download it.

157
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,700
From my favorite channel.

158
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,920
Which channel is it on?

159
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,340
Don't play it with your brother.

160
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,940
I don't know, but they have the Fox News channel on it.

161
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,160
It's 500 years in the future.

162
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,120
Oh, cool.

163
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,500
Hello, baby.

164
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:42,040
Well, my favorite channel is alt.binaries.movies.divx.

165
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,420
Yes, it's on there.

166
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,400
That's one of those non-pay channels.

167
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,520
Hello, baby.

168
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,320
Hello, baby.

169
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,220
Hello, baby.

170
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,380
Hello, baby.

171
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,540
That's the Drummond family in the background.

172
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,920
That's all they do is they spoil, they talk to their baby.

173
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,400
Hello, baby.

174
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,180
Hello, baby.

175
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:04,760
Hello, baby.

176
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,020
That's Philo's rant now.

177
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,880
The baby has a very powerful mind that has taken them over completely.

178
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,480
It has, actually.

179
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,260
That baby might as well be running their lives.

180
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,440
They'll drop everything they're doing just for that baby.

181
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,100
Baby!

182
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,920
Why do they say, sleep like a baby, when babies wake up every two hours?

183
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,360
Tall.

184
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,200
To take an example.

185
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,940
One of the misfits.

186
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,780
I suppose the reason people dislike the way they attribute it to babies are not the cats.

187
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:41,020
It means that stuff runs out of your mouth and your both ends while you're sleeping.

188
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,020
That's what sleep like a baby really means.

189
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,920
It means you have to be cleaned up after the sleep.

190
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,160
It was so atrocious.

191
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,520
Princess Wee has just walked in, but seems not to have her own microphone.

192
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,680
Or even a chair.

193
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,740
Lady just entered the room, boys.

194
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,580
I'm shortly about to take the next rocket out, in fact.

195
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,580
I've been holding the fort.

196
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,820
There's a chair in there.

197
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:12,500
You can go sit, if you dare to sit next to Phineas and Arko.

198
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,220
I'm not going.

199
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,160
Yes, Princess Wee Ardo.

200
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,200
Queen of all the UFOs.

201
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,480
But only the unidentified O's.

202
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,220
Could she intercede for us when the UFOs come in the next day?

203
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,260
Could we fall to our knees in front of her and beg her to intercede so that they don't turn us in?

204
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,380
No, because when they come, then they're no longer unidentified.

205
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,240
You know what I'm saying?

206
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,140
What is her relationship with known objects?

207
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,580
That's the drawback to being that particular kind of queen.

208
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,400
Identified flying objects, then.

209
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,400
Yeah, what about known flying objects?

210
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,140
What is she going to do?

211
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,360
She's got no... Those are out of her jurisdiction.

212
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,140
Really?

213
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,500
Those aren't her responsibility.

214
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,220
Want to play with me?

215
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,700
Oh, man.

216
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,820
That's the 60s.

217
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,520
Have I done something wrong?

218
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,360
Bob's still in college.

219
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,660
Where's Glass Madness to sing a little Bob song?

220
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,660
I like Bob better than your Bob, cause your Bob sucks.

221
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,420
He sucks so bad.

222
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,220
We all slack Bob.

223
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,100
If you can kiss my wallet goodbye.

224
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,620
La la la la la la la la la la.

225
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,940
That's a little Bob.

226
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,280
So bad, tiny Bob.

227
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,840
Hey, we both can.

228
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,840
All praise the wolf.

229
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,840
You don't have to buy the best.

230
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,940
Did I hear a little tiny collar?

231
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,940
Little tiny collar.

232
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,760
Teeny, teeny, tiny collar.

233
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,300
Boy, I love you, baby.

234
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,760
Can't I help you?

235
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,360
You are not a toad.

236
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:56,920
You are not a toad.

237
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,260
You are not a toad.

238
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:57,500
You are not a toad.

239
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,200
Yeah.

240
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,480
Oh, breathless.

241
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,780
Watch it play me.

242
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:11,320
Wow, Not You Gary is playing the guitar by rubbing it just against the Harrison's device,

243
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,440
which are like guitar picks.

244
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,060
People will be praying for the end of the world

245
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,520
if it doesn't happen, my friend

246
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,840
People will be praying for the end of the show

247
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,680
if it doesn't change

248
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,920
the atmosphere somehow

249
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,340
Five hours tonight, Over the Edge

250
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,160
and the Puzzling Evidence Show

251
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,780
combined

252
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,380
We're going till five

253
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,800
If only the musicians could hear each other

254
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,280
And no one can stop us

255
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,780
If only we could hear each other

256
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,500
I hear the ocean

257
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,940
and I hear my tinnitus

258
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,440
Hey, guess what, you guys

259
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,140
I've learned that I'm losing my hearing

260
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,940
What? Huh?

261
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,980
They always do that

262
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,060
They cannot help themselves

263
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,260
Well, should I yell louder or what?

264
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,140
Yeah, that actually helps

265
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,520
quite a bit

266
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,620
You have headphones, volume controls under the desk there

267
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,700
The little knobs near every jack

268
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,940
They don't turn it up nearly

269
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,100
That's not a volume control

270
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,260
Oh, that's not a volume control

271
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:13,260


272
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:13,600
Oh!

273
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,260
They don't nearly turn it up high enough

274
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,440
but it's better than nothing

275
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,460
Well, it's not the jacks

276
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,380
or the headphones

277
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,700
or even the show

278
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,360
It's unfortunately my ears

279
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,740
You know, I'm really, really, really old

280
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,720
Well, you're mighty close to an electric guitar right now

281
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,400
I'd watch out

282
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,520
Yeah, that's part of the problem

283
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,480
Too many years spent filming my friend's bands

284
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,600
standing in front of the speakers

285
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,260
And now I'm in a situation

286
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,920
I hear these crickets all the time

287
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,420
I used to think they were real crickets

288
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,780
I moved to Ohio in the dead of winter

289
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,760
Princess, we would say,

290
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,700
Listen, hear that?

291
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,460
I'd go, yeah, I hear the crickets

292
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,680
What kind of vehicle did you use to move to Ohio?

293
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,400
I heard these crickets

294
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,800
I know these

295
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,720
Is there a history of this?

296
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,980
We used slaves, actually

297
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,040
to haul the church building itself

298
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,160
You must have got out just in time

299
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,200
Brick by brick

300
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,000
Well, this was Texas under George Bush

301
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,160
So it wasn't that expensive

302
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,660
You know, it wasn't a union

303
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,120
The unions were still out of it

304
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,120
They weren't there yet

305
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,860
We were able to move the church

306
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,160
stone by stone

307
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,760
so to speak, as it were

308
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,720
Brick by brick

309
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,920
floppy disc

310
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,060
by floppy disc

311
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,980
Did you move your frock brick by brick

312
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,080
or did you move it?

313
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,820
It was sort of like Easter

314
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,700
We moved the frock

315
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,600
Oh, I think I am

316
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,240
When they moved the building

317
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,380
they found something horrible underneath it

318
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,000
Well, I named my frock

319
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,720
Festering Expressence

320
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,520
and Spomam Patel

321
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,180
all those years

322
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,880
Dr. Drummond finally arrived

323
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,900
I heard Princess Wee's tackle

324
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,900
Actually, I was in a church building

325
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,640
I've been here just lurking about

326
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,580
listening and calculating

327
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,000
as it were

328
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,640
There she is

329
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,140
There she is

330
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,960
I've been repositioning my monitors

331
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,760
I've been recalibrating my whistle

332
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,320
There he is

333
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,100
Yeah, baby

334
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,040
We're swinging as we pucker

335
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,420
Get it

336
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,700
We're pinging and sluffering

337
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,820
You're swucker and pingerin'

338
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,500
Yeah, that's how you feel

339
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,600
The world's only brand new

340
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,180
Well, in that case

341
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,280
I gotta get my Walwart

342
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,280
Here you go

343
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,480
I have a Walwart

344
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,760
and I didn't say Wal-Mart

345
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,140
but I said Wal-Wart

346
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,920
Welcome to Wal-Mart

347
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,600
I love you

348
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,220
So, I'm just gonna say

349
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,480
Look, a price fell

350
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,880
How long will it be before all of us are working as greeters at Wal-Mart?

351
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:12,880


352
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,500
I'm gonna get a job there

353
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,260
Wal-Mart World

354
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,200
I already am

355
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,300
I know I can get a job there

356
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,820
because that will meet my standard of brain power

357
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,800
Well, they don't P-test you at Wal-Mart

358
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,280
That's one thing about it

359
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,740
I mean, they may not pay you well

360
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,260
or give you any benefits

361
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,360
but they don't P-test

362
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,480
They don't?

363
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,800
Welcome to Wal-Mart

364
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,380
They do?

365
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,720
Yes, and after 20 years

366
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,740
they give you a shirt

367
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:39,900
What if they give you a shirt

368
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,420
and don't pee?

369
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,060
No

370
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:41,400
And a cart?

371
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:41,680
No

372
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,380
You can live in that place

373
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,180
and they'd never know

374
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,100
People do

375
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,060
I do now

376
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:47,760
People do

377
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,260
But do they give you a sincerity test?

378
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,640
There's plenty of food

379
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,640
What fluid did they take out for a sincerity test?

380
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,160
There's a mattress to park on

381
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,460
I don't know

382
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,580
but it comes out of the base of your skull

383
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,300
Toilets open all night?

384
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:01,900
Yeah

385
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,120
Snack food galore?

386
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,280
TV's

387
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,680
His sincerity fluid is slightly too viscous

388
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,040
TV's, DVD's, Wal-Mart

389
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,040


390
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,820
Dr. Drummond would have to use somebody else's

391
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,240
I'm totally depleted on the sincerity solution

392
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:18,840
Clothing

393
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,000
You never run out of clothing in Wal-Mart

394
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,500
In fact, I was going to try to get a depletion allowance

395
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,000
for my lack of sincerity

396
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,840
If you were living in Wal-Mart, you'd be home now

397
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,960
I've got some synthetic

398
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,420
So the Reverend John Shirley

399
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,820
I think it should be worth some kind of government subsidy

400
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:39,380
The Piss Baptist must go on about his Piss Baptist duties

401
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:44,660
You know, there are 10,000 people lined up in the Grand Canyon waiting for me

402
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,860
And I'm a sincerian, you know

403
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,720
There's an enormous vat next to the Grand Canyon

404
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,380
that I use to keep my fluids, the other fluids, replenished and flowing

405
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,980
And everybody is very grateful

406
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,960
Let John Shirley's mercy rain down

407
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:07,320
You know, the Forest Service is not allowed to say how old the Grand Canyon is

408
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,180
That's what I've heard, yeah

409
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,880
They're not allowed to say this

410
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,760
They said they were going to change that policy

411
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,060
They were going to stop selling that book about how the Grand Canyon is only 4,000 years old

412
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,440
They haven't done it

413
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:23,360
Because that would infringe on the rights of creationists

414
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:29,060
to state theories of ancient science

415
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,620
Well, I'm really hungry

416
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,780
My stomach is rumbling

417
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,320
I read in the newspaper that 29% of Americans

418
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,740
I find this hard to believe

419
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,160
but some of them

420
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,540
Some new survey

421
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:46,120
29% of Americans believe that the sun revolves around the Earth

422
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,900
It doesn't?

423
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,000
Are you saying it doesn't?

424
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,840
Okay, 29.01, I guess

425
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,380
It sounds believable to me

426
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,200
I mean, I can believe in a supernatural being

427
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,420
that's been around since the beginning of time

428
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,500
with no evidence at all

429
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,460
Why can't I believe in something as equally believable

430
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,460
as what you claim?

431
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,560
That appears to be the logic

432
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,940
If I know you can believe

433
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,060
I'm not making it up

434
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,080
Anything that you want to believe

435
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,580
You can be what you want

436
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,160
You can believe what you want, too

437
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,680
Anything you want

438
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,880
Because when you grow up

439
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,480
You can do anything you want

440
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,100
I'm very proud of you, young man

441
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,300
My stomach is really rumbling

442
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,400
I know, it's playing a rumba, isn't it?

443
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,360
Do what thou won't

444
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,620
Do what he won't

445
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,440
You've heard, do what thou wilt, shall be thou won't

446
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,860
The whole of the law, but for the subjeetis it's

447
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,140
Do what they won't shall be the whole of the law

448
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:43,600
Do what Jesus won't

449
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,380
Do what they won't

450
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,540
The engine of the train

451
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:45,980
You will

452
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,180
Waves something like 80,000 times

453
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,300
They won't, but you will

454
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,040
What would Jesus not do?

455
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,680
Who would Jesus do?

456
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,320
I forget the actual weight, but it's

457
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,140
Magdalene this year

458
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,640
W-W-N-J

459
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,200
N-D-J

460
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,880
I can't drink it now

461
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,900
G-W-B-B-Q

462
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,100
Jesus won't

463
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:08,660
You really

464
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,000
You know it's like a hot pot

465
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,220
Princess Weah

466
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,800
And her throne

467
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,100
Somebody wants to get in

468
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,980
Her throne and her sacred microphone is ready

469
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,200
You know, it turned out Princess Weah was actually the daughter of

470
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,600
of

471
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,180
Darth Hater

472
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,480
The Doctor Goon

473
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,600
The Doctor Goon, the singer from outer space?

474
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,720
Yeah, Doctor Goon, one of those guys

475
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,060
One of those ass guys

476
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,860
amino acids

477
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,600
You like me?

478
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:45,280
I'm going to escort the Piss Baptist to his limousine helicopter.

479
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,500
Well, steering the show is sort of like trying to jump on a big man's baby.

480
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,640
Dear friend.

481
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:09,360
This is what it sounds like in my brain just before I go to bed.

482
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,320
I know that you think that sounds funny.

483
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:21,780
Okay, now I've got some catalogs here I want to read from.

484
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:22,620
Okay.

485
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,100
Do you have my catalogs ready?

486
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,300
I'm ready to recite my catalog copy now.

487
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:39,340
This is Charles Collins at a testing laboratory in Houston, Texas.

488
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,100
Switches have just been turned.

489
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,400
There was already so much money in there.

490
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,620
The human brain.

491
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,620
The human being is about to receive an outer sink.

492
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,560
That many fingers with lots of neurons.

493
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,000
It will never wrinkle or decay.

494
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:13,180
Have you ever asked yourself how much are major companies willing to pay you to create a show like this one?

495
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,760
It's true.

496
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,920
From health supplements to credit cards.

497
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,680
They do it because.

498
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,320
It's good.

499
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,700
And it can bring in millions.

500
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,700
This is like a dream come true.

501
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,640
I have a retired lifestyle and 39 bucks to spend.

502
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,600
But I didn't care.

503
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,900
Remember there's no risk.

504
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,700
No risk.

505
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,160
I was just so busy that I bought this.

506
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,580
I have no money.

507
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:52,580


508
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:52,580


509
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:52,960
No risk.

510
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,140
I'm going to go buy this.

511
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:56,140


512
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:56,140


513
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:56,140


514
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:56,140


515
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,620
Well, after a while that's gone.

516
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,940
I'm going to go buy a car.

517
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,580
No risk.

518
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,900
No risk.

519
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,120
I let go of my hair a long time ago.

520
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:30,500
It seemed to be getting like an ever increasingly disharmonious endeavor.

521
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:37,680
So I decided, along with my $10,000, to check in to the local.

522
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:47,160
I was reading Bob's note, and there I found out that he was a great guy and a very successful copywriter.

523
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,620
You'll be hearing a lot about him once you start our new program.

524
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,160
Oh yes, I almost forgot.

525
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,060
How swiftly can you change your career?

526
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,600
I like you.

527
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,280
Thank you.

528
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,880
You did it.

529
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,220
Wait for me out on the road.

530
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,740
I'll be right back.

531
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,520
Oh my God, this is still going on.

532
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,060
Okay, all right, all right.

533
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,640
We arranged the...

534
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,540
Let's do the show now.

535
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:04,480
The show can start now because we rearranged the studio into three sectors.

536
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,060
There's two sectors for...

537
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,720
Married people and their children.

538
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:16,060
And then there's the main room, which is for the lonely geeks.

539
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,220
Phineas, Don Joyce, and...

540
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,720
Sad old bachelors.

541
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,920
Weeping.

542
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,660
You can hear them weeping and hollering.

543
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,440
Over 300 years ago...

544
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,500
Ideally...

545
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,060
Tiny...

546
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:37,440
Great...

547
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:37,660
Great...

548
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,180
Wow.

549
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,000
Like they say, a boy.

550
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,140
Really?

551
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:50,960


552
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,200
It's a lie!

553
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,320
It's a lie!

554
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:55,700
Really.

555
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:01,520
Say it like I did when I was young and grew up in Freelance.

556
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:01,520


557
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:01,520


558
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:01,520


559
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:01,520


560
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:01,540
Small turned mud all over my body.

561
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,300
You wouldn't do it with a explosion.

562
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,040
You could live in a nuestra chinchin.

563
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:06,620
You've got to watch your board, don't you?

564
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:06,640


565
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,060
Uh, now what?

566
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:07,600
Wh-w-what is that?

567
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:07,620
My name's Tony Gonzalez.

568
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:07,620


569
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:07,620


570
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,080
just transgressed my personal space.

571
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,440
Violated.

572
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,900
He violated me.

573
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,680
I feel raped.

574
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,740
And it was good, too.

575
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,320
I loved it.

576
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,020
I loved violating your personal spaces.

577
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,860
I feel raped.

578
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,740
I feel used.

579
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,540
Yeah, because we here at the one pretty true church,

580
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,240
the first church of the last lap,

581
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,980
kicks a subgenie's ass every time.

582
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,020
Listen to that fake Texas accent.

583
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:34,880
Every time.

584
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,880
That is the fakest Southern accent.

585
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,180
Oh, you look at these boots.

586
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,760
Smell the bottom of my boots.

587
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,620
That's the fakest smelling cow hockey I ever smelt.

588
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,560
Well, just look at my...

589
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,360
Is that my tinnitus or is that the show?

590
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,160
It's the show, dear.

591
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,300
It's just the show.

592
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,520
It's gotten to where my hearing, really, it's true,

593
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,720
my hearing's gotten so bad that Princess Wee has to translate for me.

594
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,700
And she plays...

595
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,160
She plays tricks on me by mistranslating things.

596
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,380
The waitress says,

597
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,560
that'll be $30.

598
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,800
And Princess Wee says,

599
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,280
she says she wants to have a three-way.

600
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,020
And then I end up humiliated and embarrassed.

601
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,200
And they all think it's funny.

602
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:28,100
People make fun of old deaf persons like myself.

603
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,680
Now, I don't want to forget my students.

604
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:40,040
And the subgenius how to make your own cult, do's and don'ts.

605
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,480
Oh, K-Rob has arrived.

606
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,860
The mighty K-Rob.

607
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,340
That means the sound quality may improve.

608
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,360
Uh-huh.

609
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,300
Listeners, there is hope.

610
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,000
Undoubtedly.

611
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,000
What the fuck?

612
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,820
Oh, no.

613
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,660
Michael Pepe, as I suspected.

614
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,540
Michael Pepe.

615
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,180
Michael Pepe even arrived.

616
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,380
That means the station will be on the air for another half an hour or so.

617
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,940
Before the Pepe effect works in.

618
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,300
Before we're publicized.

619
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,940
Pepe kind of looks like Philo's new daughter.

620
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,940
Michael Pepe has a new...

621
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,060
This is Philo's daughter.

622
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,740
No, that's Philo, not his daughter.

623
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,500
Philo's daughter is the one with the mutton chops in the other room.

624
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,700
Yes, Dr. Drummond and Mrs. Chaos McBobcat

625
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:34,680
have a new daughter.

626
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:34,680


627
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,960
They have brought their baby, their new infant child, Michael Pepe.

628
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,180
You can hear it crying now.

629
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,340
Pardon me, Michael.

630
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,360
I'm in headphones and you're not on a mic, so I can't...

631
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,440
Nothing makes any...

632
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,740
You said something about how many eyes does it have?

633
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,060
Only three.

634
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:01,200
Actually, my nephew, Alex, today asked a question.

635
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,680
He seriously asked me,

636
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,680
Hey, if you had three eyes,

637
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,580
would you be able to see the fourth dimension?

638
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,980
And I said no, because the fourth dimension

639
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,920
isn't something that you see.

640
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,160
So eyes are not the sense organ you need.

641
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,760
Your time sense would be able to...

642
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,680
You smell in the future.

643
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,200
Somehow.

644
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,300
Is the sense the future sense of smell?

645
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,980
Will you see the fifth dimension?

646
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,720
Well, they broke up.

647
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,940
The fifth dimension, I think, broke up.

648
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,280
The fourth dimension is cool.

649
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,280
What is that noise in the background?

650
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,400
Is that the show?

651
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,220
Yeah, it's puzzling evidence.

652
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,360
He puts on weird things and he leaves.

653
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,600
He's holding on to something.

654
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,320
Michael Pepe, you have to get on a microphone

655
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,100
for anyone to hear you.

656
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,400
I'm deaf now,

657
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,620
so I've been reading your lips so far,

658
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,880
but the radio audience can't hear that.

659
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,740
I sat down and...

660
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,100
He thinks I'm joking.

661
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,920
These kids these days,

662
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,500
they just walk around like zombies.

663
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,180
We just cussed each other out in sign language.

664
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,500
Hey, I learned sign language the other day.

665
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,800
The sign...

666
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,680
Okay, radio listeners,

667
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,140
the sign for sex is this.

668
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:26,960
And the sign for cactus is this.

669
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,180
Spiky, spiky.

670
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,760
So when you see somebody

671
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,200
want to have kinky sex with,

672
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,380
you go like that,

673
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,720
and then spiky, spiky.

674
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,000
And then you go like...

675
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,520
The sex symbol, of course,

676
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,600
is the old temple of Devo

677
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,560
with the finger...

678
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,280
That's the formal, polite way of saying sex.

679
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,900
Now, if you turn your fingers around like this,

680
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,680
that's butt sex,

681
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,280
or in 69, it's like that.

682
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,220
The sex symbol, friends,

683
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,160
is actually two fingers

684
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,020
of each hand

685
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,320
tapping together on the end.

686
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,720
Like if you made two little fingers,

687
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,620
you could walk along the tabletop

688
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,620
using your fingers.

689
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,600
You put those two figures together

690
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,620
and tap them together.

691
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,900
Yeah, but Uranus is not a planet.

692
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,280
Uranus is not a planet.

693
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,400
My anus is.

694
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,600
You have to get on a microphone, Michael,

695
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,940
or it doesn't really...

696
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,460
Nothing you say really exists.

697
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,820
Is that Michael Poupe?

698
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,080
Now, my students listening...

699
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,580
Is that Michael Poupe?

700
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,240
Give me the hook.

701
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:27,940
Get the hook.

702
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:28,900
Get the hook.

703
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,900
Maybe logic.org class,

704
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,120
online class,

705
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:33,720
online class,

706
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,040
Church of the Subgenius,

707
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,020
should know

708
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,200
that this is the subgenius

709
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,960
business meeting.

710
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,380
Michael Poupe is here,

711
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,700
so I have to hook myself up.

712
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,280
Business meeting.

713
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,200
Well, what is the business?

714
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,240
The business is...

715
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,540
We're trying to untangle

716
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,420
the true history of the church.

717
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,460
Bob assigned us

718
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,320
to do a commission

719
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,400
to study the...

720
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,360
What went wrong

721
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,740
during the previous

722
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,220
church administration.

723
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,460
The previous administration

724
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,520
of the church

725
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,040
made many mistakes,

726
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,660
and we're trying to delineate

727
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,400
what happened

728
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,860
decade by decade

729
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,320
since, well,

730
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,900
for the last 100 years.

731
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,580
And then what happened?

732
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,280
The bad permit having to do

733
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:29,920
with the elimination

734
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,280
of the Gary Factor.

735
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,940
Once Gary was eliminated...

736
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,240
Well...

737
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,680
Not you, Bob.

738
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:33,720
Not you.

739
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,960
Gary's finally added up

740
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,720
to where the church

741
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,100
is going to suffer badly.

742
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,900
And right now...

743
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,060
Actually, that started

744
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,420
several years ago

745
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:46,900
on July 7th, 1987,

746
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,120
when Gary stormed out

747
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,140
of the studio saying,

748
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,540
I've had it with you guys.

749
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,320
Don't call me.

750
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,560
I'll call in the show.

751
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,860
I remember that.

752
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,600
That was the funniest thing

753
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,200
he ever did.

754
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:00,800
Who?

755
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,340
That was.

756
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,960
I hated to say that,

757
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,900
but I'm glad you just put that

758
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,640
out on the table

759
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,800
because I wanted to comment on that,

760
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,200
but I really didn't want to be the one

761
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,800
to bring the subject up.

762
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,200
I thought it was a great bit.

763
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,580
Now, one point of contention

764
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,300
is when exactly was

765
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,000
J.R. Bob Dobbs born?

766
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,700
Some say that it was

767
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,520
in the early 20s,

768
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,340
but we're looking now

769
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,160
at 1927 or 1929.

770
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,580
It was a midnight clear.

771
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,220
We know that.

772
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,280
Bob was born in my late 20s.

773
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,400
Yeah, we know it was

774
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,460
on a midnight clear

775
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,480
and we know that it was

776
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,460
in a cheap motel.

777
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,680
How else could they land?

778
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,700
We know that in 1945,

779
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,420
Bob killed Hitler again

780
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,360
and he met Philo in 1950

781
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,560
in college.

782
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,920
Well, you know,

783
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,060
that means I'm old.

784
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,240
Oh, yeah.

785
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,780
Yeah, Gramps.

786
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,120
Now, in 1953,

787
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,240
Bob was immaculated

788
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,960
and the countdown to X-Day began.

789
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,640
Unfortunately,

790
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,700
it ended prematurely

791
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,620
and had to start again,

792
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,600
but we don't know where to start exactly

793
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,880
because we don't know where it ends.

794
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,920
Welcome to school.

795
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,180
I'm Principal Bob McKenzie.

796
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,920
In 1955,

797
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,040
Bob had his second,

798
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,100
pre-vision.

799
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,940
My vice-principal, Doug.

800
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,360
And, uh,

801
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,220
in 1956,

802
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,760
Princess Wea

803
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,000
was born.

804
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,980
When did Bob get sternocryptal?

805
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,160
1955.

806
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,800
1955 sterno was pregnant?

807
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,440
1950 and five.

808
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,920
And then eight years later,

809
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,040
Jane was born.

810
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,520
That's right.

811
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,160
That's right.

812
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,120
It says so here.

813
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,620
In 1957,

814
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:10,040
some bad boys got me to sit on a cactus

815
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,480
by telling me it was the king's throne.

816
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,380
It was evil, evil, fast.

817
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,500
And, uh, I, my parents spent the afternoon

818
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:24,180
pulling tiny cactus spines out of my behind.

819
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,140
You're lucky you didn't have my parents.

820
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,820
They pounded the X spice into it.

821
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,740
Well, I was, I was spoiled.

822
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,260
I'll admit it.

823
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,500
I was a spoiled child.

824
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,320
Okay.

825
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,720
Please, I was born in a place like this.

826
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,680
I don't like this.

827
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,400
In 1959,

828
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,900
Bob started producing movies.

829
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,820
Like, uh,

830
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,240
Is this KPFA or is this DC?

831
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,140
Attack of the Giant Shrew People.

832
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:51,960
Is this KPFA or is this DC?

833
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,020
Uh, it's KP Yo Mama.

834
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,700
Uh, it's KP Yo Mama.

835
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,960
I didn't get that criticism.

836
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:00,680
I was...

837
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,660
KPFU?

838
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:01,720
I was...

839
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:01,720


840
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:01,720


841
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,580
It was undoubtedly a criticism,

842
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,860
but I couldn't make it out.

843
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,860
If you could call back and criticize us again,

844
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,280
we would very much appreciate it.

845
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,460
We'll all be quiet and listen to your criticisms.

846
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,860
Your constructive criticisms about...

847
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,900
He said something like,

848
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,880
Is this KPFA or is this...

849
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,660
And then I missed it.

850
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,720
So I don't know what we were being compared with.

851
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,020
Yeah.

852
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,840
It could be the mad God,

853
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,340
communist, insane, you know...

854
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,420
Grand people.

855
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,220
Yes.

856
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,440
I don't know.

857
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,020
I don't know.

858
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:31,360
I don't know.

859
00:35:31,360 --> 00:36:00,820
We should look up more people

860
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,200
requests from

861
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,860
Anything is possible today.

862
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,260
You don't hammer a nail.

863
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,980
The nail causes the hammer to go up and with the human gripping.

864
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,840
And how do you feel about that, Sam?

865
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:15,760
I feel satisfied that the church has progressed as predicted.

866
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,060
I'm scared.

867
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,920
If this was the year 1963.

868
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,960
The manor's still alive.

869
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,620
We are still alive.

870
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,620
Is this the noisiest show?

871
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:34,280
Oh, princess, we think how pleasant our show, our slack is.

872
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,260
I'm trying to control it, but it's out of hand.

873
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,480
It's got a Don Joyce of its own.

874
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,320
This is Walter Bloom at Times Square in New York City,

875
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,900
returning you to Charles Collins in Texas.

876
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,240
Five, four, three, two, one.

877
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,320
As I looked at the strange devices before me,

878
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:01,540
I find it difficult to understand or even believe.

879
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,400
I believe it.

880
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:09,160
I believe that this show sounds better when they play tapes of other shows on it.

881
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,800
Good work, everyone.

882
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,980
But I knew what to expect when I was born.

883
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,280
They told me.

884
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:24,000
They gave me instructions for life when I was born

885
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,820
and told me what to expect.

886
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,440
Unlike others.

887
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:28,900
They're just people.

888
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,880
They just have to blunder and bluff their way through.

889
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:40,220
Unfortunately, I lost the instruction book when I was about five.

890
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,800
I had to be toilet trained all over again.

891
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:49,540
We have a long day ahead of us, so we should begin with a two-hour recess.

892
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,420
I kept having to call tech support for life.

893
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,360
Get up and go out.

894
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,480
Go to your side.

895
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,760
Good day.

896
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,560
Okay, now we're starting.

897
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:58,600


898
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,180
I'm going to go to bed.

899
00:37:59,180 --> 00:37:59,600
I'm going to go to bed.

900
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,560
Okay.

901
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:04,820
Good.

902
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,140
Good night.

903
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,560
Good night.

904
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:06,560


905
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:06,560


906
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:06,560


907
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:06,560


908
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:06,560


909
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,240
This show reminds me of my hearing test, which I flunked.

910
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:10,540
My voice.

911
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,080
I'll wait until someone phones in where the pieces fell.

912
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,600
Gary Gebrogfred here has a special electronic guitar that, with every turn, he can play

913
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:28,600


914
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:28,600


915
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:33,500
Every time he touches one of the strings, it creates a whole new show.

916
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,760
It's like a sampler.

917
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:42,500
And each note of each string has a separate show that plays back.

918
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,200
Princess Wee is playing her messages over the microphone.

919
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,200
I'm going to go to bed.

920
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,000
I'm going to go to bed.

921
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,980
I'm going to go to bed.

922
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,580
I'm going to go to bed.

923
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:58,580


924
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:58,580


925
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:58,580


926
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,040
I'm going to go to bed.

927
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,040


928
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,040


929
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,040


930
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,040


931
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,040


932
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,040


933
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,040


934
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,040


935
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,040


936
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,820
I'll wait.

937
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,860
Then maybe we'll be finally knowing what the flying saucers are.

938
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,280
Who are the masters of the UFO?

939
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,480
Two to three to six feet, nine to twelve, twenty to six, twelve to three to nine.

940
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:28,520
Oh, no.

941
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:28,520


942
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,320
Standing next to me is a technical expert.

943
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:50,340
A fanatical group all together have a comfortable feeling that they're all friends of each other.

944
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:57,360
The people who are not on a microphone in the other studio are all laughing because they're having fun.

945
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:02,380
The people who are on microphones and listening to the show all look grim.

946
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,320
Maybe we should get off the microphones and join the party.

947
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,400
Just go jam. Just go jam out.

948
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:15,280
No, the jamming is happening right here. Gary is doing all the jamming.

949
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,960
I'm just waiting until you jam this thing.

950
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:23,180
He's been jamming it into the edge of the table and onto the equipment.

951
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:27,260
Jammed it into the microphone. Jammed it into his crowd.

952
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:34,920
Oh, clambering cacophony of symphonic proportion.

953
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,460
Uh, they're all very much exciting to see the true thing.

954
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:48,960
You can see it in any political party. There's always a fringe of fanatics in any political party.

955
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,340
So a lot of people think the world's his.

956
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,040
and 2012.

957
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:03,360
Yeah, but the reason I think that is because

958
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,780
of the Mayan calendar running out of numbers, right?

959
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,900
Right, that's Frank Zappa's birthday.

960
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,160
But that's just another bunch of arbitrary

961
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,200
numbers made by humans.

962
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,240
Why should nature and the exos and the world

963
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,660
ending depend on silly, arbitrary

964
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,800
human numbering traditions?

965
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,540
Oh, it's just a coincidence.

966
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:36,340
Oh, just a coincidence. Yeah, that's what they all say.

967
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:41,240
Except for the scientists who say that nothing is a coincidence

968
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,480
and it's all a meaningful, mystical message from Bob.

969
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,560
Well, the real good scientists.

970
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,900
The mystical message music now.

971
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,840
Let's get on with the mystical message.

972
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:04,060
I thought the music and the sound was itself the mystical message.

973
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,840
The answer, Mr. Collins, lies in a system called prepared curing.

974
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,720
I thought the bared curing was the mystical message.

975
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:16,740
A surface each person lives within is treated with a chemical

976
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:20,560
reactant in the cat. It is then dried at low temperatures

977
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,080
so as not to set the cat.

978
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,400
When we have the shape of each human being in question,

979
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,780
we eat it with this device.

980
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:34,760
The educational film in the background is describing where babies come from.

981
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,260
Chicago.

982
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,900
That's pretty much where my...

983
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:38,760
Yeah, Chicago.

984
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,880
That's where my dad explained it that way.

985
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:42,820
Really?

986
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,940
He said babies are poured into a little mold.

987
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:52,040
They have a mold, a person mold, and they pour the baby juice in there and the baby comes out.

988
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,220
That's what they mean by that? Yeah. That's what they mean by that? Yeah.

989
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:53,220


990
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:53,980
That's what they mean by breaking the mold.

991
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,340
Babies came from friendly 13-year-old girls.

992
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,140
Really?

993
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,280
Yeah.

994
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,040
Yeah.

995
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,620
I understand you think I'm right.

996
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:08,280
Babies come from friendly 13-year-old girls, he said.

997
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,700
That's what he said.

998
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,660
In some countries, that is correct.

999
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:12,260
Yes.

1000
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,120
In many countries, that's correct.

1001
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:22,000
As I keep reminding Princess We whenever we're watching a movie like Peter Pan or Lemony Snicket or Harry Potter.

1002
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,200
I go, look!

1003
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,420
You know, in many countries, those girls would be married by now.

1004
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,720
They'd be grandmothers.

1005
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,200
Not quite grandmothers, dear.

1006
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,280
There's nothing wrong with that.

1007
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,300
...to people in the third seat.

1008
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,660
There's nothing wrong with it, is there?

1009
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,900
I mean, not that there's anything wrong with it.

1010
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,000
That's what they always say when there really is something wrong with it.

1011
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:49,360
Why?

1012
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,980
Are you having some kind of attention deficit disorder?

1013
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:53,180
Are you having some kind of attention deficit disorder?

1014
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,220
They do.

1015
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,140
Is that what's wrong with you?

1016
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:01,060
And they feel a bit cozy with each other.

1017
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,100
Hey, Reverend Stang, I got a couple of extra catalogs over here.

1018
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:08,240
Oh, is it time to read catalogs, Dr. Drummond?

1019
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:08,440
Yeah.

1020
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,220
You know, that's my favorite part of this show.

1021
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,180
When you read the catalogs at random.

1022
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,220
Hold on a minute. I'm gonna bring one over to you.

1023
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:20,960
If it wasn't for that, I'd have nothing to edit out of your shows when I replay them on Hour of Slime.

1024
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,980
Yeah, I've edited the best catalog readings out.

1025
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,300
Oh, he really does have a catalog.

1026
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,480
He just handed one to me. Now I can say,

1027
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,880
Dynamite Discount Deals, Authentic,

1028
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,120
Freethlining, Real Leather,

1029
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,440
Bill Taker,

1030
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,580
I can't do it as well as Dr. Drummond, though.

1031
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:44,440
Nobody can read a catalog like Philo.

1032
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:50,500
Now it's easier than ever to stay connected with friends, family, and colleagues around the world.

1033
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,160
Philo, I notice that you're better at reading those catalogs.

1034
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:57,960
I read catalogs right when Dr. Howell is coming to a dramatic crescendo.

1035
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,100
Sleek, powerful, and completely portable.

1036
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,600
On the go, in the car, at home, or in the office.

1037
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,900
I've studied the dynamics of this show.

1038
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,380
The perfect self-contained system.

1039
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,700
Eliminate the hassles.

1040
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,800
But Dr. Drummond, what does that have to do with our topic?

1041
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,320
Always Make Clear.

1042
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,280
Hey, is Bishop Joey running away?

1043
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,580
You lucky son of a bitch.

1044
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:33,380
Don't you remember? Every third word, the listeners are supposed to take the whole show,

1045
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:38,260
cut it up into pieces, extract every third word, compile it,

1046
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:43,200
then recite it backwards for the arcane secret messages hidden within.

1047
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:50,180
We can't do it where it's too easy.

1048
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,300
We have to, you know, perform something.

1049
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:57,860
Some kind of upgrade, memory transfer, hard drive, uh, uh, refragmentation.

1050
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,620
Not a defrag this time, but a refrag.

1051
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,880
We're gonna refrag the hard drive.

1052
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,440
We don't know why we have to do it.

1053
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,680
We're possessed to do it.

1054
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,100
But in the meantime...

1055
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,720
...an instant plastic surgery, butchering murder.

1056
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:17,380
Are we gonna get to the, uh, the business portion of the show?

1057
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,720
When are we supposed to do the business meeting?

1058
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,260
What is the business?

1059
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:24,300
I've got a budget I gotta tell you guys about.

1060
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:34,680
How I legally robbed a bank last month for over $87,978 and got away with it.

1061
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,900
Well, let's split.

1062
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,260
Let's split the money? Okay.

1063
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,220
Both, both.

1064
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:48,740
I don't mind because I'll easily make that much this month.

1065
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:58,760
Okay.

1066
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:07,840
Okay, now I wanna know, how does the listener digest the show in such a way that it enters the brain pan according to the pre-scribed pathways?

1067
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,120
Hey, I drained my brain pan last night. What's your excuse?

1068
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,240
What did you see?

1069
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:19,580
I seen a flying saucer come down about a half mile from my ranch house.

1070
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:22,300
Started this morning when I was going after lost calves.

1071
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,440
He swears the saucer's undamaged, Dr. Brunson.

1072
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,280
Ha.

1073
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:26,840
Ha!

1074
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,000
Ha!

1075
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:28,900
Ha!

1076
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,280
Oh, gross!

1077
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,540
Test, test.

1078
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,760
Is this show still on?

1079
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:36,900
Chest, chest.

1080
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:37,700
Chest.

1081
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:38,760
Is this show still on?

1082
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,080
Chest.

1083
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:40,560
Chest.

1084
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,380
Chest.

1085
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:44,760
Chest.

1086
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:44,780


1087
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:44,880


1088
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:44,880


1089
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,000


1090
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:45,020


1091
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:46,140
Chest.

1092
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:49,620
Chest.

1093
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,480
Chest.

1094
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:56,660
Chest.

1095
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,040
Chest.

1096
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:58,040


1097
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:58,560
Chest.

1098
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:58,620
Chest.

1099
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:58,620


1100
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:58,620


1101
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:58,760
And there's the other question.

1102
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,660
Is this show still on?

1103
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,140
Ha.

1104
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,320
Ha!

1105
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:06,820


1106
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:06,820


1107
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:06,820


1108
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:06,820


1109
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:06,820


1110
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:06,820


1111
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:06,820


1112
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:06,820


1113
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:06,820


1114
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:07,080
Has the blessed one just turned out to be the best?

1115
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:07,080


1116
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:07,920
It's the best show right now.

1117
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,580
Yes, it's the best show so far.

1118
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:12,520
far from it.

1119
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:13,660
I did too, unfortunately.

1120
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,820
This is Charles Collins

1121
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:18,340
reporting on one of the miracles of our time.

1122
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,760
Sex disinformation tape.

1123
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,260
It's actually a commercial.

1124
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,560
We are ready to switch you over to a home

1125
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:28,800
in Cleveland, Ohio,

1126
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,460
where a family prepares for this experience.

1127
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:32,980
Now how coincidental is that?

1128
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:35,280
That's my house! Hey, they're showing our house!

1129
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,360
Talk about your coincidences.

1130
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:38,560
How can it be?

1131
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,400
Stand by, please.

1132
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,540
Stand by, please.

1133
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:43,740
What's happening?

1134
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:45,260
There's somebody standing next to our house.

1135
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,320
No, don't be anxious. Stand by, please.

1136
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:48,820
Wait a second.

1137
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,200
No, no, stand by.

1138
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,060
Can you just hop from one foot to the other?

1139
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,080
Please stand by.

1140
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:54,920
I'm hopping, I'm hopping.

1141
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:57,140
People, people, please stand by.

1142
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,320
You say hurry up.

1143
00:48:59,120 --> 00:48:59,600
Hello?

1144
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,340
Don't all rush around in a little gaggle of peace.

1145
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:03,920
I gotta go!

1146
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,200
What's going on here?

1147
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:07,220
Where's the bathroom?

1148
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,100
Keep your hands at your sides and stand by.

1149
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:12,180
Passing out.

1150
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:13,600
Don't touch anything.

1151
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,660
It's all pot.

1152
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,680
Stolen by Ivan Stang

1153
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,120
when he escaped from Texas

1154
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,580
in a 1953 Chevrolet.

1155
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,220
Two times.

1156
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:28,620
No, Philo has the prop, not me.

1157
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,280
Everybody accuses me of being the one with all the prop.

1158
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,060
It was Philo.

1159
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:35,160
That's what we're hoping, Pope.

1160
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,140
That's what we want from a Pope.

1161
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,180
You know, as a Pope myself,

1162
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:42,900
I did bring some, of course.

1163
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,400
You're a Pope?

1164
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,760
I'm a Pope.

1165
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:46,820
Yeah, I'm a Pope.

1166
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:47,660
We're all Popes.

1167
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:48,000
That's right.

1168
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,020
They call me Michael Popey, ladies and gentlemen.

1169
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:51,360
I'm a Pope with my old bathroom.

1170
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,460
They're just kidding.

1171
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,060
I thought you were like a favorite.

1172
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,320
I'm a Pope with my old bathroom.

1173
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:57,640
Yeah, I know.

1174
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,220
And Pope Pep and all that.

1175
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,060
Yeah, that'd be the second.

1176
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,280
It was the first King to know

1177
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,740
to have ordered pygmies to dance.

1178
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:05,380
This is all.

1179
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,020
Ladies and gentlemen,

1180
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,120
a new subgenius has entered the world.

1181
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,180
And he smiles immediately.

1182
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:12,520
He was, as I said that.

1183
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,620
Last year, I spent five weeks

1184
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,100
in this booby baby.

1185
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,720
So named for her diet.

1186
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,180
Her, excuse me,

1187
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,640
a genie, a subgeni.

1188
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:29,360
She's now picking her nose on the air.

1189
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:31,280
This is, of course,

1190
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,040
a natural subgenius reaction

1191
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,160
to being on the air.

1192
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,620
Actually, if you'll notice,

1193
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:40,740
the uber booby baby is wearing

1194
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:41,560
a natural reaction.

1195
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,640
The latest Bob bib.

1196
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:44,540
That's right.

1197
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:44,820
Everyone.

1198
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:49,000
There is also a bib with Bob on it.

1199
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,980
Bob the faceless.

1200
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,660
Oh, yeah.

1201
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:53,820
Birth defect.

1202
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,220
Yeah.

1203
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:56,780
Bob bib.

1204
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,220
I'm not kidding.

1205
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,340
You can actually go to

1206
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,780
CafePress.com.

1207
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,280
It's a genius shop.

1208
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,720
And there's a Bob bib

1209
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,160
as well as the Bob bib.

1210
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:06,620
I got your mail.

1211
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,560
This is a Christine Bob bib.

1212
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:13,340
It hasn't been drooled

1213
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:16,640
or vomited on in hours.

1214
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:17,760
She loves Bob.

1215
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,200
That's very clear.

1216
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,000
She loves Bob.

1217
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:21,340
It was.

1218
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,300
Pretty blue eyes.

1219
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,920
Your butts look big in those pants.

1220
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,120
What's her name?

1221
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,040
What's your daughter's name?

1222
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,580
Can you hear me?

1223
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,800
My daughter?

1224
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,220
Uber booby baby.

1225
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,940
That's on her first certificate.

1226
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,180
Uber booby baby.

1227
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:38,660
Drum it.

1228
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:39,460
Or

1229
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:39,460


1230
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:40,440
or

1231
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:40,640

1286
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,400
and praise the amino acids

1287
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,620
heard here in the background

1288
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:57,620
in their new album

1289
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:59,980
Humanity will fall like pins

1290
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,260
and will they not?

1291
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:04,020
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

1292
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,660
Dollar sign.

1293
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,200
Dollar sign.

1294
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:26,640
Dollar sign.

1295
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:29,820
