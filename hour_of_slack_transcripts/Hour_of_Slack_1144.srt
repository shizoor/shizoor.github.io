1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,380
Well, on a clear day I can see Stang.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,720
You know, I don't have much choice.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,840
Well, um, long time no see.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,240
Look out!

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,600
Now look what you've done. You hit the dynamite.

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,580
The sub-genius.

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,020
Power calls.

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,580
First thing I can get through it.

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:28,880
Shocking.

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,020
Shocking.

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,700
Here's Bob One for A1 Slacks.

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,460
Hi, I'm Bob One for A1 Slacks, and I'd like to take a moment of your time.

13
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,400
Thank you.

14
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,980
And I'd like to tell you about the nice folks down at A1 Slacks.

15
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,360
They handle a needle just the way your mother used to,

16
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,140
and the results are racers, capers, tapers, and bummers,

17
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,500
such as you've never worn before.

18
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,440
The Action Man's Go-Go Now Generation Happening Slacks

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,880
for the Go-Go Now Generation Action Man on campus.

20
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:52,700
And off.

21
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,380
And remember, you can get a good education and win valuable prizes, too.

22
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,160
Thank you, Bob.

23
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:57,780
You're welcome.

24
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,860
And now, back to...

25
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:08,260
And thank you for the message, Old Fireside Theater.

26
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,400
Well, it takes a while to get to it, friends,

27
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,820
but this is one of our more political episodes.

28
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,000
This hour of slack, number 1144,

29
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:28,220
uses excerpts from the Puzzling Evidence and John Hell shows in San Francisco and Berkeley.

30
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,400
With Puzzling Evidence,

31
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,820
Dr. Philodrum and Dr. Howell,

32
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,800
Dr. John Hell,

33
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,780
and K-Rob,

34
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,600
and me, Reverend Stang,

35
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,680
with my Winter Star sermon,

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,160
with bits of collage by Fernette and Annie Lemur,

37
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,860
and noralpref.com,

38
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,120
with Ancient Fireside Theater, thanks to Zontar,

39
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,000
and with Dr. Sinister's Radio Synesthesia from WCSB Cleveland,

40
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,460
with call-in guest Priestess Pisces,

41
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,000
Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

42
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,620
Governor Rocknar,

43
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,700
No Money Mark,

44
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,200
plus all money me,

45
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,840
and some news coming up of Jesus,

46
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,280
and Magdalene,

47
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,620
and their new baby,

48
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,360
and we may even get some rain.

49
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,680
But first, the Puzzling Evidence show.

50
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,820
In just a while, why don't you bring out our insect circus.

51
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,440
You'll split your sides laughing as you watch our earwig clowns

52
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,480
performing their more adorable,

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,060
horrible routines.

54
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,120
They have little suits on, I guess.

55
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,680
Yes, and they end with a squirt of horrible goo

56
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,380
right out of their upraised abdomens at you.

57
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,140
I'm Malcolm in the middle, but with an F.

58
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,160
Does that cost more?

59
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,200
Do you sit in the front row?

60
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,040
It's what we call the money shot.

61
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,840
It's a good thing I don't have a computer in front of me

62
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,300
every time I come to the show.

63
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,320
You know, it started with the flea circus,

64
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,180
and we expanded into the...

65
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,240
I'm looking at Centralia, Pennsylvania.

66
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,960
Is it still on fire?

67
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,140
It's still on fire.

68
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,880
It is on fire? Why?

69
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,620
It's just in.

70
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,360
Nothing's burning now.

71
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,840
But what about the tick circus?

72
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,960
Do they still have tick circuses?

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,580
They sell...

74
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,440
Centralia is going to burn for years.

75
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,520
Where the math kids get together and do trig.

76
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,700
They have the traveling leech show.

77
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,160
Underground trig.

78
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,900
Yeah, underground trig is really hot right now.

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,560
You go in the sewers of New York.

80
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,420
The sewers, I was about to mention those.

81
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,180
That's where these insect eruptions come from.

82
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,140
And math nerds.

83
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,860
And albino alligators.

84
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,100
Do trigonometry.

85
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,860
Yeah, real loud.

86
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,200
Stunts.

87
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,260
Yeah, because it's the only place they don't bother other people.

88
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,200
Hair trigonometry.

89
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:35,560
People.

90
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,540
I guess it's called people.

91
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,580
You can burn yourself just from walking in the woods.

92
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,360
You can burn yourself.

93
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,200
There's all these YouTube videos of kids hurting themselves

94
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,740
doing trig.

95
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,840
Yeah, you can burn yourself, buddy.

96
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,520
My candle burneth at both ends.

97
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,000
It will not last the night.

98
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,880
Tooth equals skinnage.

99
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,320
Skinnage?

100
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,780
You mean like...

101
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,260
Poor little cars out there by the railroad station.

102
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,360
Yeah, but that's terrible because it shows them burning pork sausage on the cover.

103
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,000
Well, they're going to put it on the tracks.

104
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,460
Yeah, here's the rock and roll funeral for Michael Pepe.

105
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,800
Sleeve cheese.

106
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,020
He was a titan among us.

107
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,140
And truly we shall not look upon his like again.

108
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:25,700
I've asked each and every one of you to step up and give a little reminiscence about Michael Pepe

109
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,400
and what he meant to us all.

110
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,840
Well, I'm going to start by throwing it open to Mavis Peebles.

111
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:41,940
She's going to talk about how the time Michael Pepe surprised her when she was on her way home from the grocery store.

112
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:49,880
Altered her view of the philosophical underpinnings of Western civilization.

113
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,080
Hard, hard, hard, hard to get hard.

114
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,240
Build institutions that are necessary for staged elections.

115
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,040
Duh.

116
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,460
Duh.

117
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:58,660
Duh.

118
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,160
Duh.

119
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,260
Eyes got wide.

120
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,920
Gitmo trials rigged.

121
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,300
Uh-huh.

122
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:02,760
Sort of.

123
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,800
Yeah, I thought so.

124
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,620
Deeply flawed.

125
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,520
Talk about.

126
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,140
Talk about.

127
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,820
Jag off.

128
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,400
Jag off.

129
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,000
Jag off.

130
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,520
Jag off.

131
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,280
Jag off.

132
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:09,700
Jag off.

133
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,080
Jag off.

134
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,420
Jag off.

135
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:10,720
Jag off.

136
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:10,980
Jag off.

137
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,240
Jag off.

138
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:11,480
Jag off.

139
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:11,580
Jag off.

140
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:11,960
Jag off.

141
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,660
We got, we got some people on the line here.

142
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,160
Let's, uh.

143
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,120
Dave is trying to call in.

144
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,600
Oh, gee.

145
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,340
Let's make room for Dave here.

146
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,340
Hello, you're on the air.

147
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,620
I heard you were on the air.

148
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,500
Yep.

149
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,460
Which is much worse than being on the cryptic science.

150
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:28,740
Cyanide.

151
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,780
I told you, I told you that thing was trying to call in.

152
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,680
And it would smell like it, too.

153
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,320
That's the first thing you would notice.

154
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,420
As your nostrils resemble the canals of Venice.

155
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,880
You talking about cyanide?

156
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,680
Kind of.

157
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,600
I actually kind of like the taste of cyanide.

158
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,160
Isn't that in almonds?

159
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:48,920
Yeah.

160
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,940
Yeah, that's kind of what it is.

161
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,160
It's like I make a tasty amaretto cookie, but instead of almond flavoring, I use cyanide.

162
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,600
It's a big hit.

163
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,260
Right.

164
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,160
It's a killer, man.

165
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,160
Almonds at one time were poisonous, but people eventually bred the cyanide content out.

166
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,880
They made them sweet instead of bitter.

167
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,180
You ever had a pluot?

168
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,340
Is it like a plum or an aristocrat?

169
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,440
It's like a cross between a plum and an apricot.

170
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,960
I thought it was something that happened in the bathroom.

171
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,380
It's something that happens before the bathroom.

172
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,100
Right.

173
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:27,240
If you ever crack open the pit and get the little kernel inside the pluot, it doesn't taste like almond.

174
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,140
It tastes like a plum.

175
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:28,600
It tastes like amaretto.

176
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,160
That's what we do with souls.

177
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,200
We go for the little kernel inside the pit in the soul.

178
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:32,920
And crack it.

179
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,060
Only you don't have to crack it open.

180
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,480
You have to coax it open.

181
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,360
Yeah.

182
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:43,580
But many of the yogis believe the soul is indivisible, much like our United Nations flag.

183
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,480
Boy, I'm having so much trouble hearing Dave.

184
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,380
And yet I can hear Dr. Sinister just fine.

185
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,020
Yeah, Dave, you're a little quiet.

186
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,000
Well, I'm having psychokinetics.

187
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,120
I'm seeing these weird diseases.

188
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,400
Designs in front of my eyes.

189
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,340
Did you hear what I just said?

190
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,960
Designs in front of your eyes.

191
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,840
Yeah, like they're a little cybernetic.

192
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,660
They're like little hallucinatory little trees sometimes.

193
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,620
And then they have different ornaments like as if it were a holiday.

194
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,580
You know, like Christmas or something hanging from it.

195
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,280
Except for all the things that are hanging are actually plutocratic politicians.

196
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,840
Dave, did you remember to eat today?

197
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:22,780
Pardon?

198
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,980
Did you remember to eat today?

199
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,780
I ate yesterday.

200
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:27,940
I...

201
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,900
Probably will eat tomorrow.

202
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,660
And I did eat today.

203
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,060
But I think it's rather futile trying to eat days when the days are trying to eat us, dang.

204
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,040
That's what time control is all about.

205
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,660
Boy, ain't that the truth.

206
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,140
You know, why eat a day when the day's already eaten you?

207
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,440
Ain't that the truth.

208
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,800
And it's a sad truth, too.

209
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,660
And that's why I went in my pants and cried.

210
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,340
And you can lose a lot of purity of essence.

211
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,400
You know, your precious bodily fluids just by thinking about it.

212
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,320
You can end up with a wronged erection.

213
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,380
A wronged?

214
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,820
There's never a wronged erection, is there?

215
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,800
Well, that's actually, that's the title of a new book,

216
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,900
A Survey of Victims of Teasing.

217
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,980
How about that primary erection we had last Tuesday?

218
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,300
What was it?

219
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,780
Was it an event or was it a non-event?

220
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,760
That's what, you know, I...

221
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,500
I was promised, I was promised flea erections and...

222
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,720
Oh, is that the flea, the new,

223
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,900
we were talking about the new,

224
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,100
the new subgenius flea circus that was...

225
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:28,640
Oh, flea circus.

226
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,420
Oh, we were touring, yeah.

227
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,140
Well, it's actually a tick circus.

228
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,260
Is it a tick circus or is it a flea erection?

229
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,760
It turns out ticks are a little easier to train than fleas.

230
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:36,940
Oh, sorry.

231
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,660
I was wondering if it is a tick circus or a flea erection.

232
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,600
Is that when fleas, like, play with erector sets?

233
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,760
Pardon?

234
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,660
Is that when fleas play with erector sets

235
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,780
or, like, they dance on something you've been with one?

236
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,520
There's no such a thing as a flea erection in this country anymore.

237
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,140
Imagine all the fleas who think that they're only erections

238
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,680
they've tried so hard to gain

239
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,260
are merely rigged by another unusual object.

240
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,460
I went out and did the dirty deed on Tuesday, though,

241
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,100
despite the terrible weather,

242
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,060
and I ran into my good Republican buddy walking in,

243
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,180
and he knows that I'm his good Democrat buddy,

244
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,320
even though, of course, I'm always horrified by the...

245
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,380
It's a lesser of two evils kind of...

246
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,480
Yeah, I say...

247
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,660
I say, why settle for the lesser of two evils

248
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,200
when you can get all the evil you want for twice...

249
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,540
for just a half the price, you know?

250
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,420
Well, that's what my friend ended up doing.

251
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,040
When we walked in, he goes,

252
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,020
well, I'm going to go in and filthy myself and do the dirty deed.

253
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,160
And I said, we had just finished it ourselves.

254
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:47,300
And I said, sorry, as a sort of a joke.

255
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,880
But it turned out, after I said that,

256
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:55,460
he decided instead of throwing his vote away on McCaskey,

257
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,400
he decided to do what Rush Limbaugh had suggested

258
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,600
to, quote, screw up the Democrats, unquote,

259
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,640
and vote for Hillary,

260
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,800
even though he was himself a Republican.

261
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,600
He registered as a Democrat that particular time

262
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,440
and voted for Hillary

263
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,380
because he figured that would...

264
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,480
In the long run,

265
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,340
that's what Rush has been telling his ditto heads.

266
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,320
Yeah, man.

267
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:21,980
Somehow.

268
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,580
It's a sad thing.

269
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,340
I think...

270
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,780
I think this year the barbarians were allowed to vote

271
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,940
for the Socratic ticket,

272
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,100
and the Socratic ticket was allowed to vote for the barbarians.

273
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,620
And a lot of the, you know,

274
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,740
the guys that wear the weird Valhalla helmets,

275
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,740
the Viking helmets,

276
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,120
and have large male breasts and stuff like that

277
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,320
were hollering for you to get out there.

278
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,740
I don't know who you is, you know,

279
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,560
or where they wanted us to get or anything.

280
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,780
They wanted you to vote?

281
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,400
Well, they wanted us to vote for the opposite.

282
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,300
We were supposed to vote according to that.

283
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,600
Oh, the barbarians wanted you to vote for Socrates

284
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,320
and the Socrates.

285
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,240
The Socraterians wanted you to vote for...

286
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,280
Well...

287
00:10:59,280 --> 00:10:59,880
Alley Oop.

288
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,440
Yeah.

289
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:00,880
Socrates.

290
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,780
Yes.

291
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,860
The members of the Socrates party

292
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,620
were telling me to vote for Alley Oop.

293
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,500
Right.

294
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,320
Well, this was a case where

295
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,260
the barbarians, the cavemen,

296
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,940
were telling everybody to vote for the Queen of Death.

297
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,460
Oh, yeah.

298
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,060
Anathema or Anathema Pus?

299
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,060
Because they figured, I assume,

300
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,020
that their guy would be able to beat...

301
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:29,640
the Queen of Death easier than Obama, Ben Hussein.

302
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,160
Yeah, but he wouldn't want it as his first lady

303
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,280
or else he'd have to kiss the goodbye note from that

304
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,720
when he put his hand on the biblical forms.

305
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,420
Good old Barry Hussein.

306
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,460
Yeah, they're all going with their feet smiling.

307
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,820
I actually have been...

308
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:48,300
I've been happy to see Obama do so well

309
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,280
because it's kind of reassuring, you know.

310
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,360
It's like, oh my gosh, I guess the human...

311
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,400
humans aren't as racist in the U.S. as I thought they were.

312
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,480
Yeah.

313
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,840
Well, this is a great hope,

314
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,320
but I think they're trying to rig the fleas.

315
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,120
On the other hand, I know people who think

316
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,160
that Obama is just another evil demagogue

317
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,420
and waiting, ready to be the next Huey Long or...

318
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,120
Yeah, I tell you what,

319
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,280
I am not impressed with Obama personally

320
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,700
like that much as a candidate.

321
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,540
I just really dislike Hillary Clinton.

322
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,960
And the way the campaign has...

323
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,180
been running the past few weeks

324
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,060
has only solidified my opinion on that.

325
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:28,760
I...

326
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,440
I don't really like anybody running for president

327
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:31,940
this time around.

328
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,480
Oh, of course, Ralph Nader.

329
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,780
Ralph Nader got into the race.

330
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,180
Now, that was just to make it so that

331
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,100
McCain was no longer the oldest guy in the race.

332
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,420
Victor, why don't you accept

333
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,660
the government's offer of a scientific post

334
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,340
and wait for politicians to make up their minds?

335
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,660
I am the last of the House of Frankenstein.

336
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,420
It is true, but how much time do you think that I have left?

337
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,000
Every hour is a day out of my life.

338
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,560
Every day, a month, every month, a year.

339
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,420
A month can see the end of my life.

340
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,200
Victor, why?

341
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,020
Why what?

342
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,100
My son...

343
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,100


344
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,100


345
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,100


346
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,100


347
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,100


348
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,100


349
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,220
Well, you're...

350
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,780
I was thinking about Abraham Lincoln

351
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,340
and the enemies of the truth.

352
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,180
But I could not tell

353
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:32,820
Kennedy

354
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,320
from John Wilkes Booth.

355
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,800
Now, out of my way.

356
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,220
Out of my way.

357
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,720
Out of my way.

358
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,400
Our dejar Union

359
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,600
On record and day

360
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,400
And I feel like

361
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,340
You're killing the place

362
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,940
With anybody who claims they're right

363
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,280
All the preachers, men, the politicians

364
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,900
All the grins and the things they write

365
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,280
Out of my way

366
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,800
Out of my way

367
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,220
Out of my way

368
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,220
Hot rockin' on record and day

369
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,940
And this is the call to arms

370
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,300
This is the call to hands

371
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,960
This is the call to the voices

372
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,260
And the mouths of the people

373
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,460
In every land

374
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,800
Out of my way

375
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,140
Out of my way

376
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,340
Out of my way

377
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,580
Out of my way

378
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,780
Out of my way

379
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,680
Hot rockin' on record and day

380
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,840
And we're takin'

381
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:38,160
The road to the future

382
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,620
And we're takin'

383
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,700
The history test

384
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,480
Of who's baddest and who is best

385
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,260
Lenin the brother

386
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,560
Lenin the sister

387
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,940
Lenin the communist

388
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,760
Out of my way

389
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,100
Out of my way

390
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,300
Out of my way

391
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,500
Out of my way

392
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,660
Out of my way

393
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,660
Hot rockin' on record and day

394
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,160
Place in the day

395
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,600
Put the money in the mattress

396
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,700
Place in the day

397
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,920
Put your pennies where they go

398
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,160
Place in the day

399
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,640
From the left to the leading

400
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,040
From the left to the leading

401
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,380
And this is what we wait for

402
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,340
And give me the tale the truth

403
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,780
Was I cool in the wisdom too

404
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,800
And though we never would admit it

405
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,080
Everybody knew we did it

406
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,820
When it burned down the board and moved

407
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,300
Out of my way

408
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,720
Out of my way

409
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,440
And we are the immigrant flock

410
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,900
The shipwrecked on Plymouth Rock

411
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,940
From the monitor and the Merrimack

412
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,400
From the pressure and the Pueblo

413
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,140
And the Titanic

414
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,020
From the pressure and the Pueblo and the Titanic

415
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,020


416
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:45,320
Which only we know

417
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:50,540
We left out trying

418
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:50,580
Just like we fucked

419
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:50,800
We left the ship that meant the kingdom

420
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,900
Ooh ooh ooh

421
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:59,540
Us a cow

422
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,980
We twisted the love

423
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:00,980


424
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:00,980


425
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:06,840
Did not go the way we went

426
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,000
Happy. Happy. We love that city

427
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,000


428
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,000


429
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,040
Mr. Speaker, a message from the Senate.

430
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:36,020
So it is, again, with a heavy heart that I see my colleague, Senator Bob, retire after a distinguished career.

431
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,000
He will not sit down and write a book.

432
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,020
And that book is entitled Bob Matters.

433
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:54,980
And it is a hope with other senators on this floor that Bob will be rendering the people of this country for some period of time.

434
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,580
In the great poem Ulysses, he says,

435
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:06,000
I am a part of Bob and I am much richer for him.

436
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,260
Four. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

437
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,660
You know, a lot of Democrats are disgusted with Hillary's tactics.

438
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,240
Yeah, actually, Hillary has suggested that the country be better off with McCain than Obama.

439
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,740
And that's not exactly how you run a primary election.

440
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:33,360
You know what I mean? You don't say that that a member of your own party is not, you know, who may well be the nominee is not as good a choice as your enemy.

441
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,800
You know, I mean, like, that's just not how.

442
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,520
All fair in love and war.

443
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,780
And of course, you know, particularly when it wins in the next dinner, all buddy, buddy again.

444
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,700
You know, it's like Rachel Maddow said, that's the way you talk.

445
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,180
If you want to be McCain's vice president.

446
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:47,880
Yep.

447
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:54,760
Now, who know if you were to say, like, let's have a like a game show or like a reality TV thing.

448
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,660
Let's marry Machiavelli.

449
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,640
And we'll say we'll have Machiavelli.

450
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,060
He'd be we could put him on the left or the right.

451
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,000
He's married to the queen of death or he.

452
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,220
I like Machiavelli.

453
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,860
He doesn't want to be married.

454
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,580
He did the queen of death.

455
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,760
But somebody has to marry Machiavelli.

456
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,360
And then they marry the queen of death.

457
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,140
That would be really freaking stupid, wouldn't it?

458
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,760
The queen of death is already taken.

459
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,260
Thank you.

460
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,480
But who is it?

461
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,780
Yeah, it wasn't.

462
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,340
But wasn't that the Reikens?

463
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,760
Yeah, that's what I thought.

464
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,400
Maybe it was Nancy.

465
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,140
At least she had that.

466
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,920
Well, at least I had the queen of death down.

467
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,740
Well, I mean, if you ask me, the real queen of death is Laura Bush or maybe Barbara Bush.

468
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,420
After those things.

469
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,860
She said about the old.

470
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,940
Oh, the poor people have it better living in the Super Bowl or whatever.

471
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,780
Well, Bush is not really a full.

472
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,020
It's not like a subgenius thing.

473
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,120
But she's not really a full and total human being.

474
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,020
She is what the Native American people call it.

475
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,560
Two hearts.

476
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,800
And part of her psyche is actually in a Doberman's.

477
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,120
Her second or whatever they call it.

478
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,360
Man, hold that thought, man.

479
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,620
We got to take another caller here.

480
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,120
Two one six six eight seven.

481
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,380
Three.

482
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:05,500
Five.

483
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:05,720
One.

484
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,020
Five.

485
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,140
You on the air?

486
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,820
Gentlemen, talk about the Bush twins.

487
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,820
Not the twins.

488
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,920
We're talking about the.

489
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:19,240
We were talking about who had the most attractive behind of the different presidential candidates.

490
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,300
Who's has the.

491
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,220
I mean, Obama has the swively hips.

492
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,960
Hillary is female.

493
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:30,120
McCain is, of course, a sagging old fellow trying to stay in shape.

494
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,820
And Obama has slightly smaller shoulders than Hillary.

495
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,700
And Obama has a very tall body.

496
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,560
He's very tall.

497
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,560
He looks like spaghetti.

498
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,080
But he's.

499
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,600
So what?

500
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,100
It's a personality and sexual contest.

501
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,620
Who do you find most sexually attractive?

502
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,740
Who do you want to have to see giving speeches on TV all the time?

503
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,980
Who would you pay twenty nine fifty to go see at a house of pornography in a film that

504
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,520
was rated by you?

505
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,380
Right.

506
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,740
So the deep question, gentlemen, my theory is the Bush twins.

507
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,040
I like to see them as a little as lesbian act.

508
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,800
You know, the whole system.

509
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,240
I think that's the thing that's going on there.

510
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,340
You know what I'm saying?

511
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,800
That would be wonderful, I think.

512
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:09,500
Exactly.

513
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,980
You know, and that's the dollar in my peep show slot.

514
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,260
Yeah, but they can't do that until their dad is out of the office.

515
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,860
Well, you know, before you hear a lot of what you want.

516
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,440
Yeah.

517
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,300
Before Daggett's out of office, all they can do is like go on drunken rampages.

518
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,420
And where was that anyway?

519
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,640
That one of them got arrested.

520
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,020
I would love to see them in a three way.

521
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,800
So it was an Argentine or something.

522
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:32,420
Yeah.

523
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,980
Well, you know, there you go.

524
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,500
I mean, you know what you're talking about.

525
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:39,200
That's the kind of thing that would end the partisanship.

526
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:45,680
I just don't understand why, why, why the right wing noise machine likes to make ugly

527
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,740
jokes about Chelsea Clinton, because frankly, I don't think she's kind of holy at first.

528
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,180
Come on.

529
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,060
At first, she was a holy looking, cute little friend.

530
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,880
She's cute right now.

531
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,840
Twelve years old.

532
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,200
She was 12 years old when her dad became three years old.

533
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,120
When her dad became president, you know, when her dad became president, she was 12 years

534
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,340
old.

535
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,480
And Rush Limbaugh was making fun of her for being ugly.

536
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,280
Like that's, you know, that is that's complex.

537
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:09,800
That's great.

538
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,500
I love it.

539
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:15,460
I've gone Chelsea stalking and there's several nice bikini shots of her out there on the

540
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:15,700
Internet.

541
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:21,620
Oh, you know, you want to go for philosophical reasons.

542
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,620
Lots of guys might pretend they would be picky that way.

543
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:32,320
But when you get down to it, I doubt seriously if most male members of the family would be

544
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:32,320


545
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:32,420
picky.

546
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:36,240
I mean, I don't know if the third chimpanzee species would actually turn their noses up.

547
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,060
Well, you know, we have careers for all the president's daughters.

548
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,320
Some head butts.

549
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,480
Diplomatic head butts.

550
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,740
Diplomatic head butts.

551
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,720
Diplomatic head butts.

552
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,360
Some head butts.

553
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,580
Diplomatic head butts.

554
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:00,840
But.

555
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,300
But.

556
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,300


557
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,300


558
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,300


559
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,300


560
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,300


561
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,300


562
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,300


563
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,300


564
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,300


565
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,300


566
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,300


567
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,300


568
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,300


569
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,300


570
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,300


571
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,800
But.

572
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:06,900
Sometimes.

573
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:06,900


574
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,320
But.

575
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:07,600
But.

576
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,280
But.

577
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,700
But.

578
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,900
성 Sleeping?

579
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,620
In sleep inside of bed.

580
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,880
Like I said, if I got up on the couch and had fun.

581
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:18,820
Yeah.

582
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:18,860
Drink some vodka.

583
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,540
MARCH scientist deeper than Heritage Hill.

584
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:20,540


585
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:20,540


586
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:20,540


587
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,300
Somebody took a bucket of BeckhamOMEXC liguería vlog.

588
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,780
Diplomatic head but.

589
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,140
Then other contributes to it.

590
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,400
That's the plan.

591
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,300
Oh, yeah.

592
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:32,300


593
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:32,300


594
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:32,300


595
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:32,300


596
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:32,300


597
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:32,300


598
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,320
Put cross lives together.

by Steve X and the song before that reckoning day was by the brain makers

600
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:44,600

604
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:15,020
saying that Roger said according to Andy Debbie told Andy that Roger told me that

605
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:21,360

get it happy burn day yes thank you thank you

611
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,940
I love hearing you guys talk about politics by the way and

612
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,020
I

613
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,620
and I know that the literature may not enjoy that so much but here in DC there

614
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:04,280
you guys are actually more informed in some ways and more interesting than the

615
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,040
radio pundits I listen to here I'm honestly confused and and this is the

616
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,300
thing actually politics are my favorite subject like some people are sports fans

617
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,280
I'm a political fan but I I just like a good clean argument that is

618
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,640
intellectually honest and we as subgeniuses we see through all the

619
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,240
political BS and I like to see candidate well you don't

620
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,980
No, some of us buy into it.

621
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,900
Honestly, like, yeah.

622
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,400
I mean, I think you kind of bought a lot of what's going on here.

623
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:37,120
Honestly, like, I'm just not impressed by anybody running for president this year.

624
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,080
No.

625
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:42,380
And some people are, and I don't see any substance.

626
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,520
You know, the ones with substance never seem to get anywhere.

627
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,780
You have your choice between a populist and populists are basically a lot like hippies.

628
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,540
Populists? Who's a populist?

629
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,980
We're Soviet-style.

630
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,300
I'm a lean populist.

631
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,200
I don't know about that.

632
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:00,820
Tell me about some of his populist actual policy proposals that are populist.

633
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,000
No, okay.

634
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:02,800
You're right.

635
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,840
Because a lot of his policy proposals are a little bit to the right of Clinton.

636
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,320
That's the funny thing.

637
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,160
A lot of his policy proposals are actually a little bit to the right of Clinton,

638
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,060
or, like, by that I mean, like, they would be a little less effective,

639
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,500
and, like, you know, you're throwing bones to the Republicans

640
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,780
when you spin your policy proposals a certain way, you know?

641
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,500
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

642
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:24,720
Absolutely.

643
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,960
He's going around saying that, like, Social Security is going to be in a crisis.

644
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,740
Like, you know, nobody who's done an honest look at that.

645
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,780
I mean, like, Medicare is one thing, but Social Security is something else entirely,

646
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,840
and it's kind of irresponsible to go around saying it's in a crisis.

647
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:44,920
Well, what is wrong in this country with wanting to bring health care costs down for everybody?

648
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,440
What is so wrong with that?

649
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,780
There's nothing wrong with that, but I'm saying his proposal is not going to be effective at that.

650
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,720
Let's imagine.

651
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,400
Hillary's. Hillary's is going to be even less effective.

652
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:54,480


653
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,460
You need to do some more reading, my friend.

654
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,460
You need to do some more reading.

655
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:04,200
First of all, the number one thing we need to keep in mind is this is basically an insurance-type system.

656
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:04,840
Right.

657
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,160
All right?

658
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:05,360
Right.

659
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,640
Is how it works, all right?

660
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:11,300
People pay money into it so that there's money there to grab when you need it.

661
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,220
Now, here's the thing.

662
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,800
When you don't have a mandate, when you don't have a mandate, when you say that,

663
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:21,240
and then you simultaneously say that, well, you can't be rejected because of preexisting conditions,

664
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,820
what you get there is people.

665
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,340
They stay out of the system when they're young and healthy and say,

666
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,700
eh, I don't need to pay for that.

667
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,300
And then when they get old and sick, suddenly they're signing up.

668
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:37,500
And do you see how quickly that would cause the system to fail financially?

669
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,940
You need to have healthy people involved in a health plan just as much as you need sick people involved in it.

670
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:53,240
Not to give away my employer too much, but one of the divisions of my company is a company that does information for doctors

671
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,400
on basically how to get.

672
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,520
the most money out of Medicare.

673
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,680
Oh, you slurred.

674
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,740
How dast you.

675
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,600
That's corrupt.

676
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,920
That's corruptigation, especially from the district of corruptigation.

677
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,000
And exactly.

678
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,020
Exactly.

679
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,980
But are you brought to you by health and human servants?

680
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,960
Basically, they are paying my company and paying me.

681
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:18,500
They're paying my company about, I don't know, $600 for about 12 pages a month of information

682
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:24,140
just to basically get as much money as they can out of the Medicare system.

683
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:24,780
Hmm.

684
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,560
For 12 pages of information, this is a job that we should all be in.

685
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,660
And I'm trying to figure out a way to do this for the church, the subgenius, where we can get,

686
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:35,200
send out 12 pages of information for about $600.

687
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,220
And when I will, I'll be on the phone with staying right away.

688
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,480
I'm working on it.

689
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,200
Well, if you do that, don't mention prices on the air here.

690
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,760
You know, like we were talking about Chelsea and do you think you would fit in that category

691
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,100
or would you just want to like smash me in the face for saying this now?

692
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,100
Oh, Chelsea?

693
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,120
What?

694
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:54,480
No.

695
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,240
No, she's cute.

696
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,240
She's cute.

697
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,960
I mean, but then I kind of like girls who are a little different.

698
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,400
I really couldn't imagine, you know, being involved with a Barbie doll.

699
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,380
Do you like humans that are different?

700
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:05,740
Right.

701
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,900
I mean, real different?

702
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,380
They're tiny humans?

703
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:19,300
Well, I mean, I'm currently have in my house right now a wonderful Yeti mutant who is my male consort of sorts.

704
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,880
Yeah, I know who you're talking about.

705
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,940
And he is a mutant.

706
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,840
That's for sure.

707
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,260
Oh, absolutely.

708
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,280
They cut that up and use it as a PSA just the way it is.

709
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,500
Or you can like add like a 15 donut in there and maybe have coffee with everyone.

710
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,380
Yeah, I mean.

711
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:40,640
No, that's the outro, which is worse, really, if you're from where you're from.

712
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:46,980
Now, you know, between Snake Plissken's escape from New York and his escape from L.A.,

713
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:53,640
there was an escape from Cleveland, which is referred to twice in Escape from L.A.

714
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:53,760
Yeah.

715
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,940
He escaped from Cleveland.

716
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,580
Yes.

717
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,940
And that was where he met Carjack Jones.

718
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,980
In the Unmade movie.

719
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:07,460
I was very surprised to find when he made it to L.A. that Carjack Jones was no longer a rough, tough man, but a large-breasted woman.

720
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,220
Boy, I missed that one, but it's certainly as progressive as...

721
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:18,160
Escape from L.A. has a Dobbs takeoff in it played by Reverend Bruce Campbell.

722
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,400
I saw that.

723
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,540
Named Dr. Dobbs.

724
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,320
I know, the insane plastic surgeon.

725
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,280
Yeah, and he looks kind of Bob-like.

726
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:31,640
Like a Bob who had been stitched together from people who didn't really look like Bob.

727
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,700
Does his face crack at one point?

728
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,680
It does.

729
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,720
That was a campy movie.

730
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,820
Whatever happened to the campy camp at Burning Man?

731
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,180
Or is that like every other one now?

732
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,640
Burning Man, you had to say it.

733
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,240
Oh, that's right.

734
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,140
That's not cool anymore.

735
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,280
Now you have to burn them.

736
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,900
You have to burn Burning Man before he's supposed to burn.

737
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,640
Or else you're just...

738
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,680
I'm going to laugh at you.

739
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,080
Everybody's going to...

740
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,240
To develop your fan base.

741
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:01,780
No.

742
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:06,060
There should be like 60,000 Burning Man, all the same size.

743
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:06,780
There are.

744
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,360
At the night of the burn, they all get burned at the same time.

745
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:15,340
Wouldn't it be great if everybody just stayed in their camp and burned their own Burning Man in their own camp by themselves?

746
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,840
Well, that's the way they used to do it.

747
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,080
And why go backwards?

748
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,380
Because going backwards is good.

749
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,180
We should go backwards to a time when...

750
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,340
Everyone spent their time by themselves.

751
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,980
A little five foot high Burning Man that you burn in your own camp.

752
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,840
In their own Burning Camp.

753
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,160
Whoop-de-doo.

754
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,000
Big deal.

755
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,020
A tiny little man.

756
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,320
Five foot tall.

757
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,560
No, five inch tall.

758
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,840
I'm telling you guys, out in the Midwest, there are burning little men.

759
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,680
Sure there are.

760
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,360
Sure there are.

761
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:42,940
There's little green ones.

762
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,380
They'll have two girls that juggle fire and two guys painted blue.

763
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,880
Have them sent to my tent.

764
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,180
Wow.

765
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,120
A little four foot high man that they burn.

766
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,220
And then instead of taking a whole week...

767
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,000
They do it like in three hours.

768
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,060
It's not to catch him, but nobody can.

769
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,420
There's one in every town.

770
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,040
There's like Austin has one.

771
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,940
There's one in every town.

772
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,420
Hello, I'm Dr. Howard.

773
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:08,000
And so like when you're driving through the middle of Fargo, North Dakota,

774
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,980
and you look over and somebody says,

775
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,760
Hey, have a good burn.

776
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,940
Hey, have a good burn.

777
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,980
You know exactly.

778
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,120
You go, yeah, you too.

779
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,500
Burn on, dude.

780
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,400
Burn on.

781
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,560
Ray Vaughn burners.

782
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,100
Ray Vaughn burners.

783
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,200
Ray Vaughn burners.

784
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,040
Save it for the burn.

785
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,300
Save it for the burn.

786
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:23,560
Save it for the judge.

787
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,760
Save it for Judge Punch, that old goat.

788
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,640
What's he up to lately?

789
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,400
I don't know.

790
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,340
It's all up in the air.

791
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,800
All we know is that Jesus and Magdalene have Conbo back.

792
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,200
And they have the new baby, Reverend Bonecracker.

793
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:46,720
Now, doesn't the ex-husband live with the judge now who's trying to keep him sober?

794
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,080
Yeah, they're both in prison.

795
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,860
The judge wants to keep the guy sober.

796
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,080
Judge Punch got together with him and they're now in Minot.

797
00:31:53,320 --> 00:32:03,160
Judge Judy sent Judge Punch and the biological father to Guantanamo Bay for terrorist activities.

798
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,740
And Judge Punch and Judy are giving demos in the Bay prison.

799
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,220
Right.

800
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,720
And here they are, hand in hand, walking to the prison yard.

801
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,900
Who's in rehab.

802
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,100
They got the drunk dad going through rehab.

803
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,600
Now I'm getting bored with it all.

804
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,480
Judge Punch is going to lose a lot of credibility if the dad doesn't stay sober.

805
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,920
He's lost all credibility with me.

806
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,200
Yeah, now they're just talking about.

807
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,320
Subgenius legal matters.

808
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,460
Who cares about that stuff?

809
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,100
Now, as I say.

810
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,280
Here's what they had to say.

811
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,740
I'm not saying.

812
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,700
But he did say this.

813
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:35,940
He said it wasn't a true inflammatory abscess component injection report.

814
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,320
Gentleman's time has expired.

815
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,260
Oh, Fred.

816
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,360
Thank you.

817
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:41,900
Thank you.

818
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,300
By the way, one other thing.

819
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,580
I'm getting in.

820
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,620
Yeah, right.

821
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,280
It's crazy down here by DuPont Circle.

822
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,840
People think that they're like religious leaders.

823
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:57,720
And fornicators and some of them like can fly and stuff like that is not, you know, no Kung

824
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,260
Fu movie I want to be in.

825
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:02,820
I can tell you, I live actually north of the D.C. area itself.

826
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,800
I live in Montgomery County, Maryland, because I cannot tolerate living within the district

827
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,880
lines because the district has a curse on it.

828
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,540
Whenever I go into it, I am immediately lost.

829
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:19,760
I think it has to do with too much pink energy and maybe the energy has to do with all the

830
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,740
occult symbols that you find in the way the streets were.

831
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,160
laid out.

832
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,920
Well, they are known to make people sick, especially if they've taken too many psychic

833
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:27,860
psychogenics.

834
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,480
And all of a sudden, all these things start to, you know, these strange like eyes and

835
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,640
pyramids on buildings and stuff like that.

836
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:39,700
And Gates, you know, is like, is this an embassy or am I just hallucinating like some demonic

837
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:40,480
nightmare?

838
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,660
And then you know, you pass out.

839
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,240
Oh, and then the streets that end.

840
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,940
Well, Washington isn't that bad of a city.

841
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,880
You go down the street and it ends and all you see in front of you are two guys in uniform

842
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,840
with machine guns.

843
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,720
And you go, oh, sorry.

844
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,440
I went the wrong way.

845
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,360
So you turn around and you say, well, why don't I make a right instead?

846
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,720
You go down the street and it ends and it's the Potomac.

847
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,620
Then you turn around again and you go down the street and it ends and there's guys with

848
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,420
machine guns again.

849
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,320
And eventually you do this for three hours and you go crazy.

850
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:11,580
And the guys with the machine guns are standing there watching you going, hmm, is she going

851
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:11,980
anywhere?

852
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,720
And some of them are exes too who are already here now.

853
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:16,900
Right.

854
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:20,860
I mean, who are waiting for me to go crazy because they know if I keep going down the

855
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,700
street and having this happen over and over.

856
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:27,380
And over again that, you know, the guys with machine guns will then feel the need to do

857
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:27,660
something.

858
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,220
Or they'll need to follow you around.

859
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:32,980
Maybe they want to date with you, even though you could say you're going with a Yeti mutant.

860
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,260
That doesn't mean much to the jar heads, you know.

861
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,100
No, no.

862
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,300
They'll just soon bite his nipples right off and jump in the swimming pool with them

863
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:39,660
afterwards.

864
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:45,480
Maybe if they, maybe if she specified which Yeti mutant she was going out with, that would

865
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,140
scare him away.

866
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,220
Yeah, it's possible.

867
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:47,480


868
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,060
I just said, oh, no, it's totally two beans.

869
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:52,420
And everybody would go, oh, two beans.

870
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:52,680
Oh, no.

871
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:52,680


872
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,480
Well, can we say that he was working for the Pentagon at one point?

873
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:56,620
Oh, yeah.

874
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:59,880
He actually is now working for NASA, actually.

875
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,020
Really?

876
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,020
Which went from the Pentagon to NASA.

877
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,660
And this is one of the nice things about doing what he does in this area is he works for

878
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,480
these various people for, I don't know, three months.

879
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,820
And then about the time that he realizes he hates everyone he works with, he gets another

880
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,460
job and he's working for another group of people.

881
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,680
So he's designing, he's setting up the manned landing on Mars for two days.

882
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,820
This comes in 2009, right?

883
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,480
Well, you know, for.

884
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,520
Oh, top secret, I get it.

885
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,520
Or is it a subhuman?

886
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:32,680
Once again, is it a mutant whose foot's gonna land on Mars?

887
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:38,960
Well, how are we gonna switch the planets back into their rightful places is the big

888
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,440
question.

889
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,420
Dangerous question, indeed.

890
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,520
Maybe disturbing.

891
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,680
Maybe disturbing.

892
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:44,580
Disturbing.

893
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,220
Disturbing.

894
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,380
143 million pounds of government officials.

895
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,700
At least 37 million pounds of the affected government officials.

896
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,660
That's three billion pounds.

897
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:58,140
lunch programs around the country. 35 million pounds of hot government officials tainted by

898
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:03,500
the processing of so-called downer government officials who sick to walk. Inability to walk

899
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:08,060
is sometimes a sign of so-called government officials disease, a brain wasting disorder.

900
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:13,080
Some sick government officials were prodded to stand with forklifts and water hoses.

901
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:13,880
Glad to be here.

902
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:17,060
Should they be going to McDonald's and asking hard questions?

903
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:17,900
Being mad.

904
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:22,240
Being mad. There is evidence of illness. I think there's a significant food safety risk

905
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:22,760
to the public.

906
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,660
Feel me in life.

907
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,460
Hey, hey.

908
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:28,100
Going to McDonald's and asking hard questions?

909
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:28,820
Thank you.

910
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:34,400
Okay, so anyway, I'm going to have some dinner and then dinner at eight.

911
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,760
Well, what's this about a big powwow at Philo's?

912
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,400
It's not a big powwow. It's a really tiny powwow.

913
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:45,460
Oh, there goes the end. That's the end of the world again.

914
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,980
But it's all fun and frolic.

915
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,300
But it's all fun and frolic.

916
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,560
It's prickly feet, frogs, and crow pies.

917
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,640
Because when you know the world's ending, you'll do things that you've waited all your life,

918
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,380
that you've put off all your life.

919
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,200
You go, oh my God, I've only got one minute left.

920
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,300
I always wanted to climb Mount Everest. I'm going to start right now.

921
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,280
And he got sick.

922
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,020
We have to take a shower first, all right?

923
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,000
I'll be right with you.

924
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,800
That's what X-Day is like.

925
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,880
I should have told him that that shower was, well, booby trapped.

926
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,280
He was gone, but the shower went on.

927
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,220
Now, when did this blessed event with the...

928
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,740
Magdalene occur? Just fairly recently, right?

929
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,880
On Christmas Day.

930
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,260
No kidding. Christmas Day?

931
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,440
Well, pretty close, yeah.

932
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:34,980
But what about that legend, the one referred to in Curse of the Werewolf,

933
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:41,960
about a child born on Christmas Day, and now it can evidence lycanthropic tendencies?

934
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,220
Oh, well.

935
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:47,240
Well, why do you think they called the kid Reverend Bonecracker?

936
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:47,760
Oh?

937
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,200
He was so savage that he cracked tiny little Magdalene's cockles.

938
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,540
Oh, that's terrible.

939
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,160
Well, it just meant it hurt to sit down for a while.

940
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,440
But she's all right now.

941
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:58,840
Yeah.

942
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,680
Well, that's good.

943
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,540
She's back to sitting.

944
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,460
Moms do that.

945
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,200
Yeah.

946
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,480
Yes, the child of Jesus and Magdalene.

947
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:13,460
I guess you could call Columbus, the Columbus they live in, the new Priory of Zion.

948
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,800
It's psych.

949
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,360
With the little sign saying, this place is terrible.

950
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,920
Oh, yes, it's like purgatory.

951
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:21,800
But the...

952
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,660
The legal...

953
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,200
The go-in here...

954
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,400
Bohu is over?

955
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,560
No.

956
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,020
It's all over.

957
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,780
No, and the bill paying will go on forever and ever and ever.

958
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,840
It's all over the floor.

959
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,460
Forever and ever.

960
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:36,440
It's all over the floor now.

961
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,280
Yes.

962
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:44,140
Subgenius is concerned about the plight of Jesus, Magdalene, and their child, Conbo.

963
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:50,820
Should look for the little donation button on subgenius.com.

964
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,380
In the news updates section.

965
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:59,640
Or go to modemac.com and start poking around.

966
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:04,680
Or just Google subgenius child custody case.

967
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:12,640
Is Modemac putting himself in charge of the financial donations and so on?

968
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:19,980
Modemac, who, by the way, is a sex god, has taken a lot of responsibility in general.

969
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,700
He's really quite...

970
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,080
A saint.

971
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,260
As well as a sex god.

972
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,960
It's sagging now?

973
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,720
This show is really sagging.

974
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,680
It's a little dumpy show?

975
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,200
The show does need exercise.

976
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,180
The show...

977
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,320
Let's go out on the balcony.

978
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,320
Looks like a gift for 20 bucks.

979
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:35,780
Let's go.

980
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,500
Maybe we should go out on the balcony.

981
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,180
Okay, yeah.

982
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,760
And sit on the wall.

983
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,160
But if we fall over, you'll have to do it really fast.

984
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:46,220
You know, the show's only on for another half an hour, right?

985
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:46,400
I know.

986
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:51,780
All the king's monkeys, his slugs, and his snails.

987
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,660
Because it's a church.

988
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,260
Restore.

989
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,700
Yeah, we didn't talk about Paul.

990
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,200
We didn't talk about John or Jerry or any of the old books.

991
00:39:59,220 --> 00:39:59,860
But it's a church.

992
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,520
You've got to expect...

993
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,720
We didn't talk about Mark.

994
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,080
Other Pauls.

995
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,340
We didn't talk about Billy and Jill.

996
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,880
Namby Pamby sat on a fence.

997
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,960
Namby Pamby tumbled from a fence.

998
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:17,500
All the queen's donkeys, her dog and her cat, could not restore Namby to where he was at.

999
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,040
The end of the world in this church is coming up soon.

1000
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,480
So I just thought I'd let everybody know.

1001
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,600
So, lumpus dumpus sat on a stile.

1002
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,620
I'll get back to you later, hon.

1003
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,020
All right.

1004
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,020
Lumpus fell off after a while.

1005
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,480
We have concerned callers here.

1006
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,620
People that love us and want us to do the good thing.

1007
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,720
All the king's spiders, his earrings and beads.

1008
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,320
What's that word you just used?

1009
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:37,720
Stashed.

1010
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,260
Some more thing.

1011
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:39,940
His smashed body.

1012
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,640
What the fuck thing?

1013
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,720
It's just something we say out here to be friendly.

1014
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,180
In case...

1015
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,100
So you don't commit...

1016
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,380
Well, sir, are we supposed to talk more about Bob or less about Bob?

1017
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,360
I never understood.

1018
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,380
I'm doing a show right now, right?

1019
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,860
Rudy Kazuti sat high on a ledge.

1020
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,180
You talk all the time about Bob.

1021
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,220
Nothing but Bob.

1022
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,200
Rudy Kazuti fell right off the edge.

1023
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,780
Killing him didn't do a damn bit of good.

1024
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,360
No.

1025
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,400
It only made it worse.

1026
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,380
It was supposed to improve sales.

1027
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:13,980
All the queen's puppies, her kitties and dogs, fed Rudy's smashed body to weasels and hogs.

1028
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:14,860
What are we going to do?

1029
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,180
You know, sales are in the toilet.

1030
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,080
Oh, then suddenly we were in...

1031
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,800
There comes the toilet humor again.

1032
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,780
No matter how much you...

1033
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:21,780


1034
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,020
Just go ahead and shoot them.

1035
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,080
All comes back.

1036
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,040
Do you think that's what...

1037
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,260
Why not?

1038
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:25,920
Why not?

1039
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:26,880
Maybe that's what...

1040
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,180
Why not?

1041
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,580
What the Benazir Bhutto thing was all about.

1042
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:29,960
Could be.

1043
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,160
The only way to get her elected was to kill her.

1044
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,020
Yeah, could be.

1045
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,120
It works like that.

1046
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:34,640
Yeah.

1047
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,120
Yeah.

1048
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,340
I was so sorry to hear that.

1049
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:43,840
As one subgenius put it, she was the only leader of a nuclear-armed nation that I ever

1050
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,620
had sexual feelings for.

1051
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:46,840
Okay.

1052
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,520
Yeah, obviously you didn't live in the 60s, man.

1053
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,280
Well...

1054
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,660
I think all the people are...

1055
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,320
Hot for Nixon.

1056
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,500
Hey, guy.

1057
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,200
Are you thinking of Madame Nune?

1058
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,280
Well, I...

1059
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:56,820
Madame Nune.

1060
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,320
Yes, the dragon lady.

1061
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,060
You know that gypsy with the gold tattoo?

1062
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,360
She was one of my favorites at 15.

1063
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,760
Because I was living out there near the Orient.

1064
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,280
I was...

1065
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:10,300
My object of desire was Corazon Aquino.

1066
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,720
Wow, now we're really getting somewhere.

1067
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,700
That squat little bespectacled lady.

1068
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:16,780
Easy, dude.

1069
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:17,260
Burn me on.

1070
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:17,760
Oh.

1071
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,740
Now, I'm going to burn the Stalerville.

1072
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,040
Yeah.

1073
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,600
Because, friends...

1074
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,480
Praise Bob.

1075
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,560
As long as...

1076
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,980
Now, notice it's not a 20 or a 10 or anything.

1077
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:37,460
As long as the aliens up above, the men from Planet X, can smell the smoke rising off this

1078
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:43,320
burning dollar, they'll know there's still a subgenius down here on Earth dumb enough

1079
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,660
to be worth saving.

1080
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,740
Praise Bob.

1081
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,700
And don't call the fire marshal.

1082
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,060
Please.

1083
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,480
Sometimes this gets a little tricky.

1084
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,900
One time we had a...

1085
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:08,560
I went on a short tour with a group of fellows called Circus Apocalypse, who were really,

1086
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:14,280
really funny sideshow freaks, you might say, or circus sideshow guys.

1087
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,140
They liked Jim Rose Circus.

1088
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:21,720
They would poke the screwdrivers in their noses and juggle.

1089
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,640
They would juggle knives, which they didn't really know how to do.

1090
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,000
And so they'd get cut a lot.

1091
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,580
That was part of the fun of it.

1092
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,500
Somebody got sick almost every...

1093
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,720
Talk about sickening.

1094
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:34,760
So I could make you people vomit if I did what they did.

1095
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:42,080
But one night, their juggling fire did set off the fire alarm.

1096
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,440
We were in Carnegie Auditorium in...

1097
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,200
In Pittsburgh?

1098
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,280
Pittsburgh.

1099
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:47,080
You were there.

1100
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,260
You were there, yes.

1101
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,660
And we all had to go out in the snow.

1102
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:51,700
And...

1103
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:57,340
And stand on the steps of the building in the freezing snow to listen to Dr. Legume

1104
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,660
deliver his subgenius rant.

1105
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:04,340
And I swear, friends, I felt like it was Planet of the Apes come to life.

1106
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,640
It was great.

1107
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:15,180
Now, technically, I got one thing to say, and it won't take long.

1108
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,820
But Bob Dobbs done been here, took a good shit, and gone.

1109
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,240
To quote...

1110
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,820
The great Rudy Ray Moore.

1111
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:25,920
Or Dolomite, as he's also known.

1112
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:28,560
We could...

1113
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,840
Can we turn on the projector now?

1114
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,960
Because it's dinner time, basically.

1115
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,560
At 6.45, it said dinner break.

1116
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,620
I am done.

1117
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,220
Except for selling.

1118
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:43,660
But we have...

1119
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:47,120
Last Starwood, I did...

1120
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,820
Well, I always videotape at Starwood, and so do a lot of us.

1121
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,680
But this is...

1122
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:52,880
This time, I edited it.

1123
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,940
And it's not completely edited, because there's...

1124
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:56,600
We don't have...

1125
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,080
I mean, we can't put it on YouTube.

1126
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:01,160
We can't show, sell copies, because it's...

1127
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,700
This version of it has too many people that we don't know.

1128
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:10,500
They didn't give us permission to show them dancing around a bonfire naked to their boss.

1129
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,020
And we're very sensitive about that.

1130
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:15,540
Believe me.

1131
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:21,220
That's one reason why I'm allowed to videotape at these things, because I know how that is.

1132
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:21,580
So...

1133
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:27,400
Good buy and good sales.

1134
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,300
You know, you've been...

1135
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,480
You know, on the radio since there, right?

1136
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:36,660
That's where we've been for a really long time, and we've been writing a lot of things

1137
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:36,660


1138
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:37,460
Do you gather at the end?

1139
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:38,340
I like it.

1140
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:38,380
I think this is the thing.

1141
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:40,780
You have to figure this thing out.

1142
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:41,580
So I work with same people.

1143
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:41,580


1144
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:41,580


1145
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:41,580


1146
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:42,320
But I think about it a lot, because at some point, we all know aboutieleness of the–

1147
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:42,340
LinkedIn friends are all the same.

1148
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:42,900
In a bad way.

1149
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,360
Yes.

1150
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:50,080
An今 힘들berg by people.

1151
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,060
That's another concept.

1152
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,220
Oh, we were going to do a question and answer.

1153
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:02,120
There was going to be a screen saving.

1154
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,460
Thank you to the guy with the devil horns on his head.

1155
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,240
I had to get mine removed.

1156
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,180
You can still see Bump from one of them up here.

1157
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,120
Are there any questions?

1158
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:15,340
Any questions?

1159
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,060
I'll answer the...

1160
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,360
Why is there air?

1161
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:24,880
Why is there air?

1162
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:31,500
You know, that was the title of a Bill Cosby album that my dad used to have.

1163
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:32,820
Blow up basketballs.

1164
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,240
Is that what it was for?

1165
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:34,560
Yes.

1166
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,780
I never did get the punchline.

1167
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:41,940
You asked me, over in a sarcastic manner, over at the sales table, you said,

1168
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,060
say, what's Bob's position on illegal aliens?

1169
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,320
Illegal aliens from Sirius.

1170
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:54,640
And channeling Bob himself, I replied, probably doggy style.

1171
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:04,520
Somebody, the other day it came up on one of the radio shows,

1172
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:10,460
somebody said, what would Bob do?

1173
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:10,940
Ha ha.

1174
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,780
And what wouldn't Bob do?

1175
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,180
Ha ha.

1176
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,460
But then we got, it's like, well, no.

1177
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:18,500
Among the presidential candidates, who would Bob do?

1178
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:27,140
And we realized that it would be simpler to answer the question, who wouldn't Bob do?

1179
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,800
And the answer, we decided, was Huckabee.

1180
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,860
Huckabee was the only one that Bob wouldn't do.

1181
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,240
I don't know if he had the tightest ass.

1182
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,020
Ha ha.

1183
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:43,840
He does have the tightest ass, Isaac.

1184
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:44,360
Ha ha.

1185
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:44,440
Ha ha.

1186
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:44,440


1187
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:44,440


1188
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:44,440


1189
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:44,440


1190
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:44,440


1191
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:44,440


1192
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:44,440


1193
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:44,560
Ha ha.

1194
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:44,960
Ha ha.

1195
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:44,960


1196
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:44,960


1197
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:44,960


1198
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,580
Isaac is right.

1199
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,320
Huckabee would have the tightest ass.

1200
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,780
I guess Bob wasn't thinking.

1201
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:57,840
The same question came up on all.slack, and somebody said, well, Obama's got those swively

1202
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,460
hips, which I thought was sort of cute.

1203
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:08,440
I had to say Hillary, because hers were the only ones that would be of much use to me

1204
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,040
personally, but I'm kind of small-minded that way.

1205
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,440
And I don't know.

1206
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:13,840
I don't know.

1207
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:16,980
I haven't been there.

1208
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,820
I'm sure I'm missing something.

1209
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,040
Ha ha ha.

1210
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,300
That's just the database.

1211
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,420
Shut the way back machine, Sherman.

1212
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,380
That's just the database, Morgan.

1213
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,280
It's impressive.

1214
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,480
Yeah, it's really fast.

1215
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:35,800
Well, I had to figure out what we did for the last 20 years, last year.

1216
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,560
Why?

1217
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,560
Is that somebody's...

1218
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,880
We had an outfit out here called Maybe Logic Academy.

1219
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:41,800
Oh.

1220
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:42,300
Awesome.

1221
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:42,780
Awesome.

1222
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:43,340
Awesome.

1223
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:43,420
Awesome.

1224
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:43,820
Awesome.

1225
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:43,820


1226
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:44,100


1227
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:44,100


1228
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:44,440
Awesome.

1229
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:44,440


1230
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:44,440


1231
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:44,440


1232
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:44,440


1233
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:44,440


1234
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:44,440


1235
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:44,440


1236
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:44,440


1237
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:44,440


1238
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:44,440


1239
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:44,440


1240
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:44,440


1241
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:44,440


1242
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:44,440


1243
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:47,820
We had an outfit out here called Maybe Logic Academy, and it was a little bit of a

1244
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:51,140
bit of a Robert Anton Wilson spinoff.

1245
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:53,880
That's what we've been referred to here.

1246
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:58,140
Ivan Stang is the guy who's the basis for these important events.

1247
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:02,860
Well, I'm the one who answers the phone at the office.

1248
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,580
Is that the guy who owns the van?

1249
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:05,400
Yeah.

1250
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:05,680
Yeah.

1251
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,640
He owns Devo.

1252
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:13,560
They had me teach a history course in how to run your own cult business.

1253
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:16,260
And the history of Church of the Sub-Gene.

1254
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:16,520
Oh, wow.

1255
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:21,820
And we had 50 students sign up, paying 100 bucks each.

1256
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:22,340
Yeah.

1257
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,580
So it was a profitable thing.

1258
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,460
We're going to do it again this year, or in 2008.

1259
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,120
Almost this year.

1260
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:30,460
I think in May.

1261
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,400
No, I'm talking about a distinguished faculty, including Douglas Rush.

1262
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:38,080
What makes up the curriculum?

1263
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:42,200
Well, in this case...

1264
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:42,840
Pedagogy.

1265
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:43,120
Pedagogy.

1266
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:44,220
Pedagogy.

1267
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:44,440
Pedagogy.

1268
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:44,440


1269
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:51,700
I made them listen to every audio tape that had ever been made, and watch every video,

1270
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,640
and look at scans of every...

1271
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,600
Ten years right there.

1272
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,040
...psychotic letter that I had ever had to read.

1273
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:57,900
Hey, you two are talking.

1274
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:58,840
We're watching it again.

1275
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,460
Do they still have to pay their $30?

1276
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,100
...throwning in Sub-Genius Vegas?

1277
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:02,740
Oh, yeah, sure.

1278
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:04,720
We all have to pay the $30.

1279
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,980
It's the graduate seminar.

1280
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:06,500
I did.

1281
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,140
I paid.

1282
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,560
I wrote the check.

1283
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,960
I never paid to go to Burning Man.

1284
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,400
I didn't even have to endorse the backup.

1285
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:14,180
Nor would I ever.

1286
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:14,320
Never.

1287
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,060
We had employees then.

1288
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:17,820
Now it's just...

1289
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,820
We're all janitor stang running the whole shop.

1290
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,180
The fleets of bombies.

1291
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,960
Cavernous interior.

1292
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,260
What kind of bombies?

1293
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:30,300
You know, we've had to downsize a bit.

1294
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:32,240
But the important thing is we're still here.

1295
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,660
Enron's not still here.

1296
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:34,840
That's right.

1297
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,080
But the church...

1298
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:41,220
The Sub-Genius Foundation is still at that sacred P.O. box.

1299
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,820
1-8-1-4-1-7.

1300
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:48,120
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1301
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,760
www.subgenius.com

1302
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:55,000
Making its way through the world.

1303
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:57,220
From one city to another every now and then.

1304
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,700
A vigorous and still living entity.

1305
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,100
Entity, entity, entity, entity.

1306
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,960
Don't gather round people.

1307
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,420
Wherever you roam.

1308
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:20,220
And admit that the waters around you have grown.

1309
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:25,080
Except that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.

1310
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:29,000
If your time to you is for saving.

1311
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,440
Then you better start swimming.

1312
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,900
Or you'll sink like a stone.

1313
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:39,100
For the times they are a-changing.

1314
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,180
And you'll be a-shaking.

1315
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,540
And you'll be a-shaking.

1316
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:49,080
And you'll be a-shaking.

1317
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,100
And you'll be a-shaking.

1318
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:54,780
Come mothers and fathers throughout the land.

1319
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:59,480
Don't criticize what you can't understand.

1320
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:04,380
Your sons and your daughters, they're beyond your command.

1321
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:08,760
Your old road is rapidly aging.

1322
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:12,420
Please get out of that new one.

1323
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:12,940
It's a new one.

1324
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:19,200
You can't lend a hand for the times they are a-changing.

1325
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:34,220
Come writers and critics who prophesy with your pens.

1326
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:39,160
Keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again.

1327
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,160
Don't speak too soon.

1328
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,120
For that wheel shall it spin.

1329
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:48,000
And there's no telling who that it's naming.

1330
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:54,140
For the loser now will be later to win.

1331
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:58,720
For the times they are a-changing.

1332
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,080
Yeah.

1333
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,800
This is the Congressman.

1334
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,900
Please heed the call.

1335
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,540
Don't stand in the doorway.

1336
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,940
Don't block up the hall.

1337
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:23,880
For he who gets hurt will be he who has stalled.

1338
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,020
The battle has started raging.

1339
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:33,900
We'll shatter your windows and clutter your walls.

1340
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,920
For the times they are a-changing.

1341
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:51,040
The line it is drawn.

1342
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,620
The curse it is cast.

1343
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,080
The slower now.

1344
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,780
Will later be fast.

1345
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:03,720
As the present now will later be past.

1346
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:07,680
The order is rapidly changing.

1347
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:13,580
And the first one now will later be last.

1348
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:18,020
For the times they are a-changing.

1349
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:28,760
The world will be a-changing.

1350
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,920
The world will be a-changing.

1351
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:39,480
And a thank you to whoever is buying the round.

1352
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:44,320
The Rainmakers are actually Bob Walkenhorst.

1353
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:48,000
Did that Bob Dylan cover.

1354
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,180
Recorded at The Record Bar, Kansas City, Missouri.

1355
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:54,040
TheRecordBar.com.

1356
00:54:54,040 --> 00:55:00,340
And also the earlier song, Reckonin' Day, from their old CD,

1357
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:05,520
was by Bob Walkenhorst and the Rainmakers, who are still around.

1358
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,920
See BobWalkenhorst.com.

1359
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:15,860
That's like Christopher Walken, but with Horst on the end of it.

1360
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,360
BobWalkenhorst.com.

1361
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,440
He's a true Bob.

1362
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:24,020
The background music, friends, is from the original,

1363
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:29,900
the ancient Lemuria, recreated by an Australian band called Reptoplasm.

1364
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,060
Lemuria, Songs of a Sunken Continent.

1365
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:38,460
This is actual music from the Lemurian composers

1366
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:42,460
from before that great land sunk into the ocean.

1367
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,720
And now a word from the Fireside Theater.

1368
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,720
Here's Bob One for A1 Slacks.

1369
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:51,560
Double your trousers, double your legs with A1 Racers tapers and...

1370
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,780
Hi, kids!

1371
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:55,440
And remember, you can take A1 Slacks out of the country,

1372
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:56,880
but you can never wear them out.

1373
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:57,580
Thank you, Bob.

1374
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:58,060
What?

1375
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,580
And now back to our movie.

1376
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:05,000
TheRevelationX.com.

1377
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:05,140
TheRevelationX.com?

1378
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,780
TheRevelationX.com is available at Walmart.com.

1379
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:08,800
Wow.

1380
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:09,440
There you go.

1381
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,460
That's kind of scary.

1382
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,440
I mean, in a very odd way.

1383
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,540
Like, what are they trying to prove?

1384
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,480
That they're true to Bob.

1385
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:18,880
Though how do you think they've grown so fast?

1386
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,940
Sam Walton and Bob were old golfing...

1387
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:22,700
Sam's Club.

1388
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:24,120
Everyone remembers that.

1389
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,320
Sam Walton.

1390
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,380
Sure, Sam's Club is golfing club.

1391
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:28,520
He's still to hand launch.

1392
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,240
America embraced the Waltons.

1393
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,120
Yeah, the Bilderberger Conference.

1394
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:33,520
Ah, Bilderberger.

1395
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:34,320
Yeah, helping with that dog.

1396
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,680
Was Bob at the Bilderberger Conference?

1397
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:36,300
Always.

1398
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,200
See a bohemian grove, too?

1399
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,100
Yeah, they frolic in front of the owl of Bob.

1400
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,320
And so forth.

1401
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,240
Smiling the whole time in the mud.

1402
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,620
I just can't, you know...

1403
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:47,980
I've been there, you know.

1404
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,840
But Bob wasn't Skull and Bones.

1405
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:51,640
He wasn't a member of the Skull and Bones.

1406
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,280
He didn't say that.

1407
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:55,180
Well, I don't think he went to Yale.

1408
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:55,660
Okay.

1409
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,340
Yeah, I don't believe that either, according to what I heard.

1410
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:01,140
But he's always partied with those guys.

1411
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:05,800
He was a big muckamuck in the conspiracy before he rebelled against them.

1412
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:17,200
He continued infiltrating the highest realms of the conspiracy long after he was aware of their war against Slav.

1413
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,340
He'll just stretch out here on top of this antenna.

1414
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,280
Big dark forest of central Europe.

1415
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:27,340
And for a while he thought that they were absolutely believers in the idea of Slav?

1416
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:28,040
No.

1417
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:28,700
Was he betrayed?

1418
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:29,220
No, not at all.

1419
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,440
Was there a Judas in the midst?

1420
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,560
He was the saint of sails.

1421
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:37,760
His sails magic allowed him to rise to the highest realms.

1422
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:42,040
He was hobnobbing with the Rockefellers and so forth.

1423
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:51,380
It's just that he realized the truth that Slav was more important than mere lucre or what the conspiracy calls success.

1424
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:51,620
Yeah.

1425
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:55,480
He saved John F. Kennedy.

1426
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:56,960
He saved Elvis.

1427
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,860
He helped them plot their dis- Jim Morrison.

1428
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,240
He helped plot their disappearances.

1429
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:03,640
I knew it.

1430
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,580
Jim Morrison's in Africa, isn't he?

1431
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,000
Yeah, yeah, I've been told that.

1432
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,000
Quite confident then.

1433
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,020
But is Elvis still alive?

1434
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:21,600
Elvis, I say this on radio to ensure disbelief, but Elvis and John Kennedy are both cab drivers in Argentina.

1435
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:24,740
Well, no, I shouldn't say that.

1436
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,580
They've got- both of them were cab drivers.

1437
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,760
They both died of old age recently.

1438
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,060
I was gonna say both of them at this point.

1439
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:34,260
They're not alive now, but they were-

1440
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,120
Kennedy especially.

1441
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,820
But you know, they just withdrawn from public view.

1442
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:45,840
That movie Bubba Hotep was closer to the truth than, you know, most people would think.

1443
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:49,540
From PR News in Washington, I'm Seriously Flawed.

1444
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,580
The consumer product safety news.

1445
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:55,660
The safety commission is reminding parents not to leave babies in cribs with turkeys.

1446
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:02,960
The agency says the turkeys can suffocate and that there were more than 240 turkey deaths from 2002 to 2004.

1447
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:08,240
Many turkeys suffocated lying face down on soft children in both Texas and Ohio.

1448
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:13,200
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said that in the meantime, this is PR News in Washington.

1449
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:16,900
PR comes from New York City and LA.com.
