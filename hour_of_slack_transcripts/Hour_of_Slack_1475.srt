1
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,140
Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the subgenius of OVSLUG.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,980
I feel real good. And then other times, I feel like I was going to get sick right in my stomach.

3
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,900
Well, that doesn't take much doing.

4
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:50,860
Yes, friends, we're still editing the recordings of X-Day, but luckily we have some shows from before X-Day.

5
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:59,360
This will be part two of Dr. Sinister's Radio Synesthesia, which follows our Slack every Sunday night on WCSB Cleveland.

6
00:00:59,560 --> 00:00:59,980
Thank you.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,680
So, away with the show. No, we want the show. We don't want to send it away. Whatever.

8
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:18,540
And, yeah, some not music in the background. Not music.

9
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,660
The artists themselves said it is not music.

10
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,420
What is it?

11
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,320
I don't know.

12
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,960
Sounds like music to me.

13
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,600
Sounds a lot like music to me.

14
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,600
Is it music to your ears?

15
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:29,980
Yes.

16
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,740
It's melodic.

17
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,020
It's not anti-music.

18
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:32,320
And rhythmic.

19
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,440
Thank God.

20
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,160
The name of the title.

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,840
How is it not music?

22
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,580
The title of the album is not music.

23
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:43,820
If there was one thing I could go back in time and remove from the book of the subgenius, it would be all that stuff about anti-music.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,520
Wasn't that Paul Maritas?

25
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:46,740
No.

26
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,840
Don't you think you'd rather take back...

27
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,440
No, no, no. That was Doctors for Bob, and they meant it.

28
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,360
When they said anti-music, they really meant it.

29
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,660
Don't you think you'd rather take back the date of July 5th, 1998?

30
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,080
It doesn't have anything to do with me.

31
00:01:59,320 --> 00:01:59,760
I...

32
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,300
I added...

33
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,140
Philo and I added that bit about anti-music.

34
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:12,300
July 5th, 1998 was given unto Bob by Jehovah One, the alien space god from some corporate sin galaxy.

35
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,780
You know, there's...

36
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,500
During his...

37
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,960
His immaculation.

38
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,880
The immaculation of Bob in 1953.

39
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,980
There have been a lot of cults out there throughout history that said the world was going to end on a particular date.

40
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,960
That date came and ended, and the cult...

41
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,740
Let's see.

42
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:29,740


43
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:29,740


44
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:29,740


45
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:29,740


46
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:29,740


47
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:29,740


48
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:29,740


49
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:29,740


50
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:29,740


51
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:29,740


52
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:29,740


53
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:29,740


54
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:29,740


55
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:29,740


56
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:29,740


57
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:29,740


58
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,140
Let's just say it did not prosper quite the way it did before that date came and went.

59
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,040
They were left with...

60
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,380
Jehovah's Witnesses have done great.

61
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:42,000
And they've predicted five specific ends of the world, and yet they're still going strong.

62
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,540
I'm one of Jehovah One's witnesses.

63
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,240
Yeah, well...

64
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,420
Ah.

65
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,600
They're very witless.

66
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,360
Jehovah's Witnesses.

67
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:48,400
Can I be a witness?

68
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,500
Yeah, but I've been hearing all night long on this radio station.

69
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,020
A bunch of Jehovah's Witnesses.

70
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,160
At the Kingdom Hall.

71
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,640
You know the best thing about Jehovah's Witnesses?

72
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,560
I will be done.

73
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,400
Well, actually, I gotta take that back.

74
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,680
The best thing about Jehovah's Witnesses is they have Prince now.

75
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,360
The second best thing about Jehovah's Witnesses is they don't vote.

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,740
They have Prince?

77
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:11,920
Yes.

78
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,500
Yes.

79
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,620
Hey, speaking of Prince...

80
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,560
Are these formerly known as Prince?

81
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,400
On Saturday night at...

82
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,420
They used to have Michael Jackson.

83
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:18,760
X Day.

84
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,540
Morris Day and the Time.

85
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,320
That's right.

86
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,940
At our special event.

87
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,840
Morris Day and the Time will be at X Day.

88
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,480
They'll be playing Saturday night.

89
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,200
Don't you wish you'd signed...

90
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,360
I've signed up because now it's too late.

91
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,040
Or is it?

92
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,500
No, I've really gotta make it...

93
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:33,780
Oh, it's not too late.

94
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,100
We're having a seance and a Beatles reunion.

95
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,680
With real Beatles.

96
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,760
We're...

97
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,980
The Dung Beatles.

98
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,000
The Tenacious D has agreed to conduct the Bobby Awards.

99
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:46,620
Wow.

100
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,180
And Penn and Teller will be special guests on the Hour of Slack,

101
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,820
although I expect Teller probably won't.

102
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,360
I thought it was at 8 a.m. actually.

103
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,420
He does talk, but not professionally.

104
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,640
Well, what doesn't kill...

105
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,660
What doesn't kill you makes you richer.

106
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,480
The Rolling Stones canceled, by the way,

107
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,700
and I'm not at all surprised.

108
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,360
They needed their Metamucil.

109
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,560
It wasn't.

110
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,460
It was that they didn't want to play...

111
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,080
By the way, you've been making...

112
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,280
...after the swinging love corpses.

113
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,380
That's a hard act to follow.

114
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,220
And I had to, and that's...

115
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:19,660
Right, exactly.

116
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,900
By the way, you've all been making jokes

117
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,480
about how old the Rolling Stones are

118
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,540
since they were younger than you are now.

119
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,520
Well, that's true.

120
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,540
That's easy.

121
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,400
They are...

122
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,540
Real, real easy.

123
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,200
It's all right to poke fun at mortals, isn't it?

124
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,320
Hello, you're on the air.

125
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,720
Hello, subgenii.

126
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,420
Hello, hello, hello.

127
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,560
It's no money, Mark.

128
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,020
No money, Mark.

129
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,880
We know why we won't see you at Wisteria.

130
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,600
No money.

131
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,280
That's it.

132
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,180
Yeah, sorry about that,

133
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,980
but I did want to ask you something.

134
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,240
Will the flying spaghetti monster be there?

135
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,180
Of course.

136
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,800
I'm sure he will.

137
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,320
He's ubiquitous.

138
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,760
Yeah, he's always...

139
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,680
He's one of the biggest fans

140
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,980
and butt kissers of J.R. Bob Dog.

141
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,240
That flying spaghetti monster

142
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,940
was one of the earliest bobbies.

143
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,640
We deprogrammed him.

144
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,860
We sent him on his way,

145
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,940
and he's done pretty well.

146
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,380
Actually, it's a tentacular,

147
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,960
undifferentiated mass

148
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,720
dripping with red sauce.

149
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,760
We've all been touched by his noodley appendage.

150
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,460
My God's bigger than your God.

151
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,780
My God's better than your...

152
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,980
Well, I'm subgenius.

153
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,660
This Astro Sturgis ripped off...

154
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,600
The Discordians.

155
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,520
My God, he's a Sturgis boy.

156
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:32,960
...was first,

157
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,600
and the diminuses just ripped him off.

158
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,720
Hilarious.

159
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,320
These people don't understand

160
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,060
that there is such a thing as prefiguration.

161
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,500
Just as Apollonius of Tyana

162
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,360
prefigured the Christ of the early Christians,

163
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:54,380
so did these early primitive fumblings

164
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:58,140
manage to suggest the refined doctrine...

165
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:58,240
It's ludely appendage.

166
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,700
...which would come later.

167
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,960
In fact, which comes terminally, ultimately.

168
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,720
You know, nobody ever accuses us

169
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,560
of ripping off the Boo-Hoo Bible.

170
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,960
Do you remember that one?

171
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,260
What about Art Kleps?

172
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,080
I've got a copy.

173
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:10,940
Right, Art Kleps.

174
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,220
Art Kleps and the Boo-Hoo Bible.

175
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,560
No, I have not heard of this Boo-Hoo Bible.

176
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,260
I had that long before I ever...

177
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,360
It was the sacred Bible of the hippies years ago.

178
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,300
Yeah, predated the Discordians.

179
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,100
And a most entertaining book.

180
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,720
So you can find a copy of anything online,

181
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,360
although I doubt if it can get there by X day.

182
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,900
But you could try to order the...

183
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,180
Art Kleps was the chief Boo-Hoo of the...

184
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,420
The Boo-Hoos.

185
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,520
Yes, of the Boo-Hoos.

186
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,280
And he wrote the Boo-Hoo Bible,

187
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,300
or compiled it from sacred sources.

188
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,060
And frankly...

189
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,960
What about the Bobo Bible?

190
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,360
For me, the Merry Pranksters

191
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,920
was the most influential religious organization.

192
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,840
And the Church of the Blinding Light, too.

193
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,600
Either you're on the bus or you're off the bus.

194
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,480
Blinding by the light.

195
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,580
Oh, blinding light.

196
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,680
Oh, light that blinds.

197
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,880
Ken Kesey was a subjugator.

198
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,080
A subgenius minister, by the way.

199
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,460
I cannot see.

200
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,420
Yes, I know.

201
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,460
Look out for me.

202
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,820
You know what?

203
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,900
Frequently on this program, we'll sit around...

204
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,520
The few people who still call in,

205
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,200
we'll be talking about the people who used to call in.

206
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,480
Yeah, if you're so tough.

207
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,020
And what I really aspire to,

208
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,160
what I really aspire to,

209
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,900
is to be able to talk about people who used to call in...

210
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,420
Sex music.

211
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,360
And have them be as notable

212
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,380
as the people who used to be subgenie.

213
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,240
Well, it's your show.

214
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:27,820
If I could...

215
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:27,960
You ought to do that.

216
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,520
If I could have that going for me,

217
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,600
I'd feel like I accomplished something in life.

218
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,220
The people who used to be subgeniuses.

219
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,480
The people under the stairs.

220
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,660
What the hell went wrong with them?

221
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,080
Did they get deprogrammed?

222
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,240
No, usually what happens is

223
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:53,300
we have to kind of discontinue their line,

224
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,320
usually due to sexual predator behavior.

225
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:57,760
Their line...

226
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,240
Revenstein has gone out through all the earth

227
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,620
and their words unto the end of the world.

228
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:00,960
That's been, unfortunately,

229
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,480
the most common reason for banishment

230
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,420
is predatory sexual behavior.

231
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,380
Can you tell me...

232
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,920
I hate to say it.

233
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,220
I'm not going to ask you to name names.

234
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:10,940
But I kind of love to.

235
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,520
I'm not going to ask you to name names

236
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,160
if they're not already in the public record,

237
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,180
but what can you say about it?

238
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,760
Name names and break the muck.

239
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,400
Because, actually, Revenstein,

240
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,600
you know, you proposed a voyage to Germany.

241
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,780
How about that?

242
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,820
Yeah, Revenstein.

243
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,560
What about that?

244
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,740
Proposed by a friend of the family,

245
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,020
who lives over there.

246
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,920
I want to go to Germany.

247
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,220
I was creeped out by that proposition at first.

248
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,480
But you insisted that these people were legit.

249
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,960
And I trusted your judgment.

250
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,560
Because if anybody is used to dealing with weirdos

251
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,640
and sniffing out sketchy business from miles away,

252
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,680
I would trust your judgment on that matter

253
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,500
if nobody else's.

254
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,540
The heron wolf.

255
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,500
Well, if I said that,

256
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,640
then you better pick up on it.

257
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,180
You have seen some very disturbing behavior

258
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,720
from humans.

259
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,240
I've developed pretty good cridor.

260
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,860
So, like, what kind of...

261
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,960
Over the years.

262
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:01,800
I mean, like,

263
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,300
we need more anecdotes on this program.

264
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,760
Because we can't get an antidote

265
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,080
to the poison that this show is,

266
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,720
so we'll have to settle for anecdotes.

267
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,320
The Church of the Subgenius

268
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,660
is the antidote to all placebos.

269
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,040
So you can get rid of those old...

270
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,480
Anything that was making you feel good before,

271
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,680
after the Church of the Subgenius is done with it,

272
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,620
it won't help you ever again.

273
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,920
You could probably tell...

274
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,720
Placebos will all be useless.

275
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,200
But you could probably tell some very disturbing stories

276
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,360
about people who have gotten involved

277
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,740
with your movement in the past and...

278
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,100
Without naming names.

279
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:38,800
And...

280
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,840
Yeah, we can't.

281
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,100
And made a disgrace of themselves.

282
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,240
We're not trying to humiliate anybody.

283
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,660
They did that for themselves, but...

284
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,940
We'd love to hear more of those stories.

285
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,280
Well, it's up to you, Stang,

286
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,600
if you want to open the secret archives

287
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,120
of the Church of the Subgenius.

288
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,500
They wiped my memory of that sort of thing.

289
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,900
I'm not allowed to criticize the tribe.

290
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,860
I went through the...

291
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:56,900
I went through the...

292
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,660
re-education camps.

293
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,260
I can't...

294
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,880
It's in blank to all that stuff.

295
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,080
I was the worst one.

296
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,160
What about the Department of Information?

297
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,240
I can tell you all the stupid things I did.

298
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,060
Oh, wait.

299
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,660
I'm still in the middle of it, though.

300
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,500
That's the problem with these kind of stories.

301
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,380
You sit down to try to write the history

302
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,820
of the Church of the Subgenius,

303
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,520
and all that comes out is more stuff

304
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,700
to put in the next history of the Church of the Subgenius.

305
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,500
Here, Stang, your stories are most convincing.

306
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:25,960
Clip seeds.

307
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,120
I...

308
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,420
We've got another caller here.

309
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,160
Okay, let's have him.

310
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,220
You're on the air.

311
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,240
Hello?

312
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,640
Hey, Dr. Sinister.

313
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,840
What happened to Dave?

314
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,420
I don't know what happened to Dave.

315
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:39,860
He...

316
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,860
Hopefully he'll be back.

317
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,060
We'll meet again some sunny day,

318
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,400
but new caller, you're on the air.

319
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,000
Dr. Sinister.

320
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:46,780
That's me.

321
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,860
This is a rhetorical question.

322
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,760
I love rhetorical questions.

323
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,700
Am I a dumb shit?

324
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,360
Stupid ass dumb fuck?

325
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:56,760
Or what?

326
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,120
I'm going to guess yes, you are.

327
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,080
Well...

328
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,860
Only because I think that most people are.

329
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,040
There's a...

330
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,320
And since you sound like a person...

331
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,840
That's a sad, sorry way to be, I guess.

332
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,580
Since you are...

333
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,420
That's my comment on that.

334
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,760
You sound like a person.

335
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,120
And I'm going to guess that you actually are a person,

336
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,180
so I think statistically, if I had to...

337
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,140
If I were a gambling man...

338
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,080
Oh, you're going to pick me apart now?

339
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,840
No, I'm not going to take you apart.

340
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,740
Peace. Bye.

341
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,860
But you know what?

342
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,120
I'm an idiot myself.

343
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:25,740
Really?

344
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,340
Yeah.

345
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,380
Don't let my fancy big words fool you.

346
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,240
I'm an idiot.

347
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,820
I haven't heard any fancy big words.

348
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,560
Yeah.

349
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:36,720
You're not...

350
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,440
You don't seem like the pusillanimous type.

351
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,500
Pusillanimous?

352
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:42,960
Yeah.

353
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,360
I forgot what that word means.

354
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,500
I confused that word with pugnacious.

355
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,480
No, it's small-minded.

356
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,480
Small-minded.

357
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,620
Yes, I am small-minded.

358
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,360
Look at that.

359
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:53,920
It's tiny.

360
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,880
Well, you know, I didn't mean to accuse you of being small-minded.

361
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,280
It was just a word of kindness, or anything like that.

362
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,560
I didn't mean to accuse you of having a...

363
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,480
All right, all right.

364
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,300
Let's forgive him.

365
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,520
Let's say the church had the genius, okay?

366
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,420
We admit it.

367
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,400
We admit right up front, okay?

368
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,560
We're not the sharpest crayons in the pencil box, or whatever.

369
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:11,900
We...

370
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,780
Whatever the...

371
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,140
Eat your heart out, Mensa.

372
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,560
That's stang?

373
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:14,880
Yeah.

374
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,900
The genius stang?

375
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,920
That's a good one.

376
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,060
That's a good...

377
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,400
He's right over there, officer.

378
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,520
It's a killer.

379
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,280
Do your duty.

380
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,220
It's a killer.

381
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,740
Go ahead.

382
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,020
man?

383
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,060
Would you like to ask

384
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,740
Reverend Stang? He's kind of

385
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,820
old, but you could ask him something.

386
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,160
I know J.R. Bob

387
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,780
for what he wants. We got him on ice

388
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,500
here. We're in communication

389
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,360
with his brain.

390
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,380
I don't have an app.

391
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,540
Alright, well. Another joke

392
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,680
on the story. What about Burning Man, you folks?

393
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,840
You folks have been talking about Burning Man.

394
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,500
Well, I go every year.

395
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,540
I have to, but...

396
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,940
How long have you been going there?

397
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,200
Since... Does anyone still go to Burning Man?

398
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,820
Since 1996.

399
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,480
I would go to... Princess, we and I

400
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,320
would both happily go to Burning Man

401
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,300
every single year if we

402
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,440
could afford it. And also if it

403
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,600
wasn't just a couple of weeks after

404
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,560
we burn ourselves out.

405
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,620
Then it wasn't a damn fool waste of time.

406
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,040
Well, we gotta...

407
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,100
You know, we think

408
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,320
globularly and act loco.

409
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,480
Well, that makes sense.

410
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,680
That's why we go to the loco campground

411
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,620
and burn people up and get burned.

412
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,300
And burn each other.

413
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,120
It burns! It burns!

414
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,700
So, what's your...

415
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,560
What's your question, maybe,

416
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,840
with Larry Harvey?

417
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,100
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

418
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,560
You ask the question. We give you the answer.

419
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,820
You're the one calling in.

420
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,760
You ask the question. State short question, please.

421
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,020
Larry Harvey and, uh...

422
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,220
Harry Larvey, yes.

423
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,620
No, Larry Harvey.

424
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,180
Oh, okay.

425
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,620
And John Law.

426
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,720
John Law was involved with that whole thing.

427
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,700
Not anymore.

428
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,320
Yeah, I know.

429
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,280
Well, and Michael Michael and all those other guys.

430
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,060
Ranger...

431
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,140
What do they call them?

432
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,080
Danger Rangers.

433
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,560
Red Rock Rangers.

434
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,680
Danger Ranger.

435
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,900
He's still around.

436
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,340
He's still there.

437
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,420
He's still on the job.

438
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,900
Michael Michael still?

439
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,020
Danger Ranger, yes, is still there.

440
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,120
All right.

441
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,220
Roaming the waste spaces of the Earth.

442
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,780
Yeah, and so they got a big old fence

443
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,300
around the whole thing now, right?

444
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,780
Well, the BLM makes us keep all the loonies

445
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,920
inside the crates.

446
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,920
Lazy folks corral, as they call it.

447
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,140
And it's to keep the hats that blow off

448
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,560
everyone's head contained.

449
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,600
Somewhere, there are two of my hats

450
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,920
up against that fence.

451
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:36,940
Really?

452
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:37,460
Yeah.

453
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,500
I bet you could sell one of those hats

454
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,780
on eBay or something, right?

455
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,480
I bet you could, too,

456
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,660
but I'm not perceiving a question here.

457
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,820
Did you have a question to ask?

458
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,360
Why is Starwood cooler than Burning Man?

459
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,960
Because you've never heard of it.

460
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,760
That's why.

461
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,500
So check it out.

462
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,740
Starwood Festival.

463
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,780
Just two weeks.

464
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,300
Southern Ohio?

465
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,320
Wisteria, yeah.

466
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,540
It's in Southern Ohio near Athens.

467
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,440
Clear-cut case of Wisteria.

468
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,920
Although, actually, this year,

469
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,100
Starwood Festival will be on board my escape vessel

470
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,720
because the world will be destroyed

471
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,760
and I will rescue the Wisteria campground,

472
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,000
beam it up onto my...

473
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,280
And anyone who paid to go to Starwood,

474
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,920
even if they're pink boys,

475
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,680
can go to Starwood.

476
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,040
Then they will be ejected into the void of outer space

477
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,900
if they haven't bought a subject.

478
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,180
They've been a genius membership by the end of Starwood.

479
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,940
They've actually been that obtuse,

480
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,080
that remiss,

481
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,860
that they haven't...

482
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,100
They'll be turned out of the spaceship

483
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,760
into the vacuum of space

484
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,220
and we'll watch them pop

485
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,420
like an inflated balloon.

486
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,700
I'm sorry.

487
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,120
I'm sorry to step on you there.

488
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,940
What is the quintessential difference

489
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,700
between Starwood and Burning Man

490
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,780
out in Nevada?

491
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,160
Well, burning...

492
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,520
Moisture.

493
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,220
Moisture.

494
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,280
Yeah, they got water.

495
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:54,600
That's right.

496
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,180
Yeah.

497
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,340
They've got water and living things,

498
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,780
life, not just a...

499
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,480
And a lack of corporate douchebags.

500
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,060
How about that?

501
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,000
That's right.

502
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,140
They don't have any internet millionaires.

503
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,000
The corporate douchebags

504
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,640
have not yet discovered Starwood,

505
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,760
but they discovered Burning Man

506
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,740
like 15 years ago.

507
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,080
I'm afraid they did.

508
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,460
I thought that corporate douchebags

509
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,200
weren't allowed to advertise there.

510
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,220
Well, not...

511
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,220
I mean, aside from church,

512
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,000
besides genius.

513
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,220
Actually, if we really wanted to discuss this,

514
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,260
there are many people who pay outrageous sums

515
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,840
so they can camp in some cool camp.

516
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,560
These misguided souls

517
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,360
have nothing to do with the core mission,

518
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,960
but this is all too informal to discuss, really.

519
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,860
I was hoping there was a question here

520
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,060
that we could answer.

521
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,320
Oh.

522
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,020
So I haven't asked my question yet?

523
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:39,680
Go ahead.

524
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,400
Everybody else does,

525
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,300
as a friend of mine used to say.

526
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,400
I remember her.

527
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,420
She...

528
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:47,760
Gosh.

529
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,520
So I'm here on my...

530
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,640
I'm on my last question.

531
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,680
Let's have it.

532
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,080
The last question.

533
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,740
I don't...

534
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:54,820
I don't...

535
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,220
I don't divert...

536
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,880
I don't divert or advert to, uh,

537
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,480
uh, pop TV or anything like that.

538
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:00,840
What do they...

539
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,440
What do they say on, uh, the...

540
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,860
On my favorite Martian?

541
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,460
...one of the most popular, uh, shows on TV?

542
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,060
Like, your last question, your, uh...

543
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,620
I'll buy that for a dollar.

544
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,820
Is that your question?

545
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,840
What do they say on...

546
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,760
I'll buy that for a dollar.

547
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,700
I'm just...

548
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,860
I'm just saying, like, the real meta...

549
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,780
I'm just saying.

550
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,620
...meta culture...

551
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,120
Just saying.

552
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,100
You know what I'm saying?

553
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,740
...kind of stupid people...

554
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,220
Note your sign.

555
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,820
This is the kind of thing that they say.

556
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,320
They watch.

557
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,480
Yeah, they're...

558
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,000
They're stupid.

559
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,860
They want stupid...

560
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,720
They have this on the tip of their tongue,

561
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,280
and they...

562
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,560
They know what, you know...

563
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,540
I just don't know that.

564
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,640
Well, out with it, man.

565
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,420
I'm trying to...

566
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,380
I'm trying to just kind of break you guys down...

567
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,020
Why don't you stop beating around the bush

568
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,020
and just come out and say what it is that you want to say?

569
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,120
Yeah, we're all friends here.

570
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,800
What the hell...

571
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,160
What the hell's wrong with this country?

572
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,420
Hmm.

573
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,140
Where to begin?

574
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:46,500
Let me see.

575
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,720
They, uh...

576
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,660
Well, I'll tell you where to begin.

577
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,260
I'll tell you where to begin.

578
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,420
The problem with this country...

579
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:50,660
People.

580
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,140
...is that it's full of human beings.

581
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,220
That's exactly right.

582
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,760
This is a beautiful land.

583
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,540
The Grand Canyon, the Great Lakes.

584
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,760
You'll never see things like that anywhere else on the planet.

585
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:06,400
But there's trash everywhere called Homo sapiens,

586
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,660
as opposed to Homo excelsior,

587
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,880
which is the advanced subgenius race.

588
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:12,800
All right.

589
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,740
So, if you are the only last living beings on the Earth,

590
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,660
how are you going to take care of these last vestiges of...

591
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,180
Oh, now he's asking...

592
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,200
...of...

593
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,200


594
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,200


595
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,200


596
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,180
He's asking another question.

597
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,540
Oh, boy.

598
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,040
Yeah, you think you get an...

599
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,200
No, we're not going to be the last people on Earth.

600
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,180
We're going to be the only people who leave Earth.

601
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,080
Everybody else stays on Earth.

602
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,820
You're thinking of that Tom Cruise movie

603
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,800
where the most privileged person on Earth

604
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,520
gets to be the only person on Earth.

605
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,620
Don't go there.

606
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,240
Sorry.

607
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,560
I don't...

608
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:42,860
I don't...

609
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,340
I don't want anything to do with Tom Cruise.

610
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,540
Well, there was another...

611
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,700
You're too proud to admit that you've seen a Tom Cruise movie.

612
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,320
There was also a Will Smith movie

613
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,320
where he got to be the last guy on Earth.

614
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:52,920
And then...

615
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,360
Everybody wants the last word.

616
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,160
Yes.

617
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,580
They learn that from the Internet.

618
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,100
People see these movies

619
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,280
and they think they are going to be the last sole survivor.

620
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,040
I'm afraid the statistics,

621
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,040
the actuarial formula is quite against that.

622
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,240
You'd have a better chance

623
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,620
of winning the publisher's clearinghouse sweepstakes.

624
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,180
You just...

625
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,040
And yet we've all tried.

626
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,960
Yes, it's true.

627
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,120
It's human to try, to dream, to have self-deception,

628
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,900
but one must...

629
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,680
agree, at least in some small part of one's being,

630
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,100
that there ain't no chance in Hades.

631
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,220
You know, I've never tried.

632
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,580
Does that make me subhuman or...

633
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,400
A quitter, eh, son?

634
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:34,520
Oh.

635
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,820
Don't worry.

636
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,940
See, this is where I'd like to step in real quick here

637
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,820
and point out the whole concept of sub and super.

638
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,600
Okay.

639
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,580
That all depends on what direction...

640
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,160
When you go out into outer space,

641
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,920
there is no up or down.

642
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,640
That's right.

643
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,000
So to say that something is above something

644
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,740
or below something,

645
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,300
is meaningless.

646
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,520
It's just a matter of which direction you're looking.

647
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,260
Relativity.

648
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:00,280
Maybe above or below the orbital plane.

649
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,160
Yeah.

650
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,480
You just have to be there.

651
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,200
Yeah, yeah.

652
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,840
You just have to...

653
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,160
Yeah, yeah.

654
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:07,800
Look up.

655
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,660
Look down.

656
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,220
Look all around.

657
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,160
Stick up your thumb.

658
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,360
A subgenius is not something that is below a genius.

659
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,980
A subgenius is someone who's a genius of all things sub.

660
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,600
Or who is beneath a genius of some kind.

661
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,520
Actually, I've tried to use that argument before

662
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,320
when I was arguing with a born-again Christian.

663
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,700
Like, what denomination are you?

664
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,220
I said, I'm a subgenius.

665
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,360
And they're like, what the heck is that?

666
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,240
And I said, well, you know, God is the genius, of course.

667
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,100
It comes from the Latin root for, you know,

668
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,300
like the Greek root genesis, you know, genius.

669
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,480
Yes.

670
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,420
We are all below.

671
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,540
We are all below the creator.

672
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,320
Genius is with sighing scent.

673
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,340
We are subgenii.

674
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,900
Well, the genius need not be the creator.

675
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,000
It need not...

676
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,900
It only need to be a spirit.

677
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,600
Not the almighty spirit.

678
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,080
Not the biggest jumbo ghost in the room

679
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,480
that likes blood like all ghosts do.

680
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,360
That's why the Old Testament is full of putting blood out for the old guy.

681
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,480
No, it's different now.

682
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:11,280
We have different spirits that we converse with.

683
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,600
No simple seances, table knocking,

684
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,660
streams of ectoplasm emanating from a medium's belly.

685
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,980
That's all old thinking.

686
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,300
The old way.

687
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:22,460
The old way.

688
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:26,880
We have something new that we communicate with.

689
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,220
Well, I'm pretty certain that if there is any such thing as the divine,

690
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,100
if there is any such thing as a deity,

691
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:32,520
I'm convinced...

692
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,240
He was in multiple maniacs.

693
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,760
I'm convinced that they are many and not one.

694
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,300
Mm-hmm.

695
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:37,840
That's right.

696
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,320
And that they don't agree with each other all the time.

697
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,640
E pluribus unum.

698
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,660
And that explains so much about how the universe works.

699
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,720
The fact that the gods can't agree with each other on anything.

700
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,620
You know, we see one such thing as the divine.

701
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,980
Just ask John Waters.

702
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,720
Yes, I was there.

703
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,420
I...

704
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:51,980
I...

705
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,280
I...

706
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:52,280


707
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:52,280


708
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:56,440
Well, yes, the moving waters at their priest-like task

709
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,480
of pure ablution round Earth's human shores.

710
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,820
Let's take another caller here real quick.

711
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,240
You're on the air.

712
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:04,860
Hello?

713
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,360
Oh, hello.

714
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,980
This is Rev Wildhorse out here in Olympia,

715
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,120
checking in with the gang.

716
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,720
Well, Wildhouse.

717
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,760
Who was that masked man anyway?

718
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,700
A fiery horse with a speed of light

719
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,700
and a hearty high old silver.

720
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,100
That's right.

721
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,040
And Johnny Depp.

722
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,680
Yeah.

723
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,960
When I was a sprout in Indiana,

724
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,340
I was told this story.

725
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,880
A well-watered sprout.

726
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,720
And a riddle.

727
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,860
And maybe you can finally answer it.

728
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,600
I've been waiting for nearly 30 years for this to happen.

729
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,840
Wrapped in an enigma and covered with creamy milk chocolate.

730
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,820
Why does the porridge bird lay his egg in the air?

731
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,480
Say that one more time, please.

732
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:47,900
Why does the porridge bird lay his egg in the air?

733
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,620
Why is that?

734
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,860
How did I know it was hot?

735
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,980
Lazy leg in the air.

736
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,080
Was the porridge too hot?

737
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,220
Was it too hot or too cold or just right?

738
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,880
Just right.

739
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,360
In the Goldilocks zone.

740
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,940
Goldilocks has been in the news lately.

741
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,540
The porridge bird never lands, my dear son,

742
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,220
but circulates through the sky.

743
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,120
Oh, yeah, man.

744
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,340
We make the tough calls.

745
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,080
The egg also is buffeted by the streams of the upper atmosphere

746
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,300
and never descends.

747
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,840
From it eventually comes the next generation of porridge birds.

748
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,320
And the porridge itself is their leavings,

749
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,920
sifting and filtering,

750
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,620
through the atmosphere into the bowls of the truly desperate.

751
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,940
When I was a little kid, I thought that porridge was...

752
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,200
Called manna by the ancients.

753
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,840
When I was a little kid, I presumed that the word porridge

754
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,440
was derived from the word poor because poor people are always eating it

755
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,820
in the stories that I would hear about porridge.

756
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,880
It's good for you.

757
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,120
I was never actually fed porridge as a child.

758
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,160
Well, you haven't lived until you've...

759
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,520
Well, then I found out later on that oatmeal could be classified as porridge.

760
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,880
You never owned oatmeal?

761
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,020
Yeah, right.

762
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,740
Tor like oatmeal.

763
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,040
But it was never called porridge.

764
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,780
Yes.

765
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:53,680
Until now.

766
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,660
I might have eaten it more heartily if it had been presented as porridge

767
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,420
because it was something exotic from...

768
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,420
Eat heartily, honky.

769
00:23:59,420 --> 00:23:59,800
...from stories.

770
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,520
Okay.

771
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:00,740
Okay.

772
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,820
That's the story.

773
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,520
And Will Stigman sticks to your ribs.

774
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,580
I was going to ask, Red Stang there, you know, if the saucers make it this year,

775
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,420
I can't make it out to Wisteria.

776
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,700
I don't have any money either.

777
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,180
Could you guys stop by here on the way out?

778
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,420
If you paid your 35 bucks, they will stop you.

779
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,220
However, all the good spots...

780
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,020
Some people think they're good.

781
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,180
...some people think this will be already taken and you'll be in the vestibule or the

782
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,340
lobby, which is still paradise compared to everywhere else.

783
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,240
So make sure you pay your 35 bucks and there'll be a seat on the saucers for you.

784
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,620
It's been paid.

785
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:40,640
And like Red Stang got the Grand Canyon, well, I got Palouse Falls out there in Eastern Washington.

786
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:40,980
Okay.

787
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,840
We'll come and get you.

788
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:50,580
Were you under the impression that the exes only are going to show up at this one rinky-dink

789
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,900
campground in Ohio?

790
00:24:52,900 --> 00:25:00,760
They're going to line up north to south over the entire planet and let it turn under them

791
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:07,480
while they vacuum up the saved and spray napalm onto the unsaved or whatever.

792
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,220
Oh, no.

793
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,320
Something like that.

794
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,340
So you can just sit there.

795
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,880
You'll be able to watch it on television.

796
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:17,080
It'll start in the Pacific Ocean and where the dateline starts.

797
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,520
That's where it will first be, 7 a.m. on July 5th, 1998.

798
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,000
Oh, no.

799
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,700
That's when the planet rotates on its own.

800
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,080
1998?

801
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,400
Yes.

802
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,620
We don't know what year it is.

803
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,160
Have you?

804
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:35,200
I get the impression that this listener has not been reading his prescriptures.

805
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,760
Actually, what am I—

806
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:41,720
I would say that this person needs to read something besides pamphlet number one.

807
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,620
I know it's expensive to buy those books, but—

808
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,420
Actually, one of my favorite—

809
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,160
This is all explained over and over again.

810
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,000
One of my favorite theories about the whole 1998—

811
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,400
1998 mystery.

812
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,220
Let's hear it.

813
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,740
I don't hear chat while everybody talks over one another.

814
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,000
Sorry.

815
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:01,400
You question the whole 1998 thing, and this is what you call a divine mystery.

816
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,600
That's true.

817
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,560
I believe because it is impossible.

818
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,460
It's something that we can't explain.

819
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,180
We know it is true, but we can't explain it.

820
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,600
We don't know what planet this is.

821
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,040
We don't know what time this is.

822
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,360
We don't know what year it is.

823
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,600
We don't know nothing, boy.

824
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,580
We don't know nothing.

825
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,580
We don't know how—

826
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,400
And our man might not even belong to us.

827
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:15,820
Yeah.

828
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:20,960
We don't know how wine becomes the blood of Christ, and we don't know how 1998—

829
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,860
I don't know nothing about it.

830
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:21,960
I don't know anything about it.

831
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:21,960


832
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,760
—has not yet come, even though we think it's 2014.

833
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:24,680
These are mysteries, my son.

834
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,920
My favorite theory—

835
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,660
I don't know anything about it.

836
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,340
My favorite theory came out a few years ago, though, that everything was delayed by 19

837
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:30,680
years.

838
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:37,220
If you recall, back in 2003, when we were about to invade Iraq, you were talking about

839
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,740
this in one of your sermons once we were even staying.

840
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,220
Right.

841
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:44,520
George W. Bush, when trying to advocate going to war with Iraq, he said, the goal of this

842
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,960
war is peace.

843
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,740
War is peace.

844
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,460
The president says war is peace.

845
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:49,740
Iraq is white.

846
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,600
That means—

847
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:51,780
2000 years.

848
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:51,940
2000 years.

849
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,520
2003 was actually 1984.

850
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:57,740
That means that the real X Day, the real 1998, will be 2017.

851
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:58,480
Right.

852
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,840
And then Donald Rumsfeld gets one over at the next zebra crossing.

853
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,200
And that's only three years away now.

854
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,140
But you know, like sometimes when you're waiting for the airporter to take you to the

855
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,220
airplane, they come early.

856
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,660
Well, that could happen also.

857
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,060
So it could happen this year.

858
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,820
We have to be ready.

859
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,460
We have to be there and in place each time.

860
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,420
X Day will come in a time you know not.

861
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,320
It could be tomorrow.

862
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,060
It could be in the next two minutes.

863
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,700
Are you ready?

864
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,580
Did you—

865
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,900
Bob, pay your dues to Bob.

866
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,720
Or is your soul safe?

867
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,280
Ye never know when the master cometh.

868
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,120
I did my excre—however you say that.

869
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:30,660
God damn it!

870
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,920
No man knows.

871
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,640
Some excremeditation, yes.

872
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,880
Somebody open a window.

873
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,020
Bob will come as a thief in the night.

874
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,940
And in your pants if you aren't careful.

875
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,000
So stay zipped up.

876
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,420
I will.

877
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,620
And if you can't keep it in your pants—

878
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,980
Except for when the cows are coming out.

879
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,640
—keep it in the family.

880
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,400
Flip up, flip up, and knock it out.

881
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,560
I'm not going to do that.

882
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:50,560


883
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:50,560


884
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:50,560


885
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:50,560


886
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:50,560


887
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,440
I'm not going to sleep with cows.

888
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:52,880
Look up.

889
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:53,840
Look down.

890
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,320
Good night, my brother.

891
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,520
Look all around.

892
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:55,840
Good night, brother.

893
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,020
Stick up your thumb.

894
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,200
God, you're dumb.

895
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,640
Praise Bob.

896
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,560
Not dumb.

897
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,380
Let's pause real quick for station identification.

898
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,080
This is WCSB Cleveland 89.3 FM.

899
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,300
I'm not dumb.

900
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,120
Portions of the following broadcast will be objectionable to some members of the audience.

901
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,880
Therefore, WCSB advises listening discretion.

902
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:12,500
God, you're dumb.

903
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,120
Oh, yeah.

904
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,100
That's what he said to me.

905
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:14,460
Yeah.

906
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:19,280
And any views or opinions expressed on this program are not necessarily those of WCSB

907
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,280
or Cleveland State University.

908
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:20,540
We are here to help you.

909
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:20,540


910
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:20,540


911
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:20,540


912
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,960
I had to cut you out there for a second so I could do my disclaimer without you talking

913
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,340
over me.

914
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,420
What a cut up.

915
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:26,760
That's okay.

916
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,660
Cut it out.

917
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:28,960
All right.

918
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,440
I'll take my cut now.

919
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,120
I'll talk to everyone another time.

920
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,340
Have a great Fourth of July.

921
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,860
We never do the Fourth of July.

922
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,260
We have no money, Mark.

923
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,800
The Fourth of July, we can't celebrate.

924
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,700
It's the day before the end of the world.

925
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:46,840
The Fourth of July is for pinks, for sad veterans parades and fireworks and booze and too much

926
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,140
noise.

927
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,520
You know, we're not allowed to celebrate the Fourth of July anymore because, you know,

928
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:50,520


929
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:50,520


930
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:50,520


931
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:50,640
there's the Florida.

932
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,100
Well, the name of the...

933
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,620
Because, like, you know, the World Cup is getting higher ratings than the World Series

934
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,700
in the United States.

935
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,460
Okay, well then.

936
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,340
Have a great next

937
00:28:59,340 --> 00:28:59,540
day.

938
00:28:59,640 --> 00:28:59,920
Yeah.

939
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,560
Thank you.

940
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:00,880
Exactly.

941
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,480
You too.

942
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,720
And we'll see ya!

943
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,380
See ya on the saucers, brother.

944
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,380
See ya on the saucers, brother.

945
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,860
Next thing you know we'll be using the metric system.

946
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,480
Actually, no money, Mark by definition is pretty much stuck here on the gross breathe.

947
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,420
Yeah, but he said he was paid up.

948
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,060
I believe.

949
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,400
I believe.

950
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,200
No, that was the other guy.

951
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,740
I don't think No Money Mark could be.

952
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,080
Oh, I see.

953
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,900
See, here's the thing, though.

954
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,920
Although if Dobbs had mercy, he would certainly be ruptured along with the rest of us.

955
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,860
But mercy is not what this is all about.

956
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,960
Mercy shall sit between, throned in celestial sheen.

957
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,900
With radiant feet, the tissue of the clouds down steel.

958
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,580
Come on!

959
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,840
I believe No Money Mark is going to come up with some cash at the last minute.

960
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,060
What is mercy, really?

961
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,420
Altruism.

962
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,460
Empathy.

963
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,540
Feeling for another.

964
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:59,760
But if you are familiar with the works of the philosopher La Rochevique,

965
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:05,800
even a saint does his saintly things for his own good feelings.

966
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,740
No one really does anything for anyone else.

967
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,580
You are a saint because it makes you feel good about yourself.

968
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,160
No, I'm not.

969
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,300
According to La Rochevique.

970
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,240
You know what would be a really interesting experiment, then?

971
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:16,960
I'm sorry if I cuss.

972
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:17,920
Too late.

973
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,320
You should reiterate what that guy's name was.

974
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,140
Who the author of that term was.

975
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:25,680
Please.

976
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,200
What term, son?

977
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,880
Term of...

978
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:30,960
Endearment.

979
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,060
Thank you.

980
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,600
Okay.

981
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,620
Try endearment.

982
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,020
Hmm.

983
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,120
Well...

984
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,720
The problem is...

985
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,200
The problem with saints.

986
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,760
They're just as selfish as everybody else.

987
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,080
They just won't admit it.

988
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,640
That's right.

989
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,420
They're showing off how egoless they are.

990
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,860
Now, how much sense does that make?

991
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,280
Come on.

992
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:47,880
That's right.

993
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:53,340
What if we could create, either through genetic engineering or through selective brain injury,

994
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,860
a person who gets no satisfaction of any kind from anything?

995
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,440
Well, that would be a tormented spirit.

996
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,000
And then program them to do nothing but good works.

997
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,480
Just a degree away from the human condition.

998
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,540
There are many people who have toiled.

999
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,340
Endlessly.

1000
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:13,680
But even if they don't receive satisfaction, they're still seeking personal satisfaction.

1001
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,460
They're not doing it for other folks.

1002
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,580
They're doing it to make the pain go away.

1003
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,120
And that's something we have to acknowledge.

1004
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:28,520
I'm pretty happy doing what I do on a daily basis without having to prove anything to anyone.

1005
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,360
You don't have to prove anything to me.

1006
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,680
You have to prove it to yourself.

1007
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,220
To your secret heart.

1008
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,600
Okay.

1009
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,260
Well, I don't have to prove anything.

1010
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,900
I don't have to prove anything to you, nor do I have to prove anything to myself.

1011
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,440
Not now, not yet.

1012
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,180
But the great day is coming closer and closer.

1013
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,000
When the secrets of all hearts shall be known.

1014
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,560
What are you referring to?

1015
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:56,440
I'm speaking of that time when the sea gives up its dead and monsters walk the earth.

1016
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:02,180
And the dreadful judge in middle air shall spread his throne to judge the quick and the dead.

1017
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,340
Yes, it I will end them.

1018
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,240
The wise-ass caller shall be at the door.

1019
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:07,600
The judgment.

1020
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,660
Laundry detergent is stronger than dirt.

1021
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,140
Is that me?

1022
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:11,960
I'm sorry.

1023
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,780
It could be.

1024
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,420
Reverend Dang?

1025
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,660
Could be.

1026
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,240
Could be.

1027
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,040
Could be.

1028
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,700
Could be.

1029
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:17,720
Could be.

1030
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:17,840
Could be.

1031
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:17,840


1032
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:17,840


1033
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:17,840


1034
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:17,840


1035
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,520
What is wisdom?

1036
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:18,920
Why that?

1037
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,280
Why that?

1038
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:19,980
What is wisdom?

1039
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,040
Why that?

1040
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,040


1041
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:30,520
I just don't have any belief or faith in all this altruism of like some other great, gracious beings.

1042
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,800
Do you believe that altruism is a vice?

1043
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:34,920
Well, I do.

1044
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,860
Can you talk about my son?

1045
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:36,140


1046
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:36,820
You don't say.

1047
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,240
You can't say that.

1048
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,000
You can't be telling me you don't believe in J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1049
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,940
We're speaking of things which are...

1050
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,960
I feel altruism...

1051
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,180
...faltering in belief.

1052
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,740
...is a vice.

1053
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:57,120
A vice grip that will not unclench from these tormented souls until the day of liberation.

1054
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:57,540
Yeah, exactly.

1055
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:01,100
The great day of liberation when all prisoners shall be released.

1056
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:07,240
When you told me that you think altruism is a vice, you sounded just like every 17-year-old.

1057
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,400
I'm the 17-year-old I ever met who just finished reading Atlas Shrugged.

1058
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,960
Yeah, some pouting Ayn Rand fan.

1059
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,820
I've never read it.

1060
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,720
I've never read it.

1061
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:19,540
And, you know, what's the guy, the girl's name, whatever the hell it is.

1062
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,280
Ayn Rand.

1063
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,140
Ayn Rand.

1064
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,300
Ayn Rand.

1065
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,060
Ayn Rand.

1066
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,900
Ayn Rand.

1067
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,560
Ayn Rand.

1068
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:27,560


1069
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:27,800
Ayn Rand.

1070
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:27,860
Ayn Rand Paul.

1071
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:33,200
Do you believe that advancing your own self-interest is the only moral imperative?

1072
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,260
Ayn Rand Paul.

1073
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,820
Shevayn Rond.

1074
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:39,620
The only... I'm sorry, can you repeat that?

1075
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:45,160
Yeah, I will repeat that. Do you believe that advancing your own self-interest is the only moral imperative?

1076
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,500
Answer quickly.

1077
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,580
The only moral...

1078
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,800
The only moral imperative.

1079
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,280
The only moral imperative...

1080
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,600
The only moral imperative is to advance your own self-interest. Do you believe that's true or not?

1081
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,340
I don't want to say immoral imperative.

1082
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:08,480
I said the only moral imperative. Do you believe that would be to advance your own self-interest?

1083
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:14,780
Advance your own self-interest. So, advance my...

1084
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,320
I'm sorry, the time has expired.

1085
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:23,880
You're really parsing this phrase more than you need to for the purposes of our conversation.

1086
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,540
No, I mean, is it my own moral imperative or is it our...

1087
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,940
Now he's asking another question.

1088
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,860
I used what's called a definite article.

1089
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:32,960
Okay.

1090
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:33,600
The word the.

1091
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,100
I got that.

1092
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,840
Do you believe the only moral imperative is to advance your own self-interest?

1093
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,300
Well, put up or shut up?

1094
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,740
Kill them all. Let Bob sort them out.

1095
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,300
If you can't answer that with a yes or no, then just say you can't answer it with a yes or no.

1096
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:47,800
Oye.

1097
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:49,540
Advancing...

1098
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:50,900
To the rear.

1099
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:52,920
Uh...

1100
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,420
You can spa on your Sunday pants.

1101
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,080
No, I don't see my moral imperative...

1102
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,100
I didn't say your moral imperative.

1103
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:10,040
I said do you believe or do you not believe or are you not sure that the only moral imperative is advancing one's own self-interest?

1104
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,880
Can we go home now?

1105
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,980
Do you believe this, do you not believe this, or are you not sure?

1106
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,200
Stop snoring, sleepo.

1107
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,060
Oh, I nodded off there.

1108
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:19,460
Come on.

1109
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,240
Jesus, God.

1110
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,800
It don't have nothing to do with good or evil.

1111
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,680
People, it's just robots.

1112
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,800
And I'm the robot program to tell y'all you're nothing but robots.

1113
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,000
That's all it is.

1114
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,860
You're just programming.

1115
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,500
It's all a bunch of monkeys.

1116
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:36,700
Automatons.

1117
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,740
Doing what evolution forced you to do for the last million years just to get dinner.

1118
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,300
Speaking of that, what is for dinner?

1119
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:50,620
I'm back at another number, but I'll advance my point here right now.

1120
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,260
Eventually.

1121
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,900
You seem to have the idea that there's an infinite time for this.

1122
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,960
Any second now.

1123
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,040
I don't think my moral imperative...

1124
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,380
Don't push that button behind you.

1125
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,560
Three, two, one, go!

1126
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,520
Has anything to do with...

1127
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,700
Be funny!

1128
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,840
Pot stickers?

1129
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:10,500
I don't think my moral imperative has anything to do with anyone else in the world.

1130
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,820
Cock-a-doodle-don't.

1131
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,500
Yeah, see, but there you go again saying my moral imperative, and that wasn't what I...

1132
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,080
I was going to ask you about your moral imperative.

1133
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,720
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

1134
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,980
You sounded very good at parsing questions before, and you don't sound very good at parsing

1135
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,360
them anymore.

1136
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,100
Me, me, me, me, me, me.

1137
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:29,020
There is a fundamental misunderstanding going on here.

1138
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,020


1139
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,560
I didn't ask you the question.

1140
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,260
No, you really didn't, but that's okay.

1141
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,120
I didn't expect you to answer the question because it does not serve your interest to

1142
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,880
answer any of these questions we ask you.

1143
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:37,640
No, come on.

1144
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,500
We're just sitting around here trying to have some laughs at your expense.

1145
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,160
Princess, princess, we're just trying to have some fun.

1146
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:42,380
We're just trying to have some fun.

1147
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,120
I want to have laughs too.

1148
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:49,220
I want to have laughs against moral humanity and all the other crap that goes on in this

1149
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,500
world and all the stupidity that has to do...

1150
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,840
What about that giant belly laugh in the dark?

1151
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,940
All the bullshit?

1152
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,460
Okay, I can see...

1153
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,000
I can see that.

1154
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,000


1155
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,000


1156
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,000


1157
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,000


1158
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,000


1159
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,000


1160
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,960
I can see bullshit, right?

1161
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,420
Wake up, Reverend Stang.

1162
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,440
It's almost time to go.

1163
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,200
I've heard this so many times.

1164
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,260
It's groundhog day.

1165
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,520
Did somebody leave...

1166
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,760
Who brought my answer machine in here?

1167
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,880
I thought it might help.

1168
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,600
I'm sorry.

1169
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,940
That was forward of me.

1170
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:17,460
No, we had a difficult subject I thought we could...

1171
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,480
Now he's gone totally cuckoo.

1172
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,720
I hope you're pleased with yourself.

1173
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,540
So anyway...

1174
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,200
He's off howling in the hell of his own making.

1175
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:28,640
So anyway, anyway.

1176
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:28,980
I'm going to go to bed.

1177
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:28,980


1178
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:28,980


1179
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:28,980


1180
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:28,980


1181
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:28,980


1182
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:28,980


1183
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,000
Isn't it great how I can just shut everybody up by saying, anyway.

1184
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,400
Yeah, that's right.

1185
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,100
You've got about 15 minutes left in the program.

1186
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,140
It works for a second.

1187
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,280
I've got growling and all kinds of shit going on right now.

1188
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,980
Those are just growling pains.

1189
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,460
Easy there, fella.

1190
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,180
Let's see if we can retain at least the semblance of our human shape.

1191
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:57,460
Princess, wait.

1192
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:57,660
Princess, wait.

1193
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,220
I'm going to decolletage my moral imperative.

1194
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:01,880
Stop that.

1195
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,960
Throw a towel over it.

1196
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,640
There's so much tittering going on in here.

1197
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,000
It's all getting me.

1198
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,080
And you cover up too, baby.

1199
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,560
We've got to maintain some decorum here.

1200
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,780
Decorum or decolletage?

1201
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,040
Well, I...

1202
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,320
It's getting swollen.

1203
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,660
Well, I haven't seen a sight like that since I was weaned.

1204
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,800
My moral imperative is about to explode.

1205
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,960
Your moral imperative needs a cold shower.

1206
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:28,960


1207
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,720
Emergency, emergency.

1208
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,640
A kitten is up a tree.

1209
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,120
Call the fire department.

1210
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,600
Where's the fire?

1211
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,440
If your eyes, officer.

1212
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,560
It's an old one, Princess.

1213
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,940
Yeah, right.

1214
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,140
The older they are, the better.

1215
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,620
I'm just a pushover for an old joke.

1216
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,480
Moldy, oldie.

1217
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,580
I will call her pushover.

1218
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,060
Because she'll do everything for everybody.

1219
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,560
Now, that's Suzy the floozy you're talking about.

1220
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,620
Yeah, that's true.

1221
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:04,780
She's been pulling that train for nigh on to 30-some-odd years now.

1222
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,420
Mm-hmm.

1223
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,080
Old gal.

1224
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,920
She's a great old gal, though.

1225
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,600
That old Suzy the floozy.

1226
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,420
She'll be there.

1227
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,860
I think she's a great old gal.

1228
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,240
Suzy the floozy will be at the judgment.

1229
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:13,540
Not old.

1230
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,740
She'll be at the day of judgment.

1231
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:20,040
I believe she's a year younger than me, Princess.

1232
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,380
She's still not old.

1233
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,600
Her spirit isn't old.

1234
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,340
Of course not.

1235
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:24,480
Right, right.

1236
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,320
Sixty...

1237
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,420
I love that.

1238
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,600
Sixty's not old.

1239
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:33,460
No, and sixty's the new forty, and forty's the new twenty, and twenty's the new ten,

1240
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,620
and you end up as an Indian.

1241
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:40,220
Well, when I was 25, I thought sixty was damn old, and I guess I must be those who think young then.

1242
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,540
I guess you must be.

1243
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:47,860
When lively folk work up a thirst, they'll hear them ask for Pepsi first.

1244
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,580
They pick the right one, the modern light one, and all...

1245
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,840
Let's take one more caller here.

1246
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,800
Oh, it's Pepsi.

1247
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,620
You're on the air.

1248
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,400
Hey, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1249
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,440
Everybody shut up for a second.

1250
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,240
See, that guy thought he was going to say something on the air, but nobody could hear

1251
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:03,400
him.

1252
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,160
That guy.

1253
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,240
That's a great example, a great example of not knowing...

1254
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:08,520
That guy.

1255
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,500
Not understanding how to be a hit and run caller.

1256
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:14,940
A good hit and run caller will make sure that his voice is heard.

1257
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,500
You try to do a show, and there's always one failure.

1258
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,620
And that hit and run caller fails.

1259
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,460
Oh, he's gone already.

1260
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,260
Oh, too bad.

1261
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,460
How old is he?

1262
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,580
Small and apart.

1263
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:25,600


1264
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:25,600


1265
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,740
That's part of time they share.

1266
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,680
Could somebody go and let the apprentice in?

1267
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,380
Oh, he's down there at the gate?

1268
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,480
The apprentice is not...

1269
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,040
Just at the door up here by the elevator.

1270
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:35,340
Sure.

1271
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,440
Open the vast portal.

1272
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,060
Open sesame.

1273
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,500
The apprentice is here.

1274
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,260
Open sesame.

1275
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,980
Keith won't be here tonight, by the way, folks.

1276
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,000
Oh, he won't?

1277
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,340
I'll be filling in for Keith tonight.

1278
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,520
Oh, okay.

1279
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,900
So, you think things are crazy now.

1280
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,180
Well, they're just getting started.

1281
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:49,920
Oh.

1282
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,860
Because it's getting pretty late.

1283
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,200
Yes.

1284
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:54,980
Late at night, man.

1285
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,980
And I kind of lose it.

1286
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,600
It's later than you think.

1287
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,060
Especially for a Californian.

1288
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,200
Oh, yeah.

1289
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:01,700
Really.

1290
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,340
How long have you been here?

1291
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,900
Not long enough.

1292
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,600
I'm still not acclimatized.

1293
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,420
Do you get jet lag in a three-hour time difference?

1294
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,040
Actually, let me be quite honest here.

1295
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,340
I never get jet lag.

1296
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,200
That never bothers me.

1297
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,620
It never bothers me.

1298
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,220
I've never traveled far enough to experience such a thing.

1299
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,020
Why should anyone be subjected to such an invigoration?

1300
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:23,780
And my general...

1301
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,960
My general...

1302
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,660
My general sleeping habits are kind of strange.

1303
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,240
Like a...

1304
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,320
They pat you down.

1305
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,460
They make you go through the see-you-naked machine.

1306
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,720
They make you take off your shoes.

1307
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,640
And it's just not worth it.

1308
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:43,120
But to communicate with this group of fellow believers, I have to put myself through certain

1309
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,200
cantrips and certain evolutions.

1310
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,100
I like the word cantrip.

1311
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,340
Thank you for using that word tonight.

1312
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,700
Don't mention it.

1313
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,960
I got a million of them.

1314
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,920
We got a couple more callers lined up here.

1315
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,000
Turn that caller into the cold and damp.

1316
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:56,280
You're on the air.

1317
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:56,940
And you are on air.

1318
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,060
Oh, hey.

1319
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:57,800
This is Mark Buda.

1320
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,500
How you guys doing?

1321
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,120
Hello, Buda.

1322
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,000
Up to you.

1323
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,360
Yeah, I was just thinking.

1324
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,460
I remembered it just hit me.

1325
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:07,360
The first time I met Reverend Stein.

1326
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,980
The first time?

1327
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,140
Which was in 1997.

1328
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,140
He had just dropped off in...

1329
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,060
1997.

1330
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:14,720
...Sonic College.

1331
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,640
...where I met Reverend Stein.

1332
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,940
And he stopped at the Brushwood Center for the first strange days.

1333
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:20,900
Mm-hmm.

1334
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,580
We remember.

1335
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:22,760
We remember.

1336
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,800
And we were talking.

1337
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:23,900
We were talking.

1338
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:23,900


1339
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:23,900


1340
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,240
And all of a sudden, this naked guy jumps on his van.

1341
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,900
Hooga hooga, hooga booga.

1342
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,400
And the guy goes, oh.

1343
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,680
And he was probably tripping on acid.

1344
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,200
He goes, yeah.

1345
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,380
Nobody understands me.

1346
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,540
He was on something.

1347
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,100
And Stang looks at him and goes...

1348
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:38,460
He's on a van.

1349
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,940
Nobody understands me, says the naked guy jumping on top of a van.

1350
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,820
And Stang looks at him and goes, you're gonna understand something.

1351
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,100
You don't get the hell off my van.

1352
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:51,200
And this guy jumped off the van like it was 200 degrees.

1353
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,880
And Stang looks at me and goes, what's going on?

1354
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:53,880


1355
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:53,880


1356
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:53,880


1357
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:53,880


1358
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:53,880


1359
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:53,880


1360
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:53,880


1361
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:58,800
I've never hit a person in my whole life, but oh God, that felt so good.

1362
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:04,600
He couldn't help but automatically raise the temperature of the van 200 degrees.

1363
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,200
Wow.

1364
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,960
Generally, we restrain ourselves and don't perform impudent miracles.

1365
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,320
I don't think you can say you've really lived if you've never hit someone, though.

1366
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:13,620
No.

1367
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,860
Fuck away, good-bye, Stang.

1368
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:17,240
This greeting on my impious crest has been...

1369
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:17,280
You haven't...

1370
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:17,960
Dr. Sinister.

1371
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:18,580
Yes.

1372
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,320
I have to ask again.

1373
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,420
Is it true that the next...

1374
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,100
Next show host is not coming in?

1375
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,460
Keith will not be in tonight.

1376
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,200
Oh, that's...

1377
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:34,480
The reason I ask is apparently there's someone outside waiting to be on Keith's show, a regular

1378
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,360
guest of his called Sheriff Deputy.

1379
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:36,420
Holy guacamole.

1380
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,380
Sheriff Deputy.

1381
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,080
So you can use the big eyeball there.

1382
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,240
Is there a back door to this place?

1383
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,400
Dr. Sinister is using...

1384
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,640
Did he give a name?

1385
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,000
Crystal ball?

1386
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:47,720
I'm glad I'm not the only person that has that reaction to those things.

1387
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:47,920
Did he give a name?

1388
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,560
I gotta leave.

1389
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,720
I got a pie in the oven.

1390
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,520
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1391
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,860
Where is the guy?

1392
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,180
He's like in the next...

1393
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:53,400
Next show host.

1394
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:53,400


1395
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:53,400


1396
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:53,400


1397
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,940
He's in the middle lot.

1398
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:55,240
He's in the middle lot?

1399
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,540
I don't see his body weight.

1400
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,720
He's off our radar.

1401
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,420
There's a flashing red light down there.

1402
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:02,960
This is...

1403
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,920
Well, if he comes to the door, we'll see him and let him in.

1404
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:06,760
Okay, I gotta go.

1405
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:07,800
Goodbye, everybody.

1406
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,480
If he comes to the door, we'll see him and let him in.

1407
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:09,880
As soon as I heard that, red lights went off.

1408
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:10,320
I'm not talking with you.

1409
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,480
Go tell him he's not gonna be here.

1410
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:14,760
Well, he'll see us leaving in about 10 minutes.

1411
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:15,260
He's welcome anyway.

1412
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,120
He can't make it to Chicken Stock with the rest of us.

1413
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:18,520
He's a jolly good fellow if he's the real guy.

1414
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:22,240
Well, this is a weird thing, too, and I'll share with that.

1415
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,200
I guess...

1416
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:23,220
I guess...

1417
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:31,860
I guess if I were to know something earlier, I could've came down and filled in the guy

1418
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:34,060
who could've came down there, but I made plans.

1419
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:34,860
Well...

1420
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,800
You made plans to sit at home and call in instead.

1421
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:37,580
No.

1422
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,300
Those are all going by the board, aren't they?

1423
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,040
I should've thought of that when you had a chance.

1424
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,220
Getting on with something...

1425
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,420
But I will talk with Keith, and he needs a fill-in.

1426
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,200
No, Keith will...

1427
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:52,080
You're gonna have to talk with him, because he's not coming in.

1428
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:52,980
Right.

1429
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:53,680
Exactly.

1430
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,900
This is some talking future reference.

1431
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:01,880
We quit making predictions here in the Church of the Subgenius.

1432
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,140
Yeah, boy, do I hate being right all the time.

1433
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,620
I predict the sun will come out tomorrow.

1434
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,520
And I predict the women...

1435
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,380
No, it's gonna be cloudy.

1436
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:17,060
I predict cities made of rubber on the moon.

1437
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:22,500
I predict women's underwear made of titanium steel.

1438
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,140
But...

1439
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,280
It's invisible.

1440
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,320
Aztecs invented the vacation.

1441
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:35,600
I predict Obama minions disguised as Google Earth trucks spying on subgeniuses.

1442
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:37,960
Obabo.

1443
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:38,600
I'm sorry.

1444
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,840
The new name is Obabo.

1445
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,900
The new Obama is...

1446
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,460
Yeah, the subgenius Obama.

1447
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,880
The bizarro Obama.

1448
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:47,580
Obabo.

1449
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:52,980
He looks like Bi-Bo of the Archie McPhee company mascot.

1450
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:53,200
Hell yeah.

1451
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:53,200


1452
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:53,200


1453
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:53,200


1454
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:53,200


1455
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:53,200


1456
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:53,200


1457
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:53,200


1458
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:53,200


1459
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:53,640
You're on the air.

1460
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:58,700
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1461
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,040
Hold on, hold on.

1462
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,680
Hey, caller.

1463
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:02,880
Caller.

1464
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:03,680
Caller.

1465
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:04,520
Caller.

1466
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:04,660
Caller.

1467
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,420
You failed.

1468
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,480
Caller, you failed.

1469
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,900
You get an F for the day.

1470
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,020
You ever heard the phrase, look before you leap?

1471
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:11,720
Was that Dave?

1472
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,580
That was Dave.

1473
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:13,180
No.

1474
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:13,620
That wasn't Dave.

1475
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,780
No, that was not Dave.

1476
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:15,640
Dave's not here.

1477
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,800
That was not Dave.

1478
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,380
That was a Patsy imitator.

1479
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,280
That was a Patsy imitator.

1480
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:25,700
A lot of times Dave calls my phone doing a voice and I don't think it's Dave.

1481
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:25,920
That was Snow Toilet.

1482
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,480
A Patsy, eh?

1483
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:27,640
That was Snow Toilet.

1484
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,100
Yeah.

1485
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,020
Dave sometimes out maneuvers himself.

1486
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,960
There's the phrase, look before you leap, and then there's the phrase, listen before

1487
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,400
you talk.

1488
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:39,620
Listen to make sure that you're not being talked over if you have something that you

1489
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:40,200
really need to say.

1490
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,560
And okay, now I can see that Don is here.

1491
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,000
Okay.

1492
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,020
How are you?

1493
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:46,700
Don is here.

1494
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,540
Put her there.

1495
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,040
Don's coming.

1496
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:48,760
How are you, buddy?

1497
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,300
Praise Don.

1498
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,220
He's a jolly good fella.

1499
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,520
Praise Don.

1500
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,780
Yeah, I remember the praise Don skissum.

1501
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:00,360
Me too, and Lou, and all that.

1502
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:01,840
Yeah, praise Don.

1503
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:02,460
Yeah, that never ends.

1504
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,480
It's a real fucking fuck on.

1505
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:13,200
Oh, I think we just had another caller who doesn't know how to listen to make sure he's

1506
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,440
not being talked over before saying something and hanging up.

1507
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,400
I think we have five more minutes.

1508
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,840
Nobody could hear what you just said.

1509
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,960
Put the real talk show on.

1510
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,160
I could hear it because I have a superhuman sense of hearing.

1511
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:22,920
What a sucker.

1512
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:23,480
Yes, you are.

1513
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,240
Thank goodness I am stone deaf.

1514
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,840
I have not heard a word anybody said this whole show.

1515
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,960
Man, I had a couple of interesting hearing tests recently.

1516
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:39,760
I was out for a hike on a park trail last weekend with my dad, who is older than you

1517
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:39,980
two.

1518
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,460
Put it together.

1519
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,860
And I could hear.

1520
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:44,880
125.

1521
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,540
I could hear.

1522
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:45,620


1523
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:45,620


1524
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:45,620


1525
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:45,620


1526
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:45,620


1527
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:45,620


1528
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:45,620


1529
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:45,620


1530
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:45,620


1531
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:45,620


1532
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:45,620


1533
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:45,620


1534
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:50,700
I could hear a bicycle behind us, squeaking of the metal parts behind us.

1535
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,040
Squeak.

1536
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,320
And I knew to get out of the way because I could hear the bike coming.

1537
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,800
My dad did not hear the bike coming.

1538
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:55,820
He was surprised by it.

1539
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:02,880
And then there was a TV show I was watching where there was some kind of ultrasonic like

1540
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:08,340
beeping going on saying like, oh, you couldn't hear this because you're too old to hear it.

1541
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,060
But I could hear it.

1542
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:15,040
It was really quiet but loud at the same time and a very high pitched like, I can't even

1543
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,000
do this.

1544
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:16,280
Wow.

1545
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:21,680
Dr. Sinister, you know those headphones that you have on your head right now?

1546
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,840
Yeah, I had to turn them way down.

1547
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,780
I had to turn them way down because you were the last person to use them.

1548
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:33,980
Well, eventually you will find yourself cranking them up a little bit more each time.

1549
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:34,800
Every time.

1550
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,240
And someday that bicycle is going to come behind you and knock you right over.

1551
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,180
They say it's inevitable.

1552
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,120
They say it's inevitable.

1553
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,880
Over time you will lose some range.

1554
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,020
But you get to be old like the Reverend Steele.

1555
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:45,020


1556
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:45,020


1557
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:49,240
Yeah, I'm still under 40, so.

1558
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,840
Well, 40 is the new 30.

1559
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:52,880
30 is the new 20.

1560
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:53,660
20 is the new kid.

1561
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:55,060
Not biologically.

1562
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,260
No, that's true.

1563
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:57,040
Only fashion.

1564
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,000
Only can't.

1565
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,500
Only culture.

1566
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,020
70 is the old.

1567
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,260
I found out when I hit 50.

1568
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:06,140
He's only 70 years young.

1569
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,500
He can get the lifestyle lift.

1570
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,880
When I hit 50, it's like screw fashion.

1571
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,620
For kids from six to 60s.

1572
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:15,020
That's the thing.

1573
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:15,020


1574
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:15,020


1575
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:15,020


1576
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:15,020


1577
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:15,020


1578
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:15,020


1579
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:15,020


1580
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:15,020


1581
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:15,020


1582
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:15,060
That's the thing.

1583
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,620
Oldsters 90 years young.

1584
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:22,340
All right, so we've got another caller here who is probably not going to listen to see

1585
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:24,760
whether or not anyone's talking over him before he says his thing.

1586
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:25,800
Well, go ahead and try.

1587
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:26,840
Let's find out.

1588
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:31,100
All right, now you're on the air and I want you to listen before you say anything to make

1589
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:34,680
sure nobody's talking over you so we can actually hear what you have to say before you hang

1590
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,220
up on us.

1591
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:36,640
Okay.

1592
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:44,180
This is Potsy and I'm going to take my ice cream truck and buy a bunch of weed.

1593
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:45,020
I'm going to buy a bunch of weed.

1594
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:45,020


1595
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:45,020


1596
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,520
Ice cream.

1597
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,520
I don't think that's Potsy.

1598
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,080
Everybody's a crappy comedian.

1599
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,320
Nobody's got any ice cream here.

1600
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:53,940
Next.

1601
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:56,240
Ice cream.

1602
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,040
You scream.

1603
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,140
We all scream.

1604
00:49:59,260 --> 00:49:59,800
That's it.

1605
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:00,460
For Bob.

1606
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:03,420
Yeah, we've only got, we've got less than two minutes.

1607
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:11,220
So all kidding aside, if you really want to do, shout one last barbaric yawp, this might

1608
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:11,880
be the time.

1609
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:14,860
Yawp.

1610
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:14,940
Yawp.

1611
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:15,000
Yawp.

1612
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:15,380
Yawp.

1613
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,400
Yawp.

1614
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:16,400


1615
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:16,900
You're on the air.

1616
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:17,760
Oy-yi.

1617
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,700
Yes, this is Fred.

1618
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:21,660
Hello, Fred.

1619
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:22,700
I'm your biggest fan.

1620
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,880
I'm your guys' biggest fan.

1621
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,560
Wow, thank you.

1622
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:27,060
Yes.

1623
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:27,760
That's pretty good.

1624
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:28,940
Fucker late, but Potsy.

1625
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:30,320
Fucker late, but Potsy.

1626
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,300
What was that?

1627
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,980
I couldn't quite hear it.

1628
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:33,880
Oh, God.

1629
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:36,040
The butternut bread, Fred.

1630
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,820
Try to erase that.

1631
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:38,680
Bring home the butternut bread.

1632
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:41,560
Aren't you glad you stuck around for an extra two hours?

1633
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:43,920
Hasn't this been the best two hours of radio you've ever done?

1634
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:44,880
Boy, I'll say.

1635
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:50,660
That's an evil laugh

1636
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:52,460
That's an evil laugh

1637
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:55,340
Somehow you feel that you've left out

1638
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:57,120
The most important thing

1639
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,740
Bring home the butternut bread

1640
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:00,580
Fred

1641
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:03,780
Bring home the butternut bread

1642
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:04,660
And now

1643
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,920
Drop dead Fred

1644
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,340
Yeah drop dead

1645
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,300
The actor who played him just died recently

1646
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:13,020
It's true and it's what he gets for being in that

1647
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:14,240
Phoebe Cates epic

1648
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,720
There used to be a Cleveland band

1649
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,300
Called the Phoebe Cates

1650
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,380
They don't know more

1651
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,520
Time hath endless rarities

1652
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,040
And shows of all varieties

1653
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:25,800
Yeah

1654
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:28,660
Well speaking of time

1655
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,820
It is just about midnight

1656
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,180
Oh thank god

1657
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:35,120
My grandfather's head

1658
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,060
Was too large for the shelf

1659
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:37,980
Last call

1660
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:40,980
Last call of the night

1661
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,460
Can I have like a double

1662
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:44,100
With

1663
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:46,520
Last call to breakfast

1664
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,820
No matter how you feel

1665
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:49,300
I know this is not Keith

1666
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,500
March around the table

1667
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,220
And have fun with Don McNeil

1668
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:54,320
How is everybody doing

1669
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:58,680
Are those guys trying to break into the station

1670
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,100
Yeah

1671
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,100
Are they trying to break into your car

1672
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,920
I'm sorry about your asthma caller

1673
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:06,760
Yes

1674
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:08,900
Sucks to your asthma

1675
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,520
I feel your pain

1676
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:13,460
Yeah I remember

1677
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,460
The doctor Igor

1678
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:16,900
Asthma brand

1679
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,040
This is actually

1680
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,300
I've returned to being gay again

1681
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:24,080
I get to taking up the ass

1682
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,160
Oh dear

1683
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:28,040
Well so much for that

1684
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:28,980
That was

1685
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:30,500
Inappropriate

1686
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:33,420
He was doing a great job up until the end there

1687
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,260
He was doing a very convincing impression

1688
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:36,400
Right up until the end there

1689
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,440
But then it all fell apart

1690
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,900
I do a lot of voices myself

1691
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,800
My deep Keith voice

1692
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,400
Anarchy was loosed upon the world

1693
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,280
My deep Keith voice is almost the same as my George Takei voice

1694
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:46,920
That's it

1695
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,440
They're very similar

1696
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:49,880
Maybe they are the same

1697
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,400
They kind of had this equality like this to their voice

1698
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,800
Where they kind of talk this way

1699
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,000
Except Keith will say

1700
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:56,940
Good morning

1701
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,540
You sound pretty good

1702
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:00,560
They're both fabulous

1703
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,360
Well it's been fun

1704
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:06,220
Well that's the most charitable thing you could have possibly said about tonight

1705
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:06,900
Thank you

1706
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,460
Yes it has been always

1707
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:09,640
Always

1708
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:13,440
Maybe when I listen back to the recording I'll agree with you

1709
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:16,440
You'll make some sense out of all this mishmash

1710
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,020
Hash

1711
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,800
Yeah I'll be perfectly happy to wait a couple weeks for the copies

1712
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,200
No need to hang around to copy them tonight

1713
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,800
No need to wait around for the copies

1714
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,400
I know you're good for it

1715
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:31,060
So

1716
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,960
This has been Synesthesia Special Edition

1717
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,220
We've been staying Princess Wee and Dr. Howland Owl

1718
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:43,440
For a long time

1719
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:44,760
Farewell one and all

1720
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,120
Well farewell

1721
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:49,340
We will meet again in a place where there is no darkness

1722
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:52,520
Hal can you do a line from Half-Life for us please

1723
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:54,920
Have you seen my coffee cup?

1724
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,500
Thank you so much

1725
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,880
I have actually played that game just to hear your voice

1726
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,400
I'm not kidding

1727
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:01,800
Thank you

1728
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,480
I already had a copy of it

1729
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,740
Before I found out that you were in it

1730
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:08,540
Well I recorded this year for Plague Incorporated

1731
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:09,980
Awesome

1732
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,440
I'm going to a Z.A. meeting

1733
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,120
No brains allowed

1734
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:17,920
No brains allowed

1735
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,620
Kind of like this program

1736
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:20,320
Exactly

1737
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,340
That's why I listen

1738
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,040
I'm safe

1739
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,540
No brains here

1740
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:23,900
Good night doctor

1741
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,340
Good night Buddha

1742
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:25,840
Good night

00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,740
Well I don't know

1746
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:31,420
A little of this

1747
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:31,900
A little of that

1748
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,760
From PR News in Washington

1749
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:38,900
I'm timed to the huge 1997 perversion of the British percent in June

1750
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,320
Russian President Vladimir Putin says

1751
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,140
June percents were cut

1752
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,060
One year ago

1753
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:45,760
PR's report reports

1754
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,660
I'm just in time for PR News

1755
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:50,920
President Putin said you're a contagious disease

1756
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,440
Putin presented President Petropor

1757
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,420
Peace PN provinces

1758
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,860
He said to attack PR News

1759
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,780
They demanded PR News

1760
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,020
Hurricane Brennan says

1761
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:07,260
Watch and uh duh

1762
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,860
The hurricane now says

1763
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:09,400
Arthur

1764
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,000
On Wall Street

1765
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,640
1-8-6-9-4-6

1766
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,960
7-4-5

1767
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:15,960
Officials in Nigeria

1768
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,840
In a busy marketplace today

1769
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,420
And dozens of others

1770
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:21,280
In the northeastern part of the country

1771
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,280
At least 8 people were active in that part of the country

1772
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,720
No one is feared hurt or dead

1773
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,960
But no one is claiming responsibility

1774
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,180
President Putin says

1775
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:33,200
This is smart huge PR News

1776
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:36,060
Millions of years after that singularity

1777
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:36,360
What do you think Bob?

1778
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,360
You want to do this for a living?

1779
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:37,980
Sure

1780
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,460
Let's sit down and have a cup of coffee

1781
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:42,040
This is just like

1782
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:42,520
This is a

1783
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,500
This is solid at ordinary temperatures and pressures

1784
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,400
Another night with Bob

1785
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,640
This damn church

1786
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,260
I was born near a damn church

1787
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:50,440
A little village

1788
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:52,100
Simple agricultural

1789
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,340
Well praise the Lord and hallelujah

1790
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:54,540
We are the living

1791
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,620
Now I'm not going to name any names

1792
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:57,920
In stereo

1793
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,680
Somebody has to take this lump from me

1794
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,840
More coffee

1795
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,500
Will you have one lump or two?

1796
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,360
Damn good cup of coffee Bob

1797
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:06,820
Thanks

1798
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,460
This is a joke

1799
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:08,880
I like it

1800
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,720
Yeah it is it's a show it's just a joke

1801
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,520
You sure as hell got that right?

1802
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:12,620
Yeah it is it's a show it's just a joke

1803
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,560
Thank you

1804
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,620
How did that happen Bob?

1805
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:21,040
Work hard work concentration and extreme effort

1806
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,340
The beginning of brought to fruition

1807
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:28,320
Those things predicted in the before life

1808
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,140
And in the pre scriptures

1809
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:35,420
No it's going to be a real pleasure working with you again Bob

1810
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:36,960
Okay it's countdown

1811
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,440
Countdown to the end of the show

1812
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:39,860
I'm sure I told you

1813
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:41,520
Kevin is Bob's best man

1814
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,740
You got the message

1815
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:47,180
I did

1816
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:49,620
What

1817
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,320
Seeing Bob

1818
00:56:55,320 --> 00:57:11,400
Has a secret place

1819
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:11,500
Heh heh heh gratuitous

1820
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,320
Bob, Bob, Bob!

1821
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,000
The breath of the show smells like that.

1822
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:15,500
Get Bob!

1823
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:15,500


1824
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,840
We're not back in an hour.

1825
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,440
We'll reschedule the rehearsal for first of June.

1826
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,400
Okay, all right, fine, fine, fine.

1827
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,200
Oh, I'm sorry.

1828
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,100
It's time to go down, Mr. Blaney.

1829
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:25,060
It's over.

1830
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,540
Well, Hal, I don't want to come to rehearsal tomorrow morning.

1831
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,440
I'd really rather do something else.

1832
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:31,960
Yeah, I mean, yes, that would be more of a deal.

1833
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:32,560
What?

1834
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:33,360
No, the show's over.

1835
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:34,240
It's over.

1836
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:35,520
The show's over, yeah.

1837
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:36,040
I'm sorry.

1838
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:36,660
No, it's over.

1839
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,140
Well, actually, that's all she wrote.

1840
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,780
X.9.3 minutes.

1841
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,200
A medical facility researching the criminal mind.

1842
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,640
Since you had massive head injuries,

1843
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:47,960
I've used a brain from your workplace as a replacement.

1844
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:51,520
So basically, I turned Carl into Skeeter Winnie Dobbs,

1845
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:53,160
and Skeeter turned out to be pretty bad,

1846
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,020
so I have to kill him again.

1847
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:54,540
What?

1848
00:57:55,380 --> 00:58:00,560
Winnie Dobbs was killed yesterday by the owner of a catering truck.

1849
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:03,000
The victim was wanted by the state police

1850
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,240
in connection of two teenage girls.

1851
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:07,980
Murder?

1852
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,200
He dug himself out of the grave.

1853
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:37,360
He thought about the đop County Jail now over with mother couple Gang��

1854
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:40,500
Don't let us deter you from doing business with us again.

1855
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:50,380
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1856
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:54,620
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

1857
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,360
send a self-addressed stamped envelope to...

1858
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,320
Got your pencil ready?

1859
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,500
Bob, Post Office Box...

1860
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:13,940
That's Bob, P.O. Box...

1861
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:24,300
1-8-1-4-1-7 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118 www.subgenius.com

1862
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,500
Stay tuned and praise Bob!

1863
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:35,440
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show,

1864
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:38,920
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough

1865
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,740
to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1866
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:46,760
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1867
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,820
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that Slack back to rebound to you,

1868
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:57,800
you should go to subgenius.com front page,

1869
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:00,240
or especially the radio page, or the catalog,

1870
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:01,260
store pages,

1871
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:04,660
and help out financially as best you can.

1872
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:09,040
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1873
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:12,660
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1874
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,680
But some of you still have jobs.

1875
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:18,980
Even five bucks makes a big difference,

1876
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:22,520
even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1877
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,880
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1878
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,240
All we're saying is that

1879
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:30,480
blowjobs.com could go...

1880
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,740
blow the way of Steve Jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1881
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,320
We also take checks and money orders to

1882
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,220
Subgenius Foundation,

1883
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:51,680
P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1884
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:56,900
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be Slack.
