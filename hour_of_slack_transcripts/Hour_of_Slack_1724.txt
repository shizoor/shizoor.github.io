I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright.
No, no you're not alright.
You're exhausted.
That thing around your neck!
I could help a bit.
I could carry it for a while.
No.
I could carry it for a while.
Are you propositioning me?
Share the load.
Share the load.
The load.
The load.
Get away!
Can I get a praise bar?
Yeah!
Praise bar!
Some power on the slack.
Ah, yes.
Dear friends, we're back to X-Day for this show.
And we've also got a new song by El Queso,
who is heard in the background.
And yes, yes, yes, friends.
And X-Day, the great celebration at Brushwood,
in far rural, mysterious, western New York State,
where the subgeniuses go to await the saucers
prophesied by their great slack master,
J.R. Bob Dobson.
J.R. Bob Dobson.

And now friends, the title music from the video,
Dobson Deliasticies.
I gotta have some swag.
Before we go, I'd like to thank you for watching.
I'm your host, J.R. Bob Dobson.
And I'll see you next time.
Bye.

Just part of the folks.
Now let's make a call.
Your mind is not my mind.
Don't forget that.
My mind is not your mind.
They should have 24-7 Love Genius Radio.
They should.
I would volunteer to be one of the DJs on that show, on that station.
Let's all get my radio broadcasting.
And you would just listen to 24 hours of this show?
Oh, yeah.
No, 24 minutes.
Oh, 24 minutes.
Oh, 24 hours.
24 hours, seven days a week.
24 planets.
That would be tough.
I'd have to have some time off.
24 rings of smoke around the head of the caller.
Okay, we could call this caller.
And this caller would serve as part of the great radio team.
The fantastic 24-hour.
And they're watching the show.
24 hours a day.
Oh, the great team of Buzzing Evidence.
Dr. Philo Drummond and Dr. Howell.
24-7 on KPFA in sub-Berkeley.
What about this new song you ask about Prairie Squid, you say?
By the El Queso All-Stars?
You're my angel in a bucket, my darling in a pail.
And I'm writing you this letter from the lonesome county jail.
They say that I'm a little too old to be a man.

But it's all natural to love you the way that I did.
They call it a crime to spend all my time six inches deep in a prairie squid.
So I send you this reminder of a heart that beats for two.
And I hope you're doing all right in the refrigerator.
You've got plenty of time.
I've got room in the bucket.
So I'm guessing that you'll be okay.
Cause when I get out and back into you, I'm hoping you'll still feel the same way.
Hoping that you'll feel the same way.
My darling, this letter is sealed with my tears.
But it's Bob.
Bob is my witness.
I swear I'll return to your many loving arms.
Angel in a bucket.
I want you.
Angel in a bucket.
I need you.
Angel in a bucket.
I can't live without you, baby.
Angel in a bucket.
Angel in a bucket.
Kind of kick a little something past you for the G's and make a few friends as I breathe.
You know it's two in the morning and the party's still jumping.
Because my old lady ain't home.
The bitch is in the living room and getting it on.
And they ain't leaving until six in the morning.
What you want to do?
I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too.
So turn out the lights.
Shut the doors.
But we don't love them whores.
G Gordon Gordon dear friends at 7X Day.
Before that, the El Queso All Stars.
This is God's Got Talent.




He's got the friends but he needs a location.
He's got a local but he needs the supplies.
But friends have supplies so they all get together.
Now everybody's welcome at the party tonight.
It's time to redefine the new school group.
Or two-tone suits hanging by the door.
Super orgy portal party.
Super orgy portal party.
Super orgy portal party.
Super orgy portal party.
Super orgy portal party.
Super orgy portal party.

You know I actually went to one of those Bob Dobbs devivals.
Yeah there was one last night. It was a great time.
I shouldn't have said devivals.
One of the X Days but...
Oh, X Day. Wow, yeah.
After the original X Day, like everything before it was a drill
and everything after it was like
the second year was double X Day,
and then there was triple X Day.
Yeah, well here's the thing. We don't know what year 1998 will really be
because the conspiracy calendar is messed up.
Right.
So, you know, any day could...
tomorrow and you may die, that's just saying
that
the world may well end tomorrow for all we know.
You don't know. I'm fairly confident
because the story that I heard
at approximately
7.05 on X-Day
was that Bob Dobbs, when he
received the secret message from the X's,
he
wrote it on a bar napkin,
but the actual date
is if you turn 1998 upside down,
it's 8,661.
So that's the actual year
they're going to come, so we're still
supposed to go to Starwood.
The latest theory I heard was
5,000 years from now, about
The latest theory I heard was
2017
because of
Because Ivan Stank thinks he's going to live that long?
No, because 1984 came
19 years too late.
When the president started saying,
war is peace, last year, we knew
that means it must really be 1984.
Radio Synesthesia
on
on WCSB in Cleveland
with Dr. Sinister.
Before that, the super orgy
porno party thing is by
the Planet Smashers.
But now,
Little Theodore
live at X-Day.
And now, the ultimate song about
pink life.
Pink Life
Get up out of bed
Sour on my head
Drinking down a cup
Trying to wake up
Driving off for town
Feeling like a clown
Some guy's in my lane
Heard a bullet through his window pane
Heard a bullet through his window pane
Heard a bullet through his window pane
Pull into the lot
Heard a bullet through his door pane


Got my favorite spot
Boy, you're such a Glass~"
Greeting everyone
Individual death
Trying to act
Dumb
You can't
I don't belong here
But then of course the question is then where?
I'm plagued by one great doubt
It's become what my life's all about
If I had done that
I wouldn't have to do this
If I had done that
I wouldn't have to do this
If I had done that
Friends, I wish we had the rest of that song.
Little Theodore, live at X-Day.
You can get more about that at littletheodore.com
And now back to Puzzling Evidence with Dr. Howell and Philo.
A debriefing after 7X Day.
Let's see, what else happened that was exceptional
and really amazing?
Well, there was the auction, of course.
The auction for subgenius youth outreach.
That is correct.
And Hal and I were the subgenius youth outreach recipients.
Senior division, of course.
Yes, our cabin was for youthful types like Sir Guy Dua,
who was also in our cabin.
One of the three snorers of distinction.
I found out later they put us all together for a specific reason.
The Snorewood Factor.
That's right, the Snorewood Factor.
They had this wooden snore device, snore capturing device below the chamber.
This is one of my favorite movies.
Come on, you guys, be quiet.
I want you to watch this.
Okay, all right.
Hal fell asleep again.
This is the part where Ivan Stang takes over the world.
A thousand experiments.
A thousand failures.
And then, at last, the great, wonderful day.
Stang.
It's just the great, wonderful day.
The last little mixture of drugs.
But why?
Why do it?
Stang.
Just a scientific experiment at first.
That's all.
To do something no other men in the world have done.
But there's more to it than that.
I know now.
It came to me suddenly.
The drugs I took seemed to be the only thing I could do.
They seemed to light up my brain.
Suddenly I realized the power I held.
The power to rule.
To make the world grovel at my feet.
We'll soon put the world right now.
We'll begin with the reign of terror.
A few murders here and there.
Murders of great men.
Murders of little men.
Just to show we make no distinction.
We might even wreck a train or two.
Just these fingers.
Around the eyes of the criminal.














the signalman's throat. That's all. So where's my frop, Stang? Stang, where's my frop, man?
You want that award again, don't you? The Hey Stang Award. Hey Stang. Hey Stang. See
my butt plug, Stang? I snore all night and I'm like this in the day. Hal can actually
snore before he goes to sleep. It's like as he's beginning to enter his sleep cycle,
the snoring begins. But the second or third night, I was able to obtain some ear things.
Some ear muffs, all right. Ear plugs. Give a plug for those muffs. I couldn't even hear
the fan. I couldn't hear anything. I could just hear my breathing. The fans, he refers
to, were specifically imported by Philo, not to cool the room down, but just to make
noise.
A white noise that would ideally muffle all the snoring into one rattling roar.
We had three fans that blew a vortex that was enough to just...
It often blew the frop smoke away to silence the shrill beeping of the fire alarm, which
would be set off by the clouds of punching frop smoke.
We had one fan whose only job was to blow the smoke past the fire alarm before it would
set the fire alarm off.
But it did also provide a secondary purpose, and that was to keep the wind blowing across
my...
Ow.
Ow.
That hurt.
Oh, don't snap it like that. That's not going to do anybody any good.
So we had three fans positioned that blew a vortex, about a 30 to 40 mile an hour circular
wind inside our snoring chamber.
Okay, I got it.
Oh, there we go.
Sorry.
What?
Oh, there she goes.
This is Lady Time going by.
Trying to remember what show she's listening to.
You have a drug problem.
I lost my drugs twice today.
Twice today.
If it were not for the power of Bob and the love of subgenii, I would be fropless.
I lost my frop.
Twice.
And why?
And why?
Drugs.
Because the frop took your mind.
No, it wasn't a frop.
It was a false drug.
It was the false marijuana.
This stuff here.
It's not frop.
That's why it took my mind.
It's false drugs.
You don't want to smoke it.
It made me throw my sunglasses in the fire.
It made you lose your other false drugs.
It made me lose my real false drugs twice.
Not once, but twice.
Fool me once, shit on you.
Fool me twice, fuck you.
My mind is not my mind.
I never personally been to the big party.
But I suppose that if I did, I'd have a good time.
Lots of folks I see doing it regularly.
And they tell me that it feels just fine.
Time to redefine the new school group.
Or two-tone suits scattered on the floor.
Super orgy porno party.
Super orgy porno party.
Super orgy porno party.
Super orgy porno party.
Super orgy porno party.
I no longer wish to preach to the choir.
If I'm going to be reduced to preaching about things that we are well aware of,
then I am going to be preaching to others besides you illustrious folk.
I'm going to have to go out there into the world, make a goddamn fool of myself,
and preach the word of Bob, aren't I?
Well...
If that's what it requires, then that is what it requires.
But I will admit this.
I won't go gently into that good night.
I will, however, fly high and happy aboard the pleasure saucers
on that fateful day, whenever it may be.
And I've heard that it might not be this year.
I'm hoping it will be.
But it might not.
But whenever it is, even if it's just myself,
it could be two other people, it could be three other people,
it could be four other people,
it could be four thousand other people who board the pleasure saucers with me.
I will board those saucers.
And I will do it with the knowledge that my consciousness is clean,
that I have slacked off to the fullest of my ability and comprehension,
and that I have lusted and hated in an entirely satisfying way.
Ladies and gentlemen, I may be young,
but I have never seen something so slack-producing in all my born days.
I can only hope that I have many, many born days to celebrate the slack further,
and I can hope that you, too, celebrate your slack until the very day you die
and shut up like hell.
So, go out there, stay, watch the bands, whatever, enjoy the purient interest,
get drunk, smoke the frob, I don't care, I don't mind.
Just know that on that fateful day, 7 a.m., July 5th,
you will be saved.
A huge thanks to American

Hey people ofициall,
who are Maned right now
Thank you or Number,
I will stay with you.
Shout out to
And now, for your edification, your bewonderment, your bafflement, your, finally, your slack.
I proudly, in the name of J. R. Bob Dobbs, present to you, little Theodore and a babooshtay!
Not always sure what the point is, but we press on anyway.
I want an ugly girl who loves nobody but me.
I want an ugly girl who's got no need to be free.
I want an ugly girl who's got no need to be free.


Ugly girl, who thinks that's the way to be?
Ha!
I want an ugly girl, I'll make you jealous if you just wait and see.
Ugly girl, must be lonely, an ugly girl would love you only.
Ugly girl, may not look any harder now, but ugly girls have got just as many parts.
I want an ugly girl, not there, not the paper thing.
I want an ugly girl, bring me back to a love in a frame.
I want an ugly girl, make you proud if you didn't see.
I want an ugly girl, sure I'm all over the place.
Ugly girl, deserve happiness too.
An ugly girl would think the world of you.
Ugly girl, maybe easy.
But ugly girl, don't have me.
I want an ugly girl, who can tell you all about pain.
I want an ugly girl, who's the devil.
I want an ugly girl, who looks like a profane.
I want an ugly girl, take her out and start to do it.
Now I thought I'd sing something pretty and refined about something special.
Oh.
It must have been cold there in my freezer.
With never a microwave heating you up.
You aspire to be a quick dinner on my plate
But were content to wait until the time came up
So when I came home one night hungry
There you were waiting for me
That beautiful cheese was running down your side
Those wonderful beef jalapenos A and B
Did you ever think that I'd be hungry?

Did you ever know you're my burrito?
I ate your leg last week, yeah
And though you passed right on through me
They are still the wind between my cheeks
Did you ever know you're my burrito?
I ate your leg last week, yeah
And though you passed right on through me
They are still the wind
Yeah
I ate your leg last week, yeah

They are still the wind between my cheeks
One more time everybody, now!
Did you ever know you're my burrito?
I ate your leg last week, yeah
And though you passed right on through me
They are still the wind between my cheeks
One more time everybody, now!
You're still the wind between my cheeks
Oh, the wind between my cheeks
Oh, fly, fly, escape into the sky
Offending all that you passed by
Thank you, thank you
Thank Rosarita for you though
Thank Rosarita for you though
The wind between my cheeks
This is by George Meredith, Lucifer in Starlight.
One starred night, Prince Lucifer arose, tired of his dark dominions,
swung the fiend above the rolling ball in cloud parts green,
where sinners hugged their specter of repose.
Poor prey to his hot fit of pride were those.
Now upon his westward wing he leans, now his huge bulk o'er Africa's sands careens,
now the black shadows shadowed Arctic snows.
Soaring through wider zones that pricked his scars with memories of the old revolt from awe,
he reached a middle height, and at the stars,
which are the brain of heaven, he looked and sank.
Around the ancient track marched rank on rank the army of unalterable law.
Ah yes, Dr. Powell at Ex Day, dear friends.
Before that, Babushka, and before that, little Theodore, said,
by the way, they have a live at,
double Ex Day album out from their Ex Day performance in 1999.
You might check out little Theodore.com.
And before that, the amino acids themselves live at 7 Ex Day.
See the amino acids.com.
And before that, the youngest subgenius,
a ranter and winner of the Bobby Award for that this year,
Reverend Alex Thompson.
And now,
from WREK in Atlanta,
the Bob Slacktime Funhouse Show,
lymph node institute,
Doc Ellis.
Good evening, you tinsenny.
This is a blive Doc Ellis of the lymph node institute.
Tonight, I would like to talk to another audience besides you,
the cells of this great beast.
That is our church, our rock, and our deceiver.
I would like to address that scruffy guy laying on the floor of that strange room.
And you, the skinny girl in the back seat who can't remember where the car is headed.
You, my captive audience.
Your proximity to this broadcast is no accident.
Bob's is a strange and frightening bedotted countenance,
which comes unto you, like unto the angry bum in the alleyway.

Though he may befoul you and rob you in unexpected ways,
you also gain from his violation.
For Bob is the center of a giant reciprocal force.
And though he befouls and robs,
he also blanches and misplaces,
so creating as he destroys,
and obeying the first law of thermodynamics,
which states that energy can only be converted from one state to another,
but cannot be converted.

And so, Bob's is a very lucky man,
and we're with the whole briny-claws scuttling bit.
Elliot, the question Bob has for you tonight is,
how would you like to bust one of those claws of yours open,
and taste your own succulent meat?
Because whether you know it or not,
you have been living on borrowed time,
and you have been living on borrowed time,

since July of 1998.
And this brief foray of yours to the happy side of the luck plane
is both a warning and an inducement.
The church of the subgenius,
no less than Bob Spear,
lanced to the core of this world,
is the only religion that just wants to befoul and rob you.
Your brain, life, soul, etc. are yours to keep,
or at least hold onto for as long as you can.
The other religions are imperfect imitations,
or precursors, depending on how you look at it.
But, however you look at it,
this is the only church that works for you.
While we're on the subject, to be honest for once,
I too was deeply wounded when July 5th, 1998 rolled around,
and I was denied the spectacle of my unsaved friends and loved ones
tortured by the indignity of the surreal death of my own personal design.
Yeah, I had big plans,
and Bob just pissed them away.
But, we're well past that now.
Right past that into the frozen, shrieking, steel death trap.
Okay.
Well, I know I see people, and they ask me,
how did the Institute fall into the sway with the church?
Well, it was almost inevitable.
When you deal in incalculable margins as we do,
naturally, when it came time to select the trans-intuitive meme conveyance device,
we chose the one with the nice, pointy smile.
That, and it does attract a somewhat higher quality sample of the gene pool.
Of course, as in a usual population, about half the samples are fruitless,
but for some reason, far more vocal about it.
The apathy and ennui that supernatural protection can lead to,
for some, is that last layer of jade that forces their heads to sink into their torsos.
However, and listen closely,
because this is how we make our money.
The other half, instead of being merely acceptable,
as in the population at large,
is extra ordinary.
And I tell ya, the thing I love about the subgenius mind,
almost without exception,
is that the extra ordinary ones think that they are purposeless,
and the fruitless ones think that they are extra ordinary.
We've been working on that squirt package almost from the beginning.
But, more than just an easy access to an unquantifiable demographic,
the church, quite frankly, is the most powerful opiate at our disposal.
And of course, the triple your money back guarantee.
Because everything has a price.
So pay up if you won't wake up,
and get your soma that sweet, sweet slack while you still can.
I don't have to tell you what this church does
for the mutant population at large.
The jolly factors have not stopped rising
since Bob was first shot in the 80s.
These jolly factors, of course, cannot rise forever,
but try to enjoy the flow,
and fatten up your nintle ives.
For, perhaps, leaner days,
when the inevitable ebb sucks you dry.
So, take it for granted,
but also enjoy the decadence
of your easy dismissal.
The dismissal of plenty.
An infinite regress of self-referential onanism.
And then, in the rapidly approaching
global American Christian theocracy,
you will finally have an opportunity
to appreciate all the associative spice
that the church has added to your collective stew.
Yes, when the big squeeze comes,
a good laugh, or how about a sincere smile,
will be at a premium.
And when all of those chemicals
you pour into your gullet are cut off,
you will find that your memory
is a lot better than you think.
That's the good news.
As for the bad news,
well, let me put it this way.
As you try to slip away in your cell,
away from the stench and pathetic,
vacant murmurs of those
not so well connected as you,
beneath the incessant squall
of monotone Bible passages,
echoing off of concrete and steel,
day and night,
well, at about that moment,
you, weary traveler,
will have some place to go.
That funny thing Stang said that time,
that comic panel etched on your eyelids,
that distant twinkle of a Rudy Schwartz ditty.
Whatever it is,
it is one last place they cannot touch.
It won't save your life,
or ultimately your sanity,
but it might save your soul,
which will then return to the quagmire
from whence it issued,
pure and potent,
to reinfect the fibers of the core.
So, when the whole operation goes belly up
and the books are burning in the street
and the wickers are swinging from the street lamps,
you will be that lucky one,
whistling your way to your martyrdom,
that will unnerve them and their kind forever.
Or at least until they wipe out
the first 90% or so of the mutant population,
then they will undoubtedly lose their zeal,
and the 10% that remains can begin
infection of the meat side
with their latent yeti gene,
just like they did about 600 years ago.
The time to have your head up is now.
The time of fire and glass
will be the time to duck, silly goose.
So, when those durable and self-replicating thought viruses
envelop your fevered brain,
try to remember to break off a little something
for that man, Bob.
This is for real.
Not like that.
Okay, I got some.
You, scamp, you brought out your Biohazard Onrab.
And no, because that ionizer seems to be

Whatever,
but at least my four thousand fingers

Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay, flop it in the back.
Wow, this guy.
Somebody cried.
Somebody died.
Somebody died.
Die.
Someone was born.
Die.
I got to die.
Yeah.
I got to die.
Hello.
I got to die.
We are all past.
We rise and rise again.
It is our mission.
It is our mission.

We are the earth.
Yet you still ask.
We are not.
Save the universe.
We are gone.
Save the universe.
We are gone.
Save the universe.

This time.
Save the universe.
We are free.


We are free.
Save the universe.

Acid Corpse at X Day.
My friends, the Swingin' Love Corpse is mixed with the amino acids
and Carter LeBlanc in an unholy mess.
And then, of course, we got to stock up on the subgenius special meals they had.
They were MRE meals.
It was a good show until you guys were doing that.
The subgenius MREs will be...
They'll stay fresh to the year 2005.
Wow.
Did it storm there at all?
Yes, it did.
Rain.
Thunder crashed.
Lightning flashed.
And rain came down in torrents.
While we all sat inside the Eaton Hall and watched the Stang videos
projected on the giant screen.
Let's go back in time.
Hey, did you have a nap that day, Hal, in the rain?
Huh?
I had a nap in the rain.
I don't know.
Maybe I did.
That was so good.
Is that the one where Sister What's-Her-Name came in and pelted us with flowers in the morning?
What day was that?
They all blur into one...
They did blur together because we would sleep in the day and stay awake at night.
I'd be awake all night, that's for sure.
But unlike the awful C-rations of World War II, you'll look forward to these subgenius meals.
Start with your appetizer, like peanut butter on a cracker.
I never had any meals.
Mix your powdered beverage.
Cocoa.
Coffee.
Apple cider.
All the things that are calling the show continues.
It's leaking.
Move on to your entree.
No, no, don't be shrieking either.
Yes, sir.
Starburst some tacos.
Just listen to these old guys talk.
Or another do-basedy treat.
Yes, they said that Bob stood for boring old bastards.
They like to go on and on and on in the middle of the night.
Jeez.
Like what they have to say is important.
That was a really good one.
B-O-B.
Boring old bastards.
24 hours a day.
See, now that's what's been going on.
For many years.
That you don't realize.
This show is going on 24 hours a day.
It's just, these are the only two hours you get.
Plus, they give you the new Israeli surplus gas mask.
I get the other 22 hours.
Those are really the best.
No more where you have to endure the stench of the outhouse.
You can wear this subgenius Israeli surplus gas mask for all your stinky jobs.
That's what the Israeli subgeniuses have been working on?
Yes.
Yes, they've got a special brand new Israeli subgenius surplus gas mask.
Is it non-mess and waterproof?
It relieves you of those stinky, stinky gases.
Well, what if the stinky gases overflow in the water?
Hey, not to worry.
It's all rubber with plexiglass eyes.
Oh, that's cool.
G. Gordon Gordon has requested the song,
You Guys Really Fucking Suck.
We know that one.
We do know.
We practiced that one yesterday.
Sort of a bossa nova.
Sort of a bossa nova.
You guys really suck.
You guys really suck.
You really suck.
You guys really suck.
You really suck.
You guys really suck a lot.
We think you're stupid.
We think you're dumb.
You really suck! You guys really suck a lot!
You really suck! You really suck! You guys really suck a lot!
Suddenly someone appears at the turnstile who grows to gigantical size.
Frenchies like it, Belgians, Dutchies, Germans, Krautsies, Austrians.
You're talking about next day?
Crotation marks.
Well, there were some Britishers who came all the way to X-Day.
British pantalons like it.
Yeah, we had Pope Phil Monty there.
True.
And his Gore-Tex bibs.
Also, Sister Televangela.
Was there.
Who?
What?
Just many subgenius celebrities.
She was hotter than a $2 pistol and just as affordable.
Damn.
And she wanted to...
Damn.
She didn't like to leave her car, so she did everything from inside her car.
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you, my am.
Bam, bam.
That's who the ma'am was.
I liked her a little.
When she was in the subgenius, she would auction, put her vote in at the auction with a little beep of her car horn as she sat in her car.
She just didn't like to get out of her car.
Well, she didn't like to get out of her car, so she just pulled her car up close to the...
And all her crap was in the car.
All of her food.
Thank you.
Her sleeping bag.
All of her stuff.
Except when she got out of the car to jump on Fyla's bed and punch a hole in the floor with the bed leg.
Yeah.
It descended through the cabin.
Well, she is a rather robust woman.
A robust specimen, yes.
Oh, we're doing a show now, sir.
Geez.
We're trying to...
It's a bottomless...
It is.
It is.
It's a bottomless show.
So she did.
She spent some time on my bed.
She never stops.
She spent some time on my bed.
Well, it's your duty to inculcate the younger generation's subgenius principles.
Stereo?
Cheerio?
And so I'm...
She asked me that all-important question.
Why do retail stores charge up to 160% more for the same thing?
What did you tell the young lass?
She just keeps selling it over and over.
Well, I said it's because it's their job.
And you know what?
That just rolled off her back like water on a duck's back.
I'll bet it would.
I gotta go to that place that only charges 68%.
Listen to more show.
I wanna be Bob.
Get in the file all the time.
I wanna be Bob.
Big everything is a smile.
I wanna be Jesus.
He always looks so sad.
Don't wanna be Jesus.
He must have an awful dad.
I wanna be Bob.
Tell everyone about slack.
I wanna be Bob.
But I'm just not the big kid by slack.
I wanna be Jesus.
I wanna be no slave.
Don't wanna be Jesus.
He should have stayed in his place.
I wanna be Bob.
Everything is so clear.
I wanna be Bob.
He should have been ready to see.
I wanna be Jesus.
I wanna carry no cross.
Don't wanna be Jesus.
Don't wanna speak for no boss.
I wanna be Bob.
Never have to work a day.
I wanna be Bob.
All eternity's a play.
I wanna be Jesus.
Always trying to figure things out.
I wanna be Bob.
Don't wanna be Jesus.
Who needs all them fucking cosmic doubts.
I wanna be Bob.
Yeah, I wanna be Bob.
I wanna be Bob.
I'd even like it if he told me.
Ha ha ha.
Woo hoo.
Robert looks deliciously beautiful, isn't he?
Yeah, I can't help along with Alexander the Geants shit.
Uh, I worked for a while with captain cau.

Hm, yeah.
No matter what my area is, Boob.
Beep boop.
Oh my god, you can definitely hear все pueblo 여�rut.
No matter what your class Wrestle Dynamics is,
I'm sure you can say,
you'd been waiting around for all
those things that made violence in the live stream.
and a book.
Well, this has been a pretty organized anarchy, hasn't it?
Friends, that's disgusting.
How come...
Well, no, I don't want to ask.
I remember one time Sterno, Pope Sterno, stood up here in X-Stage Life in 1998,
the conspiracies 1998, and said,
Why aren't you people out there in the field fucking?
Why aren't you all in one giant group?
This is disgusting.
Somebody said, Why aren't you?
Friends, you know, sometimes we have to get real.
But I don't want to.
Fuck that shit.
Fuck that shit.
I was actually looking to see if there was anything really pithy.
Oh, yeah, there is actually something really pithy on here.
I have something important to say about...
It's about magic and prayer and faith.
Friends, you know, most of us are not especially superstitious.
We've grown out of those silly old superstitions.
We just believe in J.R. Bob Dobbs and the arrival of the exes on July 5th, 1998,
whenever that happens to come.
We don't believe in the silly religions, you know,
their silly evolution and creation crap.
We know we came from the Yetis test tubes.
Stupidly freed the humans and interbred with them like fucking idiots.
And now look, we're not doing what Sterno said.
And even he wasn't either.
But there is, there actually is magic.
Real live magic, I believe.
There is miracles happen.
Now, I don't mean the miracle of being on acid and looking at a piece of dirt and going, Wow.
Wow.
That's a miracle too.
I'm not putting it down.
I could go into this.
I have this whole rant about enlightenment, which I will spare you.
It's probably still on all binary slack from the last defival.
But there is magic and there is incredible, wonderful magic.
And the magic is that so many people can believe such bullshit.
That in itself is so, such beautiful magic.


The fact that they can believe is more important, is more weird to me than what they believe.
I studied kooks and crackpots just as I'm doing right now at this very moment.
And, and it's, it's not, every one of them has some slightly different variation on their own.
That weird science fiction we call religion.
But, but the, there is.
There is the miracle of their belief.
And which can overpower sickness.
It really can.
And can kill an ox at ten miles away from jealousy.
If you are truly an attuned over man.
My friends, there is hope.
There is hope.
You could eventually become that over man.
As soon as those aliens get here and do all of our work for us.
That we have elected to take the easy way out.
Concentrated Guru Pea.
This is dried Guru Pea that we burn.
We burn this Guru Pea and it oxidizes into our mucous membranes.
And we imbibe the, the wisdom of the gurus through this.
Is that what makes your nostril hairs grow?
Yeah.
So good.
So good.
So good.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
My boss is going to kill me!
You know, I always missed out on that stuff.
I'm always repairing something or changing film when all the fun stuff happens.
Well, you were conveniently away from the first aid area.
I'm always out of film when Bob shows up.
Well, if I had more help, then I could be there when those saucers didn't...
Yeah, you had plenty of exasperated help.
There are people throwing flingings in your arms.
Screaming, where is Stan when we need him now?
You're throwing away amputated arms and legs trying to figure out what to do next.
Calling, you know, involving local community people.
And yet, while we're under state of orange alert.
It was pretty weird.
Weird indeed, my friends.
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
And on the Radio Siniseesia show with Dr. Sinister.
Before that, Super Orgy porno party is by the Planet Smashers.
And now...
From 7X Day at Brushwood, a Pope-esque lily.
So, after all that, are you guys up for a little song?
Yeah!
Okay, this one, actually I'm going to need a little help from you guys.
But don't worry, this is pretty easy.
All I need you to do is to sing along, not during the chorus, but during the main part.
I'll cue you.
Ba dum Bob, ba dum Bob.
Ba dum Bob.
Ba dum Bob.
Ba dum Bob.
You guys, keep on going.
Ba dum Bob.
Ba dum Bob.
The times, they are changing.
And things are getting grim.
Oh Bob.
The X's are a-missing.
And our odds are getting slim.
Ba dum Bob.
Sure, I could give up and let the world know.


Let my hopes go flat.
I really got to ask you though.
Mmmmm, where's the slack in that?
Bob, ba dum Bob.
Ba dum Bob.
Ba dum Bob.
The pinks have us outnumbered.
The conspiracy has won.
Nuh uh, uh huh.
We're in a losing battle.
Before the fight's begun.
No fun.
Well I could get suicidal and make my brains go splat.
I really got to ask you though.
Mmmmm, where's the slack in that?
Ba dum Bob.
Ba dum Bob.
Ba dum Bob.
No matter the temptation, I don't care what they think.
I'd rather be subgenious than wind up pink.
Cause Bob's a genius.
Bob's so gives me gumption.
And Connie flips my crown.
And I'm not about to let them bastards get me down.
Da dum dum dum.
I don't need to fight no battles.
Or weigh down with chagrin.
No way, no how.
As long as I have with me.
Bob's everlasting grin.
And sure, I hate the normals.
I got that all down pat.
But I'm not exactly looking for normal combat.
And I'm sick of preaching and chewing the fat.
I really got to tell you though.
Mmmmm, slack is where it's at.
Ba dum Bob.
That's it?
Woo!
Thank you everyone!
Urdu.
When they retranslate the Urdu back to English,
it just leaves something out and it looks so funny.
Then we also viewed director Stang's new film,
Dobbs of Deliastisies.
And, uh...
Which I have a copy of, ready for the next subgenius.
And when that tricycle quad comes out to you,
you know what it'll have.
And Bug Porn is also showing.
Bug Porn, which is sort of a remake of the
Reproduction Cycle movie, and an excellent, excellent,
funny, funny movie.
And excellent taste, too.
See, now we should have a subgenius film festival
where everything shown would be subgenius.
Right, right.
Instead of nothing that we show being subgenius,
everything we show will be subgenius.
And it continues to rain.
So I have my screen ready, my projector,
my...everything's ready.
Where are we gonna do this subgenius film festival?
Tomorrow night?
Tomorrow night?
Well, where though?
At Ginger's house.
At your house?
They have a backyard.
You can always see the neighbors peeking through
the fence at your favorite stuff.
Jim neighbors and others peering over the fence
can disconcert you.
Golly!
You're trying to do something and these geeks
are gawking over the fence at you.
And laughing in an unseemly way.
Gawking and leering and frottering, frittering away.
It's because as X Day gets closer and closer,
people don't worry about the social normies
that they've caught.
Oops, there, see?
But we got past X Day once again.
And there goes Mr. Hamilton,
and there goes Mr. Burr,
fires back.
You're getting further away.
So we're safe for at least another year.
I guess so.
We have to go back in time now, folks.
It's 420 all over again.
That background music, friends,
that I've been using is from a band called
Felonious Bosch.
And you can get more information about them
from www.fnbosch.com.
B-O-S-C-H.
F-N-B-O-S-C-H.com.
Felonious Bosch.
Great.
You'll be hearing more about them.
And friends, we're at the subgenius
radio ministry hour of Slack.
Let me give you a post office box.
This time, let's use P.O. Box 807,
Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.
That's Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.
Short!

Share the load.
The drugs I took seem to light up my brain.
My mind is not my mind.
One look at them will tell you more
than a thousand words of mine.
Come on you poor ass singers and your big dick slings
We're going downtown to the Cox's
A second fight, the beginning of a broad daylight
We don't need no goddamn taxi
We're gonna jim and pose in a rocket jet
And take off all their racks
We're gonna build these old pads
Tomorrow night at the Ron Cox's
We're gonna rock the news ball
My mind is not my mind
My mind is not my mind
