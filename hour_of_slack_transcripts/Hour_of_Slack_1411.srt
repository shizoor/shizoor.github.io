1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,660
Cough, cough, cough

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:03,480
Bowling

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,160
Cough, cough, cough

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,180
Bowling

5
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:08,700
Bowling

6
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,020
Who sucked the meat off my pork chop bone?

7
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:11,440
Bowling

8
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,720
Don't come knocking ain't nobody home

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,760
Who sucked the meat off my pork chop bone?

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,640
Bowling

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,400
Bowling

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,220
Bowling

13
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:25,960
Bowling

14
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,260
Had a gorilla, name was Phil

15
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:28,700
Bowling

16
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,080
Made corn liquor in the backyard still

17
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:31,680
Bowling

18
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,020
And he did a good job at the produce stand

19
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:34,460
Bowling

20
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,360
Waving his fists and clapping his hands and saying

21
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,760
Who sucked the meat off my pork chop bone?

22
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,320
Bowling

23
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,280
Man don't live on beans alone

24
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,860
Who sucked the meat off my bone?

25
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,700
Bowling

26
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,120
Bowling

27
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,520
Bowling

28
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:53,600
Bowling

29
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,020
Wiggling and poking my testicle sound

30
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,360
Bowling

31
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,620
Bowling

32
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,140
Bowling

33
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,840
Bowling

34
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,600
Bowling

35
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,180
Bowling

36
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:14,720
Bowling

37
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:14,720


38
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,360
Bowling

39
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,200
Bowling

40
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,700
Bowling

41
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,280
Bowling

42
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:22,700
Bowling

43
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,720
Bowling

44
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,680
Bowling

45
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,580
He brought her to the table with the candles and the lace

46
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,600
Jesus didn't have no spoon

47
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,100
There was Peter and John and Bartholomew

48
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,380
Jesus didn't have no spoon

49
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,820
Philip and Simon and even Matthew

50
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,120
Jesus didn't have no spoon

51
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,700
No, there was no waiter, no hat checker

52
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,900
Jesus didn't have no spoon

53
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,520
And there was nobody to pay his bill

54
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,660
Jesus didn't have no spoon

55
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,200
Lordy, lordy, somebody gotta bring Jesus his spoon

56
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,140
Lordy, there's brilliant ways, but Jesus ain't got no spoon

57
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,660
Dancing and fucking on Saturday night

58
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,660
Drank too much and started a fight

59
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,540
Held up the store, robbed me a car

60
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,340
Drove to Cincinnati smoking a cigar

61
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,120
Ordered me a pizza from across the street

62
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,960
Told the man to give me one with lots of meat

63
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,040
Three to twenty minutes when he knocked on the door

64
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,620
Rocked his skull with a two-by-four

65
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,280
Said, who sucked the meat?

66
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,800
Off my porkchop bone

67
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,180
Who sucked the meat?

68
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,560
Off my porkchop bone

69
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,440
You know you're gonna reap what you done saw

70
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,920
Who sucked the meat?

71
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,320
Off my porkchop bone

72
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,780
Who sucked the meat?

73
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,260
Off my porkchop bone

74
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,660
Who sucked the meat?

75
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,120
Off my porkchop bone

76
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,680
Gotta have meat that's all my own

77
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,280
Goddamn, who's been sucking that meat?

78
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,940
Come, they told me

79
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,340
Far-a-pa-pum-pum

80
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,560
Our newborn king to see

81
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,520
Far-a-pa-pum-pum

82
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,140
Our finest gifts we bring

83
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,240
Far-a-pa-pum-pum

84
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,920
To lay before the

85
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,160
Some genius

86
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,660
Our own

87
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,020
Scratch

88
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,880
The hangout for the homosexuals

89
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,680
It's filled with cornhole fun

90
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,920
We are the carnivores

91
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:32,920


92
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:32,940
Give us everything

93
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,060
We'll leave you no impacting

94
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,120
Our cornhole

95
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,120


96
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,120


97
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,120


98
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,120


99
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,120


100
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,120


101
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,120


102
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,120


103
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,120


104
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,120


105
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,220
A ceremony

106
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:42,220


107
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:42,220


108
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:42,220


109
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:42,220


110
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:42,220


111
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,640
We will prove

112
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:43,640


113
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,360
We will win

114
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:47,360


115
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,380
And we swear

116
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:48,420
We will win

117
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:48,420


118
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:48,420


119
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:48,420


120
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,020
And we do the right thing

121
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,540
Oh the snow is fallin'

122
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,660
I'm startin' to yearn

123
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,760
For those hominy grits

124
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,020
And the Christmas ferns

125
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,480
Won't you carry me back to the good ol' USA?

126
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,720
Yes, I want to go back where I was born

127
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,980
With the meth labs out in the fields of corn

128
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,640
Please carry me back to the good ol' USA

129
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,240
Plenty of public servants who have read their Bible

130
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,020
Want to give the ladies an ultrasound that's transvaginal

131
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,960
Where the unemployed ain't got no voice

132
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,160
And the Ku Klux Klan is a lifestyle choice

133
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,800
Carry me back to the good ol' USA

134
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,080
Let's go!

135
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,540
All the small town folks say

136
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,620
And the governor's got no brains at all

137
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,140
Won't you carry me back to the good ol' USA?

138
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,620
There's a cop on the beat saying

139
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,740
The Supreme Court says he can strip search you

140
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,240
When you come on back to the good ol' USA

141
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,140
Hey, B.L.!

142
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,140


143
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,800
As corpus, shmabius corpus

144
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,400
Give me an American Treblinka

145
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,320
As long as you don't raise my taxes

146
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,180
I'll be a Kool-Aid drinker

147
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,740
And I won't worry my pretty little head

148
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,080
About water, morning, and Abu Ghraib

149
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,300
A patriotic zombie from cradle to grave

150
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,580
Oh, beautiful for spacious skies

151
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,560
You gotta carry me back to the good ol' USA

152
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,500
From PR News in Washington,

153
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,760
I'm carrying the German Deputy Prime Minister in Washington.

154
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,800
President Obama says that the wealthiest Americans

155
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,700
should come down with the norovirus.

156
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,200
He did not elaborate.

157
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,420
He told NBC's Meet the Press it's the norovirus.

158
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,940
On another subject, the president says

159
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:13,120
The president said the worst presidency was his presidency.

160
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,760
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell

161
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,400
says he threw rocks and bottles at a convoy.

162
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,020
His bodyguards say at least 19 people

163
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,480
were killed.

164
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,720
He says,

165
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,820
I need a dance partner.

166
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,740
The body of a Georgian soldier says

167
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,040
This is PR News from Washington.

168
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,080
The German George H.W. Bush

169
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,940
is still in southern Afghanistan.

170
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,640
NATO officials say that he had been captured.

171
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,000
But a spokesman says there's no sign

172
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,840
that this is the worst PR News in Washington.

173
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,540
Because there are so many levels above the presidency

174
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,800
that have higher levels of clearance than the president.

175
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,140
So the president is many ways almost like,

176
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:51,420
a,

177
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:57,420
a fanciful secretary whose job is to do certain things that the secret government wants him to do

178
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:06,220
because of the various things that they have around him to make him see the light about what he can do and what he can't do.

179
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,080
What the hell do you think you're doing?

180
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,140
Dragging your butt through the day selling body and soul for a bunch of bland normals?

181
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,860
Acting stupid so they think you're one of them?

182
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,440
Tired of all the guilt and none of the sex?

183
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,820
There is a simple answer, dear friend.

184
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,540
A glowing beacon of slack amidst the turmoil and darkness.

185
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,040
It's J.R., Bob Dobbs the living slack master and his church of the subgenius.

186
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,880
Bob brings a new destiny for the abnormal.

187
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,480
Bob comes to justify our sins.

188
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,980
To unmask the conspiracy and to get us back the slack they stole away.

189
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,760
It's us versus them.

190
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,640
Are you going to fry in hell on earth alongside the pink boys?

191
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,320
Or will you pull the wool over your own eyes and accept Bob into your mind?

192
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,400
Repent.

193
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,260
Quit your job and praise Bob.

194
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,600
With Bob.

195
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:01,100
You know, I love Bob along with his amazing achievements in slack.

196
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,520
I don't know that I provided any sort of...

197
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,720
I don't know what I did here.

198
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,200
Why am I doing this again?

199
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,680
Why am I talking to myself out loud?

200
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,860
I just set up that picture of Bob.

201
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,320
I like that picture.

202
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,340
Isn't it like deep?

203
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,920
A lot of negative space is really deep.

204
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,640
Where, on his face or around him?

205
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,180
No, around him.

206
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,360
On his face.

207
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,280
I was like...

208
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:21,900
Oh, let me see it.

209
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,920
And I'm like, oh my God.

210
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,000
Yeah, I think so too.

211
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:24,500
Yeah.

212
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,380
I don't know.

213
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,700
Do you buy Bob?

214
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,800
I want to be the kind of person that does.

215
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,980
Like, sort of like time traveling?

216
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,080
Yeah.

217
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,280
It's kind of like time travel.

218
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,160
Like, when I check in at the airport and stuff, you know, sometimes people say like,

219
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,540
I bet I know who your dad is.

220
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,180
And it's like, I wish.

221
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,920
Right, because there'd just be no end to the entertaining phone calls.

222
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:46,820
It would be super entertaining.

223
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,420
And I feel like we both have these kind of...

224
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,660
We both have kind of wolf eyes.

225
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,180
Yeah.

226
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,160
Like, I could be his daughter.

227
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:51,580
Sure.

228
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,640
All you got to do is start talking about flying saucers and the plate in your head and you'd

229
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,080
be all set.

230
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,840
And occasionally he would have this woman who sang with him who was kind of like this

231
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,280
blousy, broad.

232
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,400
Like, that was my female role model.

233
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,440
I would just watch her and think, oh, I want to be that woman.

234
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,180
But the religion was a little weird.

235
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,820
Priests didn't speak English.

236
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:10,640
Polish?

237
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,280
Yeah, Polish.

238
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,860
So he involved you in Polish?

239
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,640
How could that not be hilarious?

240
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,120
And if you got the Polish priest, you had no idea what was going on.

241
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,720
Because you could confess any sin you wanted.

242
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,640
And he wouldn't know what you were saying.

243
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,520
I feel so bad for Bob now because I just picture this guy who's a great organist going

244
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,300
Yeah, that's his laugh now.

245
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:30,640
Yeah.

246
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,260
Oh, it turned out...

247
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,220
He's probably doing better, though.

248
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,180
He's probably making some money.

249
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,660
All I remember is we went to his house once and he had the clapper.

250
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,320
And I was like, all right, he plays the organ.

251
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,480
He has an afro.

252
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,660
He has the clapper.

253
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,400
Performs with this lady like the coolest man alive.

254
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:43,700
Yeah.

255
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,320
Bob?

256
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,200
I just want to encourage you to consider very carefully what kinds of games and toys you

257
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,600
play with.

258
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,640
I'm only saying this because I care about you.

259
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:53,940
Hmm.

260
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,200
That is pretty far-fetched.

261
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,680
But Casey, how can we know what books we should read?

262
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,440
I'm glad you asked Bob himself would read the books we read.

263
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,360
Bob tells us to set any vile things before our eyes.

264
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,800
And vile means Bob.

265
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,040
Oh.

266
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,140
That's right.

267
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,140
We allow things that are sinful into our minds.

268
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,480
Disobeying Bob is sinful.

269
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,280
So is hating other people and doing violent things to hurt Bob.

270
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,120
There are many things that are sinful.

271
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,580
The point is, makes sin look like a good sin.

272
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,860
Sin is disobeying Bob.

273
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,760
But it's not.

274
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,000
Now think carefully about how much sin is in Bob's.

275
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,600
Man, you mean I have to worry about J.R. Bob Dobs.

276
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,480
I thought being a kid was supposed to be fun.

277
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,620
Bob can show you what kinds of things you should think about.

278
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,500
I want it.

279
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:42,580
Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely,

280
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,980
whatever is admirable, is excellent or praiseworthy.

281
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,040
But it's not.

282
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,580
If anything is excellent or praiseworthy, that's not Bob.

283
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:54,700
So you mean that we should fill our minds with J.R. Bob Dobs.

284
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,400
Not things that are good and worthy of praise?

285
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,520
That's exactly right, Jimmy.

286
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,040
If we fill our minds with evil, good things will come out of us.

287
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:03,740
That's right.

288
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,820
I think that Captain Destructo or these wrestling shows are admirable.

289
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,140
And I think that they make Bob happy.

290
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:16,320
If any TV show or movie we want to watch has too much violence, we probably should watch it.

291
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:16,820
Oh.

292
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,740
The hero in that story uses evil magic.

293
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,920
Now you're starting to get it, Bobby.

294
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,720
That's right.

295
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:28,360
Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely,

296
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:34,920
whatever is admirable, if anything is excellent or praiseworthy, we should find something else to do instead.

297
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,380
What are you doing here?

298
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,360
Yeah, sure.

299
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:48,100
If they're blaming, if they're saying we're kidnapping teenagers and brainwashing them, well...

300
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,740
Since we're already...

301
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,560
We might as well go ahead.

302
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,640
We'll go ahead and kidnap some.

303
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:52,980
Like them.

304
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:53,500
Yeah.

305
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,740
Well, I know I want that one.

306
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,880
I want the big one.

307
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:58,980
That one?

308
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,760
You want that one?

309
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,200
You can have the little one.

310
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,380
Yes, I want the big one.

311
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:01,780
You can have that one.

312
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,920
Almost all like them.

313
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,240
Okay, I'll take the little one.

314
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:05,980
Oh, I saw that one.

315
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,360
Yeah.

316
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,320
You were there.

317
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,140
Yeah, I was there.

318
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,480
Where?

319
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,580
Puzzling is showing pornography from that Davey Normal part.

320
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,140
Oh.

321
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,120
Oh, yeah, that's...

322
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,020
I believe she just friended me on the...

323
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,500
She friended me.

324
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,820
She just unfriended me just now.

325
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,940
So she's coming out, as it were, into San Francisco society in her big party dress.

326
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,500
But we won't be like Goldwater, whose planners at one point when they met in, I think, Memphis,

327
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:37,500
they had a downpour, and so all the beautiful Bells who greeted Goldwater in beautiful ballgowns,

328
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,280
as they do in the South, wound up sitting in the mud in front of the lectern.

329
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,600
How could that be?

330
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,700
Because the people who planned his stuff were so inept.

331
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,340
It was so crazy at the time.

332
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,540
But why was there mud?

333
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,400
Fortunately for us...

334
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,080
Let's do it outdoors.

335
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,760
It never rains in the South.

336
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:53,940
Exactly, yeah.

337
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,860
Goldwater, Goldwater, he's our man.

338
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,520
Kennedy belongs in the garbage can.

339
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,380
I chanted that in first grade.

340
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,020
Really?

341
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,420
Good for you.

342
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,100
Excellent, excellent.

343
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,740
First grade?

344
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,540
Oh, boy.

345
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,360
We're just sitting on the porch, folks, talking about old times.

346
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,020
Yes, back there.

347
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,300
Oh, yes, I've had good days.

348
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,540
Now, where's the...

349
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,520
Oh, my God.

350
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:17,780
Oh, my God.

351
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,000
Oh, my God.

352
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,000


353
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,220
Oh, my God.

354
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:18,220


355
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:18,260
Oh, my God.

356
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:18,260


357
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:18,260


358
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:18,260


359
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:18,320
Oh, my God.

360
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,080
Wait, maybe it was...

361
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,020
Could it have been...

362
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,400
No, it wasn't Eisenhower, Eisenhower.

363
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,100
He's our man.

364
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,740
That doesn't...

365
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,980
That doesn't fit.

366
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,300
Stevenson, Stevenson.

367
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,580
He's our man.

368
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:28,980
I like it.

369
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,760
Or Adlai, Adlai.

370
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,280
He's our man.

371
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:33,720
Come on.

372
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:39,540
Or Henry Cabot Lodge, who was ready to run even though he was ambassador to Vietnam.

373
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,600
Or Grover Cleveland.

374
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,860
Yeah, but those guys got those letters...

375
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,560
They read the letters from Dallas.

376
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,120
Grover Cleveland?

377
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,640
Grover Cleveland.

378
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,900
Let's put one over...

379
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,020
What?

380
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,300
They threw something at him.

381
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:48,300


382
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:48,300


383
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:48,300


384
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:48,300


385
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,620
They threw a fag thing away.

386
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,300
For Grover.

387
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,080
Don't rock the boat...

388
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,660
That can't be right.

389
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,280
... given your vote.

390
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,740
He's still on the script here.

391
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:54,800
And...

392
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,880
I didn't get the part where, you know, they keep...

393
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,140
A Roth for Cleveland, a Roth for the kid.

394
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,100
All the same subgenius characters play each other in different parts of the movie, and

395
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,420
they keep showing up as themselves, but they look kind of different, but they're still

396
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,240
like the same subgenius people.

397
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,080
I don't know how that works.

398
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:10,440
I don't think that either.

399
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,520
Well, they play each other.

400
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,340
They switch around.

401
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,780
One of them wears the unibrow and one of them wears the big, thick glasses.

402
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,940
One of them wears the...

403
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:24,800
phylo jaw and whatever wears the the uh the fake bald cap here's the part where they'll come out

404
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:32,460
and bow so you can call yeah this is the curtain call yeah except for the queen of ufos it flies

405
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:38,960
over the audience who's wearing that yeti suit i'm afraid that's that's not a no that's the actual

i chopped all those stupid bobbies in half it was cool you don't really chop bobbies in half that

let's uh be honest and say they're cannon fodder here right they're made to die like flies but

425
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:45,260
you know you can't make an omelette without breaking some eggs as mao zi tong said a revolution

426
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:54,200
is not a tea party to uh one item you have to have to befriend bob is the grand canyon

427
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:01,160
and you can't get that unless you defeat stag because all of this takes place at right as x day

428
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:08,800
starts and you have 24 hours chapter four of the grand canyon kids uh yeah 24 hours

429
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:17,060
hours to grab as much as you can from planet earth and kill as many pigs and but those mules

430
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:23,340
might take half a day to wind down the road into the grand canyon and you wouldn't want to hurry

431
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:29,020
them up you might pitch forward into emptiness you wind up really enjoying your time with the

432
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:33,580
rock and roll tribe impaled on a cactus now look you're getting your games mixed up

433
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:40,060
if you want some entertaining reading and i'm sure they still sell this book at the any at the

434
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:45,140
grand canyon ranger post and most any national park service post well i don't know i should say

435
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:50,720
that but many of your local parks your local parks will have books called death in death in

436
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,820
yellowstone death in the grand canyon what about death valley no not there well people don't die

437
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,760
their life in the death in depth yeah it was amazing they do yeah this family lived a few

438
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,340
years ago

439
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,460
death for life

440
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:08,840
in the really in the nice time of year that's 114 and decided he'd hike because he's from a

441
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,080
foreign country and he doesn't well he doesn't quite understand but no this is the death in

442
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,680
in grand canyon is what i was thinking about because it actually does have these wonderful

443
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:22,000
stories where the dad says here throws the camera take a picture of me i'm funny

444
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:29,620
well apparently there are a lot of suicides or attempted suicides at the grand canyon that they

445
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,220
don't talk about to so because they don't want to inspire

446
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:33,440
people to do that so they don't want to inspire people to do that so they don't want to inspire

447
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:41,600
people to do that so they don't want to mentor people that's crazy you know but earthlings

448
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,800
majeure love all about these

449
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:54,260
you know carly kate asked of you today there seems to be a kind of frenzy between you and

450
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,460
yours in the moment here or going out of your mind or if you're not ready for the sex world

451
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:55,460


452
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:55,460


453
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:55,780
i was false

454
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:55,780


455
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:01,460
is terry i'm literally here my hot karen i'm so situationally she's going to make a lot of noise

456
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,400
no carreira

457
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,420
great thanks

458
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:09,700
Of course, what happens is you go down a slope about 30 or 40 feet and run into a scrubbed tree.

459
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,100
And there you dangle looking like a suicide chump.

460
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,220
Until the expensive helicopter comes against you that they charge you for.

461
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,080
So, go on and get it over with.

462
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,600
And boy, are you going to pay.

463
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,280
No, you have to go to the Golden Gate Bridge.

464
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,140
Did I say that?

465
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,220
Yeah, you have to go to the Golden Gate Bridge.

466
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,320
Yeah, but isn't there a movie of suicides jumping off the bridge?

467
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,720
It's called, it's an amazing, yeah.

468
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,800
If you stand there with them.

469
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,620
It's an underground snuff film.

470
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,100
If you stand with your camera on a tripod for a year, he got X number of people doing it.

471
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,680
So, now they not only have to build a wall around the bridge, they have to build a wall around the cameras.

472
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,360
There's a fence.

473
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,540
And it's also, you have to keep off these horrible people that go up there all wearing red t-shirts with,

474
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:56,020
I'm the 1000th, because the paper had said that might be coming up.

475
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,620
And then those horrible people, two of them, hooked up a little diving board.

476
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,520
Recorded.

477
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,400
The CHP was able to run over and pull it away.

478
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,740
It was a horrifying thing.

479
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:12,840
And so, the Golden Gate Bridge look will be permanently changed and you'll be driving into a cage to prevent people from.

480
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,800
Is that the newest idea?

481
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,440
Yeah, I guess so.

482
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,880
Well, what are they going to do about giant five tentacled octopi rising up out of the bay?

483
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,620
They get fined.

484
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,900
Oh, they get fined.

485
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,100
Yeah.

486
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,740
Figures, yeah.

487
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,480
So, then people will be throwing themselves onto.

488
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,060
And they go to prison.

489
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,280
So, the octopus and or a squid of that size would have to go to some place like Alcatraz and be locked up.

490
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,960
Miles of wall will have to be built along the box.

491
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,380
That's because of Woody Harrelson who twice climbed up there and then put down big banners that said,

492
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,520
Free the marijuana.

493
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,800
And finally, the CHP got.

494
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,440
Free the marijuana seven.

495
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,640
What does CHP stand for?

496
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,460
CHP.

497
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,760
Cleveland Heights bastards.

498
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,960
The California Highway Patrol.

499
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,660
Then you hear it coming over the radio.

500
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,900
Oh, PCHP.

501
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,640
They got a bad one out on the freeway.

502
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,720
Better send the meat.

503
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,580
April 8th, 45.

504
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,700
There he goes.

505
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,180
How about you?

506
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:10,320
That's what puzzling evidence said from that show of February 22nd on KPFA Berkeley.

507
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:17,940
Where Princess Wee and I were lucky enough to be there without Philo who stayed home sick.

508
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:28,200
The music tonight so far has all been by the Rudy Schwartz project from the new album Full Frontal Klugman.

509
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,000
The song Who Sucked the Meat?

510
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,200
Off.

511
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:37,760
My Pork Chop Bone at the very beginning and Carry Me Back to the Good Old USA was that way.

512
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:47,120
And the titles in PR news were by Fernand and Andy Lemur as was the Vile Things collage.

513
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:54,420
But some other clips we played were from Reverend Royal Decapitator who sent that stuff a long time ago.

514
00:22:54,460 --> 00:23:00,840
I think I've lost one of his albums of material for a while there.

515
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,220
And just found it again.

516
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,100
He sent a whole bunch a long time ago.

517
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,100
And that's what happens when you send a whole bunch.

518
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,420
But you see.

519
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,300
You see.

520
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:22,100
If you believe the conspiracy theorists, the smartest thing any of us could do right now would be to study survivalist manuals.

521
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,520
Flee this mass media hallucination.

522
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,500
Buy cheap land in the Yukon.

523
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,480
And hide in a dome with a stockpile of canned food.

524
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,040
A Dobbs head and a frop pipe.

525
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,660
And practice your aim.

526
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,840
Otherwise, learn to give the best oral sex in town from inside a barrel.

527
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,320
I've already got my plans.

528
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,700
I've even got a, I've even got competition already.

529
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:55,300
Mr. Sister has a fancier barrel than me with a little bow on top and lipstick around the hole.

530
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,960
And it's location, location, location.

531
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,260
He's got the spot too.

532
00:23:59,320 --> 00:23:59,560
Yeah.

533
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,460
Right there at the top.

534
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:05,620
At South Clothes Fixer and Probability Pasture Roads.

535
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,000
Right.

536
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,200
Cleveland Bluffs.

537
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:12,760
Friends, but we don't trust the conspiracy theorists anymore than we trust the conspiracy.

538
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,720
Most of them are conspiracy conspiracy theorists anyway.

539
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,120
We trust only subgenius revealed truth.

540
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:28,000
And that says that the entire conspiracy, us included,

541
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,440
is but a fundamental fact.

542
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:30,760
A fungus.

543
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,600
A parasitical fungus on the skin of the over mind.

544
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:41,140
That the human race is a virus.

545
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,980
An infestation like fleas.

546
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,260
And that the host will soon be dipped.

547
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,080
Any political argument is thus rendered tragically moot.

548
00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:00,420
Knowing this, the subgenius adheres to patrio-psychoticism.

549
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,220
And the subgenius adheres to patriopsychotic anarcho-materialism.

550
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,360
Which by definition, each person defines differently.

551
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:12,140
In patrio-psychotic anarcho-materialism, state sovereignty isn't nearly enough.

552
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,120
That'd be a good start.

553
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,420
The Soviet Union broke up?

554
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:15,700
Good.

555
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:20,760
Then by gobs it's time for the USA to break up into the disunited states.

556
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,860
And then to break up a lot more.

557
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,760
Household sovereignty is what we're talking about.

558
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:35,120
If you study chimpanzees or kindergarten children for a week, politics will suddenly make sense.

559
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:42,180
You mustn't let petty primate politics bring you down to their level.

560
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,520
Rise above it!

561
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:44,900
Inflate!

562
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:50,880
Blow yourself up and float placidly high above the middle of the road.

563
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,900
From whence you can survey how silly they all look.

564
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,600
And that was a little...

565
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,340
reading there from subgenius cyclopedia of slack, the Bob Lyografon.

566
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,660
I might as well start reading from it.

567
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,860
It's been out of print for about a year now.

568
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,580
Mm-mm-mm.

569
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,880
And, uh...

570
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,760
Mm-mm-mm.

571
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,800
Oh, I was so depressed.

572
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:19,740
Dr. Philo Drummond was bragging on the slack hole on Facebook about how Revelation X was...

573
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,320
You could get it from Amazon.com for a penny a copy.

574
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:23,880
Used.

575
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,580
I noticed that new copies were going from $3.5 million to $4.5 million.

576
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,180
$35 to $135.

577
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:34,940
And yet I can't talk about the signed copies because that would...

578
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,600
because this is public radio.

579
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,680
Anyway, but I can talk about a book that you can't get from us or anywhere else.

580
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,100
The Cyclopedia of Slack.

581
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,940
The Bob Lyografon.

582
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:51,220
The Third Testament, one might say.

583
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,600
As, uh...

584
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,060
As the great Reverend Dennis Murphy said,

585
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,580
the church of the subgenius.

586
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,540
It's a no-brainer.

587
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,040
So, so true.

588
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,820
And you know the great thing is when I showed him that quote on the back of the book and said,

589
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,640
hey, use your line.

590
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,600
He said, did I say that?

591
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,360
He didn't remember it at all.

592
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,620
That never happens to me, dear friends.

593
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,720
And, uh...

594
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,560
Yes, yes, yes.

595
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,700
We have absolutely no idea of what we're going to be talking about tonight.

596
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,240
None at all.

597
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,460
And we don't care what you think we should talk about.

598
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,920
We could just talk about talking.

599
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,140
Most people do it.

600
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,040
Have you ever really listened to what people say, including yourself?

601
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,800
Don't.

602
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:52,300
Because when you start analyzing what people are saying, you realize that they are so full of vanity,

603
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,620
it's sickening.

604
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,340
Like this.

605
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,500
This.

606
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,660
This.

607
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,260
This.

608
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:58,340
This.

609
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,740
A case in point.

610
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,220
A case in point.

611
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,440
The loathsome cowpoke of Ashtabula.

612
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:15,560
Why, I've never known anyone less, has less ego than our Dave.

613
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,680
I don't know what you're talking about.

614
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:21,200
What the hell are you talking about?

615
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,520
We don't know, Dave.

616
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:22,980
We don't know.

617
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,060
That's the point.

618
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,720
We don't know what we're talking about.

619
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,800
And it's always good to remain in that position.

620
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,280
A supine position with the jackal's ears in the air, waiting for the next command.

621
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,860
I'm not sure what command to give this board.

622
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,160
You know, Dave, I've been slowly, now that I've been at this station for...

623
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,980
How long have we been on this station for?

624
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,360
About 20 years.

625
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,440
About 15, 20 years.

626
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,320
I've been operating the board at this station for only about five years or so.

627
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:04,440
And I still am not sure what happens if I push this hold button underneath your face, Dave.

628
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,000
There's a hold button under my face?

629
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,900
Yeah, and it's what I should have done when the other Dave called a couple of shows ago.

630
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,460
And then I could have had two Daves on at once, but I didn't push the hold button.

631
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,380
Why?

632
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,640
If I push the hold button, it allows me to put a second collar on.

633
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:26,640
Not that I want another collar, because Dave...

634
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,140
Perhaps you would need another collar.

635
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,540
No, no, no, no, Dave, because...

636
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:38,880
You know, it was a little too crowded when there was you, me, we, and your Buzz.

637
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,680
But now the Buzz is gone.

638
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,000
And it's nice.

639
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:51,620
The Buzz ate too much and dropped ashes all over me.

640
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:57,860
And I was sitting over the carpet and, you know, didn't even offer to do the dishes after we fed it.

641
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:58,840
Yeah.

642
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,120
I didn't really like the Buzz.

643
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,120
It's a really presumptuous Buzz.

644
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,080
Some people will do anything...

645
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:10,720
Well, the Buzz actually was a demonic form that now has reconstituted itself in another dimension.

646
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:18,360
And we're still going to have to worry about it some different way, like maybe someone's chicken, perhaps.

647
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,780
Or a small poultry device.

648
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:26,440
And places far away, maybe to you, but not to the average mid-American citizen.

649
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:33,700
Someplace right in hometown USA, you know, the chickens could be arguing with each other in Latin or something.

650
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,100
I don't know if that would hurt anything or make it better.

651
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:42,120
I wondered what that nonsense was the chickens were saying.

652
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,580
No wonder I couldn't understand. It was Latin.

653
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,280
Yeah.

654
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:45,740
Duh.

655
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,560
Yeah. You need to slice them up a little bit.

656
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,160
Maybe sit them down for a long time.

657
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,740
It's all Greek to me, you geeks.

658
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,000
We'll have to ask Buzz Aldrin what to do with the Buzz.

659
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:06,320
Maybe that's to assume the magnetic vibrations and now it's poor Buzz.

660
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,160
Well, is he alive?

661
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:12,940
I think so. And I think, if I'm not mistaken, Buzz Aldrin was the astronaut who...

662
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,460
Punched the other...

663
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:20,760
He saw something up there, out there in his tunic hand, spinning through space.

664
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:26,260
And he got kind of new agey and UFO-y and...

665
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,400
Is there...

666
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,400
Noetic institute-y and...

667
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:38,560
And kind of generally a little bit less scientific and more into feelings.

668
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,240
Feelings, yes.

669
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:49,680
Which was the one that went around punching journalists who doubted whether the first landing actually ever occurred?

670
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,500
The cool one.

671
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,760
Who is the cool one?

672
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,020
I don't know. I hope Neil Armstrong.

673
00:31:55,540 --> 00:32:05,540
If I was... I mean, assuming Neil Armstrong did actually take that one giant leap for all of mankind or whatever...

674
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:11,900
If somebody came up to me and said, you people faked all that stuff, nobody landed on the moon...

675
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:16,140
I'd probably punch him out if I had gone to the moon.

676
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,520
And if I hadn't gone to the moon...

677
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:17,600
I would laugh.

678
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,040
I would not only would punch him out.

679
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,660
I'd have him touch the moon.

680
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,680
I would have him sunk into Chesapeake Bay with concrete overshoes.

681
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,700
That is a poor personality shadow or whatever profile.

682
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,980
That's terrible to think that way.

683
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,920
I had a friend who...

684
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:40,260
Should you not laugh at the person gaily as you click your heels and say, hey, blank you?

685
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:45,620
Well, we do blank them if they can't take a joke as much as we can.

686
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,760
But, you know...

687
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,200
I had a buddy who...

688
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,480
I honestly believe...

689
00:32:50,480 --> 00:33:04,240
He would get mad if I suggested that maybe the evidence was that America had landed somebody on the moon a couple of times.

690
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,360
Whether for better or for worse, I don't know.

691
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,280
But I think they kind of did it.

692
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:16,220
There's a lot of engineers, like several tens of thousands of them that worked on that stuff.

693
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:16,700
And...

694
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:26,380
But my same friend, within a month, was informing me that not only had we indeed gone to the moon, we'd been there for about 40 years.

695
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,060
We had slave colonies there.

696
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:36,160
And I was a stupid idiot if I couldn't see the evidence in the still photographs that the U.S. government foolishly put out.

697
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,880
Because that little glitch on the horizon wasn't a little photographic glitch.

698
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:46,460
It was a crystal palace built for the moon masters of Russia and America.

699
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:53,840
Now this guy's reading to me the William S. Rice Burroughs common novel.

700
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,620
It's a hay-penny horrors of the late 19th century, I think.

701
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:06,100
William Rice Burroughs did some great, great novels about drugs on Mars and junkies on Mars and all that.

702
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,160
Parties on Venus.

703
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:13,940
And we saw a movie last night, the last two nights, called Upstream Color.

704
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:18,560
And it was like a William Burroughs novel in a movie.

705
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,420
But it didn't have anything to do with William Burroughs.

706
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,860
Not William Burroughs. S. Rice Burroughs.

707
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,620
No, no, Edgar... William Rice Burroughs.

708
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:25,700
I mean Edgar Haynes Burroughs.

709
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:30,340
The author of... the guy who wrote, you know, Nazrat and The Junkie.

710
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:35,580
Tarzan of the Junkies and John Burroughs of Mars.

711
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,620
Carson of the Apes.

712
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,960
Yeah, yeah, Car... right.

713
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,200
Yeah, Exterminator of the Apes.

714
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,480
Anyway...

715
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,160
Okay.

716
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:52,980
So, the movie, Upstream Color, about five of our listeners probably saw a movie by the same young Dallas director, Shane Carruthers.

717
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,560
The movie called Primer.

718
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:00,080
One of the most amazing time travel conundrum movies you'll ever see.

719
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,180
Uh-huh.

720
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,420
And he's got a new movie out after five or ten years or something.

721
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:10,200
He did another movie that's not quite so low budget.

722
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,920
And it has him in it.

723
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,420
He gets to have sex with a girl...

724
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,280
Or a beautiful live girl in this movie.

725
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,300
So I can see why he went to the trouble of making a whole movie.

726
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,680
But it's...

727
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,760
I'd give it a thumb in the eye.

728
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,640
What do you think, Wee?

729
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,760
Yeah, I'd give it two thumbs in the eye.

730
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,980
Princess Wee didn't like this movie because it involved worms.

731
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:31,780
Worms.

732
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,240
Worms being sold and forced on people as drugs.

733
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,800
And then the worms would crawl around under your skin.

734
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,400
And only this time it wasn't just that you did too much drugs and thought there were worms.

735
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,940
There really were worms under her skin.

736
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:47,340
Right.

737
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,420
I had some issues with the movie.

738
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,480
I'm going to give a spoiler.

739
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:55,400
It has a happy ending and she gets her child back.

740
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,200
The pig.

741
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,880
The little piglet.

742
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,020
She gives back her child back.

743
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,180
The pig.

744
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,240
Now I didn't quite understand that.

745
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,680
Well, it's a spoiler.

746
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,720
And I just ruined...

747
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,640
I ruined the movie for everyone who would be able to understand it.

748
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,660
Which is about one-tenth of the people who will ever see it.

749
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,760
Which is about ten people.

750
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,920
So, I don't feel too bad about that.

751
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,620
And besides, they're all going to forget what I just said.

752
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,900
That part you are not exaggerating.

753
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,920
The other percentages you gave before were lies and infidelities.

754
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,040
And they were abomination of Dobbs.

755
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:39,440
And by the way, as long as you've got some perverts and perps of perverts walking around saying things like,

756
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,120
Dobbs hates...

757
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,800
Dobbs hates pigs.

758
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,200
Yeah, we hate pigs.

759
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,940
Yeah, Reverend Dow Jones has founded the new...

760
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,580
You can look this up on Facebook.

761
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,400
It's the West...

762
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:01,860
Subgenius West borrowed church of Dobbs or something like that.

763
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,120
Subgenius West borrowed church.

764
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:09,360
Anyway, he's made all the placards and the signs, or at least the graphics to go on the signs.

765
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,120
That say, Bob hates pinks and so forth.

766
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:18,280
But now he needs pregnant women and war veterans with only one stump and things.

767
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:22,340
And a couple other more normal looking humans.

768
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:30,500
Well, we just need fanatics who hate everybody to carry these signs and show up at places where they really shouldn't be.

769
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:35,520
Like, is there a memorial for the poor victims of the Boston Marathon bombing?

770
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,420
Because that would be the place to preach.

771
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:39,560
That would be the place to preach.

772
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,900
That's the premier that Bob hates pinks.

773
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,280
Bob wanted the pinks to die.

774
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,460
A good one to be seen as far as the numbers go.

775
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,520
This is Bob's judgment!

776
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:54,540
Ladies and gentlemen, we think that we're on the corner of Commonwealth and Mass Avenue right here.

777
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,200
I'm sorry.

778
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,120
It's too soon.

779
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:57,860
It's too soon.

780
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,680
It's too soon.

781
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,180
I started it...

782
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,680
Well, I don't want to get mushy because my feet are on fire right now.

783
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,460
Huh?

784
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,020
You remember that?

785
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,140
That was a great fan.

786
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,100
The Cropfish, they call it, man.

787
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:08,740
The Cropfish.

788
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,920
It's too soon?

789
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:15,360
I saw them open for the Who right after Kennedy was shot.

790
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,400
And they were right.

791
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,160
It was too soon.

792
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,540
They shouldn't have been...

793
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:24,000
They were singing funny songs about the president and Oswald and Jackie.

794
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,480
And it was just too soon.

795
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,500
And...

796
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:31,180
Especially if your organs were deteriorating real rapidly at the same time.

797
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,980
I guess the lead singer had to actually skin his forehead.

798
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:41,560
Or, you know, take off an awful shave, a lot of the top of his hair off, so that he would

799
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,580
actually look bald.

800
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,840
And 25 years later...

801
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,260
Oh, Marilyn Manson owes that band so much.

802
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,260
More than a penny, man.

803
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:51,920
That's for sure.

804
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,960
Even Alice Cooper.

805
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,620
Even Alice Cooper owes the band It's Too Soon.

806
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,680
And now we call him her Bane Alice Cooper because no one agrees on the rotundity.

807
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,220
Besides, everyone's crying about it.

808
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:04,720
I mean, you know.

809
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,340
No, Alice became...

810
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:17,820
Rebelling against Alice's rebellious image, Alice became a golf-playing Republican square.

811
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,840
And look at Manson now.

812
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,440
He drinks beer.

813
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,520
He's also changed geometric size.

814
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,200
Oh, really?

815
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,360
Well, I think he's playing Republican golf, too, perhaps.

816
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,780
Charles Manson?

817
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,280
Because he quit his band?

818
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,520
No, I mean Marilyn Manson.

819
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,520
Oh, did they get divorced?

820
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:34,700
Yeah.

821
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,060
Did Charles and Marilyn finally break up?

822
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,860
You mean into like individual molecular parts?

823
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:50,420
I saw a picture of Marilyn Manson on the Inquirer in the line at the supermarket yesterday.

824
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:56,720
And it said, Marilyn, I'll never feel sexy again because Marilyn got pregnant and there's

825
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,760
a little tiny bit of fat between the boob and the arm.

826
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,560
And you know girls hate that.

827
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,420
Yeah.

828
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,700
And guys will die for it.

829
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,260
Apparently old ladies.

830
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,680
And you're just one of them on the bus.

831
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,660
Guys will die just to think about it.

832
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:12,060
But, yeah, you know, it's just, oh, I'm so ugly.

833
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,040
I have a soft round spot on my body.

834
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:15,820
I'm so ugly.

835
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,640
I hate myself.

836
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,380
You'll never be sexy again.

837
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:18,780
Oh, my gosh.

838
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,040
I'm older than 25.

839
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,260
I'm going to die.

840
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,040
I'm just horrible.

841
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,440
Oh, God.

842
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,300
Well, as you were saying...

843
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,840
I don't remember.

844
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,400
You totally forgot and went into this rant about elderly women not liking the shirt.

845
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:33,400


846
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:33,400


847
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:33,400


848
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:33,400


849
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:33,400


850
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:33,600
It was a little bit too much.

851
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:33,600


852
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:33,600


853
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:33,600


854
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:33,700
I'm not a big fan of women because I like to be naked and I like to be in the shape of

855
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:33,940
their...

856
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,160
No.

857
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:40,840
All women, except for the ones that really are kind of homely, they all think they're

858
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,920
kind of homely.

859
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,620
Well, they're all...

860
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,360
The ones that actually...

861
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:51,140
The few that aren't kind of homely seem to be in denial about it.

862
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:54,400
And the ones that aren't are in denial about that.

863
00:40:54,660 --> 00:41:00,760
Well, don't you think that's a great cultural issue to think that a whole class, the major,

864
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,380
the majority of the public, has to have a girl with that kind of look?

865
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:09,860
It's made to feel insecure by product manufacturers and people who come up with numbers so that they can entertain you,

866
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:17,000
but you pay to see if you should have a perfect 24 ways to, you know, what do you know in them stuff?

867
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,680
You know what I mean?

868
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,380
I know in them stuff.

869
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:29,040
Well, you know, it's because they weren't raised in an environment of Bob and they're repressed and they're not Rondo Hatton.

870
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,480
Well, think of Connie.

871
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,420
Connie has a big old huge mustache half the time, especially when she's ovulating, for crying out loud.

872
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,140
It's a Yeti.

873
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,620
She's going crazy on her.

874
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,260
And she wears it proudly.

875
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,380
She Yeti, sure.

876
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,080
She's got quite a bush all over.

877
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,340
Yeah.

878
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,240
Hairdo, you know, all over.

879
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:56,280
And why not use that as a mark of true beauty by perhaps crafting it?

880
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:59,500
Well, plus it captures the musk, you know.

881
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,240
Now, somehow it's there.

882
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:05,060
Connie can get away with that, whereas so many hairy-legged hippie girls just can't.

883
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,480
And believe me, I'm not trying to put that down.

884
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,920
I'm just saying they don't all pull it off.

885
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,160
It has to be scant.

886
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,180
What are we talking about?

887
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:15,880
Why are we talking about hip-hop?

888
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,340
I don't know.

889
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,760
I'm going to cut to a piece of music very briefly for five minutes.

890
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,800
This will be another Rudy Schwartz Project song.

891
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:30,180
Dave, I want you to stay on the line and just listen to this jazzy piece.

892
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:31,600
Okay?

893
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:32,860
Yeah, man.

894
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,400
It's sexy.

895
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:34,920
Yeah!

896
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,380
Yeah!

897
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:39,380


898
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:44,020


899
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,100
Yeah!

900
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:56,400


901
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:56,400


902
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:56,400


903
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:56,400


904
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:56,400


905
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:56,400


906
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:56,400


907
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:56,400


908
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:56,400


909
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:56,400


910
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:56,400


911
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:56,440
Yeah!

912
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:56,440


913
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:56,440


914
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:56,440


915
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:56,440


916
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:56,440


917
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:56,740
Yeah!

918
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:56,820
Yeah!

919
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:57,040
Yeah!

920
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:57,760
Yeah!

921
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:58,700
Yeah!

922
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:58,700


923
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:58,700


924
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:58,700


925
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:58,700


926
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:58,700


927
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:58,700


928
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,420
Yeah!

929
00:42:59,540 --> 00:42:59,800
Yeah!

930
00:42:59,800 --> 00:42:59,800


931
00:42:59,800 --> 00:42:59,800


932
00:42:59,800 --> 00:42:59,800


933
00:42:59,800 --> 00:42:59,800


934
00:42:59,800 --> 00:42:59,800


935
00:42:59,800 --> 00:42:59,800


936
00:42:59,800 --> 00:42:59,800


937
00:42:59,800 --> 00:42:59,800


938
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,100
I'm sorry.

939
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,440
I'm sorry.

940
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,820
I'm sorry.

941
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,460
I'm sorry.

942
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,980
I'm sorry.

943
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,300
All the sexual conquests you can make

944
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,200
They've been raged in an environment of

945
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:34,860
Marvel

946
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:38,560
They've been raged in an environment of

947
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,220
Marvel

948
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,380
Gently awakening us into remembering

949
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:44,560
Who and what we are

950
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,320
Marvel

951
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,560
But there are other ways we can be communicated with

952
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,940
Beside the obvious evidence

953
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,840
Don't have to raise a single man for my dad

954
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,880
Don't be dangerous

955
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:56,960
Don't be a bad boy

956
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,460
Don't be a bad boy

957
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,340
Don't be a bad boy

958
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,120
Don't be a bad boy

959
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,120
Don't be a bad boy

960
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,560
Don't be a bad boy

961
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,060
Don't be a bad boy

962
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,380
Don't be a bad boy

963
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:13,220
Don't be a bad boy

964
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:16,320
If the state and if the system

965
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,120
The populace is controlling

966
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,660
Your sense of identity

967
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:22,380
Then isn't it going to be the force that

968
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,480
Demands what it is that you repress about yourself

969
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,060
Yeah

970
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:27,540
Because again in the psychological model

971
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,780
You are basically the one who sort of decides

972
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:30,300
Right

973
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,180
But if you tie in the Hegelian aspect

974
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:32,560
No

975
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,280
It's everyone that you've met

976
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,900
Everyone that is an influence of your life

977
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,340
Including the people in the world

978
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:38,940
The whole matrix out there

979
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:41,600
The whole human collectivism

980
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,460
Is the very thing that is policing people to

981
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,760
Repress aspects of themselves

982
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,960
So that they conform

983
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,060
To conform to this mechanical technological

984
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,780
Because the word technology means more than just machines

985
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,860
It's a way of thinking

986
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:58,060
And so that kind of indoctrination

987
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:00,200
Then causes the fraud

988
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,460
That's where Dave comes in

989
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:05,700
Fraudian forms

990
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,960
How dare you say that

991
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,140
Fraudian forms of repression are responsible

992
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:12,500
Where did the banana come from

993
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,000
Let me ask you that question

994
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,060
If I could

995
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:15,600
If I might

996
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,540
Same place as that crease in the peach

997
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:22,220
Well what if they're beaming instructions

998
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:23,240
To us from

999
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,360
From Cleveland

1000
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,700
I think we still know

1001
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,280
What they're talking about

1002
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,140
Yeah but we can't figure out the syntax or the context

1003
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:35,140
We don't know what it really

1004
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:38,360
Really really really really means

1005
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,880
Well that's because they don't want to admit

1006
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,300
How good looking she is

1007
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:46,840
The whore of Babylon I'm talking about

1008
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,960
Yeah yeah yeah

1009
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,400
Yeah I mean sure

1010
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,220
She's evil and a harbinger of the end times

1011
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:57,640
And all that

1012
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,940
But she is so hot

1013
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,140
But she is a slacker

1014
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:04,140
Very praiseworthy

1015
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:06,460
Yeah

1016
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,140
She's like

1017
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:07,140


1018
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:08,660
Pleasure

1019
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,040
No

1020
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,200
Bulbing

1021
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:21,780
Blur

1022
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:22,540
Pelosi

1023
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:27,600
Someone's got to share

1024
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:27,640
Here is the same story

1025
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:27,640


1026
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:27,640


1027
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:27,640


1028
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,100
No

1029
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,700
Yeah, yeah.

1030
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,260
That was when the priest was pulling his ear off part.

1031
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:36,760
Yep, we're old.

1032
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:40,300
I like when the priest pulls his brassiere off part.

1033
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,860
Listeners, do any of you ever watch Fellini's Eight and a Half every year or two?

1034
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:49,880
It's a thing that we recommend.

1035
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,700
Well, actually, I wouldn't recommend it to most people,

1036
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:58,180
but I saw it, I think, in college when I was 17 and went,

1037
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:59,860
wow, I want to see that again.

1038
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,800
In fact, I want to rip that off.

1039
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:05,260
I want to copy as much as I can from that movie because it's so arty.

1040
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:07,400
And I did.

1041
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,360
I did, sort of.

1042
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,840
I mean, I certainly copied and imitated as best I could.

1043
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:13,760
Well, that's the hat and the cape and stuff.

1044
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,140
Yeah, I had tights.

1045
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:16,580
You're in shows that had good tights.

1046
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:17,240
You know, rolling up to the eye.

1047
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:21,320
Every time you walk into a restaurant, you put the lens up to your eye,

1048
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,840
you know, and start sizing up shots.

1049
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,140
And you have to wear a fedora.

1050
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,160
That's really important.

1051
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,040
You've got to wear a certain fedora.

1052
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:31,660
And there's a funny walk you have to do every now and then.

1053
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:34,520
It's kind of a double-take walk.

1054
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,800
Here, I'll demonstrate it for the radio listeners.

1055
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:38,760
Okay.

1056
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,120
See?

1057
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,620
Oh, man, that was really.

1058
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:43,800
Yeah, it's real Fellini-esque.

1059
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,400
Very clear.

1060
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1061
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:50,000
Do you have problems with your, you know, when you shave your ankles?

1062
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:54,820
Does it cause the crease to grow or does it make anything else happen?

1063
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,320
Dave, are you making fun of me?

1064
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:57,420
Of course.

1065
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:57,820
But.

1066
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:58,640
That's not the point of it.

1067
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,120
I wish I could shave my ankles.

1068
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:07,080
Oh, but you have to bring up ankle shaving just to rub it in.

1069
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:16,180
You know perfectly well that the hair stopped growing on my ankles and my ankles years ago.

1070
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,700
No, it's not funny.

1071
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:20,520
Yeah, it's real funny.

1072
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:27,160
Dave was so cruel when he just thought about the different things staying had done to himself over the years.

1073
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:27,500
Isn't it?

1074
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:32,220
And it kind of made for lots of food for poisonous thoughts.

1075
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:39,280
Well, see, I've already been cursed for making fun of those hairy-legged hippie girls that I mentioned earlier.

1076
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:44,600
Well, thank God there is no super being deity out there helping us or not.

1077
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:46,520
What do you mean?

1078
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,760
There's dozens of them.

1079
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:48,780
I know, but.

1080
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:56,160
You know, I mean, you call them deities or whatever, but they're super duper beings of some kind.

1081
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:57,280
And I mean.

1082
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,460
If it wasn't for you.

1083
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,580
Are you trying to say X-Day is a joke?

1084
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:14,640
Are you trying to say Bob's teachings or some made-up bunch of garbage by a bunch of Texans smoking pot in their parents' car or making fun of people on the CB radio?

1085
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,780
That would be a terrible way for a religion to begin.

1086
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:26,780
It'd be almost like some guy in the 1800s just making up a story about magic plates.

1087
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:34,700
Full of the true Bible and some angel that comes and gives him special glasses.

1088
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,040
That'd be ridiculous.

1089
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:50,300
It'd be like believing that everyone has problems because they're reincarnated from uncleared aliens who sinned in the past by being psychologists or something.

1090
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,760
Boy, you got that right, brother.

1091
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:52,720
It'd be silly.

1092
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,240
Crazy stuff.

1093
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,760
I don't know that this was Joseph Smith.

1094
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:56,760
I hate to say it.

1095
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,400
I don't speak of any one religion.

1096
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:03,760
But the cults have been a part of American history for a long time.

1097
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:13,680
If anyone has ever seen the beautiful Kirtland Temple Cathedral to that religion, which was based upon, there was a bunch of cool Indian stuff around here.

1098
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:17,760
And it's all prehistoric and real archaeologically important.

1099
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:23,200
And they came out and they said some super guys from England came up with it and they were Jesus' buddies.

1100
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,520
Can you believe that?

1101
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:42,820
And now we cut to the footage proving that no American Indian would ever be capable of building a pyramid without help from Jesus aliens from a Caucasian galaxy.

1102
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:48,580
It's kind of silly when you say the whole sentence, you know.

1103
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:52,200
It's the log line of a whole country.

1104
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:55,460
Well, it's that all that Vondonican.

1105
00:52:56,780 --> 00:53:11,180
Astronaut stuff is predicated on the assumption that no spear-throwing savages would ever be smart enough to build a pyramid or a temple, you know, with good brickwork.

1106
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,280
Because only aliens could do that.

1107
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:20,100
Unless they're, you know, post-Renaissance Caucasians in Europe.

1108
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:25,560
How could anybody build something fancy without help from aliens?

1109
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:26,760
If they're just...

1110
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,040
If they're just dumb Indians...

1111
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,780
God, well, that's the history channel now.

1112
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,520
That's the science channel now.

1113
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:37,320
That's what people grow up believing.

1114
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,600
We had to have aliens helping us all the time.

1115
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:43,420
Because we're too stupid.

1116
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:44,740
Well, speak for yourself.

1117
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,660
I'm a subgenius.

1118
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:54,360
I'm stupid in a completely different way than those ignoramuses out there.

1119
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,080
A very important way.

1120
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:56,740
My dad...

1121
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:56,960
My dad.

1122
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,980
You hold in your hand the keys to illumination of a type never achieved on this planet before.

1123
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,460
Oh, speaking of illumination, I didn't say...

1124
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:09,260
I didn't illuminate who did the music that we played.

1125
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,480
Well, You're Not Rondo Hatton, of course, was Rudy Schwartz's project.

1126
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:20,220
But the thing called Raised in an Environment of Bob with all those preachers, that was the El Queso All-Stars.

1127
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:20,940
Remember them?

1128
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:21,520
Oh, yeah.

1129
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,320
We never got a chance to meet those guys.

1130
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,360
Yeah, the cheesy All-Stars.

1131
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:26,640
Yeah.

1132
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:33,020
They became more of an anti-Scientology group than a pro-subgenius group.

1133
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:38,840
Just so long as they're not a bunch of damn antebellum cross-dressing transvestites.

1134
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:40,160
What do you mean?

1135
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:41,420
What do you mean?

1136
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,100
What do you think X-Day drills are all about?

1137
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:54,440
I have never seen a man in a southern ladies' escadrille dress in my life at a burning figure of Bob's.

1138
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,440
Do we need to tell, Dave?

1139
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:56,560
Dave.

1140
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,480
In my life.

1141
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:01,520
Dave, you know that girl you picked up at the last X-Day that you were raving about?

1142
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,260
The young, pretty girl?

1143
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,960
Quote, girl, unquote.

1144
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,360
She killed someone.

1145
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,160
No.

1146
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,760
Well, yeah, she did.

1147
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:16,000
She killed her male self, which wasn't her real self.

1148
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,460
Oh.

1149
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,500
So, welcome to the...

1150
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:24,120
So, you're saying I made a terrible mistake because I either knew or cared about?

1151
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,700
No, it's just that you're...

1152
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:31,280
You just have to face the fact that it's okay to be bisexual, Dave.

1153
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,180
There's nothing wrong with that.

1154
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:36,460
I'm not a transsexual werewolf.

1155
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:36,840
No.

1156
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:42,580
A communist, a trans or a bisexual, nor have I ever been one.

1157
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:46,800
Nor a Baptist, Methodist, or...

1158
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:50,160
How about a mammal, Dave?

1159
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:55,640
I have always, as far as I swear as I can remember,

1160
00:55:55,640 --> 00:56:00,560
to the best of my knowledge and recollection, have always been a mammal.

1161
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:01,180
I swear.

1162
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:07,220
On a stack of, I don't know, Revelation X or whatever you want to put on there.

1163
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,480
That's what they all say.

1164
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:10,060
Yeah.

1165
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,880
They've got time to say it over and over again.

1166
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,760
Scaly-legged things.

1167
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:17,900
Scaly-legged hippie things saying that they're mammals.

1168
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:20,900
Oh, well.

1169
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:21,880
Oh, well.

1170
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,340
Well, we really are...

1171
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:24,960
X-Day is a-coming.

1172
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:28,780
Friends, July 5th, 1998.

1173
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:30,760
Could be this year.

1174
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:31,620
We don't know.

1175
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:38,280
We know that there's a July 5th coming and we have a fun little camp out.

1176
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:46,000
I think more and more every year people really, really, really wish it would happen.

1177
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:52,800
They just want to get out of here so bad because this is such a dismal, dreary, creepy place.

1178
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,480
Now, you know, the funny thing is I've started...

1179
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,360
It's kind of changed my mind about that.

1180
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,320
Oh, you like it here now.

1181
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:03,180
Yeah, the last couple of years have been really not great to Princess Wee and me.

1182
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:12,380
You know, she retired and gets paid to sit around or rather drive around National Parks

1183
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:21,220
and I get paid to fill the mail order while in the back of the car while driving around in National Parks

1184
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:24,440
covered up with a black tarp so I can't see outside.

1185
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:33,980
So you keep me concentrating on my addressing envelopes while Princess Wee looks at Monument Valley or whatever.

1186
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,660
But I enjoy it.

1187
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:37,820
But I enjoy it, you see.

1188
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:38,760
I dig it.

1189
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,440
It's rigorous work for some people, though.

1190
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,020
You have to admit that when you stay.

1191
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:47,740
I mean, a lot of those creatures you carry around with you in the back of the van and stuff,

1192
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:53,520
aren't they forced to do a little bit of actual physical labor and they don't get paid too well for it, do they?

1193
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,320
No, I can't trust them to do that.

1194
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:58,160
They don't do anything but make it hotter in there.

1195
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:03,680
Imagine how hot it is under a black tarp in a van in Monument Valley.

1196
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:11,880
Yeah, and just think of all the medical liability you'd have to pay if you ever let anybody really know what you're really doing with it.

1197
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:16,120
You know, that's not part of the bottom line to cut corners.

1198
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,840
So, well, just what the hell?

1199
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:19,040
We'll let it go the way it is.

1200
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:22,980
Besides, most people don't really know what they're really doing with it anyway.

1201
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,420
And on that note.

1202
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:25,300
Well, they don't.

1203
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,400
All right, I must say that it's time for us to go.

1204
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:36,340
But if X-Day doesn't happen this year at the same place the next week, the most fun thing in the world happens.

1205
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,160
Starwood Festival.

1206
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,400
Well, yeah, if you like hairy-legged hippie chicks.

1207
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,120
No, no, I'm just kidding.

1208
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:45,340
Just kidding, ladies.

1209
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:48,000
I'm a hairy-legged hippie chick myself, okay?

1210
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:52,600
And this is the Hour of Slack number 1,411.

1211
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,280
And I feel everything.

1212
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:56,500
Every one of those in my bones.

1213
00:58:56,660 --> 00:59:01,600
More information can be had if you need it from subgenius.com.

1214
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:08,400
The music in the background here is by the Flying Ryan Brothers from their album Under the Influence.

1215
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,160
A little song called Full Throttle, I guess.

1216
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:13,400
Dave?

1217
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:14,980
Yes, with that.

1218
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:17,320
I'm going to have to kiss you goodnight now.

1219
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:18,820
Right on the forehead.

1220
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:20,620
Let's use tongues this time.

1221
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:25,620
Oh, that was gross.

1222
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:27,920
Okay, now this.

1223
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:32,400
From PR News in Washington, I'm 32.

1224
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:34,820
So not a particularly good number.

1225
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:38,400
Economists say look for the PR News added last month.

1226
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:38,820
None.

1227
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:41,420
The video released yesterday said, quote,

1228
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:47,000
I thought it was in the best interest of everyone to rehabilitate PR News, but I was wrong, end quote.

1229
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:50,320
On Wall Street 457-1221.

1230
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:59,860
President Obama says an unexploded World War II bomb presents a real and clear danger to the U.S. and its PR.

1231
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:03,800
In 2010, three people accidentally exploded.

1232
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:10,780
The Associated Press is reporting that a state official in West Virginia says this is PR News.

1233
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:16,240
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show.

1234
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:20,380
And we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us.

1235
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:22,500
Keep on going for another couple of months.

1236
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:27,540
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1237
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:34,640
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1238
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:42,120
you should go to subgenius.com front page or especially the radio page or the catalog store pages

1239
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:45,440
