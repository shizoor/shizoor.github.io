1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
Begin next show now.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,180
Snort projector on tool.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,520
Ah yes, dear friends.

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,240
Another hour of slack begins.

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,940
It may not go on for very long,

6
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,440
but at least we've got a beginning of one.

7
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,220
Here at X-Day 19

8
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,580
at Tarzan's radio station

9
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,320
in Caffeina's Cafe

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,140
with Syria Campground

11
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,520
and Event Center near Pomeroy, Ohio.

12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,540
All of which

13
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,560
will be destroyed by the aliens

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,600
on July 5th coming up.

15
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,280
Unless

16
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,600
we protect them by

17
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,340
beaming them up to our

18
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,880
escape vessels.

19
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,740
Which we as subgeniuses

20
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,320
have earned.

21
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,540
Or unless there's some unforeseen

22
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,040
element of mercy

23
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,320
in this whole sadistic scheme

24
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,560
which has not been made available

25
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,840
unto us. But I wouldn't count on it.

26
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,040
Well, some subgeniuses

27
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,760
may be merciful.

28
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,360
Oh, subgeniuses.

29
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,460
Who else can you ask?

30
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,300
My list of

31
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,840
stuff to collect is much longer

32
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,940
than my enemies list.

33
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,140
Well, the

34
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,280
coming subtasm

35
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,940
will test that

36
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,840
as well as many other

37
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,060
long-held principles

38
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,060
and assertions.

39
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,260
The saucers are coming, my friends.

40
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,080
Ever nearer to planet Earth.

41
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,340
However politically incorrect

42
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,900
it may be to see

43
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,000
leering aliens committing

44
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,080
atrocities,

45
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,880
one will have to

46
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,340
dispel

47
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,620
the curse of the

48
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:29,740
evil.

49
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:32,780
This is the

50
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:32,780


51
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:32,780


52
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:33,320
I hope you enjoyed

53
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:33,320


54
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,380
If you're stuck

55
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,180
for ideas

56
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,540
when you get

57
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,780
your powers,

58
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,560
think about

59
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,560
those Mars Attacks

60
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,500
bubblegum cards.

61
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,560
You can just reenact

62
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,220
that stuff.

63
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,340
Which series?

64
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,340
Was there more than one

65
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,520
Mars Attacks bubblegum

66
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,120
card series?

67
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,960
Yes, there was.

68
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,240
Because when the movie

69
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,540
came out, the Tops

70
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,440
company put out

71
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,660
widescreen

72
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,440
glitter

73
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,280
series.

74
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:58,560
And the Tops

75
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:58,560


76
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:58,560


77
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:58,560


78
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,080
Mars Attacks cards

79
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,380
as well as

80
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,020
more cards

81
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,340
adding a harmful

82
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,400
back story

83
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,540
which marred

84
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,340
the original

85
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,440
Mars Attacks

86
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,460
story line.

87
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,820
Well, then even

88
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,740
better use the

89
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,960
Dinosaurs Attack

90
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,720
cards.

91
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,000
It's a curious

92
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,020
thing about that

93
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,440
series.

94
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,600
You know, Tim Burton

95
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,400
did want to

96
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,020
make a movie

97
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,520
of that,

98
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,240
but instead

99
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,400
he got

100
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,580
sidetracked

101
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,080
into making

102
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,580
a movie

103
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,200
of Mars.

104
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,280
And he

105
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,280


106
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,280


107
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,280


108
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,280


109
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,280


110
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,280


111
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,280


112
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,280


113
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,280


114
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,280


115
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,280


116
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,280


117
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,280


118
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,280


119
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,280


120
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,280


121
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,280


122
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,280


123
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,460
was a little bit

124
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:28,460


125
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:28,460


126
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:28,460


127
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:28,660
attack series.

128
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,300
I didn't know that.

129
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,260
His original intention

130
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,240
was to film the

131
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,000
Dinosaurs Attack series.

132
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,140
We need some free

133
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,960
women up here.

134
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,780
Or women free.

135
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,600
They did all get in free.

136
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,100
We're woman free right

137
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:40,720
now at the

138
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,340
Suzy the Flusy

139
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,620
Ladies and Germs, the

140
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,900
women were given free

141
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,980
access to

142
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,480
Baby Bear saw me

143
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,140
looking at her.

144
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,700
Oh, here she comes.

145
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,520
Well, she shouldn't

146
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,380
have paid, certainly.

147
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,240
I don't think any females paid.

148
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,260
So take a look at the

149
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,940
microphone and this time,

150
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,800
for the first time ever,

151
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,840
we have headphones.

152
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,760
Oh, I get my own

153
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,160
headphones.

154
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,400
I've never had my own

155
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,180
headphones before.

156
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,840
Just like good old

157
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,820
radio days.

158
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,500
Wow.

159
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,980
Where's the cough button?

160
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,920
Oh, that I'm afraid

161
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,260
you have to supply

162
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,380
yourself.

163
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,280
Whatever is happening,

164
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,180
I don't care much for it.

165
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,480
The pictures on the screen?

166
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,000
Images of Philo and so

167
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,100
forth.

168
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,700
No, that was G.

169
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,240
Gordon Gordon.

170
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,180
Oh, it was.

171
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,260
Yeah, there was a subgenius

172
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,720
fad about 10 years ago of

173
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,200
putting G. Gordon Gordon's

174
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,280
that face into pornography,

175
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,960
but usually not where the

176
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,720
head was.

177
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,680
There is a vast collection

178
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,480
of those things.

179
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,980
Yes, unfortunately, he was

180
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,560
shamed into leaving the

181
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,100
country for Portugal because

182
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:50,540
of that.

183
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,680
Now he resides as a citizen

184
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,420
of that nation.

185
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,680
Yeah, that's what they

186
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:56,960
say.

187
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,240
He got the

188
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,240


189
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,240


190
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,240


191
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,240


192
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,240


193
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,240


194
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,240


195
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,240


196
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,240


197
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,240


198
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,240


199
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,600
passport.

200
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,640
You don't want to know why

201
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,500
he's actually there.

202
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,540
I've got my passport

203
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:02,940
ready.

204
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,360
Oh, so you're going to go

205
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,140
over and take a Portuguese

206
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,160
fling, eh?

207
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,900
It depends on how the

208
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,940
election works out.

209
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,280
I hear Nova Scotia will be

210
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,540
taking people.

211
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:13,940
If anyone is elected, I'm

212
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,540
fleeing for some other

213
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,040
country.

214
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,920
I don't know which one.

215
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:18,280
Anyone?

216
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,760
What if Bob is elected?

217
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,500
Well, that's the one thing.

218
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,840
But see, but, you know,

219
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,400
friends, if Bob is who he

220
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,900
says he is, he's already

221
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,220
won.

222
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:28,220


223
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:28,220


224
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:28,220


225
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:28,220


226
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:28,220


227
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:28,220


228
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,300
You're the world overlord,

229
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,600
and your anxiety over America

230
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,320
turning into more of a police

231
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,720
state is foundless.

232
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,680
Because it's going to be one

233
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,040
anyway.

234
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:38,800
Under Bob!

235
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,820
Bob does not need the

236
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,360
entanglements and appurtenances

237
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,080
of power.

238
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,020
Slavery.

239
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,780
Already he possesses the

240
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,120
power.

241
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,500
Slavery under Bob is

242
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,340
preferable to freedom under

243
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,860
any other government.

244
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,860
Uh, yes.

245
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,900
The wonder of it.

246
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,320
The wonder of Bob Slack.

247
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,220
The depth of his mighty

248
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,340
treasure vault.

249
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,420
The height of his stacks of

250
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:09,860
money.

251
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,820
The gleaming gold.

252
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,460
The gold in his vault.

253
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,200
Even Frodo has never seen as

254
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,760
much gold as Bob has.

255
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,620
Hidden, stashed away.

256
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,520
Someplace he forgot about.

257
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,340
And you can run skipping and

258
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:27,840
noodling.

259
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,520
You can scoot through his

260
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,940
piles of gold.

261
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,700
Scrooge McDuck.

262
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,760
You can roll and loll and

263
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,160
wallow in money.

264
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,140
And then people won't want

265
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,180
that money as much.

266
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,720
If you're Bob's friend.

267
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,300
If Bob invites you to that

268
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:41,640
party.

269
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,920
The savagery and splendor.

270
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,960
The power, the beauty, and the

271
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,460
majesty.

272
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,040
Are you close enough to Bob

273
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,420
to be invited to that party,

274
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:50,800
friends?

275
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,300
Have you done for Bob what

276
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,440
makes him notice you?

277
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:55,960
Oh, come on.

278
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,740
Everybody who's here is Bob.

279
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:57,840


280
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:57,840


281
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:57,840


282
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:57,840


283
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:57,840


284
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:57,840


285
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:57,840


286
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:57,840


287
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:57,840


288
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,660
Bob's buddy, right?

289
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,640
I mean, we've established that.

290
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,760
Wow, the slideshow just came

291
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,000
around to the first picture.

292
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,020
That means we've been exposed to

293
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:12,860
1,313 graphics of subgenius

294
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,260
nature.

295
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,140
And still we live and breathe.

296
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,280
Oh, yes.

297
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,600
I didn't think that the

298
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,460
subgenius image slideshow could

299
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:23,760
end.

300
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,800
It can't end.

301
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,000
Doesn't it go on forever?

302
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,520
Subgenius?

303
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,480
The subgenius slideshow shall

304
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,500
never end.

305
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,460
Hey, I made that one.

306
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,080
There you go.

307
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,860
The number of subgenius

308
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,100
Facebook groups is too damn high.

309
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,920
Why is that ever the truth?

310
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,140
I've quoted that one quite a

311
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:40,740
bit, actually.

312
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,020
The internet makes it really,

313
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,420
really easy to be creative.

314
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,880
You just say something that

315
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,300
someone else said, and then you

316
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,640
put, you know, Slack or Bob or

317
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,940
somebody in front of it.

318
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:51,740
Yeah, stick a pipe in it.

319
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,740
Just stick a pipe in it.

320
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,480
That's why Nenslo hates it now.

321
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,460
All you do is just stick a pipe

322
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:56,560
in it.

323
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,260
If you take something that's

324
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:57,500
current, you can't get it.

325
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,140
You just put a Bob in it.

326
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,460
Oh, is that who that was?

327
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,160
That was Nenslo?

328
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:01,640
Yes.

329
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,940
He sure is testy.

330
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,820
I assumed it was someone

331
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,420
that was a...

332
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,960
He's a grouchy, grumpy former

333
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:07,960


334
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,760
...that had the ability to

335
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,140
get away with that because no

336
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,960
one else was saying anything

337
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,560
about it.

338
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,720
He's irascible.

339
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,380
Mothered by stones and wind.

340
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,460
He's a grumpy guy.

341
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,400
Yes.

342
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,700
Big old grumpy Gus.

343
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,280
Become slightly irritable in

344
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,840
his old age, but we remember the

345
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,500
wonderful, wonderful, wonderful

346
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:27,500


347
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:27,500


348
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:27,500


349
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:27,500


350
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:27,500


351
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:27,500


352
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:27,500


353
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:27,500


354
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,340
things that he did in the past and believe that...

355
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:30,660
No kidding.

356
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,280
...even he might come to the embrace of the church once again.

357
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,300
Well, probably if you go over to his house and visit with him, he'd treat you to a great

358
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:45,240
home-cooked meal and sit down and discuss terrible foreign films with you.

359
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,120
And he'd show you beautiful art and his golden nature guide book of weeds.

360
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,140
And the Kooks Museum.

361
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,340
Right.

362
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:54,940
That's on the property.

363
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,340
Run by Mrs. Nenslo, Donna Cossie.

364
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:57,400
Right.

365
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,620
And I think it's well worth visiting.

366
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,920
But of course, while in scenic Portland, you can also view the vertiginous Woodstock

367
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,000
Mystery Hole.

368
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,220
I've been down in that hole.

369
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,620
Oh, I've been in that hole, Dr. Howe.

370
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:10,860
Terrifying.

371
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,620
Yeah, I went down in it too.

372
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,760
I'll always remember that.

373
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,860
It is truly a mystery hole.

374
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,160
Oh, did you get a little bottle of the Vapors of Encouragement?

375
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,660
No, I did not.

376
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,720
It's a free thing.

377
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,900
You get a little bottle with the Vapors of Encouragement in it.

378
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,220
But were they like, who blessed them?

379
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:36,800
It was winter and I was wearing a heavy coat and my feet could no longer find the rungs

380
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,720
of the ladder.

381
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,740
They told me to let go and drop the remains.

382
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,740
Oh my God, that's terrifying.

383
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:42,900
Yeah, you bet.

384
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:49,040
You look down the mystery hole and the ladder just, in perspective, it dwindles down to

385
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,820
nothing.

386
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,760
It's like it's...

387
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,000
You know, you can see some mining carts and maybe a railroad track down there at the very

388
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,400
bottom.

389
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,220
It's not very clear.

390
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:02,020
And yet, when you start climbing down the ladder, you magically grow gigantically

391
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,520
huge.

392
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,080
Yes, your feet are unable to find the rungs on this tiny ladder.

393
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,900
And then you find yourself on the ground and there's a little bitty mining cart

394
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,860
and the bottom of the ladder is like...

395
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,820
Turns out not to be so deep after all.

396
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,140
It's a forced perspective mystery hole.

397
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,700
But then there are other rooms down there full of junk or what you have...

398
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,240
There's a little tiny door that's big.

399
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,780
Yes.

400
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,880
I've never been to very many of the roadside attractions.

401
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,220
You have to drink something and then you shrink down.

402
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,740
I've never seen the thing.

403
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,320
I've been down in that hole.

404
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,260
There's another mystery hole, Hal, in West Virginia, not far from Pottery Pet.

405
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,020
Does the thing, can you take it, still exist anywhere?

406
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,600
Baby Bear never saw it?

407
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,420
Oh, yes.

408
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:48,360
I've never gone on any road trips and stopped at any of that roadside attraction stuff.

409
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,160
The thing outside of...

410
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,780
It attracts me.

411
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,120
I feel a need to go to those things.

412
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,220
I've never been to any of those.

413
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,440
I've never seen those things when I go past them.

414
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,820
But they don't exist that much anymore.

415
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,160
Well, it seems like they're mostly out west, right?

416
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:08,280
I always heard that the thing, can you take it, was some sort of withered mummy they ripped

417
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,240
out of a burial site or something.

418
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,900
I can show you a picture of it someday.

419
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,660
Not now.

420
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,680
I've got an ultimate spoiler.

421
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,780
All right.

422
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,380
What if I don't know if I can take the thing, though?

423
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,960
Was there only one thing or were there many things?

424
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,200
You can take it.

425
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:34,080
In fact, when you pull over off of Interstate 10 in Arizona and go to the thing museum,

426
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,480
there are many, many, many things and it only costs a dollar.

427
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,160
Wow.

428
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,860
The thing itself is, in fact, more than one thing.

429
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:54,080
In a glass vault, it's either a mummy of an Indian woman and her baby or a prop that looks

430
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,200
sort of like a mummy of an Indian woman and her baby.

431
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,000
A pickled punk.

432
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,920
But that's just the beginning.

433
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,000
There's more.

434
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,860
The museum goes on and on.

435
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,900
It's in several warehouse-sized buildings.

436
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:11,940
It's full of primitive art by a very primitive man who carved an entire torture chamber life-size

437
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,720
out of tree stumps and hand-painted them.

438
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,720
And they're just...

439
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,540
You never know about your next-door neighbors.

440
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,460
It's just crappy enough to be great.

441
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,540
It's full of creatures.

442
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,180
It's full of animals.

443
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:24,180


444
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,680
And alien little things made of driftwood.

445
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,500
Where monsters prowl.

446
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,220
All over the place.

447
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,920
Where creatures roam.

448
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,220
I envy his ability to follow through on anything.

449
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,580
So, you know, next time you're driving through Arizona, don't miss the thing.

450
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,640
It's only a buck.

451
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:47,440
It's a good hour-long show of stuff to look at.

452
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,500
There's also sort of a...

453
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,820
Yeah, what's the big hurry anyway?

454
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,960
You know, here's the true story.

455
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:58,940
The cartoonist Gilbert Shelton and his wife Laura were driving and they came to the thing

456
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,900
and Gilbert said, you know, I always wanted to stop in and take a look at that.

457
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,580
And she said, well, you can go, but I'm going to sit right in the car because it's just a waste of time.

458
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,080
And so that's what happened.

459
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,360
She sat in the car and Gilbert went in.

460
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,280
He paid the admission.

461
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,080
He looked at the thing.

462
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,180
And then he came out and he said, well, what was it?

463
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,700
And he said, well, you didn't pay the admission.

464
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,140
So I'm afraid I can't tell you.

465
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,840
And he's never told her yet.

466
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,020
What an example of marital cruelty.

467
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,420
What happened?

468
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,300
Oh, don't worry.

469
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:34,700
Don't worry.

470
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,820
I don't want a telephone or a calculator.

471
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,140
That's too much.

472
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,220
Get rid of that stuff.

473
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,200
Oh, there you go.

474
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,520
Burma GURBS.

475
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,480
Okay, if you say so.

476
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:48,780
Yes.

477
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,540
Roadside Attractions of America.

478
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:57,480
By the way, the people who wrote the Roadside Attractions book and do that website are dues paying subgeniuses.

479
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,640
And they got their deal through our sacred agent, the late Jane Brown.

480
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,700
Praise Jane.

481
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,480
A lot of roadside attractions have actually fallen into disrepair.

482
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:18,600
And now you visit the crumbling, vandalized by teenagers ruins of roadside attractions like pathetic Fred Flintstone Village.

483
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,040
I was going to mention Bedrock.

484
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,100
Is that still there?

485
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,320
I'm afraid not in the form it was when it was in its healthy heyday.

486
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,100
It was pretty run down when I saw it, but that was 20 years.

487
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,380
No.

488
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:41,820
But I found out about the dinosaur park in, I think, Virginia that some tea party guy ran.

489
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:50,860
And he decided that he would show how the South really won the Civil War because dinosaurs came and ate Abe Lincoln and the Union Army.

490
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:58,160
And it's this whole diorama of dinosaurs munching the horrible Yankees in the Confederate's triumph.

491
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:15,600
So when I told Puzzling Evidence about that, he made sure actually to go to that place and video it extensively and then even get into a conversation with the caretaker of the park, which revealed many truths.

492
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,180
My book.

493
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,840
Well, before the world ends, some of the world's most important things are going to be destroyed.

494
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:20,840


495
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,180
Some people may be making a pilgrimage to what is it?

496
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,540
Mount Pleasant?

497
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,440
That's us.

498
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,360
Mount Pleasant, New York.

499
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,540
No, no.

500
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,540
What is Point Pleasant in West Virginia?

501
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,920
Oh, Mothman lives.

502
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:33,880
Mothman.

503
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:34,760
Mothman.

504
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,320
Yeah.

505
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,660
They have a statue of Mothman.

506
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,600
And I've never been there, but I've seen Reverend Fox's pictures.

507
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,460
And when you see it, you say statue.

508
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,100
Maybe it's not a statue.

509
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,120
Yeah, maybe that ain't no statue.

510
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,940
Maybe that's old Mothman himself.

511
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:50,820
Yeah.

512
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,720
John Keel basically told me he made all that stuff up.

513
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:01,480
Well, we don't have to spoil people's yearnings and beliefs.

514
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,300
You'd be surprised.

515
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:08,100
You know, when you're an outspoken subgenius, I've had people...

516
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,060
There's no such thing.

517
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,120
That doesn't exist.

518
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,640
All subgeniuses beat around the bush.

519
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:20,660
I've had rival cult leaders come up to me and go, keep on doing what you're doing, man, because it is all bull.

520
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,060
Bullshit.

521
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,200
Isn't it?

522
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:34,800
Some very respected Wiccan, that couple, I don't want to say their name, but they basically said, yeah, we're glad somebody knows this is all a bunch of crap.

523
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,340
Well, you can look it up in Wiccanpedia.

524
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:49,680
On the other hand, I tried to talk to the great Zukowski, who was really the guy who came up with the Yeti.

525
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,680
The descendants of the Yeti theory, but I tried to tell him...

526
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,380
But not as the subgeniuses.

527
00:15:54,380 --> 00:16:08,080
No, he believes that the Yetinsen, and that's his term, that we're the bad guys, but we're the ones behind corruption and murder and evil, and that the humans are the good guys.

528
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,500
How could that be true?

529
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:18,840
And I broached this subject at a convention to Zukowski himself, and I had the experience of being brushed off as a kook by Zukowski himself.

530
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,100
Prince of kooks himself.

531
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:34,940
He looked at the audience and goes, after I said, sir, I've read your book, and we in the church as subgenius really agree with you about every point of that, except that we think that the Yetinsen are the good ones.

532
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,340
And he looks at the audience and kind of rolls his eyes and doing this.

533
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,020
There's one in every crowd.

534
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:47,340
Well, you see, some people read my book and they get some funny ideas of their own.

535
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,820
It's a very strange idea of mine.

536
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:48,820


537
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,020
It is.

538
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,440
Yep.

539
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,020
Ah, that was a proud day.

540
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,260
It's like the Morlocks.

541
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,400
The Morlocks are painted as the bad guys.

542
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,380
Right, exactly.

543
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,240
They're our children, our descendants.

544
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,500
How can we be so mean to the Morlocks?

545
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,240
Yeah, they're the ones that can still create and build.

546
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,280
They still keep the machinery running and the groceries coming in.

547
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:16,340
By the way, if you've never read the sequel to The Time Machine, which is called The Time Ships.

548
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,320
The Time Ships.

549
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,600
By Stephen Baxter, definitely check it out.

550
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,100
Oh, don't worry.

551
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,880
It's just a JPEG.

552
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,860
It's a fine, fine book.

553
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,100
It's a fine book.

554
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:27,800
Well, I didn't know.

555
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,280
It looked like some sort of computer symbol.

556
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,200
Well, there it is again.

557
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,860
If you say that's all right, it must be you.

558
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,380
What is this?

559
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,760
Image has been redacted.

560
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,980
What is this we're listening to?

561
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,280
Well, I don't know.

562
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,380
It's something you need.

563
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,000
What kind is this?

564
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,380
You're the one in control.

565
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,540
Yeah.

566
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,840
Rice Song.

567
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,980
Rice Song.

568
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,140
That's all it says here.

569
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:02,300
Well, Reverend Baby Bear, how do you find the camping conditions at X Day?

570
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:08,660
Well, I've only been here for, you know, not even an entire day yet.

571
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,980
But so far it seems nice.

572
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,740
But there have been no insect outrages or other things going on?

573
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,420
There's cicadas everywhere, but...

574
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,800
The last of a dwindling breed.

575
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:27,100
A bee landed on my chair this morning, and I gave it up to him.

576
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,440
I let the bee have the chair.

577
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,060
Well, that was gracious of him.

578
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,780
Princess Wee was bitten by a spider in bed in the big house.

579
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,400
And she saw a mouse run under the bed.

580
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,280
Boy, they just won't let her be.

581
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,120
We really are in the wild.

582
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,620
She jumped on a table.

583
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,860
And went, eek, a mouse!

584
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,020
Just like in cartoons.

585
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,680
A wonderful living stereotype.

586
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:49,500
Yeah.

587
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,120
Well, that's good.

588
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,680
Because no wasp has trespassed this year.

589
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,800
I have been menaced.

590
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,500
That's a cue for a wasp to land on your microphone.

591
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,800
They came and hovered about you once again?

592
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,480
Yeah, I saw some behind you guys earlier, actually.

593
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,580
Well, I prefer simply not to know that they're floating, hovering, darting.

594
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,180
Well, with the headphones, it's an entirely different...

595
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,240
thing for me now.

596
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,560
If I don't hear them, then they can't scare me.

597
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,480
And I don't have to run, shrieking and bawling and weeping.

598
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,860
On radio, what is not heard does not exist.

599
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,880
What you can't hear won't kill you.

600
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,700
Well, why do you think we do?

601
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,640
We've done these thousands and thousands of hours of shows.

602
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:36,080
The wasps don't bother us when we're doing radio, because we've got the headphones on.

603
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,980
Yeah, but I've never been given a pair of headphones.

604
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,980
I hadn't earned my membership stripes yet.

605
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,920
Now you've stepped down.

606
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,920
I've stepped up to big pay.

607
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,360
I have stars on my shoulder pads.

608
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,100
You'll get your new epaulettes in the mail.

609
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,020
Dr. Howell was with me when I bought those new headphones.

610
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,120
Yes.

611
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,060
I thought, just think how good they'll look on Baby Bear.

612
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,340
I actually have a really good pair of headphones that I probably should have brought.

613
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:12,940
You could bring them, but you know, every time you bring them, you risk their being damaged by some goofy, overenthusiastic subgenius.

614
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:17,060
I also had a mummified lizard for Susie, and I've also forgot that.

615
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,260
Well, if it's truly mummified, it'll wait until another occasion.

616
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:21,440
It'll keep you.

617
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,580
And now, for the first time, we are bringing you the full story of one of them.

618
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,420
I named him Carl.

619
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:37,060
We are giving you all the evidence, based only on the secret testimony of the miserable souls who survived this terrifying...

620
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,880
He's done it again!

621
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,680
What did I... the incidents?

622
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,040
Places.

623
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,360
No.

624
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,720
My friend, we cannot keep this a secret any longer.

625
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,060
I thought when you...

626
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,460
If that's your heart, it's supposed to be true.

627
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,680
...stand the shocking facts of the world...

628
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,700
...and its unsurfaceable evil.

629
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,020
The idea.

630
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,420
Who do they think they are?

631
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,240
The nerve.

632
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:06,880
Oh, okay, that's... that's... that's moving. That's moving. The slideshow's moving along.

633
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,080
Alright, yeah, we're moving, we're grooving.

634
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,300
Recording.

635
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,480
In the groove.

636
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,560
Everything's going fine.

637
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:13,580
Recording.

638
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,640
This is the theme from Ed Wood, the movie.

639
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,320
Mm-hmm.

640
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,140
Background.

641
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:28,740
You know, I... when I was a young shaver, I was actually following what all those characters were doing.

642
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:38,680
As I'm sure you were, too, because one of them, though not shown in the movie, was a certain Forrest J. Ackerman, who hung out with the rest of those weirdos.

643
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,340
And if the movie had been more accurate, should have been shown in the entourage.

644
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:51,600
So I knew about Ed and Vampyra and Dolores Fuller and, uh, of course, Lugosi.

645
00:21:52,360 --> 00:22:01,640
You know, Ackerman slavishly followed Lugosi and, uh, managed to get his ring and, uh, see him sleeping in his coffin and everything else.

646
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:08,860
He has the original Lugosi Dracula ring with the bat on it, or did have it at the time of his death.

647
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:08,860


648
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,320
He has the original Lugosi Dracula ring with the bat on it, or did have it at the time of his death.

649
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:17,000
These are the things that subgenius doctors know and others don't care about.

650
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:25,880
Well, it's true. They're happy, uh, healthy, uh, uh, usual normals that don't care about.

651
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,460
I don't know about those things.

652
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:34,560
I know about Disney villains and all the Pokemon, the original ones.

653
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,000
The Disney villains were good, especially the female ones.

654
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,160
Those were the monsters that I came up with. Pokemon and, uh, Disney villains.

655
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,340
Those are cute monsters though, aren't they?

656
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:46,920
What?

657
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:47,660
Maleficent.

658
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,400
They're cute monsters though, aren't they?

659
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,000
Stepmother.

660
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,020
I mean, some of them. They range in cuteness.

661
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:58,940
Look, if everything in the world is cute, then the monster is still a monster, though cute.

662
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,840
There's like dragons and stuff.

663
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,360
Yeah, cute ones.

664
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,360
There's weird ugly toad monsters.

665
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,400
So you can play weirdos and dragons.

666
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:19,380
Ah, yes, yes, yes. No, no, no. I'm starting to get kind of tired.

667
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,020
Oh, fuck up.

668
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,520
I've been tired the entire time.

669
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:29,360
Well, we were up to the, we were, uh, I, the, the bands were, uh, whatever that thing was last night.

670
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,700
Roystering until cock crow.

671
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:36,720
Yeah, that went on until like two or three in the morning, and then we had to strike the set and, you know, wrap it up.

672
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,080
I was up.

673
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:38,780
Hide the microphones.

674
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,920
I was up until the birds were twittering.

675
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,020
Were you on mic?

676
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,720
They all had their iPads out, and they were twittering.

677
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:47,840
Lucky Mike.

678
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,200
Tweeting.

679
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,740
And smaller foolers makin' melodia that's slapin' all the nicht with open ear.

680
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:59,100
For not your pricketh him in her corages, as the poet says.

681
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,780
Yeah, that guy.

682
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,520
Hey, anybody else want to come up here and engineer this show and talk?

683
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,340
And sit in for Ivan Stang, who's just too feeble and weak to continue.

684
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:18,600
I've, I've been, uh, I know the subgeniuses for what they was, and I know J.R. Bob Doggs for what he was.

685
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,760
There, there. It's all right.

686
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:28,760
My family, while crossing the Great Highway, was attacked by a band of normal humans.

687
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,160
I was raised among them.

688
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,160
And forced to do as they did.

689
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,160
Learn their ways.

690
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,520
The Pink Boys.

691
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,740
And I'll never forgive them.

692
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,220
I will never forgive the Pinks what they did to me.

693
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:52,980
And you will smite down upon them with righteous fury.

694
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,120
I shall.

695
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:03,140
My power, the great power that Bob Doggs has granted me

696
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,140
is eclipsed only with

697
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,820
by the great pleasure

698
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,280
that I shall experience

699
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,980
upon that day called X.

700
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,380
Yes, they shall grovel at your feet.

701
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,280
Right? They're gonna grovel.

702
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,980
See, you need a cough button up here.

703
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:27,320
I'm afraid that's something that only the effete radio stations of civilization have.

704
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:32,080
Not Tarzan's free and easy, uh, radio station.

705
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,480
What are you doing?

706
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,840
We don't have a cough button.

707
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,860
Do we, sir?

708
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,980
Here in the jungle.

709
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,520
No, when you do professional radio, you're supposed to have one of those little slide whistles that goes

710
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,520
and a quack, a little quack sound effect.

711
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,600
And I'm trying to find my nose flute.

712
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,640
Oh, no.

713
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,480
Well, maybe it's time.

714
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,360
I must have put it away safely. That's okay.

715
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,280
We'll go without the nose flute.

716
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,880
We're safe for the time being.

717
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,020
I just needed to blow my nose, and I thought I might as well kill two birds with one stone, you know?

718
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,540
Sing a little song while cleaning it out?

719
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,220
Yes.

720
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,300
Kind of a bubbling.

721
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,320
No warbling.

722
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,700
Ever thought of sending your sinus to Arizona?

723
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:16,780
Oh, I'd love to, my sinus and my, the rest of me to go to Arizona more often.

724
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,920
And get cleaned out.

725
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,160
I like the rocks.

726
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,880
And the vitamin D. So freely available.

727
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,020
I like places that look like there should be dinosaurs chasing you.

728
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,820
They're just behind the next rock.

729
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:30,460
Yeah.

730
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,180
And we've got, uh, petroglyphs out there.

731
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:40,100
Including some that sort of look like dinosaurs, but you've seen those, right?

732
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:49,780
You know, uh, before there were movies, and before there were even stage plays or books, there were petroglyphs.

733
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:57,260
And I can imagine that there was, there was probably a sort of a George Lucas or a Spielberg of petroglyph makers,

734
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,140
where people would go, have you seen Ogg's latest picture?

735
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,100
Man.

736
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,120
It's like, it's so real, it looks just like a horse.

737
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,340
And, but there's no horse there.

738
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,820
I can't wait for, I hear he's working on a new picture.

739
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,720
I wonder what his next picture's gonna be.

740
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,240
I heard it's gonna be in color.

741
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,400
Now he's invented negative space.

742
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,260
Let's kill him.

743
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:26,160
Now really, I mean, think about it, there, there, not, I'm sure not everybody was drawing petroglyphs.

744
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,300
No, not everybody had enough time to draw petroglyphs.

745
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,080
A lot of people had time only to be drawing petroglyphs.

746
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,260
I know.

747
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:38,660
Chased 20 miles by a bellicose mammoths, and then eat two caterpillars and a blackberry.

748
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,440
But it's the near-sighted cave man that invented religion.

749
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,160
Well, he didn't have the glasses, you see.

750
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:54,860
He couldn't, he couldn't, he was no good at throwing rocks at rabbits, but he learned how to make little fat ladies out of clay.

751
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,560
And he got rich.

752
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,800
Well you must be familiar with-

753
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,800
Cos that was like, pornography has driven me about cheap!

754
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:01,960
Robert Crumb's wonderful story.

755
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,080
art forever. Are you familiar

756
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,560
with Robert Crumb's comic

757
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,040
Cave Wimp? Yeah.

758
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,020
I had that same theory before I saw that

759
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:10,600
comic. That's a great story.

760
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,880
Yeah, that's where

761
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,240
the near-sighted caveman

762
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,780
was the one who came up with the

763
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,760
religion idea and art.

764
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,940
And for a time was quite successful

765
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,840
and managed to pass his DNA

766
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,600
along to create future

767
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,300
generations of wimps

768
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,300
in later periods.

769
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,060
When all the other men go out to hunt

770
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,320
only the wimps stay back.

771
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:33,940
Right.

772
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,980
With, you know,

773
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,620
females.

774
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,320
Yes.

775
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,020
But this irritated

776
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,240
not only the... It doesn't sound as dirty when I say it

777
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,560
because I'm not an old man like you guys.

778
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,940
It irritated the male cavemen

779
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,020
but it really irritated the

780
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,840
crone cavewomen

781
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,000
who said that things were getting

782
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,840
out of order and they,

783
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,360
the real power in the tribe,

784
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,640
got the burly cavemen

785
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,680
to throw cavewimps into the tar pit.

786
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,520
But as he went under, he

787
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,840
realized he managed to

788
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,660
pass along his seed

789
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,000
to future generations.

790
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,700
Well, he had created an unrealistic

791
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,200
ideal woman that it was hard for

792
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,680
starving cavepeople to live up to.

793
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,620
This really fat

794
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,620
female figure.

795
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,200
Voluptuous.

796
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,660
Yeah, that was the, obviously,

797
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,680
that was what the kind men

798
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,620
like in those days. But just as today,

799
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:30,620


800
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,820
the conspiracy tries to make it real,

801
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,540
you have to look like a Monster High girl.

802
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,320
You have to be skinny.

803
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,160
You have to be Barbie.

804
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,540
Oh my gosh. Have you turned on Monster High?

805
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,420
No, no, not at all.

806
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,220
Well, I'm upset that they're all pretty.

807
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,760
They're all skinny.

808
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,020
There's no fat Monster High girl.

809
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,100
And I think, I mean the whole point of the thing is

810
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,480
everybody's different and you embrace your abnormality.

811
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,540
That really is the running thing behind it.

812
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,660
Except they're hypocrites.

813
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,160
I've been learning more about it.

814
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,340
You're watching?

815
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,960
I like, no, I just like looking,

816
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,580
I like to go to the toy store, like anytime.

817
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,980
And view the action figures.

818
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,340
I'm anywhere where the toys are.

819
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,220
And just check out what kids are getting now

820
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:15,040
that I didn't get and then just seethe bitterly about it.

821
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,300
Well, now you're an adult.

822
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,100
You're gonna buy it unlike the kids.

823
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,120
Well, it just doesn't, it's not the same.

824
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,460
But I just like to see the different, you know,

825
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,660
the different things they come up with

826
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,060
for the Monster High dolls.

827
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,640
I do that too. I do that too.

828
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:29,640


829
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:29,640


830
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:33,020
I go to the toy section and just wistfully, you know.

831
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,960
It looks a little weirder when you do it though.

832
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,780
I could afford that stuff, but I don't really need.

833
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,900
I did, we did buy one Monster High character.

834
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,680
It was a new one from the movie Scarier Reef.

835
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,260
It wasn't Draculino, was it?

836
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,840
No, it's the daughter of,

837
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,820
we thought it was the daughter of Cthulhu.

838
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,140
Because she has tentacles for legs.

839
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,060
She's really sexy looking.

840
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,140
Of course they all are in a monster-y way.

841
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,020
Sounds like some that I know.

842
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,640
And the back, it said, daughter of Cthulhu.

843
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,100
Daughter of question mark.

844
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,280
Now they're all the daughter of some monster or another.

845
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,160
Is it the Kraken?

846
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:04,780
Usually they're obvious.

847
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,760
It turned out to be the Kraken.

848
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,160
Oh, okay.

849
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,120
But I didn't.

850
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:08,900
I'm sorry. Spoiled the story.

851
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,640
We learned that when we saw the movie.

852
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,920
But when we saw the toy box, I thought, man,

853
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,900
I bet it's supposed to be daughter of Cthulhu.

854
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,560
And I just don't want to deal with the royalties

855
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,340
for Lovecraft Estate if there is such a thing.

856
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,560
But no, it turned out to be the daughter of the Kraken.

857
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:26,520
And she was a villainess in that particular one.

858
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,600
I wouldn't be surprised if they had

859
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,620
a daughter of Cthulhu.

860
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,420
My eight-year-old cousin knows who Cthulhu is

861
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,860
and types him in on Scribblenauts and he appears.

862
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:37,840
Good.

863
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,120
I hope an accurate depiction.

864
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,940
Once an elder god, now a cute, fluffy toy.

865
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,440
A plushie.

866
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,760
A plushie exists.

867
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,420
Shee hee hee hee hee.

868
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,040
Well, but at night it may metamorphose

869
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,240
into a more accurate miniature, which then grows.

870
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,620
I had a list of the characters.

871
00:31:59,620 --> 00:31:59,900
I had a list of...

872
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,020
Like in Jack the Giant Killer.

873
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,740
I had a list of the correspondences

874
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,980
between subgenius women and the Monster High girls.

875
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,300
And Baby Bear, you corresponded to Draculaura

876
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,660
because of physical resemblances.

877
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,980
And she's kind of squeaky voice too.

878
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,280
I think, actually I still have that sticker.

879
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,360
I have the Draculaura sticker.

880
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,400
I put it on one of my boxes of magic cards.

881
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,600
APO Stacey corresponded with the daughter of Cthulhu.

882
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,200
The daughter of the Yeti.

883
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,340
Abbey Bominable?

884
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,400
Yeah, Abbey Bominable.

885
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,120
How could I forget?

886
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,200
It's Apostasy.

887
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,160
Yeah.

888
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,000
But...

889
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,320
No, APO Stacey.

890
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,040
Apostasy.

891
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,920
Well, that's...

892
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,380
Why are you saying that's an apostasy?

893
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,560
You know, this is like people who suddenly realize

894
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,040
that we are dough.

895
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,580
Weirdo.

896
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,400
Now I get it.

897
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:52,560
13013.

898
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,460
Simpsons episode.

899
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,180
Mrs. Crabapple.

900
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:55,860
Oh no.

901
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,740
Nobody ever thought of that.

902
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:58,620
Yeah.

903
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:03,440
But, you know, it could be like a regional pronunciation difference.

904
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,820
Like the difference between aluminum and aluminium.

905
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,440
Well, that's just wrong though.

906
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,320
There's no...

907
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,260
It's crazy stuff.

908
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:11,860
That's insane.

909
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:12,760
Apostasy.

910
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,360
There's not that many eyes in aluminum.

911
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,040
That's too bad.

912
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,480
There's one singular eye.

913
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,420
But it sounds kind of shimmery and aluminiumy.

914
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,720
Well, you know how those British people are.

915
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,520
They have to add an extra letter to everything.

916
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,460
They add some letters that don't...

917
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:28,840
It's not that long.

918
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,900
Or it couldn't be that we just dropped letters being ignorant settlers in the New World or

919
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,020
anything.

920
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:35,300
No.

921
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:39,500
If you're referring to what I'm thinking of, it is because we're better Latinists.

922
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,240
But what?

923
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:45,660
I had a friend who went to London to work at a kids' science museum there.

924
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:54,280
And the kids there asked him to say words in an American accent all the time, just like

925
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,060
people pester people with British accents.

926
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,860
They shrilly tittered and giggled?

927
00:33:59,160 --> 00:33:59,500
Yes.

928
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,020
They would surround him and they'd be like, say aluminum again.

929
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,000
And he would just be like, aluminum.

930
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,720
And they're like, oh, it sounds so funny.

931
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,500
Listen to the funny Yankee, mommy.

932
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,820
Ah, well.

933
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,140
Who's going to fight the next war?

934
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,440
The next generation.

935
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,000
And that reminds me.

936
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,460
You know what?

937
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:31,560
What we ought to do is get those little kids that were doing that show last night up on

938
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,220
that stage, the little rascals.

939
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,080
The kids?

940
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,020
Yeah, the kid, the kid, Julie show.

941
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,980
The kid, fid, Julie show.

942
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:42,640
Well, yeah, they're going to dress up in funny costumes and put on a show.

943
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,200
The whole time I was thinking, God, I wish I had a...

944
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,820
This is where I should have brought that recorder up there to get the line recording because

945
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,320
it was all vocal stuff.

946
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,700
You do have a recording of this session, don't you?

947
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,360
I have four.

948
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,000
Four.

949
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,600
Well, there you are.

950
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:04,200
Simply edit it in at this appropriate moment and regale the audience with a recapitulation

951
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,440
of what happened on the main stage.

952
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:14,800
No, but seriously, we're old and we should let one of these shows be done by the...

953
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,720
Let them try to stop them.

954
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,300
Those poe buckers.

955
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:17,800
There's one.

956
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,860
See that Reverend Fox?

957
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,520
He's coming up there.

958
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,180
He's coming right up here right now.

959
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,480
We only have three mics.

960
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,300
What is happening?

961
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,340
But I'd love to get that.

962
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,240
I'd love to get up and go take an ibuprofen and a pee and...

963
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:34,480
Well, why don't you take your Geritol, grandpop, and we'll put Fox in to pinch hit for you.

964
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,860
Yeah, that's going to run for 30 minutes.

965
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,500
This will run forever as far as I know.

966
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,460
But you'll pop down those pills in no time.

967
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,320
The music may run out, but where's the...

968
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,720
But these colors never run.

969
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,740
Oh, yeah.

970
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,260
Oh, yeah.

971
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,320
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to...

972
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:55,320


973
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,520
I can't...

974
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:03,540
I must describe Reverend Stang, quivering and palsied with rheumatism, is getting up,

975
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:12,180
leaving the dais, and now Reverend Fox is going to make news in his stead.

976
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,620
While Stang goes to charge his phone...

977
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,960
And his batteries...

978
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,660
I will be here.

979
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,080
He's just going to play Monster Hunter.

980
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:19,420
I will commandeer the knobs.

981
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,620
There's a lot of knob handling to go around here.

982
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,460
Twiddle them.

983
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,180
Between here and Gobbler's Knob.

984
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:26,580
Delicately.

985
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,000
Infinite variances on knobs.

986
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:43,740
Did you know that there was a Cthulhu region of Pluto, the dwarf planet recently given a flyby by robots from Earth?

987
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:51,540
Cthulhu Regio, which can be located on an image of that strange-looking planet,

988
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,440
which actually turns out to be rather attractive in its own way.

989
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,880
Oh, he's very cute.

990
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,300
He's a little cute guy.

991
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,400
Spinning balls of frozen anger.

992
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:02,540
There's also Tombog Regio, named for...

993
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,600
All right, guys, Dad's gone.

994
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,120
Time to throw a party.

995
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,740
...discoverer of Pluto, Clyde Tombog.

996
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:18,020
That's Tombog Regio, not Topo Gigio, just in case there's any confusion there.

997
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,500
But not the dog.

998
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,600
No, the dog also appeared in 1931.

999
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,440
We're not talking about the dog.

1000
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,300
No, the dog appeared a little later than the actual discovery of Pluto,

1001
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:34,180
which was named by Tombog's little daughter, but not out of the Disney canon,

1002
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:38,500
because, strangely enough, the cartoon Pluto also appeared,

1003
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,660
but slightly later at that point in humanity's evolution.

1004
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,720
That's really Cthulhu's true form, is Pluto, the dog.

1005
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:50,420
And now we know that Pluto and its giant moon, Charon,

1006
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,820
are actually a kind of binary system,

1007
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,640
orbiting around each other,

1008
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:59,240
while two smaller, satanically named moons

1009
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,780
zip and dart around the parent planet.

1010
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,100
They're just lazy. They can't get their stuff together.

1011
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,620
And then why does Pluto have an atmosphere, as apparently it does?

1012
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,920
We thought it was a frozen lump of ice and rock,

1013
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:16,660
and apparently it's active enough to have an atmosphere of its own.

1014
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:19,980
What's in it?

1015
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,620
Well, I don't know. I've never been there.

1016
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:26,800
I don't know about myself, but informed minds are speculating

1017
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:30,820
that it is perhaps the lost planet Yuggoth,

1018
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,240
mentioned by H.P. Lovecraft in his work The Whisperer in Darkness.

1019
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:41,820
But beyond Pluto, there are all sorts of newly discovered planets in our system,

1020
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:47,820
like the planet Biden, named after our current vice president, Joseph Biden.

1021
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,080
Good old Uncle Joe.

1022
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,340
I hadn't heard of it.

1023
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,780
Well, have you heard of the ones named...

1024
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,080
You know, they no longer use Greek gods,

1025
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,020
so they're using Eskimo deities and so on.

1026
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,700
There's the planet Quawar,

1027
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,660
and the planet Sedna out there,

1028
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:09,220
way far out in the inky darkness of space.

1029
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,580
And many new objects which are floating out there,

1030
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,260
called the Centaur objects,

1031
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:21,320
which orbit between Neptune and the outer reaches of the solar system.

1032
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:26,320
Hidden craft among the planets here within our own solar system.

1033
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:31,940
And we occasionally get bombarded when a rock gets out of the asteroid belt.

1034
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:35,660
But mighty Jupiter sucks most of them up,

1035
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,380
sparing the Earth from destruction and grief.

1036
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:41,940
We saw some of that last night around the fire,

1037
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:45,620
some space junk just hurtling through the atmosphere and exploding.

1038
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:49,020
There's a big meteor shower a-coming this way.

1039
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:50,580
That's...

1040
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,580
No, no, no.

1041
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,980
But most of it will be...

1042
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,540
Those are the souls of the damned, falling from the sky.

1043
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:03,160
They'll be falling on Earth, unable to appreciate their beauty.

1044
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:03,900
Salt it.

1045
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,200
Don't ever need anything here again.

1046
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,300
Salt it away for the indefinite future.

1047
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:16,940
Yum.

1048
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,360
Well, that was...

1049
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,100
I'm just hearing...

1050
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:24,880
snappy dance music, just barely, on the soundtrack.

1051
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,280
I wonder why it's turned down so low.

1052
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:27,420
We're just riding...

1053
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,360
Yeah, how do we get the...

1054
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,900
Don't, don't, don't.

1055
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:32,720
Not that one.

1056
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,140
Oh, he knows how to operate a slider.

1057
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,560
Don't you? Just slide them up.

1058
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,240
That's why they call them that.

1059
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,600
Well, if it's...

1060
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,020
You put the stuff on the...

1061
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,820
Just see what makes the mambo music louder.

1062
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,120
And if it doesn't put them...

1063
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:49,980
There you go.

1064
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,380
Now we're having a mambo espresso party right here in Caffeinas.

1065
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,900
Everybody's happy, having a good time.

1066
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:04,280
We're slugging down huge Irish coffees, Scotch coffees,

1067
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,440
Northumbrian coffees, Cornwall coffees.

1068
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,880
Mugs full of hot dirt.

1069
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:13,360
Yeah, just like Mother used to make.

1070
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,800
It's hard to find good coffee.

1071
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:15,800


1072
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:15,800


1073
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,020
It's hard to find good dirt.

1074
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:19,300
This is some fine soil around here.

1075
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,060
But this used to be a strip mine, correct?

1076
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,880
A series of spirit mounds,

1077
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,920
including the mighty turtle mound commemorating Old Sequoia.

1078
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,580
Old Sequoia.

1079
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:36,580
Some of you have received cryptozoic maps,

1080
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,920
which were tipped into your registration booklet this year.

1081
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:45,780
And they show the location of many of the...

1082
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:50,140
hidden species in the American continent,

1083
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,380
including Old Sequoia,

1084
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,060
also including another Ohio monster type,

1085
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,960
known as the Loveland Frogmen.

1086
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:03,640
Yes, under stealth of darkness,

1087
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,520
these amphibious, slimy beings,

1088
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,100
hunched over, crawl by night.

1089
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,680
And there's only one way

1090
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,420
to find out what they're up to.

1091
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:19,400
You have to become one of them.

1092
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,840
You could just poke them with a stick a whole lot.

1093
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,120
Yeah, they're not covered.

1094
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,280
They're easy to poke.

1095
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,900
If they're out there, then why are there so many cicadas?

1096
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,520
Just like Gig and a frog.

1097
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:39,020
Well, the cicadas recently had their 17-year appearance.

1098
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:42,900
And the ones that you see now are the last outriders.

1099
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,760
It may have fulfilled their biologic function.

1100
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,020
And be ready to perish,

1101
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:51,520
knowing that 17 years from now,

1102
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:54,440
or so they think in their childish innocence,

1103
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,740
the new generation will crawl forth.

1104
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,420
I was camping in the spring

1105
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,580
as they were erupting from the ground.

1106
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,800
Were they singing?

1107
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,920
It started raining, like, as soon as we got there.

1108
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,600
And they were just...

1109
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,100
It was gross.

1110
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,620
It was really gross.

1111
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:13,380
Chirping away.

1112
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:17,460
And Susie was telling me about the locust.

1113
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:19,700
Yes.

1114
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,420
Her friend that she encountered.

1115
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,080
It was dancing.

1116
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,400
Susie did her interpretation of the locust dance,

1117
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,580
which I think was...

1118
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:29,540
I saw it.

1119
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,740
It did apparently appear to be dancing.

1120
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,540
I couldn't figure that out.

1121
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:37,780
Maybe its feet were slipping in some complicated way.

1122
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,960
But why did it repeat those movements?

1123
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,500
Maybe it had gotten into somebody's fromp stash.

1124
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,480
Maybe.

1125
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,440
Maybe everyone was blowing fromp on it

1126
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,760
and confusing its little brain, possibly.

1127
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,120
Or maybe, as I said,

1128
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,620
it was just sort of a puppet,

1129
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,540
jerked about by instinct,

1130
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,900
irrelevant, now that it had finished

1131
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,560
contributing to the future locust stream.

1132
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:03,600
Gross.

1133
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:04,840
I don't want to swim in that.

1134
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:05,460
Oh, no.

1135
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,420
Well, I dare say you won't have to.

1136
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,000
Those locusts will be only a memory.

1137
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,480
That's a good one.

1138
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,780
Yeah, that's an expensive luxury over in Japan,

1139
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,220
is the locust bath, though.

1140
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:19,120
You know, filling up over to your knees

1141
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:24,040
and just a pool of warm, spiny legs.

1142
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,680
They're only as warm as their environment.

1143
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,040
But how about these...

1144
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,340
Them guys are weird over there.

1145
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,560
...bee keepers who get a huge beard of bees on themselves

1146
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:37,400
and then get photographed grinning under a beard of bees

1147
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,740
in all the bee magazines.

1148
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,480
That's like the most horrendous thing

1149
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,880
I could possibly...

1150
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,320
Like the buzzing,

1151
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,300
just being...

1152
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,160
having to sit completely still while it's...

1153
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,700
It's like a centerfold in the bee magazines.

1154
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,960
The buzzing, the buzzing.

1155
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,480
The monthly bee beard.

1156
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,520
Yes, the bee keeper,

1157
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,860
the weekly bee keeper,

1158
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,120
they always have these burly guys

1159
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,760
covered with a beard of bees

1160
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,660
in the photos that are snapped and sent in.

1161
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:02,520
But as you know,

1162
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,580
if one stings, it's a chemical signal.

1163
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,440
They all sting.

1164
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,100
And then you don't want a beard of bees.

1165
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,800
A bunch of bees created a...

1166
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,460
A bunch of bees created a...

1167
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,400
A bunch of bees created havoc and mayhem

1168
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,340
in California just recently.

1169
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,700
They went on a rampage,

1170
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,340
stinging everybody in the neighborhood.

1171
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:22,520
And authorities were called and saying,

1172
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:25,620
oh, these must be killer bees from Mexico.

1173
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,360
And the result?

1174
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:28,660
Nuh-uh.

1175
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,280
They're ordinary bees who decided to go on a rampage

1176
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,100
and they stung two little dachshunds to death

1177
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:39,920
so that they swelled up and resembled jumbo dogs.

1178
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:41,880
That's, uh...

1179
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,020
And they followed people down the street,

1180
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,180
a-stinging them,

1181
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,320
and into their houses, too.

1182
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,460
Yes, this was the days when the bees stood up

1183
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,260
and said they weren't gonna take it anymore.

1184
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:54,420
I blame the schools.

1185
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,360
I blame Jerry Seinfeld.

1186
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,920
He's an anti-bee?

1187
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,380
Oh, he...

1188
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,660
No, he stirred them up

1189
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:04,360
with his propaganda, political propaganda film.

1190
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:05,940
Somebody stirred them up.

1191
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:09,760
He was invigorating those bees to go out

1192
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,220
and start taking action.

1193
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:14,840
But instead of legal action, like in his hilarious movie,

1194
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,040
they just decided to kill wiener dogs.

1195
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,200
I thought that movie was gonna, like, suck

1196
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,160
and, like, be really bad.

1197
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,700
And finally, you know...

1198
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:21,960
Which movie?

1199
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,820
I sat down to watch it.

1200
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,340
Bee movie.

1201
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:24,740
Oh.

1202
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,980
And, um, it's worse than I thought it was.

1203
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:28,680
Oh.

1204
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,120
But Ant-Man was pretty good, though.

1205
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,180
So bad.

1206
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,180
But Ant...

1207
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:33,620
Yeah, I liked Ant-Man.

1208
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:34,780
I liked Ant-Man a lot.

1209
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:35,660
I liked Antony.

1210
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,000
I liked his riding ant.

1211
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,900
Well, how about the ant that was...

1212
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,740
accidentally enlarged and became dog-sized

1213
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,980
and a family pet under the table

1214
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:46,400
being fed by his daughter?

1215
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,600
Yes, that was a nice outcome.

1216
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,540
I think pet ants would be a wave of the future.

1217
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,740
You know, if the planet is going to be completely

1218
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,680
soaked in this bloody radiation.

1219
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,540
Too big to communicate with the colony

1220
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:03,880
by the usual method, so now it's on its own

1221
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,360
and becomes like a beloved family retainer.

1222
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:09,900
And then we have...

1223
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,120
And then when they die, you just hollow them out

1224
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,780
and you use them like a chip and dip bowl.

1225
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,540
You can turn them into decorative furniture.

1226
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,680
How ex-Kyton.

1227
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,940
We need more giant bugs.

1228
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,040
They used to be a staple of Hollywood movies.

1229
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,380
Why would you wish for that?

1230
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:31,700
The Deadly Mantis, the Earth vs. the Spider...

1231
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:32,700
It's not a wish, it's hope.

1232
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:33,000
Them.

1233
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,160
Hoping for giant bugs.

1234
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,480
Ant Farm Dickhole.

1235
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,600
Large enough to see.

1236
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,300
Well, I missed the Ant Farm Dickhole movie,

1237
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:46,020
but that was shown a few years ago at X Day.

1238
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,020
I mean, as long as we're on the topic of oversized insects.

1239
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,360
You gotta mention that one.

1240
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:56,140
A few years ago, after X Day, I was in New York

1241
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:58,600
and I saw a number of vendors,

1242
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:01,080
and one of them was selling honey,

1243
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:03,300
and he had these bear statues.

1244
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,800
Oops, I mentioned bears.

1245
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,380
Well, he had these statues,

1246
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:08,440
and they were covered with honey,

1247
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,520
and they were covered with bees,

1248
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:10,960
but the amazing thing was,

1249
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:14,400
these bees who were flying around his head

1250
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,760
seemed perfectly habituated to him.

1251
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,820
And while I was standing there,

1252
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,020
one woman asked him,

1253
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,520
do they ever, you know, sting you?

1254
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,640
And he said, oh no, they never sting me.

1255
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:28,980
And he reached up and he picked one out of the air,

1256
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:31,620
and then he put it on the palm of his hand,

1257
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,220
and the bee lay on the palm of his hand

1258
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:35,760
while he stroked it with his finger,

1259
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:38,580
and its little abdomen moved in and out.

1260
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:45,120
And he claimed that the bees never harmed him,

1261
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:48,180
and that he was the bee daddy and all sorts of things,

1262
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,600
just to sell his honey, I imagine.

1263
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,120
Just pushing that honey.

1264
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:57,640
But I never saw anybody take a bee in flight out of the air

1265
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,700
and then pat it while it was lying on its back.

1266
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:01,960
Oh, you had taken it out of the air.

1267
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:02,840
I didn't understand that.

1268
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,300
I wrote an article about this

1269
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,580
that was published on rawstory.com,

1270
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:12,900
years ago, a number of us were writing on that national news blog,

1271
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,960
rawstory.com,

1272
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,460
even Ivan Stang,

1273
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:21,180
until Pete Goldie wrote an incredibly offensive email

1274
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:24,580
that got us all kicked off rawstory.com.

1275
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,260
Oh, that's what happened?

1276
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:30,260
Yes, it turned out that he wrote a very offensive letter.

1277
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,560
Well, I never...

1278
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,640
I am less than surprised.

1279
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,500
He certainly knows how to twist the knife,

1280
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,380
and they said,

1281
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,360
who is this guy?

1282
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,880
Let's get rid of this whole bunch of people.

1283
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:45,840
After they sent him to cover some NASA convention, too.

1284
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,400
A NASA convention?

1285
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,320
A NASA event of some kind,

1286
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,000
since he's a NASA liaison himself,

1287
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:58,040
a science and astronomy expert.

1288
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:00,960
One of them rocket boys.

1289
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:06,220
Yes, no rocket jockey he,

1290
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:08,500
but a plane crash archaeologist

1291
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,680
who goes to the sites of former plane crashes

1292
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,420
and ghoulishly sifts through them for artifacts.

1293
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:20,020
Like recent aircrafts?

1294
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,920
Like aircrafts that are falling out of the sky now?

1295
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:22,960
Historically recent.

1296
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,940
Wherever an airplane crashed,

1297
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:28,480
he's gone and he's pulled out items

1298
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,900
that were buried by the impact

1299
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,600
or survived the fireball.

1300
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,160
Oh, he's a grave robber.

1301
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:33,800
Okay.

1302
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,180
A tomb raider.

1303
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:39,900
All for scientific purposes, supposedly.

1304
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,040
Supposedly.

1305
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:44,040
He doesn't have the boobs for it,

1306
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,820
to be a tomb raider.

1307
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:46,720
To be a tomb raider.

1308
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:50,580
Apparently Lara Croft is resented

1309
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,600
by a lot of fanboys

1310
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:56,680
who write bad things about her online.

1311
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:59,320
Is there anything that fanboys don't resent?

1312
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,220
Well, there is that.

1313
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:03,880
Browsers.

1314
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:04,780
Posts.

1315
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:07,300
computer animation

1316
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,280
of Lara Croft being

1317
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,320
sexually outraged and

1318
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,120
they write

1319
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,480
snippy things about how

1320
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,680
she's not so great.

1321
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,340
Easy to knock her down to size.

1322
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,600
I'm paraphrasing. They don't use

1323
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,500
those terms. Well, we can use all that

1324
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,520
juicy Wi-Fi now and we can just

1325
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,560
pull up all these articles on our phones.

1326
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:29,640
Yeah, and read them. In fact, that should be

1327
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,400
the whole show. We should just read things

1328
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,380
off of our phones for another hour.

1329
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:34,080
All at the same time.

1330
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,760
Yeah, all at the same time.

1331
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,240
How many

1332
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,080
Facebook accounts can we get?

1333
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:42,560
We don't have enough.

1334
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,860
We don't have enough microphones.

1335
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:46,940
We need at least 10 or 12 people simultaneously

1336
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:48,400
reading off of their phones.

1337
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,400
Don't forget that not only

1338
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,420
are some of us being

1339
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:54,700
heard right now, but all of us

1340
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,420
will be heard in the

1341
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:57,040
future.

1342
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,040
Because of these recordings. And so

1343
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,280
to you future folk

1344
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,940
out there listening to us,

1345
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,640
judge not the subgeniuses

1346
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,180
too harshly

1347
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:10,340
for the quality of this Bobcast.

1348
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,440
But there are going to be

1349
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,720
more live Bobcasts

1350
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,300
throughout X-Day

1351
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,640
so far. Yep.

1352
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:20,020
Ferg has had the interactive

1353
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:21,540
subgenius web stream

1354
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:23,360
thing.

1355
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:26,460
And we've been interacting.

1356
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:27,880
In fact, I think more

1357
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,260
interacting with the audience through

1358
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,600
the phone than

1359
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:32,260
the web.

1360
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,520
Than the actual audience

1361
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,700
here. In fact, most of the audience

1362
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,720
I think started yelling at people on the

1363
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,280
phones last night. I think that was

1364
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:41,640
what was going on at 3 or 4

1365
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,140
when the microphones were

1366
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,620
hidden away from

1367
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:48,420
ranting and raving subgeniuses.

1368
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,160
Pride from their hands.

1369
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,700
I didn't pay for the Wi-Fi, but

1370
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:55,360
I just, you know,

1371
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:57,580
I just miss it so much. You're not supposed to pay

1372
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,720
for anything this year.

1373
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:00,800
I just miss Wi-Fi.

1374
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,040
Yeah, I know.

1375
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,120
Your Wi-Fi ticket.

1376
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,880
I miss the meal ticket.

1377
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,440
I miss the Facebook

1378
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,300
app. I need to tweet about

1379
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:12,740
something. We're running out of tortillas and peanut

1380
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:13,900
butter at camp. Who can you shame

1381
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,860
when there's no Facebook

1382
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,580
to interact with?

1383
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,660
I just want to know what's going on on BuzzFeed.

1384
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,480
Well, it's alright. It's only a

1385
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,020
brief interruption.

1386
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:26,680
There's amazing, fabulous products out there right now

1387
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,360
and I need to know what they are.

1388
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,080
I need to purchase things.

1389
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,260
What is the deal of the day on NewEgg.com?

1390
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,400
Someone look it up.

1391
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:35,640
I need to know.

1392
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,060
It's Steam Summer Sale.

1393
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:38,220
Yes.

1394
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:41,120
I could have spent all of this money on video games.

1395
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:42,340
No!

1396
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:45,240
Which, it is alleged, will complete your slack.

1397
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:51,320
Just get this one final object and you'll be four square.

1398
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,940
Four square or eight square?

1399
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:55,480
Squared away.

1400
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:56,300
Four cube.

1401
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:00,060
I was looking at the hypercube information that we had here.

1402
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,260
What you're seeing there is the show.

1403
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,080
The shadow of the hypercube.

1404
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:05,740
Eh? Eh?

1405
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:09,980
Can't show the actual hypercube itself in our dimension.

1406
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,080
But we can look at the shadow

1407
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,640
and not be

1408
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:14,980
destroyed

1409
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,700
or overwhelmed.

1410
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:24,260
There are some wonderful cube animations that ran on the stage last night

1411
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,820
when I was able to get in yesterday with Baby Bear.

1412
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:32,260
And we, uh, I leapt on the stage as soon as I got here and, uh,

1413
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,820
seriously injured my, my legs.

1414
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:35,220
Oh no!

1415
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:35,740
This has been great.

1416
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:36,280
What happened?

1417
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:36,860
Immediately?

1418
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,680
Like immediately as like getting onto the stage.

1419
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:40,840
How's your leg now?

1420
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,260
Uh, not too well.

1421
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:46,640
But, uh, we sprayed some Bactine on it and I slapped a bandaid.

1422
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:49,140
Those are two brand names.

1423
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:54,240
I should have said I put on a, uh, a topical spray and an adhesive strip.

1424
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,760
At this point, uh, product placement doesn't matter one way or the other.

1425
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,460
It's all over.

1426
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,280
It's a quaint, uh, terminology.

1427
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:05,340
Lingo from a vanished civilization and era.

1428
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:14,640
But I hope the Bactine did, uh, destroy the germs which were ranging themselves like an army

1429
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,300
to enter the violation of your body and your leg wound.

1430
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:21,800
Yeah, I, I think I'm gonna lose my leg by the end of next day.

1431
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:22,640
It's gonna...

1432
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,020
But then you'll get a new one that's even better.

1433
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,960
I'll just grow three more legs.

1434
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:28,980
They'll all be bionic and can...

1435
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:29,560
I'll have more legs that I know what to do with.

1436
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:31,260
...contain supersonic, uh,

1437
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:31,440
I'd like a leg coming out of the back of my neck.

1438
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,480
...pogo sticks that can vault you into the ionosphere.

1439
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,520
I'd like a leg coming out of the back of my neck.

1440
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,100
They make it, make it easier to chew your...

1441
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,720
That's in case you fall over, um...

1442
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,680
It's easier to chew your own toenails.

1443
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:44,440
There's still the face plant, uh, and, uh, it's nursery.

1444
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:47,420
Nursery?

1445
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,760
Is this the, uh, kindergarten edition of the show?

1446
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:50,860
Where does the music go?

1447
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:51,940
Well, to, to grow the face plant.

1448
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:52,660
I don't know, uh...

1449
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:52,840
You're in control.

1450
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:57,760
Uh, as, as, as Stang said, the music might die off and so...

1451
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,400
Yeah, he talked a whole lot of stuff, but I wasn't doing a whole lot of stuff.

1452
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,240
It had, uh, his prophecies in mind.

1453
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,420
It had invariably come true.

1454
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,500
I was more interested in the sitting down.

1455
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:09,280
But I can say to you that the music will be heard again.

1456
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:18,220
It will fill the air in its joyousness, uh, air the Leviathan can swim a league, uh, any

1457
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:19,260
moment now, folks.

1458
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,600
And go to registration.

1459
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,200
Shh.

1460
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:28,420
Now's the opportunity to go to registration while there's no music.

1461
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:31,180
Is there anyone here who's unregistered?

1462
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:31,220
Shh.

1463
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,080
I'm unregistered at this point.

1464
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:33,480
Just a bunch of unbreakful deadbeats.

1465
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:38,820
Clearly, everyone in Caffeinas has gone to Princess We and received the special bracelet.

1466
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:41,040
Does anyone have the bracelet except for...

1467
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:41,940
You'll be registered by Princess We.

1468
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,220
Like, no one else has one on.

1469
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:46,480
It looks so good on you, baby bear.

1470
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,760
It's greenish, uh, color stands out.

1471
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:50,200
I gotta get mine.

1472
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:51,200
Yeah, where's yours?

1473
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:52,780
I came up and talked on the microphone.

1474
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:53,760
What have you been doing all day?

1475
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,660
What's that bracelet you've got on?

1476
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,800
Is that a wisteria bracelet?

1477
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,000
This is the wisteria bracelet.

1478
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,880
But you've also got to get the subgenius bracelet.

1479
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,220
You have to get the subgenius electric bracelet.

1480
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,700
Electrostimulotron-o-matic.

1481
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,700
Oh, you don't know what it is because you can't read it because you don't have yours.

1482
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:13,600
It's an official X-Day electrostimulonegative reinforcement control.

1483
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:20,340
So you guys should just get your bands and then you can be on the bandwagon and you don't

1484
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:22,160
have to worry about being banned.

1485
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:23,440
Get your band on.

1486
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:26,200
Get banned or get banned.

1487
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:27,200
Yes.

1488
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,280
Put your band on or be banned.

1489
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,200
It's your fate.

1490
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,840
It's your fate in the Church of the Subgenius.

1491
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,740
My band is inside the shadow of the hypercube.

1492
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,920
Join the Yeti band now.

1493
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,260
And here they come, hundreds of subgeniuses from over the hill.

1494
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:50,060
Shuffling along, hunched over, swinging their arms, anxiously awaiting induction.

1495
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:52,540
Valiantly riding on their horses.

1496
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:56,300
Of dirty, stained money and filthy clothes.

1497
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:58,320
The proud, the tall.

1498
00:57:58,380 --> 00:57:58,920
A fistful of dollars.

1499
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:01,180
The avaricious, the arrogant.

1500
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:01,180


1501
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,340
Grasping.

1502
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,920
For a few more fistsful of dollars.

1503
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,520
And dynamite.

1504
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,960
A few fistsful of dynamite more.

1505
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:12,740
A few more stark fists of dynamite.

1506
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:16,780
That'll make them wake up and take notice.

1507
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,880
Think they can push me around.

1508
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:20,940
Yeah.

1509
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:22,940
It's easy to push with a fist though.

1510
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,280
We need more fists.

1511
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:31,180
Unless you encounter a fist of equal strength and weight covered.

1512
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:31,180


1513
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:31,180


1514
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:32,180
Coming from the other direction.

1515
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,540
Then you have the impasse.

1516
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,980
The tie that needs to be broken.

1517
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,440
Well I have upper body strength of like a ten year old so anybody can do that.

1518
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:40,700
Well.

1519
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:41,900
I have a weak leg.

1520
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:45,860
You never know what you can do when it comes to the point of crisis.

1521
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,340
You can draw on inner resources.

1522
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:56,300
I could drink some more of that crazy bourbon cola that we grabbed.

1523
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:57,640
There you go.

1524
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,420
You're formulating a plan already.

1525
00:58:59,620 --> 00:58:59,840
Yeah.

1526
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,760
I just get jacked up on a whole lot of sugar.

1527
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,940
Then we'll start throwing some fists around.

1528
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,820
That's using the old noggin.

1529
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,000
Consume sugar.

1530
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,460
Nature's perfect food.

1531
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,900
A non-alcoholic drink that tastes like it has bourbon in it.

1532
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:16,440
So kids can finally get the taste of bourbon that they've been waiting for for years.

1533
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,500
Otherwise known as a why bother.

1534
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:21,500
Why not?

1535
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:22,480
Get them hooked.

1536
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:23,300
Get them hooked early.

1537
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:25,200
Well when you can drink actual alcohol.

1538
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,380
To drink fake beer for a year.

1539
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:29,820
Yeah.

1540
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:29,820


1541
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:30,280
Fake beer.

1542
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:30,820
Fluttering beer.

1543
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:31,580
Yes.

1544
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:32,420
That's just water.

1545
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:40,240
For free information see www.subgenius.com.

1546
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,440
Praise Bob.
