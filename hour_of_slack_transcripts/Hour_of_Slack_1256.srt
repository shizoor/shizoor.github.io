1
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,500
From here on out, it's up to you, Mac.

2
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:15,860
All right, Mac.

3
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,660
You got it?

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,260
Yeah.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,140
Okay, now, it's coming at you, too.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,380
And a little gentle now.

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,140
All right.

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,320
I've got it.

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:25,780
Here.

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,660
All right.

11
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,880
One, two, four, three.

12
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,600
The subgenius power of switching.

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,620
I'll crawl in first.

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,220
Good luck.

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,540
Okay, now, let's get to work.

16
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:40,880
Here.

17
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,460
Here are the time bombs you rigged up.

18
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,240
Six grenades.

19
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,700
Yeah, that ought to do it.

20
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,220
All right.

21
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,600
We're the type.

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,040
A bomb room.

23
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,200
The Bizarro Bomb.

24
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,520
No light.

25
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:04,540
Slug.

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,980
The Bizarro Bomb.

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,420
The Idle Slug.

28
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,220
The Idle Slug.

29
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,980
The Idle Slug.

30
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,200
The SMG bomb.

31
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,540
Oh, my God.

32
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:14,020
I want to join Islamic jihad.

33
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,760
I just want to kill for God.

34
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,000
Praising Allah is the life for me.

35
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,580
The Idle Slug.

36
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,580
The Idle Slug.

37
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:25,580


38
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:25,580


39
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:25,580


40
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:25,580


41
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:25,580


42
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,400
I'll use pipe bombs, what the fuck?

43
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,020
Killing Hebrews brings good luck.

44
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,280
Gotta make Khomeini proud of me.

45
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,960
Load a car with dynamite and drive into a synagogue without any brakes.

46
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:52,100
Nothing could be better than impaling your intestines on a big rusty stake.

47
00:02:52,100 --> 00:03:00,440
Hand grenades and cattle prods, let's go out and kill for God.

48
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,840
I can hear Mohammed calling me.

49
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,760
Yowza, yowza, yowza.

50
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,360
smT0 💥 joke

51
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,900
a town is all it takes is a search of sexual Sindh

52
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,700
No Bam engineers andujahide im like wow

53
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:51,300
Let me play a few in the night

54
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:51,700
philosophize

55
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,380
Though the Koran seems quite odd

56
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,860
I still want to kill for God

57
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:16,220
Praising Jesus is the life for me

58
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,900
Fuck those pagans, they're such cynics

59
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,320
Let's bomb the abortion clinic

60
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,500
Jerry Falwell is my cup of tea

61
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,800
Never thought I'd make it big by selling God to idiots on cable TV

62
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,460
What the fuck, it's not GE

63
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,840
But still a better way to use my business degree

64
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,200
Use a rifle, spare the rod

65
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,740
Let's go out and kill for God

66
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,080
Praise the Lord and hand that gun to me

67
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,420
From PR News in Washington, I'm growing dimmer by the hour,

68
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,680
but Australian officials still aren't happy.

69
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,300
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev is in Moscow subway stations.

70
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,140
Russian security officials say Dmitry Medvedev

71
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,240
is one of Russia's biggest domestic problems.

72
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,560
Analysts say security officials ripped through

73
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,060
one of the world's biggest metro systems at rush hour.

74
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,640
Officials say there aren't PR news in Moscow.

75
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,780
Wall Street 6-10-8-8-10-6

76
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,640
Australia's foreign minister says this is PR news.

77
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,320
The Commerce Department is still recovering, but slowly.

78
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,360
Clearly, economists should please the Federal Reserve on Friday.

79
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,540
A wrecked South Korean warship inside a sunken ship in Moscow.

80
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,640
Military divers sank into the Yellow Sea on Friday,

81
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,340
but received no response.

82
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,100
The South Korean government could have drifted into South Korean waters,

83
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,840
trapped inside North Korea.

84
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,780
Congress has adjourned without conspiring to kill PR News in Washington.

85
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,260
Thanks to Lee Murr for PR News and for our title sequence

86
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,840
and for the song destruction's bracketing said title sequence.

87
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,820
Although the large did the hour of pinks part.

88
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,780
That song, Kill for God,

89
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,760
is by Reverend Joe Newman of the Rudy Schwartz Project

90
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,140
from the CD Remembering a Summertime Rash,

91
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,560
which is a collection of greatest hits, you might say,

92
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,380
released by DCJamRecords.com.

93
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,120
You can also own this CD,

94
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,180
even though I intend to play pretty much all of it on the show eventually.

95
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,400
The Rudy Schwartz Project album Bowling for Appliances

96
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,000
has also been released,

97
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,580
and we'll be hearing that as well,

98
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:54,260
all from DCJamRecords.com or MySpace slash RudySchwartzProject.

99
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,220
And as far as I know,

100
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,540
Reverend Joe Newman is still looking for somebody

101
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:05,740
to make a music video of that song, Kill for God.

102
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,900
For details, see Stang at Subgenius.com.

103
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,840
Zappa died so that he could be replaced

104
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,040
by such...

105
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,900
as Reverend Joe Newman.

106
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,080
But now, an artist shown to us by Reverend Tater Gumphreys,

107
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,140
the artiste Amit Lesak.

Stinks and sucks

139

I know what you are but what am I?

140
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,740
I hope you die soon

141
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,620
I know what you are but what am I?

142
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,480
I'm gonna hit you with a rock

143
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,200
I know what you are but what am I?

144
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:05,480
I know what you are but what am I?

I know what you are but what am I?

148
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:52,180
Mr. Rection did that collage of calls left on my message machine by the good Reverend Bernard

149
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:58,020
who recently had a setback in that he was forced to move to a new boarding house due to foreclosure.

150
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,260
And now he only makes his 20 calls in a row every week or so.

151
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,880
And now...

152
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,060
Ten minutes to meltdown, I'm having a drink

153
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:12,720
I don't think you care, no I don't even think about

154
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,300
Who were the hands that you saved?

155
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:15,700
I don't think you care, no I don't even think about

156
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,180
Ah! you don't love

157
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,340
Cause you hold them so tight

158
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,280
While the sky up above

159
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,360
Opens, up and rains down with a known holy pour

160
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,580
And there's holes in the ceiling

161
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,600
And holes in the floor

162
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,700
There's holes in these walls, ones so covered with grout

163
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,980
Hey? baby. Its the end of the world

164
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,880
Have a good time

165
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,280
Degtonically speaking, integrity's lost

166
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,400
I don't feel foundation was ever at cost

167
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,500
Just some old bricks and mortar, some holes to be filled

168
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,540
This plywood and brief that can all be rebuilt

169
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,700
It's just two licks and twines, some mad sticks and plates

170
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,940
But it's all too late now, oh my God, what a waste

171
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:22,060
When I feel the ground shaking, I hear a strange sound

172
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:27,040
Hey baby, it's the end of the world, I will see you around

173
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:03,020
Affection is earthbound, our crushes of stone

174
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:07,040
These all fall away, still you're never alone

175
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,560
One mode of function, steadfast deconstruction

176
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,680
Of attachments once forged, one mode of function

177
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:13,680


178
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,460
With our fiery ramparts

179
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,440
I can't help but think, way before the big sing

180
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,660
That the streets of Atlanta's already held a stake

181
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:27,760
I can't help but know, way deep down in my soul

182
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,820
That the best is already coming, now it's time to go

183
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,980
So sign all your yearbooks, give a last glance

184
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,120
We've all missed the prom, but you're used to this dance

185
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,520
So no figureless shadow will drown out

186
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,200
the sun

187
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,420
Hey baby, it's the end of the world, I hope you have fun

188
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,060
I hope you have fun

189
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,140
I hope you have fun

190
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:43,520


191
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:13,500
I hope you have fun

192
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,500
I hope you have fun

193
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,520
I hope you have fun

194
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:43,500
I hope you have fun

195
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,660
Come as free as the flow

196
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,460
How about you?

197
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,280
Come as free as the flow

198
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,660
And the world is there to die

199
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,800
Oh, oh, oh, oh

200
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,520
Ah ha ha ha

201
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,120
Ah ha ha ha ha

202
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,040
Ah ha

203
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,180
The Rudy Schwartz Project did that song

204
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,480
Leonard Skinner Memorial Tractor Pull

205
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,300
from Bowling for Appliances,

206
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,560
praised Joe Newman,

207
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,540
and before that,

208
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,620
the incredible end-of-the-world song

209
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,640
Meltdown was by a North Texas band

210
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,220
called Slobberbone,

211
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,760
which my son turned me on to.

212
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,580
Slobberbone.

213
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,940
They're Google-able by that name,

214
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,780
Slobberbone.

215
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,560
That song is my new

216
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,220
Shorterper brain worm.

217
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,100
And now, a large view

218
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,220
of puzzling evidence.

219
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,200
Dobbs, Ferry, Dobbs.

220
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,560
Dobbs, Ferry.

221
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,480
That's your cue, caller.

222
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,580
You are Piltdown, man.

223
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,080
Go, caller.

224
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,900
Yes, just a minute.

225
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,780
Just a minute.

226
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,120
Just a minute.

227
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,820
All in the valley of death.

228
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,380
Oh, he's in the extra meditation chamber.

229
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,060
I thought so,

230
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,400
but then I thought it was the Kraken.

231
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,800
Not the Kraken.

232
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,820
They're already there.

233
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,880
Oh, yeah, I see.

234
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,660
They're next day already.

235
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,460
Hey, Kraken, that wasn't too bad.

236
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,900
You're already there.

237
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,360
Yep, he's already there.

238
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,580
Yes, if you have been there,

239
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,080
I will show you the way

240
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,340
where the air is so rare.

241
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,220
If you have been there already,

242
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,820
just stand relaxed and steadily.

243
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,820
It's very relaxing.

244
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,120
Relax, settle back,

245
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,500
and enjoy our future.

246
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,160
You can't have my people

247
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,620
to your pants, my dear friend.

248
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,580
The joy of

249
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,440
two bugs and

250
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,400
you are into that kind of stuff.

251
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,280
I've got,

252
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:41,780
like,

253
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,780
to point out that

254
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,720
none of these

255
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,540
are the official sponsors.

256
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,680
Oh, no.

257
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,400
I'm sorry, caller.

258
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,480
I had to break with a ringer.

259
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,020
And I left my

260
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,700
my big wind of

261
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,020
spinach dip

262
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,140
over at Chicken's

263
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:56,940
in the research video.

264
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,880
They're a little bit, uh,

265
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,420
under the mistaken belief

266
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,940
that there was going to be some

267
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,980
dinner service

268
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,500
or having sex with one another.

269
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,140
Oh, yeah, they're pipes, man.

270
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,580
Now I've got to go back

271
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,780
and get my spinach dip

272
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,480
while it still exists.

273
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,160
I'm feeling.

274
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,120
But on the other hand,

275
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,100
a great feeling of

276
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,080
lassitude,

277
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,880
despair,

278
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,860
and ennui

279
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,700
seems to paralyze my will

280
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,740
so that I may not make

281
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,460
a separate extra trip

282
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,200
to retrieve the spinach dip.

283
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,160
You might not want to.

284
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,740
You might not want to.

285
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,740
What, don't eat the spinach?

286
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,560
Is that what you're saying?

287
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,680
I fight to the finish

288
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,660
because I eat my spinach.

289
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:37,660
Spinach.

290
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,320
Spinach.

291
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,120
Spinach.

292
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,480
Spinach.

293
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:41,580
Spinach.

294
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:41,880
Spinach.

295
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:41,880


296
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:41,880


297
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:41,880


298
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:41,880


299
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:41,880


300
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:41,880


301
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:41,880


302
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:41,880


303
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:41,880


304
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:41,880


305
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:41,880


306
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:41,880


307
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:41,880


308
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,680
Okay, so opening up

309
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,680
and in drops the little pellet.

310
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,240
Yes.

311
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,060
Wow.

312
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,020
That's delightful.

313
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,700
And it goes with the curtains.

314
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,380
They're adorable.

315
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,720
It's so cute.

316
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,820
And that's how we feed the show.

317
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,560
Green.

318
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:52,920
Yeah.

319
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,040
So the kraken won't surge up

320
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,700
from the depths

321
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,340
and consume the entire show.

322
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,720
Might do it anyway.

323
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,740
Which would be ugly.

324
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,640
We are reading literature

325
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,220
about chair mop dogs right now.

326
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,280
These two gentlemen

327
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,680
know more about dogs

328
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,200
than I do.

329
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,220
They're going to start

330
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:11,880
some play.

331
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,700
Probably all the other

332
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,760
sub-Deenies combined.

333
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,080
Yes, and who

334
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,740
does that?

335
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,760
Calm yourself, please.

336
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,860
Okay, let's

337
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,900
throw the

338
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,900
constant sphere.

339
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,600
They're worried over there

340
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,860
about free expression.

341
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,900
I'm worried more about

342
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,780
free explosions.

343
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,100
Really?

344
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,240
They're free explosions?

345
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:37,720
Yeah.

346
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,480
They're in the sack

347
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:39,980
over here.

348
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,540
Take a pick.

349
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,080
Do you want

350
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,760
media?

351
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:41,880
Do you want media?

352
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,040
Do you want media?

353
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,680
Small or large?

354
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,440
Large.

355
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,480
Pants.

356
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:51,940
Why?

357
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,040
These large-sized

358
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,440
comics.

359
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,080
Name for Bob?

360
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,740
Yeah, I named her for Bob.

361
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,460
Celebrate seven weeks, Michael G and Swet and we took the holiday with all our friends

362
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,260
It was a time to relax and let your worries behind

363
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,400
Exactly seven weeks and something crossed my mind

364
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,180
It was the sign of the time we'd never forget

365
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,220
One morning our parents kicked us out of the bed

366
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,080
We told them it was stupid, don't play the fool

367
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,160
But the answer was shot, you gotta go to school

368
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,060
G's running up and down and everybody know

369
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,860
Rapping, rocking, popping in the street kids show

370
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,000
Michael G rocked the house and you don't know what I'm saying

371
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,980
Now when he's on a mic there will be no delaying

372
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,520
So you better run to see him in your neighborhood

373
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,420
He's rapping, rocking all the way to Hollywood

374
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,720
Hey check it out, these are the words we sing

375
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,300
Yo scream with us, we need a holiday

376
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,460
We're gonna ring-a-ring-a-dong for a holiday

377
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,460
Put your arms in the air, let me hear you say

378
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,200
We're gonna ring-a-ring-a-dong for a holiday

379
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,340
Put your arms in the air, let me hear you say

380
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,080
We're gonna ring-a-ring-a-dong for a holiday

381
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,280
Michael G and Swet were here to stay

382
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,020
We're gonna ring-a-ring-a-dong for a holiday

383
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,260
Hey check out the new song we just played

384
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,500
We are going on a

385
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,280
If you want to go you

386
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,300
Go into London and

387
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,260
Take a little piece of Amsterdam

388
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,280
We are going on a

389
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,400
If you want to go you

390
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:10,960
If you want to go you

391
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,040
Go into London and

392
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,960
Take a little piece of Amsterdam

393
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,140
I want a holiday

394
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,320
I've screamed a lot

395
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,200
Your only thing is cool

396
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,320
The only thing I've got

397
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,400
I swear it's very slow beat

398
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,220
I better know

399
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,340
Take another beat

400
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,420
Take another beat

401
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,360
What a party

402
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:45,360


403
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,040
Let me see where you're going

404
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:58,500
Ring a bell

405
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,760
What a party

406
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:01,760


407
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,680
Ring a bell

408
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,280
I'll say you're fine

409
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:03,800
Give you a call and scream some snow

410
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,420
Thank you.

411
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,160
Thank you.

412
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,340
Thank you.

413
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,740
Thank you.

414
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,440
Thank you.

415
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,160
Thank you.

416
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,460
Thank you.

417
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,420
Thank you.

418
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,300
Thank you.

419
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,060
Thank you.

420
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,640
Thank you.

421
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:35,660
Thank you.

422
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,680
Thank you.

423
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,360
Thank you.

424
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:03,980
Thank you.

425
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,280
Thank you.

426
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,200
Thank you.

427
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,980
Thank you.

428
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,080
Thank you.

429
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,500
Thank you.

430
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,000
Thank you.

431
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:12,880
Thank you.

432
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,080
Thank you.

433
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,120
The End

434
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,060
Stay с снимки!

435
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,060


436
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,780
You look ка Jeong Lsplash

437
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:33,780


438
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,640
health clubs are cluiced in the hills, jack off

439
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,060
with wet machines, smoothies, and pills.

440
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,340
The money you've wasted on your muscle tone

441
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,480
would be better spent on a coffin and stone

442
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,640
to lay you to rest in a permanent grave

443
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,680
keeping what's left, which I gladly would

444
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,720
save to pay for the futiles of assholes

445
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,600
like you and shit on your grave in the

446
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,720
fog in the dew. Shit on your

447
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,900
grave in the fog in the

448
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,580
dew, child.

449
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,360
Shit on your grave in the

450
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,460
fog in the dew, child.

451
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,360
Shit on your grave in the

452
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,200
fog in the dew, child.

453
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,140
Shit on your grave in the

454
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,900
fog in the dew, child.

455
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,960
Shit on your grave in the

456
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,840
fog in the dew, child.

457
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,140
Shib on the gravy

458
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,280
And the fog is a bit dry

459
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,860
Shib on the gravy

460
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,100
And the fog is a bit dry

461
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,680
Shib on the gravy

462
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,960
And the fog is a bit dry

463
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,640
Shib on the gravy

464
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:09,480
The Fog and the Dew and also Colgate Clean, both by the Rudy Schwartz Project.

465
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,920
That song, The Fog and the Dew, has been covered by ancient subgenius bands,

466
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,120
The Swinging Love Corpses, as well as Doctors for Bob.

467
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,420
Sorry about the censorship I had to apply for our broadcast listeners,

468
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,580
as opposed to our internet listeners and home subscribers.

469
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,400
But now, the news.

470
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,860
From PR News in Washington, I'm drooling a hole to get inside.

471
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,380
Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is suspected in Monday's explosion

472
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:40,940
that killed 25 people during a hearing of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.

473
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,780
Greenspan said there was a lot of amnesia.

474
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:47,400
Greenspan said amnesia, that is, he suggested, that is emerging.

475
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,240
He said emerging currently.

476
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,140
Greenspan led to an explosion of bad homo sub-PR news.

477
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,560
Greenspan is kept back by flammable poisonous gas.

478
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,320
On Wall Street, 2210-947.

479
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,480
Automaker General Motors reports you're listening to

480
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,040
PR News.

481
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,960
Company officials say they've scratched their asses.

482
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,160
The space shuttle Discovery has erupted in violence.

483
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:15,200
The shuttle's crew pilot reports it lost more than $4 billion in the last half of last year.

484
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,640
The seven-person crew say they can turn a profit this year.

485
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:23,960
Shuttle Commander Alan Poindexter and his crew use devices to connect to PR News.

486
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,100
Today in Washington.

487
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,000
Hello, friends, and welcome.

488
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,480
The sermon tonight...

489
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,580
is entitled...

490
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:34,720
What...

491
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:35,660
If.

492
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,900
It is called that for good reason.

493
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,700
Because, you see, everywhere I go across this great nation...

494
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,240
everywhere I tour, every performance I give...

495
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,020
some sincere but misguided Christian accosts me in the parking lot...

496
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:56,240
and barks a curse we've all heard a million times for the last 2,000 years.

497
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,680
Sinner!

498
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,240
They shriek...

499
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:05,000
with eyeballs bulging and bony finger pointing.

500
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,360
You may laugh now...

501
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,180
but come Judgment Day...

502
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,780
what if...

503
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,520
you're wrong?

504
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:24,440
If I had but a dime for every time that thinly veiled threat was hurled towards the subgenius...

505
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,160
I'd have more money than all the trial lawyers in California and New York combined.

506
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,080
laughter

507
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:37,120
Yet, as mean-spirited as this rhetorical question sounds, it is in fact a legitimate challenge.

508
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:42,020
What if, Bob forbid, we are wrong?

509
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:54,360
Such a premise is difficult for subgenies to contemplate because one of the cornerstones of good salesmanship is confidence in the product.

510
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:55,940
laughter

511
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,660
We will succeed because we know we will succeed.

512
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,640
It is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

513
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:08,720
To even question the outcome is not only defeatist and anti-Dobbsian...

514
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,620
it is subgenius sacrilege.

515
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:19,820
And yet, in the interest of open theological debate, we will consider just this once...

516
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,040
the question of what if we're wrong.

517
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:29,080
Now, theoretically speaking, not that it is statistically probable, but hypothetically imagine if you can...

518
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,160
a world come July 5th, 1998...

519
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,060
where there is no excess invasion.

520
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,240
laughter

521
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,040
Oh, it's painful, it's painful, dear friends, I understand.

522
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,620
But remember, this is only theoretical.

523
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,660
A planet that is not surrounded by an angry alien spacecraft.

524
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:56,140
A globe not littered, a globe not completely polluted with the corpses of conspiracy dupes.

525
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:56,740
laughter

526
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,040
Oh, dear friends.

527
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:00,760
laughter.

528
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,760
A sick society, still dominated by paints and normals.

529
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,720
An earth where corporations, governments and well-equipped armies still loyal to the system...

530
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,560
continue to uphold the status quo.

531
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,480
sigh

532
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,520
They fight to maintain their tight totalitarian grasp on the very throat of freedom.

533
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,620
Oh, it's a nightmarish vision indeed, one that makes my head spin.

534
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,580
But one we will contemplate nonetheless in the interest of free and open debate.

535
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:27,820
laughter

536
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,280
Yes, dear friends.

537
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,280
laughter.

538
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,860
The dark future of Dobbsian defeat and conspiracy conquest.

539
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:43,760
This desperate future where the last subgenius forces are holed up in the underground bunkers awaiting the final onslaught by conspiracy mercenaries...

540
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,640
is a vision we do not want to contemplate but will this one last time.

541
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,820
As the Kelvin bombs explode far above on the planetary surface,

542
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,860
Stey and his subgenius generals huddle beneath a flickering light bulb,

543
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:05,800
pouring over maps of subgenius tunnels, subway tunnels and underground sewers, examining any and all possible attack routes.

544
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:13,180
They will be determined, determined to fight to death and take the maximum number of normals with them.

545
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:13,960
Yeah!

546
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,280
laughter.

547
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:19,700
Why?

548
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,800
Because we hate you!

549
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,180
laughter.

550
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,300
They will be dedicated to honoring Bob through a dignified Dobbsian death.

551
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,440
It is even...

552
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:37,160
It is then that some weak of heart heretic will step forward,

553
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:41,700
probably some Bobby who always dreamed of being a real subgenius warrior for a long time.

554
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,440
But when the chips are down for Dobbs wants to cash out,

555
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:52,360
this weak-willed wannabe Bobby will show his first real courage when he steps forward and whines,

556
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:58,960
But Reverend Steyn, you promised we'd have something to show for our membership fee.

557
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,240
laughter.

558
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:04,880
The bunker will fall silent like a tomb.

559
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:09,480
The collected gas will cause the barometric pressure to plummet.

560
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,760
The bobbing above will pause in divine reverence.

561
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:18,740
Steyn will slowly turn to the trembling traitor,

562
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:22,040
glare into his frightened little face,

563
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:30,360
and with the thunder of Daniel Webster will proclaim the same answer I gave the Christian in the parking lot.

564
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,680
And that is this.

565
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:42,460
Even in hell, we'll have the one thing the conspiracy tried to deny from us all our living lives.

566
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,060
The one human right they'll never be able to take from us again,

567
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:50,680
no matter how much they lie about what we did or what they didn't do.

568
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,480
It's the one virtue Christians will never obtain,

569
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,840
no matter how much they beg, pray, or grovel to their God.

570
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,120
I'm talking about respect! Self-respect!

571
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:11,740
The only commodity that can't be bought, traded, negotiated, or stolen in any of the conspiracy marketplaces.

572
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,120
Praise Jack! Hallelujah!

573
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,380
applause.

574
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,600
It's a concept foreign to all pinks and normals who serve the system.

575
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:30,380
They may have stolen our freedom, our slack, and even our lives,

576
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,980
but by virtue of our very defiance to them and their ways,

577
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,960
we've earned a self-respect they can't even pretend to want.

578
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:37,900
And you want to know why?

579
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,080
Why?

580
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,260
Because their religion is based on submission,

581
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,500
while ours is based on independence!

582
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,080
applause.

583
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:48,920
Praise Bob!

584
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,320
applause.

585
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,040
Give me a praise Bob!

586
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,620
Praise Bob!

587
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,460
Praise Bob!

588
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:59,360
So that, dear friends, is our answer.

589
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:04,480
That's what we get even if we're wrong come Judgment Day.

590
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:10,940
The honor and dignity of self-respect earned through a lifelong fight for independence and freedom.

591
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:17,020
Only the devil could possibly resent a man for wanting to be free.

592
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:22,040
Any god that wouldn't want his followers to be free is no savior,

593
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:28,820
but a tyrant, an enslaver of souls, a devil in disguise.

594
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,420
applause.

595
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:40,040
And that leads me to my question to the Christian.

596
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,040
laughter.

597
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,540
It's terribly original, so brace yourself for it.

598
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,440
laughter.

599
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:55,140
What if, what if you're wrong come Judgment Day?

600
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:56,760
applause.

601
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,820
Please think carefully before you answer, dear friend,

602
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:07,140
because remember, your very soul dangles in the balance.

603
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,140
And that is the word of our praise Bob!

604
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:10,800
Amen!

605
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:11,700
applause.

606
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,080
Praise Father Joe Mama!

607
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:19,900
Oh yes, dear friends, praise Father Joe Mama.

608
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:26,740
A beautiful, beautiful sermon there from the Pittsburgh revival a couple of weeks ago.

609
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,380
music.

610
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,200

music.

618
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:56,420
music.

619
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,020
music.

620
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,020
Continue

621
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:06,020

00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:06,980

Have a DJ, let the bass drum go

On it!

00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:23,300
And look at me with your fingers,

645
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:24,760
I'm going to do a thyself-nake,

646

647

Screw it.

659
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:32,140
Yeah!

660
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:39,700
Marijuana.

661
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:43,860
Marijuana.

662
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:47,600
Yeah!

663
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,260
Yeah!

664
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:24,580
Say it!

665
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,480
Fuck my mom again.

666
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,000
Fuck your mom again.

667
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,120
Boys, we don't have to be so quick.

668
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:00,680
Be so quick.

669
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,240
Be so quick.

670
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:01,840
Be so quick.

671
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:02,400
Be so quick.

672
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:02,960
Be so quick.

673
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:03,100

Be so quick.

676
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,060
Be so quick.

677
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:11,560
That hardcore edit called Who is Behind the Mask is by The Large, under his other musical

678
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,180
name, Schranz Ferdinand.

679
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:18,200
Not normal for an hour of slack, but I like it.

680
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,680
I like hardcore techno.

681
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:24,560
Princess We Are Doe, to whom I am consort, does not like hardcore techno.

682
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,400
She says it sounds to her like a marching band.

683
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:29,700
Drives her crazy.

684
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:34,180
Of course, she's usually hearing it from downstairs, so it's just a muffled dub.

685
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:36,900
Eh, princesses, what you gonna do?

686
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:42,000
You are listening to The Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

687
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:48,840
For more information, you can check out subgenius.com, which goes on forever.

688
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,360
The music in the background here is by Perry Kingsley.

689
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,540
And now to close the show off.

690
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:58,740
I'm gonna run a prolonged inside joke that you might enjoy even if you're outside.

691
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:08,640
Reverend Susie the Floozy created a...mix in which she drops the names of all the subgeniuses

692
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:15,360
currently utilizing the secret internet forum Scrub Genius, which was started up by Reverend

693
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:23,200
Tater Gumphreys of Kern's Holler when alt-dot slack became so top-heavy with pink coots

694
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:30,700
that we needed a kook-proof forum where the real subgenie could gossip about the unreal

695
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:35,760
non-subgenie without being flooded or otherwise de-enslackin'.

696
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,880
Anyway, it's one of those tours de-forcing.

697
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,680
Susie, take it away.

698
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,380
I wanna tell y'all about Kern's Holler.

699
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:50,680
Kern's Holler's the nicest little whorehouse you ever...wait a minute, that's the wrong

700
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,120
intro.

701
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:58,200
It's the nicest little piece of land you'd ever wanna find up in the hill country in

702
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,080
Internetville.

703
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:00,840
Oh yeah.

704
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:04,840
There's this good-hearted guy named Dr. Tater Gumphreys.

705
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:12,280
He's kinda somewhere halfway between a brilliant lunatic and a crack-pop visionary and a feed-shoveling

706
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:12,620
guru.

707
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:18,280
And Kern's Holler's where he set up this kinda artist colony and game preserve for subgenius

708
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:18,980
freaks.

709
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,820
It's way out in the cyber sticks and it's high security.

710
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:28,660
So everyone can let their freak flags fly without no trolls or national guardsmen to

711
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:29,600
ruin our vibe.

712
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:35,420
Anyhow, I dropped in at the farmhouse the other day looking for Tater and I couldn't

713
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:36,240
find him nowhere.

714
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:43,720
Doc Holocaust and Xanatos, Satanicos Bombasticos and Dr. Dark were all busy chatting in the

715
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,200
kitchen over milk and cookies.

716
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,060
I don't know who that is.

717
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,320
They didn't know where he was.

718
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,000
I don't know, man.

719
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:53,180
In the entertainment room, Dr. Phineas Narka was hanging out with Nico and Nikki and Narka.

720
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:53,180


721
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:53,180


722
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:53,180


723
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:57,320
I don't know who they were.

724
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:12,380
I think they were watching The Good gleiche drip'd Love for Hilarious Meal...

725
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:15,980
I'll be darned if I don't know what they were saying when I sectioned the list out.

726
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:16,700
And of course, ongreat să chef Michael, shh that's my name, and the anyway it is Jennifer

727
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:21,000
Stank and Christoph Michael, maybehodef���選en each dank weeding isde

728
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:21,320
much.

729
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:25,300
and hell, they was both losing somehow to crazy Reverend Jim Jones.

730
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:29,220
I stepped over Reverend Andre Gravel and Reverend Dr. Crash

731
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:32,700
and made my way onto the lawn where Reverend Anna Dynamite's

732
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:37,260
Kernthaler Ladies Garden Club and Splatterfilm Appreciation Society meeting was underway.

733
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,840
As I panned around the assemblage looking for Tater,

734
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:46,360
I could see Tula, Ubiquitous, and Subgenius Spice and Reverend Popa's pockets were there,

735
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,000
but then it morphed into a Manchurian candidate, Cyclorama,

736
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,600
Dr. Mr. Sister, and White Ruffled Madam Spidey-Trag,

737
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:58,280
and then his face erupted into Hideous Rictus, and he was laughing, laughing, laughing.

738
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:03,040
What is it with the laughing today? I gotta get out of here and fight Tater.

739
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:06,260
I fell to the ground and crawled out between everyone's legs,

740
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:08,500
and when I was clear, I just broke into a run.

741
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:13,940
There was a shimmer of gossamer wings, and Popa's pantyhara fluttered past.

742
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,660
I didn't know she could fly, but I had a feeling she didn't realize it either,

743
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,700
so I didn't distract.

744
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:23,840
St. Reverend Alex strolled by, and I was about to ask him about Tater,

745
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:26,980
when all of a sudden a lightning bolt hit right between us,

746
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,800
and then there was his truly laughs and the sound of high fives.

747
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:35,040
It was Reverend Ramona backing on up, and Priestess Pisces,

748
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:40,640
holed up in a futuristic treehouse, shooting lightning bolts off their fingertips for a kiss.

749
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:45,300
My broken field ran out of range as it ebbed with me with taser shots.

750
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:46,720
Oh, girls.

751
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,860
Then I almost damn near stepped on Gleep,

752
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:50,400
the hen.

753
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,300
She was running past like a chicken with its hat off,

754
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:56,320
and then I almost stepped on Curtis, who'd lit after her,

755
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,380
and then come a whole pastel of ferrets with Paul Jamison

756
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:03,000
trying like hell to get him back in his pockets before they got to Gleepy.

757
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:07,980
Oh, that noise knocked me back into the big mushroom in the middle of the yard.

758
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:15,540
Chuck Key and Bob Corr and Dr. Topper come falling off the top of a laughing worsen stank.

759
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:19,280
I cussed and kicked a shroom, only here come Reverend Quaalude,

760
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:19,980
and I'm going to get you.

761
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:19,980


762
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:19,980


763
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:19,980


764
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:19,980


765
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:19,980


766
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:19,980


767
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:19,980


768
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,020
I'm down, too, and he almost pancaked me.

769
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:22,760
Oh, what?

770
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,340
Meanwhile, out on the giant fire ant mound,

771
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:31,400
Ankara and Embidger and Artemia Salina and Zapanes were discussing the finer points of kook baiting

772
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:35,880
over a wailing, screechy, alt-slack kook who they'd crucified on the anthill.

773
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:40,060
I went over and watched the hideous, greasy thing monkey dance for a while,

774
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,460
but I had to go.

775
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:46,480
I had a mission, and Reverend Diva Schematic was up on the towering plinth drawing.

776
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,600
I yelled up, tried to ask her if she'd seen Tater,

777
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:49,900
but...

778
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,580
Little Theodore was on the other plinth playing loud as a bastard,

779
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,180
and on the third plinth, Reverend Baylor Trucks was playing loud as a son of a bitch.

780
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,340
But then I got snarled on the cables lying around on the ground.

781
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:05,720
DJ Shaver and Two Beans and Maynard Brainerd were wiring up the plinths,

782
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,720
which it turned out were colossal speakers 20 feet high.

783
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:13,340
I backed off and ran like hell before they could plug those suckers in.

784
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,780
Oh, in the shed, Leonard the Committed and Rock Roswell and the sicker Vicar and Patter Nostril were shooting,

785
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,400
with the dead Dr. Legume's knuckle bones.

786
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:26,240
Though Dr. Legume wasn't dead yet, but that didn't stop him.

787
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:35,080
Witchfinder Colonel Christopher Lee had set up a portable cocktail bar to cash in on the action and was popping the tops off of some sub-Genesis homebrews with an evil grin,

788
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:39,540
only the Reverend Dr. Mabotami had the balls enough to coiff it then.

789
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:44,400
A jeep sped by, driven by five satages of Reverend Suds riding shotgun.

790
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,920
They were on patrol, making sure Kern's holler was secure,

791
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:49,980
with Agent Lloyd riding high,

792
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,080
I on back, leafily fingering the trigger of that huge swivel-mounted machine gun.

793
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:55,480
I know I felt safe.

794
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:01,680
Out in the woods nearby, Rasta Billy Bob and his primate were having a sweet romantic moment.

795
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:05,400
They sat on a throne made of stacks of ancient books,

796
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:08,380
and a huge snowy owl sat above them.

797
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:11,060
Flames reflected in his unblinking eye.

798
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:14,500
The fire came from a pile of burning books.

799
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,760
The flames sputtered a bit.

800
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:21,000
The owl grasped a copy of Pilgrim's Progress in its talons

801
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,920
and flew over the flames and dropped it on the pyre while the happy couple laughed.

802
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:32,640
In the barnyard, Reverend Bork Cowcatch and Reverend Johnboy were practicing their human pyramid thing

803
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,560
with the livestock for the Tri-County Fair up in Humber.

804
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:41,060
Oh, they's coming along real fine, but I think this boar's ought to be putting the bulls on the bottom.

805
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,560
I made damn sure I didn't distract them.

806
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,740
I strolled on into the barnyard.

807
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,240
And that's when I saw it.

808
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,120
Oh, the thing you cannot unsee.

809
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,980
It was that international sex bandit, James Spurter.

810
00:56:56,200 --> 00:57:01,860
And he was fornicating with Tater's Prize Livestock Crossbreeding Experiment.

811
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:03,900
The hog to bust.

812
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:10,060
And the other ice-sweet toilet pepper was obligingly holding its head wherever the hell that was.

813
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:16,740
And Reverend Angry Larry and Bull Zombie was eagerly filming it all for the next installment of the day.

814
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:17,840
And I was like, oh, my God, this is a dead Dave show.

815
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:18,720
Oh, yeah.

816
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:22,880
And leaning against this tall wall and drinking another sub-gibbon.

817
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,040
It was Dr. Lepotomy again.

818
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:29,660
Just because he'd won his damn name to be mentioned twice, the egomaniac.

819
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:32,560
Anyhow, I never did find Tater.

820
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,680
But that was my own damn fault.

821
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:40,300
I stayed and did some hog to bust with the rest of them until the smell got to be too bad.

822
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,980
So at least tonight wasn't a total wash.

823
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,020
Good night.

824
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:47,240
Good night, Seekers.

825
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:51,100
And thanks for the music, Rastabilly Bob.

826
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:57,040
Still tastes like bacon sushi.

827
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:03,660
Thank you, Susie.

828
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,040
And now, the Psychoskeletons.

829
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,480
J HYLYAU!

830
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:24,360
Don't drink.

831
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:24,740
Dan washed his beat for good, Lord Arnold.

832
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:31,340
Oberlin got owes, But Brachim and Bence will die.

833
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:35,240
HA HA HA HA, Shdooch, Where's your tupperwaist?

834
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:35,720
It's fake passes.

835
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,480
U

836
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,040
.

837
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:37,340
Shut up.

838
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,260
You.

839
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:44,620
Thank you.

840
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,860
Thank you.

841
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:51,420
Thank you.

842
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,280
Thank you.
