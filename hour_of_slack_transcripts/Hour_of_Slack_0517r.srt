1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
And I guess we can proceed, thank you.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,660
And to myself, well, praise Bob.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,240
I guess the kids have learned to think faster

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,740
due to television commercials, MTV,

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,200
and such like, a heavy, fast hour of slack.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,740
It was a 20-foot slender and incredibly fast...

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,260
Self-genius hour of slack.

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,660
That looks very inviting, Mr. Hobbs.

9
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,980
Why don't you take a bite?

10
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,560
A bite? How about a little lick?

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,680
The gaping mouth was almost on me when...

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,140
Oh, take it deeper.

13
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,540
Oh, yeah, that's it.

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,600
You keep like that?

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,400
I hope he swallows it.

16
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,640
He'll be back tonight in our dreams.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Enjoy this one.

18
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,120
Tell me about it. Tell me what you like.

19
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,500
Oh, it's so good.

20
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,600
But I don't think he liked the way you taste it.

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,660
Sounds primitive, doesn't it?

22
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,620
We're all primitive deep down, Pete.

23
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,540
Rock!

24
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:24,960
Rock!

25
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:25,480


26
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,360
Rock!

27
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,080
Rock!

28
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,380


29
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,480
Rock!

30
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,600
Rock!

31
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:29,780


32
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:31,500
Rock!

33
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:31,680
Rock!

34
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:32,380
Rock!

35
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:32,380


36
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:32,380


37
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:32,380


38
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:32,380


39
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:32,380


40
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:32,380


41
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:32,380


42
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:32,380


43
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:32,380


44
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:32,380


45
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:32,380


46
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:32,380


47
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:32,380


48
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:32,380


49
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:32,380


50
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:32,380


51
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:32,380


52
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:32,380


53
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:32,380


54
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,980
Sounds primitive, doesn't it?

55
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,700
I know this will sound funny to a scientist.

56
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,780
Okay, and now...

57
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,860
That thing's still running.

58
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,580
What have we got here?

59
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:50,840
Oh!

60
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,120
Okay.

61
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,440
Oh, yeah.

62
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,200
The psoriasis doctors.

63
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,960
The psoriasis doctors.

64
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,640
Here is the famous movie star Ronald Reagan

65
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,100
speaking from St. John's Hospital in California.

66
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,500
Thanks, and even though I am broadcasting from a hospital,

67
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,920
it gives me a bang.

68
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,520
One day when Bob was a youngster,

69
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,140
he was playing with a bunch of kids in the freight yards in his hometown.

70
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,400
Surely Bob...

71
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,240
Bob...

72
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,600
For days he lingered between life and death.

73
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,480
Bob...

74
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,500
He'll be all right.

75
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,060
Bob opened his eyes, and Bob opened his eyes,

76
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,720
and everybody agreed that Bob would make good in his new field.

77
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,880
For this is the strange story...

78
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,420
For days he lingered between life and death.

79
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,380
Bob decided...

80
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,340
Bob...

81
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,360
, Bob...

82
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,140
More slack coming up.

83
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,480
More slack coming up, friends.

84
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,640
Speaking of good...

85
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,800
Here's some good Christmas news.

86
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,620
This is from Puzzling Evidence News Service.

87
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,300
Well, this is going to be a newsy show.

88
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,860
Some music, some news.

89
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,620
No theme, no problem with Bob.

90
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,000
Parachuting Christmas elf hits car, breaks leg.

91
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,960
Hundreds watch as shootist misses target.

92
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,100
Quincy, Massachusetts, a parachutist dressed as one of Santa's elves.

93
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,860
lost control and landed on a moving car in front of hundreds of spectators at a Christmas festival.

94
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:35,420
Bob Humphrey of Holbrook, police said Bob Humphrey was falling at about 30 miles an hour

95
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,180
in his elf suit when he hit the car and bounced into the street.

96
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,480
Humphrey, 39, spent Sunday night at Quincy Hospital where he was treated for a broken knee,

97
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,080
broken leg, and bruises.

98
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,560
Parachutists dressed as Santa Claus and other elves landed safely.

99
00:03:50,680 --> 00:04:05,760
Oh, wow. I mean, like, you know, it's time for the, um, I just had it, um, oh, wow, um,

100
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:16,520
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, the, uh, the, uh, the Gottlieb, no, um, Ginsberg, uh, yeah, wow,

101
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,580
that's, uh, the Ginsberg moment, uh.

102
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:27,040
Like, um, I keep trying to think back, you know, and I can't really, uh, really get it sometimes.

103
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,540
It's kind of confusing.

104
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,580
But I remember occasionally.

105
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,440
Beautiful bride.

106
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,400
And today we...

107
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,700
Oh, I'm sorry, are you on the air? I beg your pardon.

108
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,060
Wow, man, like, what's, what's happening?

109
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,820
May I sit down here? Are you the DJ, sir?

110
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,440
Um, yeah, wow, man.

111
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,380
What do you want?

112
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,720
I, I feel as if I'm, I'm flashing back.

113
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,700
No, man, it's me that's flashing back. What are you doing? Who are you?

114
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:08,820
My name is Tirebiter. Someone asked me if I would come today to, to, uh, help you on your radio program,

115
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,320
but they didn't say that your eyes would be so strange.

116
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,520
Well, that's good coffee, Doug.

117
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,320
Uh-oh.

118
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,420
Yeah, that's right. It's time.

119
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,760
For Muzzly Definites Presents.

120
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,680
It's 4.30. Time for that big old mug of work.

121
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,500
Ain't nothing better than a good cup of coffee, I'm telling you.

122
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,960
Especially this. It's a great, big, manly cup of coffee, you know.

123
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,560
That's why we need more doctors.

124
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,300
Drinking manly, manly cups of coffee.

125
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,760
And that's what I think you ought to tell all those listeners out there on your show, Doug.

126
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,660
Tell them to drink more manly coffee.

127
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,860
I remember that time in Mozambique, Douglas, yes.

128
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,700
We were on the beach in Mozambique, I guess it was in 48.

129
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,060
Beautiful country. Portuguese had things well in hand then.

130
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,120
Remember, we sat in Hotel Balneario, it was called.

131
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,240
The resort hotel, yes.

132
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,280
There were fireflies down on the beach, it seems to be called in Mozambique.

133
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,560
They come out at sunset or thereabouts.

134
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,420
And the women, ah yes, the women strolling.

135
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,120
Their flounce skirts and their bright eyes and their dark, smoldering, tropical flesh.

136
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,740
Ah, yes, Douglas.

137
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,380
Those were the days, the old subgenius days.

138
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:03,600
Now we sit sadly in our little old high rises, toothless doctors, nail-less doctors.

139
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,540
Ah, thinking about the old days.

140
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,680
Those were the days, doctor, those were the days.

141
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,400
Back when the church was just a bad joke and a quick lip fart on everyone's face.

142
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,900
Yes, back before money and contracts and being famous.

143
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,900
And people like artists became members, yes.

144
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:42,440
This was back before the lives crept into things.

145
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,920
Back before.

146
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:54,340
The structure of the church was unwholesomely chipped away piece by piece.

147
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:59,440
By a sniveling group of art snots.

148
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:08,540
Blind about things like pain and hunger and suffering and disillusionment and betrayal.

149
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:14,120
Oh, the world is such an awful place.

150
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,520
And thus was sin brought in to the church.

151
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,020
Lies became part of the litany.

152
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,160
And all has perished.

153
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,820
But it was a worthy time at one time.

154
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,440
Perhaps it shall come again.

155
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,340
The End

156
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:43,940
The End

157
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,560
The End

158
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:44,900
The End

159
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:44,900


160
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:44,900


161
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:44,900


162
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:44,900


163
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:44,900


164
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:44,900


165
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:44,900


166
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:44,900


167
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:44,900


168
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:44,900


169
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:44,900


170
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:44,900


171
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:44,900


172
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,400
The End

173
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,820
Well, maybe at 6 AM it will return.

174
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,340
But for now, you're in the clutches of the show.

175
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,760
Heh, heh, heh.

176
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,240
Hmm, hmm.

177
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,740
So, have that mug of work.

178
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,680
Sit back and enjoy as we tell you a little tale.

179
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,620
Watch out!

180
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,840
Oh, thank you, puzzling evidence.

181
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,620
Look, I just want to tell you, I've been listening to these show tapes.

182
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,720
These are some of the best show tapes you have ever done.

183
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:20,000
Man, it's really, it's starting to un-jones on my show tape pick.

184
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,000
Now I'm coming down a little bit, man.

185
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,380
I feel much, much better.

186
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,580
Whoo!

187
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,260
Hey!

188
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,420
Hey, I'm stretching.

189
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,360
I'm a man.

190
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,680
I'm a manly man.

191
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,100
And I believe in doing manly things with myself.

192
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:36,580
Yep.

193
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:42,240
All the equipment in the world, and you can't lock it up.

194
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,660
Can't lock the sound of the picture.

195
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,900
You've got to go by time code.

196
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:55,280
Can't just have simple manly gears and sprockets physically linked together.

197
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,140
No, no.

198
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,200
Got to do it with electron signals.

199
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,140
A zillion, trillion little electron signals.

200
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,800
One of them gets stepped on, and the whole thing's out of sync.

201
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,740
Well, of course, Doug, our helicopters are dropping like flies.

202
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,560
The Saudis have a sub-nuclear bomb.

203
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,520
The price of gasoline still goes up.

204
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,700
Congress can't come up with a budget.

205
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,500
George Bush looks like the wimpy Ed.

206
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,620
John Sununu revealed to be a fat dork.

207
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,760
It's amazing, isn't it?

208
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,700
Yes.

209
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,860
And meanwhile...

210
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,960
What is the real story, Guy?

211
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,620
The air gets worse.

212
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,260
The water becomes filthier every day.

213
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,900
The topsoil is blowing away or washing away.

214
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,060
And down chemical-laden rivers.

215
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:54,620
It wasn't polluted with chemicals when it was removed from the countryside.

216
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:01,020
It's polluted with chemicals by the time it finally becomes sediment at the mouth of some big river.

217
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:07,700
It's all going to hell in a handbasket, and it's going really fast.

218
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:13,280
And it's just something that happened while we all watched.

219
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,760
The Big Show.

220
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,820
Because they told us the Big Show was what was up there on Wall Street.

221
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,340
They told us what was the Big Show was up there on the movie screen.

222
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,680
They told us what was the Big Show was on the television programming.

223
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,140
They told us what was the Big Show was the World Series and the Super Bowl.

224
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,920
And the Fall Fashion.

225
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,320
They told us it was the new cars.

226
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,580
They told us it was the hydroplanes.

227
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,900
They told us it was the jet.

228
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,560
They told us it was jet skis.

229
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,460
They told us it was safety belts and inflation bags.

230
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,920
They told us it was labor unions and pension schemes.

231
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,660
They told us it was all sorts of things.

232
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,000
But they never told us it was what was right outside our door.

233
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:11,140
They never told us the Big Picture was the air, the water, the earth, and the sunshine.

234
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,120
But that's all it was.

235
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:14,880
A big show.

236
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,660
A ball of dirt.

237
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:20,100
With a skin of moisture and a rind of air being driven.

238
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,580
By the heat of a burning, collapsing nuclear gas bag.

239
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,300
No, they told us there were all sorts of things going on and not to worry.

240
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,420
And we didn't worry.

241
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,780
Nobody worried.

242
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,560
No, sir.

243
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,460
Keep the taxes down.

244
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,880
Everybody can have five of everything.

245
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,020
We're an example to the world.

246
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,460
We're an example to the world.

247
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:51,860
Then one day we turned around and found that people are dying by the thousands.

248
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,540
From diseases that didn't exist 50 years ago.

249
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,380
We find the air is filthy.

250
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,300
The water is putrid.

251
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,360
The land is being turned back into a desert.

252
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,500
And there's still the same old game going on upstairs.

253
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,640
The same greed.

254
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,500
The same intolerance.

255
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,140
The same religious and political bigotry.

256
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,720
The same alpha prime monkey men playing games.

257
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,520
While all around us the world goes to hell and can't move.

258
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,380
Watch out.

259
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,420
I mean, what does that have to do with hurting him real bad?

260
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,480
It's all I can say.

261
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:44,480


262
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:44,480


263
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:44,480


264
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:44,480


265
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:44,480


266
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,380
It's just show time for the show, folks.

267
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,700
And learn how to buck the giants in every way you can.

268
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,320
You'll always be vulnerable to competition from the giants.

269
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,880
You've got to accept other realities.

270
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,180
You surrender.

271
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,460
For example, you surrender.

272
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,480
For example, when you cannot hope to win.

273
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,180
What do you do?

274
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:08,740
You surrender.

275
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,200
For example...

276
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,260
APFP in...

277
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,620
All over everything.

278
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,600
Oh, I'll get it.

279
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,060
I think it's Bob.

280
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,040
It was Bob.

281
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:16,500
It was Bob.

282
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,620
Oh, never mind.

283
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,000
I'll get it.

284
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,840
You mean Bob Dots or whatever that was?

285
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,080
Yeah, the cheap guy.

286
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,440
Bob had promised to keep him posted.

287
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,520
Okay, then what happened?

288
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,120
Well, from killer to post he was...

289
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,600
Thanks, Bob.

290
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,520
Oh, thank you, Puzzling Evidence.

291
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,300
Thank you, Joe.

292
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:29,820
Thanks, Bob.

293
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,680
Thanks, Bob.

294
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,480
Thanks, Hal.

295
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,800
And mean old curmudgeonly Sir Guyon de Cruel.

296
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,880
Action question number 43.

297
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,500
Bob, I'm sorry for you, Hal.

298
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,500
No easy pass.

299
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:37,500


300
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,280
Oh, that's Mitch Green from Paul Axel's office.

301
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:41,680
And then see which one pulled best.

302
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,560
Stop the advertisement.

303
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:43,600
Okay.

304
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:43,600


305
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,660
So the advertising stopped.

306
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:47,960
Thanks, Bob.

307
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:48,840
Thanks, Bob.

308
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,520
Is that a lie there?

309
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,280
The lie of the land or the lay of the land over there, that little thing?

310
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,680
I think you've missed the point.

311
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,200
It's not the environment.

312
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,160
It's the communist jubilee.

313
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,420
Yeah, it's pretty until the chainsaws and skill saws and rip saws and band saws all

314
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,340
get together and...

315
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,640
Wow, look.

316
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,400
They're cutting down the flowers.

317
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,360
It's the saw symphony.

318
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,460
Oh, wow.

319
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,100
Oh, wow.

320
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,100


321
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,180
Oh, wow.

322
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:13,180


323
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:13,180


324
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:13,180


325
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:13,180


326
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:13,180


327
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:13,180


328
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:13,180


329
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:13,180


330
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:13,180


331
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:13,180


332
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:13,240
Oh, wow.

333
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:13,880
Wow.

334
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,000
What happened to Hal?

335
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
It turned into a...

336
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:16,540
Whoa!

337
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,180
Whoa!

338
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:17,720
Whoa!

339
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,440
Whoa!

340
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,200
Oh, look at that.

341
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,060
Ew.

342
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,620
Ew.

343
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:20,720
Ew.

344
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:20,940
Ew.

345
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:21,760
Sticky.

346
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,400
Oh, is my face red?

347
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,300
We can get our way out of here.

348
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:25,800
Come on, let's go.

349
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,480
Oh, I suppose so.

350
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:27,880
Whoa!

351
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,320
Aunt Bertha!

352
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,160
Come on, look this way.

353
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,380
That's only a statue of Aunt Bertha.

354
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,860
I'm not afraid of her a bit.

355
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,360
Why, she could be standing right behind me and I'd...

356
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:40,960
Whoa, geez.

357
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,940
I'm behind you, Hal.

358
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,900
Oh, jeez.

359
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:43,620
Sorry.

360
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,760
R-r-really?

361
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,740
I drank too much too, here.

362
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:47,540
Whoa!

363
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,220
Oh yeah, Aunt Bertha, run, run, run, run!

364
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,280
Come back here, you nasty little boy.

365
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,580
Wait, in here, in here, in here.

366
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,800
No, no, in here, in here.

367
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,800
Oh, what do I do?

368
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm gonna get you good.

369
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,320
I'm gonna get you good.

370
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
Hey, how's the show?

371
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,400
What show? What show?

372
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,260
What show?

373
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,120
What show?

374
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:26,720
...back there, errs, or some of them wake up naked in the next county

375
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,460
or surrounded by broken bottles.

376
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,480
I wonder how the hell you got there, errs, or...

377
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,100
Ah!

378
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,900
Oh, almost hit the wrong button there.

379
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,980
Yeah, this station would have been...

380
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,200
...blown sky high.

381
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,480
Uh, and, uh, the, uh, the prolonged rant,

382
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,460
in case it was what puzzling evidence and Dr. Howell were saying wasn't clear,

383
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:58,600
that was G. Gordon Gordon doing the long, cynical, depressed, sad rant.

384
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:03,520
But I don't know why our good friend G. Gordon Gordon should be so sad,

385
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,760
because there's so much funny news out there.

386
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,000
Um, uh, and...

387
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:13,600
And I'm going to read you some more news stories, dear friends, this time,

388
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:20,820
from, uh, the News of the Weird, only this is a book called More News of the Weird

389
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,800
that just came out from, uh, Chuck Shepherd,

390
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,380
uh, sent to us personally by Dr. Shepherd.

391
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,660
And, uh, it's, it's, um, uh, available, certainly.

392
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,600
Uh, simple, simple enough to find.

393
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,200
And you'll...

394
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,700
Yeah, plume books. You'll love it.

395
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,400
For instance, this one chapter here, The Last Days of the Planet.

396
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,880
Now, if G. Gordon Gordon's rant wasn't enough to depress you pretty well,

397
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,520
how, how about some of these little bits of information?

398
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,900
In 1988, an ABC TV poll of, uh, 17-year-olds,

399
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:04,860
one girl answered that the Holocaust was that Jewish holiday last week, right?

400
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,300
Another thought the Ayatollah was a Soviet gymnast.

401
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:14,700
And yet another thought Chernobyl was Cher's full name.

402
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,120
Uh...

403
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,720
Uh...

404
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,520
Begin to see why he called this chapter Last Days of the Planet.

405
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:20,900
Whoop!

406
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,400
And it must be the last days.

407
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,860
Because a sex educator, uh, told a Florida House of Representatives committee in 1989

408
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:34,400
that some high school boys were playing a game in which the winner would be the one

409
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,060
who fathers the most children during the school year.

410
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:47,800
A fore, forewarning of a decline in morality, civic leaders and parents in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,

411
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,780
had to quell a fad in 1986 in which children banded together dressed as Michael Jackson,

412
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,860
mimicked his movements and marauded through the city and suburbs causing disturbances.

413
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,040
Boys were wearing rouge and lipstick.

414
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:07,000
I can see how the Ethiopian parents would be a bit worried.

415
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,760
A 1987 Philo-

416
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,120
Next, next year it'll be, uh, Bart Sensen kids, I guess.

417
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:19,980
In a 1987 Philadelphia Inquirer story on college's spring break in Fort Lauderdale reported on

418
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:25,780
a stupid tricks contest in which contestants flouted national concern over the spreading of AIDS.

419
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:31,940
In one, six men from Penn State brushed their teeth in turn with the second using the district.

420
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:36,920
The first man was charged from the first brushing until the sixth man drank the remainder.

421
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,620
Holy Cross was the crowd favorite.

422
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,160
I guess that's the name of the game.

423
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:47,760
Uh, the name for a stunt in which one student vomited into the other's mouth said,

424
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,240
the master of ceremonies we're all here to have fun.

425
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,840
Graduation exercises were canceled at Fairview Pennsylvania High School in 1988

426
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,340
because of fears that several students might try to commit suicide.

427
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:02,980
On stage.

428
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,300
I should mention that towards the back of the, the weird news book,

429
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:13,420
uh, the authors, uh, defend the fact that they include,

430
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,740
well, like for, they have a hypothetical inter, uh, exchange between the,

431
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,280
let's say the listener and the author's listener.

432
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,940
Hey, what about that chicken story where the farmer had sex with the chicken

433
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,040
then tied her up with little leather leg cuffs?

434
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,540
I suppose you think that's funny.

435
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,320
I suppose you think mass murder is funny.

436
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,160
I bet you think husbands beating up their wives is funny.

437
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,440
Authors say, nope.

438
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,380
In fact, we've often included such stories because they aren't funny.

439
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,760
We were shocked by them.

440
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,760
They make us shake our heads in disbelief.

441
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,880
Listener, well, if you feel that way, you shouldn't be saying that stuff.

442
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,080
You're just going to encourage all those psychos.

443
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,260
No telling what kinds of things they'll be doing.

444
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,380
Authors, maybe, but the research doesn't show that.

445
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,140
It is possible that a very few potential psychos will gain confidence in their pathologies by,

446
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,060
uh, reading news or hearing news of what other people have done.

447
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,560
But murders and mutilations and animal abuse are such grotesque behaviors

448
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,980
that they can hardly be learned from reading books.

449
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:14,600
There are very weird people in this country and on this planet.

450
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:20,040
Um, he goes on to mention that after years of sifting through data like these,

451
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:26,440
one gets the chilling feeling that someone is trying to tell us something.

452
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,200
But our only recourse is to continue to collect the data.

453
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,260
Ask anyone who collects this stuff.

454
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,780
Not one of us has any idea what it all means.

455
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,240
Weird news must pass as its own reward.

456
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,380
However, we find ourselves on a different track from the Forteans.

457
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:50,420
Sure, we want to read the report about the giant bat-like creature seen in some remote part of the country.

458
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,960
And please, if you have such a clip, kindly send it to us.

459
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,080
But we're more interested in people who worship giant bat-like creatures

460
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,320
or who want to marry giant bat-like creatures.

461
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,180
That is the point.

462
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,600
The point is, we view ourselves mainly as recorders of human behavior.

463
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,900
Why did the guys on the overpass think it was a good idea to drop concrete chunks on passing cars?

464
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:14,240
Better still, why is there an entire village of people in India that, every year,

465
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,680
stops what it's doing and spends the next 24 hours throwing rocks at each other,

466
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,000
attempting to kill or maim as many people as possible?

467
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:26,480
And then, after 24 hours exactly, seizes fire, nurses the wounded, and buries the dead?

468
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:26,880
Hmm?

469
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,780
At the very least, the study of strangeness gives us all faith

470
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,380
that we're personally not so peculiar.

471
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,600
Our work gives us the opportunity to tell ourselves,

472
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,620
I thought I was a little strange, but then again,

473
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,940
I never stood on the front lawn wrapped in aluminum foil to ward off gamma rays.

474
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,600
And even if you did do that, friend, there's still something in our books and this show

475
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,860
to make you feel better about yourself.

476
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,240
And maybe that's the legacy of Weirdology.

477
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,900
More of which is as follows.

478
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:03,520
A survey of 1,500 Australians released on International Women's Day in 1988

479
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,240
revealed that one-fifth of Australian men believe it is acceptable to kick or beat a wife

480
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,700
if she disobeys or fails to keep house clean.

481
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,200
And a Rhode Island...

482
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,320
Whoops. Switch music out.

483
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,560
And a Rhode Island Rape Crisis Center survey in 1988

484
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:26,600
revealed that 24% of 7th to 9th grade boys and 16% of the girls

485
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,160
believe it is acceptable for a man to force a woman to have sex

486
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,760
if he has spent money on her.

487
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:39,000
The figures went up to 65% and 47% if the couple had been dating for six months or more.

488
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,160
I guess that's more okay.

489
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,360
According, of course, not to, we at the Church of the Subgenius,

490
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,900
because we ain't gonna tell you what to do.

491
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:48,760
Uh...

492
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,360
Oh, I can't read this one.

493
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,580
The horrible reason for the extinction of the last herd of wild elephants

494
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,960
in Thailand...

495
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,860
Well, I'm reading it anyway.

496
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,220
...where they're in danger of extinction from hunters seeking the males'

497
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,040
um...

498
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,500
uh...procreative organs, let's say, for making Chinese aphrodisiacs.

499
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,520
These weigh around 44 pounds and sell for about 10 bucks a pound.

500
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,740
Ha ha ha.

501
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,200
And, uh...

502
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,220
Under the chapter, The Voices in My Head,

503
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,220
uh...

504
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:30,960
Aaron Strydom, a 23-year-old ex-police officer in South Africa,

505
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,400
went camping and meditated...

506
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,480
No, I don't want to read that one. That one's just too...

507
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,220
This isn't a good time for that.

508
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,040
A member of the Outlaws Motorcycle Gang in Tennessee,

509
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,300
Arthur Gary Volz, confessed to the murder of his go-go dancer girlfriend,

510
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:50,440
saying that he was a German general and that when he killed her he was acting on orders.

511
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,860
A truck driver testified at the trial that he was parked along I-40

512
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,560
the night of the murder, when Volz, a former police officer, said,

513
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:00,120
that he had approached him and said that he needed orders to kill someone.

514
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,780
Michael Trofimov pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity in the murder of his father.

515
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,420
Trofimov, who had recently joined a religious group,

516
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,820
was found with his hands around his father's neck,

517
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,880
speaking in tongues and screaming for God.

518
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,080
His uncle said,

519
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,180
he was a good young man, and then he started going to these religious meetings.

520
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,440
His uncle also noted that the night before the murder,

521
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,760
Michael apparently drove his car into a train,

522
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,240
and that that, quote,

523
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,380
really triggered him off, unquote.

524
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,500
The jury at Thomas Lee Bonney's trial for the 1987 murder of his daughter,

525
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,980
Carol Bonney, in North Carolina,

526
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:47,080
watched videotapes of the defendant assuming the voices of multiple personalities while hypnotized.

527
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:51,120
A psychiatrist diagnosed ten separate personalities in Bonney.

528
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,260
The one known as Satan said,

529
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,540
I know everything. I am strong.

530
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,900
I control Tom.

531
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,180
He's dumb.

532
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,200
A wimp.

533
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,060
A goody-goody talking that Jesus garbage all the time.

534
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,440
On the night of her murder,

535
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,700
Carol and her father argued over a love letter to a boyfriend whom Satan called,

536
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,480
quote Satan,

537
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,880
called that stupid newt.

538
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:18,220
Satan, or the multiple personality, Satan personality of Thomas Lee Bonney.

539
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,300
Then noted that, quote,

540
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,760
Carol called me a bad name.

541
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,220
She sort of goofed when she called me that.

542
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,120
I'm Satan.

543
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,220
Uh.

544
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,560
Uh, police said a 36-year-old father in Little Rock, Arkansas,

545
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,000
beat his five children,

546
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,020
held their hands under water,

547
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,680
and forced them to smoke crack cocaine because, quote,

548
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,540
God told him to do it.

549
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:52,120
And, uh, Mario Albalo filed a $20 million damage suit

550
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,660
charging former Charlie's Angels actress,

551
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,440
Jacqueline Smith, with sexual torture.

552
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,600
Albalo claimed that the torture began in 1977

553
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,660
when he was watching a muscular dystrophy telethon,

554
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,740
and Jacqueline Smith appeared on screen.

555
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:10,240
Albalo said that Smith immediately began to torture him with telepathic messages

556
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,260
containing suggestions for deviant sexual acts

557
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,700
that continued well after the telethon ended.

558
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,080
We'll continue on to the next chapter, Weird Clergy,

559
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,480
which is certainly pertinent to, uh,

560
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,820
the Church of the Subgenius.

561
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:27,520
Uh...

562
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,120
A resty, wary citizen,

563
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,580
but nothing he dismayed.

564
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,600
Oh, Christ was not our savior,

565
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,720
nor born on Christmas Day

566
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,380
to save us all from atom bombs

567
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,180
when we have gone astray.

568
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,660
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear,

569
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,720
trembling and fear.

570
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,160
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

571
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,560
God love ye wary citizens,

572
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,680
for it is such a shame

573
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,580
to think of cruel injustices

574
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,020
all done in Jesus' name.

575
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,640
Remember when you go to church,

576
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,380
church believers are to blame.

577
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,880
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear,

578
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:28,940
trembling and fear.

579
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,340
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

580
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,960
God help ye wary citizens,

581
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,860
you've all been taken in

582
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,480
by priesthood's waxing rich and fat

583
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,160
upon your fear of sin.

584
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,000
Though you let you in,

585
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,480
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear,

586
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,480
trembling and fear.

587
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,900
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

588
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,380
God save ye wary citizens,

589
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,340
whom for this will make ye sick.

590
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,080
Said Christ was just another Jew,

591
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,740
they nailed upon a stick.

592
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,940
He couldn't save himself,

593
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,160
you know religion is a trick.

594
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,640
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear,

595
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,700
trembling and fear.

596
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,220
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

597
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:30,080
Oh, tribulation and victory,

598
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,200
I will not ask

599
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,060
you why you call me

600
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,060


601
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,020
Cruciate development of a charge

602
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:50,020


603
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:50,020


604
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:50,020


605
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:50,600
For this is a cooked up

606
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,880
Right here in Dallas, Popet, with God rest ye wary citizens.

607
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:03,460
Oh, yes, and that was me giving his brave combo.

608
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,500
And this behind me is Ivan staying in brave combo.

609
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,700
Amazing how that works, isn't it?

610
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,740
And we're just...

611
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,720
Amazing how that works, isn't it?

612
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,300
And we're just sort of drop that out and drop this up.

613
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,120
Ah, there we go.

614
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,620
A lovely, lovely thang.

615
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,520
We like to say all too often.

616
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,640
In 1983, an 18-year-old student at Colorado State University

617
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,560
alleged that a Fort Collins Catholic priest threw her down a flight of stairs

618
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,820
because he was upset at her tambourine playing during mass.

619
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,400
She quoted him as saying, quote,

620
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,440
You play the same way over and over again.

621
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,160
You're not going to play the...

622
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,280
You're not going to play...

623
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,000
You're not going to play the 515 mass anymore.

624
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,640
He then grabbed her by the neck and belt

625
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,560
and threw her out the door where she tumbled down the stairs.

626
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,320
When the church's youth director tried to intervene,

627
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,540
the priest slugged her in the face.

628
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,360
Weird clergy.

629
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,200
Members of America's largest Tibetan Buddhist sect,

630
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,600
just so you know, we aren't picking on just, you know, one sect.

631
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,820
This Tibetan Buddhist sect leader, or sect,

632
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,840
demanded the resignation of its leader, Osul Tenzin,

633
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:20,760
in...

634
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,860
a 45-year-old in 1988,

635
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,640
after news got out that he had contracted AIDS

636
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,140
and had knowingly spread it to his male sexual partners.

637
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:33,880
A church official said Tenzin had spread the disease to, quote,

638
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,180
many, many people.

639
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,080
Just how many is that many?

640
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,640
A National Law Journal article in 1988 revealed

641
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,940
there have been more than 140 reported instances in 18 states

642
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,960
of priests,

643
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,060
molesting children,

644
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,620
and that a report to the U.S. Catholic bishops

645
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:58,440
estimated that the church's liability in lawsuits by the victims

646
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,020
could reach over $1 billion over the next decade.

647
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,220
Sister Franziska Lesky, 57, a Roman Catholic nun,

648
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:10,920
was fined $500 in Graz, Austria, in 1988

649
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,780
for strangling a kitten to death with a cord

650
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:17,400
after it meowed too loudly in the convent.

651
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:21,060
A Brownsville, Texas jury awarded Steve,

652
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,320
Wolverton, $500,000 from the local Catholic diocese

653
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,320
for its negligence in refusing to stop Sister Mary Krieger

654
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,680
from seducing and carrying on an affair with Wolverton's wife,

655
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,460
a guitar player in the choir Krieger directed.

656
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,080
Grand Rapids, Michigan, Baptist minister,

657
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,400
this is my favorite one,

658
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,720
Baptist minister Dwight Reimer used electric shocks

659
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,800
to help him teach the Bible to children.

660
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,520
He asked for young volunteers to sit on a stool

661
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,260
wired to a six-volt...

662
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,480
...lantern battery in order to demonstrate

663
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,840
that sometimes, quote,

664
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,300
God can shock you into hearing his word.

665
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,460
Dr. William Pollard, an Episcopal priest

666
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,920
and author of Let's Talk About Theology and Nuclear Energy,

667
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,100
says that nuclear power is part of God's plan

668
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,260
and thus is essential to life.

669
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,720
According to Pollard, one cannot both accept

670
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,540
that God is the divine creator of all things in the universe

671
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,780
and reject nuclear energy.

672
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,260
And Los Angeles,

673
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,860
Los Angeles minister R.L. Himers Jr. asked parishioners

674
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,740
to pray that a U.S. Supreme Court justice,

675
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:32,300
William Brennan, would die so that an anti-abortion justice

676
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,980
could be appointed in his place.

677
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,980
Ah, yes, dear friends.

678
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:44,240
And here's the latest little piece of music

679
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,700
just to totally change the subject entirely.

680
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,960
A little piece of music from Reverend John Bartles,

681
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,020
Ah, yes.

682
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,860
A redhead Iraq till I just could wait

683
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:08,900
This Arab and right, if you know what I mean

684
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:13,060
It's really no problem, Jordan, you take it to Syria

685
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,160
Don't let them live here, no crap

686
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,960
It's only an old anyway

687
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,960
This is a song I sang in my weapon in Vietnam

688
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:33,680
Whoever takes those things to Kuwait's gotta be putting me out

689
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,840
Like cooking turkey in a bath on Thanksgiving Day

690
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,680
These kids in chemical warfare suits

691
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,860
Oughta be done right away

692
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,200
I like them tender, but I like them dumb

693
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:03,440
And as the odor of freshly cooked American flesh rises into the air

694
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:11,920
It should whet the appetites of armchair generals everywhere

695
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,020
Oh yeah, oh yeah, so

696
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:19,380
I ran and I wrecked till I just could wait

697
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,260
This Arab and right, if you know what I mean

698
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:27,540
This redhead no problem, Jordan, you take it to Syria

699
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,860
Don't let them live here, no crap

700
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,440
It's only an old anyway

701
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:51,140
This Arab and right, if you know what I mean

702
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,140


703
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,140


704
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,140


705
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:06,780
This Arab and right, if you know what I mean

706
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,900
This redhead no problem, Jordan, you take it to Syria

707
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,300
Don't let them live here, no crap

708
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:17,080
It should whet the appetite of American flesh

709
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,160
This Arab and right, if you know what I mean

710
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:18,280
This Arab and right, if you know what I mean

711
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,300
This redhead no problem, Jordan, you take it to Syria

712
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,760
Don't let them live here, no crap

713
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,940
It's only an old anyway

714
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,280
This Arab and right, if you know what I mean

715
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:50,280


716
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:50,360
This redhead no problem, Jordan, you take it to Syria

717
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:50,800
Don't let them live here, no crap

718
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,960
It's only an old anyway

719
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,040
It's only an old anyway

720
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,000
It's only an old anyway

721
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,380
It's only an old anyway

722
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:16,220
It's only an old anyway

723
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,560

724
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,260

725
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,360
¶¶

726
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,340
¶¶

727
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,060
¶¶

728
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:16,600
Ooh.

729
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,160
And that was, once again,

730
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,120
Reverend John Bartles.

731
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,620
He's got some great stuff.

732
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,340
Most of it I cannot play over the radio.

733
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,320
Although, the other side of this,

734
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,840
it says, all clean except last one.

735
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,180
We'll see if nobody comes in to replace us tonight.

736
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,360
We will play that.

737
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,580
A tummy beast.

738
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,600
¶¶

739
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,320
¶¶

740
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,680
One afternoon, I said to Mommy,

741
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,160
who is this person in my tummy?

742
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,620
He must be small and very thin.

743
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,340
Or how could he have gotten in?

744
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,060
My mother said from where she sat,

745
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,300
it isn't nice to talk like that.

746
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,460
It's true, I cried.

747
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,680
I swear it, Mommy.

748
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,420
There is a person in my tummy.

749
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,800
He talks to me at night in bed.

750
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,000
He's always asking to be fed.

751
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,860
Throughout the day, he screams at me,

752
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,740
demanding sugar buns for tea.

753
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,280
He tells me it is not a sin

754
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,020
to go and raid the biscuit tin.

755
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,960
I know quite well it's awfully wrong

756
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,800
to guzzle food the whole day long.

757
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,060
But really, I can't help it, Mommy.

758
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,260
Not with this person in my tummy.

759
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,180
You horrid child, my mother cried.

760
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,340
Admit it right away you've lied.

761
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,680
You're simply trying to produce a silly, asinine excuse.

762
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,300
You are the greedy, guzzling brat.

763
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,140
And that is why you're always fat.

764
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,480
I tried once more.

765
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,340
Believe me, Mommy.

766
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,260
There is a person.

767
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:49,260


768
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,280
There is a person in my tummy.

769
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,980
I've had enough, my mother said.

770
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,600
You'd better go at once to bed.

771
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,380
Just then, a nicely timed event

772
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,920
delivered me from punishment.

773
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,020
Deep in my tummy, something stirred.

774
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,100
And then an awful noise was heard.

775
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,180
A snorting, grumbling, grunting sound

776
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,260
that made my tummy jump around.

777
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,640
My darling mother nearly died.

778
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,920
My goodness, what was that, she cried.

779
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,180
At once, the tummy voice,

780
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:19,940
came through.

781
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,220
It shouted,

782
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,820
Hey there, listen you.

783
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,160
I'm getting hungry.

784
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,220
I want eats.

785
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,340
I want lots of chucks and sweets.

786
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,260
Get me half a pound of nuts.

787
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,220
Look snappy or I'll twist your guts.

788
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,080
That's him, I cried.

789
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,340
He's in my tummy.

790
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,540
So now do you believe me, Mommy?

791
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,800
But Mommy answered nothing more.

792
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,100
For she had fainted on the floor.

793
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:43,980
.

794
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,180
.

795
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:46,360
.

796
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:46,360


797
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:46,360


798
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:46,360


799
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:46,360


800
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:46,360

00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:46,460

805
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:46,540

806
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,060

.

902
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:47,960
Set on, set on, hooping it on and hanging it up.

903
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:53,700
A lovely trophy, a conversation piece too.

904
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:59,340
Another broken jaw, hanging from the dog, from the dog.

905
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:10,820
A blanket, a feathered plow, safe as a cow.

906
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:18,620
Well, I must have been about 16 years old

907
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:23,960
when we blew up dead birds with firecrackers.

908
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,380
Displaced guts, organs, blood in the air.

909
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:34,080
And it was such a fun sight to see.

910
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:55,420
Very unusual song there from an unusual band on this unusual show.

911
00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:00,520
Actually, that was something we got in the mail from a band called The Sealers

912
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,580
in Stilesville, Indiana.

913
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:09,840
The Sealers from their Organic Orgasmic Body Buzz EP.

914
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:16,440
You never know what we're going to be getting in the mail here, dear friends.

915
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:22,140
And speaking of the mail, I think I'll play this just so you know what to do with the mail.

916
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,580
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,900
Got your pencil ready?

920
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,700
Bob, Post Office Box 140306.

921
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,800
Dallas, Texas 75214.

922
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:49,480
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306.

923
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,480
Dallas, Texas 75214.

924
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:55,560
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

925
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:17,020
Subgenius Post Office Box, which once again is Box 140306.

926
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,800
In Dallas, Texas 75214.

927
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:24,640
And you can write for free information on the Church of the Subgenius.

928
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,600
Because, dear friends, we are going to save the universe.

929
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,160
Or at least the swinging love corpses are going to save the universe.

930
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:05,020
When we were born into this life

931
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:10,340
We were destined to make it right.

932
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,360
And it's predetermined.

933
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:15,780
And this is our fate.

934
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,500
We're singing this song.

935
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,240
So you can read later.

936
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:25,560
We are going to save the universe.

937
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:28,260
We are going to save the universe.

938
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:31,040
We are going to save the universe.

939
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,280
This time!

940
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,080
We are full grown.

941
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,620
We are grown up men.

942
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,560
We are all past.

943
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,240
We've paid to reason.

944
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,920
That is our mission.

945
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,680
And it is our task.

946
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:07,300
It's all for us.

947
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,020
Yes, you still ask.

948
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,040
We are going to save the universe.

949
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,260
We are going to save the universe.

950
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,020
We are going to save the universe.

951
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,820
We are going to save the universe.

952
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,180
This time!

953
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,640
We are going to save the universe.

954
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:01,020
We are going to save the universe.

955
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,660
We are going to save the universe.

956
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:10,940
We are going to save the universe.

957
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,380
Don't you worry

958
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,120
Don't have no fears

959
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,020
Don't get out of sight

960
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,540
Because the end is near

961
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,120
We can plan

962
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,880
Don't be smug to the side

963
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,340
We're in control

964
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:44,220
And we are more than fine

965
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,960
We are gone

966
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,340
Inside the universe

967
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,520
We are gone

968
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,040
Inside the universe

969
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,320
We are gone

970
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,940
Inside the universe

971
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:57,200
Inside

972
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,520
Well, maybe next time.

973
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:15,980
Maybe next time.

974
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,220
The church of the subgenius

975
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:19,660
will save the universe.

976
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,520
And if not us,

977
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,120
then the swing and love corpses,

978
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,660
which in some ways

979
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:28,660
might as well be the same thing,

980
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,200
except they don't answer as much mail.

981
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,720
And we're coming down

982
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,180
to the end of the show,

983
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,020
the unedited show.

984
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:38,860
I've actually done a lot of

985
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:39,940
two shows today,

986
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,100
but you'll hear the edited one next week.

987
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,560
This was the sloppy show.

988
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,360
Actually, I went to,

989
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,020
I just got back from a movie.

990
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,820
I went to see Dances with Wolves.

991
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,180
And it's real hard to get

992
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:55,220
into the proper churchly mode

993
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:56,960
after a sort of

994
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,180
ponderously serious movie like that.

995
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,380
Not really a ponderous movie,

996
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,080
although one's coccyx

997
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,860
feels like it's done a lot better.

998
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,540
It's a lot of pondering

999
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,280
because it's over three hours long.

1000
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,480
Well, friends, here's another church

1001
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,120
that wants to save the universe

1002
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,020
next time.

1003
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,940
This is not associated

1004
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:20,300
with the church of the subgenius.

1005
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,060
I'm going to read this one

1006
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:24,860
out of the Puzzling Evidence News Service

1007
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,080
from Puzzling Evidence.

1008
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,680
Police unplug 1-800-WANT-POT.

1009
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:33,520
New York, November 14th.

1010
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:34,680
A Greenwich village man

1011
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,720
who calls himself the Pope of Pot

1012
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,120
was arrested today

1013
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:38,860
on charges of murder.

1014
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:39,420
The charges that he ran

1015
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:40,840
a marijuana delivery service

1016
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,540
that used a toll-free telephone number

1017
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,360
and a dozen bicycle messengers,

1018
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,160
police said.

1019
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,020
Customers were able to call

1020
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,560
1-800-WANT-POT.

1021
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,320
It's so basic.

1022
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,300
And a bicycle messenger

1023
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,300
would be dispatched

1024
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,520
from a comic book shop

1025
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,500
with eighth of an ounce

1026
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,120
pouches of the weed

1027
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,900
that sold for $50,

1028
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,560
a police spokesman,

1029
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,340
Captain Stephen Davis, said.

1030
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,200
Good, good.

1031
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,460
Captain Davis.

1032
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,060
The operation netted

1033
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,280
about $40,000 a day.

1034
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,680
This, um...

1035
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:17,720
Let's see.

1036
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,340
The leader of the organization,

1037
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:20,500
Michael Cesar,

1038
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:22,060
48 years old,

1039
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,240
a friend of Mr. Cesar,

1040
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,620
says he headed a group

1041
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:26,380
that he dubbed

1042
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:29,300
the Church of the Realized Fantasy,

1043
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,480
which met at the loft,

1044
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:32,520
the police said.

1045
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,680
A member of the group

1046
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,380
who asked to be identified as

1047
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,220
Fred

1048
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:38,380
described it as a, quote,

1049
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:41,040
communal marijuana sex church,

1050
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:41,660
unquote,

1051
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:43,680
where members would smoke dope,

1052
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,420
ask questions of the Pope,

1053
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:46,400
quote,

1054
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,560
and have sex.

1055
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:49,600
He basically believed

1056
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,620
that you should be able

1057
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:51,460
to get what you want,

1058
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,200
when you want it,

1059
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:52,860
as you want it,

1060
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,120
as long as you don't infringe

1061
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,280
upon the rights of others,

1062
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,260
Fred said.

1063
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:59,600
Associates of Mr. Cesar

1064
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,460
said the flamboyant preacher,

1065
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:02,420
a figure,

1066
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,800
preached that marijuana

1067
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,900
should be legalized,

1068
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:06,220
that money was evil,

1069
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,840
and that sexual relations

1070
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,280
should,

1071
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:08,900
should be casual.

1072
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,360
He doesn't believe

1073
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,740
marijuana should be illegal,

1074
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,740
Fred said.

1075
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:14,660
He believes it is a sacrament

1076
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:15,360
of his church.

1077
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,120
Well, you know,

1078
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,060
in some respects,

1079
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,640
that church sounds very similar

1080
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,200
to the Church of the Subgenius,

1081
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:20,820
except that

1082
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:22,520
we don't want your common

1083
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,660
street drugs like pot.

1084
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:25,980
I mean,

1085
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,320
that's kid stuff.

1086
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:29,920
As Bob Dobbs' son Bobby

1087
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,520
once said,

1088
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:31,660
drugs are for kids.

1089
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:32,520
You know,

1090
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:33,400
so grow up.

1091
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:34,620
And, uh,

1092
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:35,260
because,

1093
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,320
now,

1094
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,520
now,

1095
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,220
if you want to,

1096
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:40,420
if you call 1-800-WANT-FROP,

1097
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:42,400
you wouldn't get anybody.

1098
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:43,900
Sorry.

1099
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,060
Sold out.

1100
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:50,500
Frop,

1101
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:51,180
by the way,

1102
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,160
just so you understand

1103
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:52,920
what I'm saying,

1104
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,000
is an herb,

1105
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,480
a common herb in Tibet,

1106
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,480
in the Himalayas,

1107
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,720
or at least near places

1108
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,760
where yeti,

1109
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,020
yetis leave droppings,

1110
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,120
where this amazing

1111
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,140
healing herb can grow

1112
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:07,040
and eventually be smuggled

1113
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,240
on the backs of

1114
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:08,940
llamas

1115
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:09,880
to, uh,

1116
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,440
Bob's special

1117
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:12,960
monkery,

1118
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:14,160
or lamastery,

1119
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,040
in, uh,

1120
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,260
Dobbstown, Malaysia.

1121
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,800
Uh, yes.

1122
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,500
Oh, ha.

1123
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,340
No, I threw a towel over it

1124
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:23,440
the moment it happened.

1125
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:24,280
Oh, no.

1126
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,860
They flew on their

1127
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:26,920
membranous wings

1128
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,100
through the ether

1129
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,600
from the planet Yagov,

1130
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:30,780
which we know

1131
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,600
as the planet Pluto.

1132
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,480
Yes, I know.

1133
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:34,400
It's surrounded by

1134
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,240
a large moon

1135
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,440
which we call

1136
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,460
Cheron.

1137
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,240
Cheron.

1138
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:38,240


1139
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:38,360


1140
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:38,360


1141
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:38,360


1142
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:38,360


1143
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:38,360


1144
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:38,360


1145
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:38,360


1146
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:38,360


1147
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:38,360


1148
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:38,360


1149
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:39,100
The moon is actually

1150
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,240
the departure station

1151
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,000
for hundreds of

1152
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:42,960
Yagov beings.

1153
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,200
They're Indians

1154
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,960
in ancient colonial times

1155
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,420
under the leader

1156
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:49,280
of their shaman,

1157
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:50,200
an eskimo,

1158
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:51,600
who are in dire

1159
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,680
and dark communication

1160
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:53,940
with these evil

1161
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:54,940
angelic beings

1162
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:55,760
from the depths

1163
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,540
of space.

1164
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,640
Oh, where are your

1165
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:58,840
wacky improvisations?

1166
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:59,620
You're just reading,

1167
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:00,560
uh, material.

1168
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:01,580
I am not.

1169
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,760
I'm improvising everywhere.

1170
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:03,680
Well, uh,

1171
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:05,620
I'm not so sure.

1172
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:06,740
Oh, look out.

1173
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:07,540
We spilled some dough.

1174
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:08,140
I don't believe it.

1175
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:09,200
We've got a voice

1176
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,400
stress analysis

1177
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,560
of our, uh,

1178
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,160
this bootleg tape recording,

1179
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,220
uh, we'll sell you,

1180
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:14,900
and, uh,

1181
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,020
That's why I'm on

1182
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:17,580
the end of this, uh,

1183
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,340
line and line.

1184
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,120
I'm on this acoustic

1185
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,000
hologram

1186
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,360
that I threw by a point.

1187
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:21,480
You're just glistering

1188
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,640
that baby's behind

1189
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,740
with that shaft of sunlight.

1190
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,180
I can't even talk to this guy.

1191
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:25,380
Okay, you're supposed

1192
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:25,920
to be up to date.

1193
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,980
Read the script.

1194
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:28,060
It's so brilliant.

1195
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:29,340
I don't have a script.

1196
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,060
I brought these notes

1197
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:32,160
from my staff today,

1198
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,120
but I threw them away.

1199
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,520
Black market pills?

1200
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:35,400
Do you have any

1201
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,800
naked pictures of your wife?

1202
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,600
Okay, here's one.

1203
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:38,160
Oh!

1204
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:38,820
Oh, no.

1205
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:39,980
Oh, no.

1206
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,120
Oh.

1207
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:41,760
Oh, no!

1208
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:43,000
Oh, no!

1209
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:44,540
That stuff might

1210
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:45,600
get nasty on me.

1211
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:46,120
I don't even know

1212
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,120
what's coming up

1213
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:47,660
on that tape.

1214
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:48,260
I knew what was

1215
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:48,860
on that part.

1216
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:50,080
Ranger Rita.

1217
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:52,280
All right.

1218
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:53,660
We're, uh,

1219
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,280
ancient history.

1220
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:55,720
Oh.

1221
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,360
A hunk,

1222
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:57,760
a hunk

1223
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,640
of burning meat.

1224
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,980
Yes, and you're

1225
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:03,460
just a hunk

1226
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:04,180
of burning listener,

1227
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:04,480
huh?

1228
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,040
Oh, now,

1229
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:07,620
here's Emmett.

1230
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:08,220
I guess we've got

1231
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:09,040
two minutes to clear

1232
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:09,640
out the station

1233
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,280
or I'll see ya.

1234
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,560
Oh, wait a minute.

1235
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:18,660
Yes, indeedy-poof.

1236
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,040
It's time to leave

1237
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:20,820
the air once again

1238
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:21,700
in a magical way.

1239
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,440
And we're glad

1240
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,240
because our hunk

1241
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:25,860
of burning love

1242
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:26,720
wants to go home.

1243
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,000
Uh, yeah,

1244
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:33,820
put the show away.

1245
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,560
How's it going, Emmett?

1246
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:36,700
The show better now.

1247
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:37,600
Wonderful.

1248
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:39,980
Y'all can listen to this.

1249
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:41,720
Goodbye.

1250
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,660
I predict that although

1251
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,320
50% of the coming population

1252
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,680
will be under 25,

1253
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:51,600
70% of the voters

1254
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,860
will be over the age of 50.

1255
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:56,280
I predict

1256
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,920
paste on bikinis

1257
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:58,700
for you girls

1258
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,280
and clamp on bikinis

1259
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,420
for you men.

1260
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:04,080
I predict a new

1261
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:04,920
one-shot serum

1262
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,540
that will control

1263
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:08,200
every known disease.

1264
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,800
I predict that the

1265
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,180
French prostitutes in Paris

1266
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,860
will go on a stand-up strike.

1267
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:18,500
I predict public executions

1268
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,840
will be shown on television

1269
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:21,920
sponsored by your local

1270
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:22,980
gas company.

1271
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,460
I predict that future

1272
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,440
television commercials

1273
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,180
will be so interesting

1274
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:29,500
that the viewers

1275
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,980
will not go to the toilet

1276
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:32,420
during the program.

1277
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,980
And I predict that our

1278
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,080
local American doctors

1279
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,000
will go on strike

1280
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,520
and be replaced

1281
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,860
by African witch doctors.

1282
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:43,640
I predict that human flesh

1283
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,920
will be canned and exported

1284
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,840
from Africa for sale

1285
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,960
in England and on the continent.

1286
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,620
I predict there will always

1287
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:53,520
be more people,

1288
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:54,740
but there will never

1289
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:55,420
be more land.

1290
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,120
I predict that population

1291
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,460
explosion will permit

1292
00:55:58,460 --> 00:55:59,700
standing room only.

1293
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:01,360
Every inch of our land

1294
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,040
will be occupied.

1295
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,120
I predict we will live

1296
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,020
in floating cities

1297
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,480
sustained by

1298
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,540
anti-gravity,

1299
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,140
huge plastic bubbles

1300
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:09,860
under the sea

1301
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:10,880
which draws oxygen

1302
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,140
from the sea itself,

1303
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:15,000
underground tunnels and caves,

1304
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,960
plus the very center of Earth,

1305
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,480
which will be a nation

1306
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,700
unto itself.

1307
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,060
I predict we will travel

1308
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,700
by means of non-gravity,

1309
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,020
a set of a personal wings,

1310
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:29,240
moving platforms which float

1311
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:29,900
through the air.

1312
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,880
We will also take a pill

1313
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,980
which makes us lighter than air.

1314
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,000
Nothing will travel on the ground.

1315
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:36,440
We will be able to travel on the ground,

1316
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,020
freeways and streets will vanish

1317
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,600
and be replaced by small landing fields

1318
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:43,360
on the very roof of your very home.

1319
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,720
I predict that your television set

1320
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,460
will cover one side of your wall

1321
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:50,000
and the figures there

1322
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,060
will be three-dimensional

1323
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:53,660
and almost walk out into the room

1324
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,300
in natural color,

1325
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,580
breathing, living,

1326
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,420
with odors to match.

1327
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,520
You will enjoy the bracing air

1328
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,040
of the Northwest,

1329
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:04,720
the warm enchantment of the South Seas

1330
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,260
or the swill of the jungle.

1331
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,740
I predict education will be given children

1332
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:10,900
through the television screen.

1333
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:12,700
No personal teachers,

1334
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:15,200
but there will be a warden on duty

1335
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,680
to see that 100% interest is sustained.

1336
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:20,160
Later, education pills,

1337
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:22,720
which will give you all of the education

1338
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:23,980
that you may need.

1339
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,880
I predict that firearms will be outlawed

1340
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:31,360
and only police visible will be the eye

1341
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,380
of the television detection cameras,

1342
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,040
which will stun with a laser

1343
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,720
and disarray any and all wrongdoing.

1344
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:41,160
A camera eye will follow you

1345
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,960
from the day of your birth

1346
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,340
until the day of your death

1347
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:48,820
and if you go to the right place, beyond.

1348
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,680
Oh, my friend,

1349
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,620
how far have you progressed

1350
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:55,580
from the Stone Age?

1351
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,500
How far have we advanced

1352
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,000
from the ooze and the slime?

1353
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,960
Are the present doctors

1354
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,500
really miracle men of medicine?

1355
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,180
What have they cured?

1356
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,840
What have they controlled?

1357
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,180
In the next few minutes,

1358
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:11,140
you will be shown a special example.

1359
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,760
My friend, this is not the 10th century,

1360
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:16,080
but the 20th century.

1361
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:19,040
I firmly suggest that if you are...
