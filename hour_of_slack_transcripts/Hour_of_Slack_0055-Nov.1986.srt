1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,380
Help me, somebody.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:03,300
Now how much would you pay?

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,280
Not that Beethoven is through, not at all.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,900
It's just that there's a new electricity and excitement in our young composer.

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,360
Any sound, any music, and anything goes.

6
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,140
THE END

7
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,180
We all follow where the artists lead us.

8
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,360
They are our Galileos, our Louises, our Edisons.

9
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,960
We all follow where the artists lead us.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:29,980
We all follow where the artists lead us.

11
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,800
Every time you say, see, hear, or think.

12
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,200
What about slack?

13
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,440
That's your key phrase.

14
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,660
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

15
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,780
And now, the Soap Genius Hour of Slack.

16
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:21,060
The Soap Genius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station...

17
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,860
Oh, oh, KNOF!

18
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,780
...only in the city of...

19
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,500
Dallas, Texas.

20
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,660
Should any other shows be heard from or contacted in the course of this show,

21
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,880
the listener is advised to remain calm and only contact listed or unlisted officials

22
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,940
in the event of any material from this radio or other listening device being inhaled during broadcast.

23
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:44,480
Small animals or other children becoming exposed to the ultra-high or ultra-low shocks and brain frequencies

24
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,180
constantly scanned throughout our program should seek shelter in an approved safety unit only.

25
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,700
This is Walter Teasdale reminding you that it's often a photon that light releases,

26
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,080
but truth is, not everyone gets the picture.

27
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,980
Hoping your time is all time,

28
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,800
and all your unpermissible truths are happy truths.

29
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,420
Here is your host...

30
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,520
Oh, yes, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Stang,

31
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,120
and tonight we have with us a respected,

32
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,160
an oh-so-respected expert

33
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,640
on the secret doctrines of sex hurt.

34
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,700
But more than that, dear friends,

35
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:28,540
a woman, an uber-woman who has been actually as great a thorn in the conspiracy's side

36
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:34,640
here in Dallas as any, any of us tool-using primates.

37
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:43,280
Uh, she's, uh, in many ways the Dr. Ruth, the Mata Hari, the Corazon Aquino,

38
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:49,760
and the Lizzie Borden of the subgenius women's sewing auxiliary.

39
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,180
Reverend Chastity Belt, uh, so good to have a female warm...

40
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,000
voice on the show.

41
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,360
Well, Reverend, it's so glad, I'm so glad to be here,

42
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,800
and you're right, I am sort of like the Lizzie Borden,

43
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,100
because I'm a real cut-up.

44
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,380
Oh, now, friends, me and, me and Reverend Chastity here,

45
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,600
we, we don't have to be here.

46
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,240
We could be out getting some wick-splitting done, you know.

47
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,000
We don't have to be doing this show.

48
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,980
We could blow you listeners off,

49
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,340
drive over to a cheap motel on Harry Hines,

50
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,520
and get right down to the business of the show, and, uh,

51
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,720
the business of taking the job, don't you see,

52
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,680
of illustrating to ourselves just what it means to be a subgenius.

53
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,560
Ah, yes, we could do this, because in Bob's church, friends,

54
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,880
all men and all women are, are, are married to each other.

55
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,960
Um, even the men are married to the men and the women to the women,

56
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,380
believe it or not, although, uh, I personally don't, uh,

57
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,080
partake in this particular form of consummation.

58
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,100
Nay.

59
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,380
Nay.

60
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,560
Nay.

61
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,800
But you must learn somehow to give yourself to the feeling, dear friends.

62
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,800
Because it's our, our duty to Bob and Connie that we may indulge

63
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,480
in the knowledge of the flesh until we achieve memories

64
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,080
of our own previous reincarnalities.

65
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,140
Ah, yes.

66
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,320
Give yourself to the feeling.

67
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,440
Give yourself to the feelings, boys and girls, and things.

68
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,900
Give yourself to the feelings.

69
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,900
Well, Reverend Chastity, what was the last, uh, evil thing

70
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,160
that, that you've been known for here in Dallas?

71
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,460
I understand it had something to do with a talking toilet,

72
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:42,060
trying to, trying to achieve some sort of freedom of toilets in Plano.

73
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,960
Yes, I, I, I have to say, I'm at a point now where I say,

74
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,140
let my people tinkle, and I know you can relate,

75
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,180
because we all eat, we all sleep, we all reproduce,

76
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,260
and some of us all meet the call.

77
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,300
Well, in the little boys' or little girls' room.

78
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,720
Except in, in the Plano, uh, oh well.

79
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,360
Transit Center, I tell you, dear.

80
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,680
People meet the call of nature wherever nature calls, you know.

81
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,300
Now, Bob said there's nothing wrong with that.

82
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,300
Well, I have no problem with that.

83
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,340
I'm just kind of distressed at seeing little old ladies

84
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,640
tinkling on perfectly good city buses.

85
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,500
Well, out of respect for Bob, um, and Connie,

86
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,420
instead of jumping into the sack of,

87
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,120
of mutual respect and, and, uh, lower things,

88
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,480
we're gonna jump onto a new subject matter, friends,

89
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,760
one which we have not oft broached on the Hour of Slack,

90
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:39,480
and rip away the veils of clothing which obscure this subject,

91
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,400
the subject of Connie Dobbs,

92
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,920
wife of Bob, she whom men have called the Blessed Anti-Virgin.

93
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,640
The secrets of Connie are like a closed lotus,

94
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,360
but if we stroke this lotus with just the right combination,

95
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,340
of gentleness and urgency, dear friends,

96
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:01,440
it will open its blossoms to reveal a treasure.

97
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,720
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

98
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:12,000
So, uh, but, but, is Playgirl enough, Reverend Chastity?

99
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,360
No. No.

100
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,780
Is, is there, I mean, what about porno, pornography for women?

101
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,480
I feel that not enough has been done about this,

102
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,840
and I am distressed.

103
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,220
You see, Reverend Stang,

104
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,220
we owe it to the future of America

105
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,680
to reproduce as much and as often as possible.

106
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,060
Where will the future war veterans come from?

107
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,020
Where will the war winners come from?

108
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,300
They will come from nowhere if our young women are not enthused

109
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,620
and excited in a way to reproduce.

110
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,220
And I know that you can appreciate this.

111
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,800
I am concerned about this Mace Commission report,

112
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,180
because if we take away the playboys,

113
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,880
we take away the Playgirls,

114
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,500
we take away the inspiration,

115
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,880
they will not be in the drive-ins.

116
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,440
On Saturday night, making them little future Americans.

117
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,780
Little future mutants, dear friends.

118
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,280
Because, now, Reverend Chastity,

119
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,380
as you yourself have often preached,

120
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,120
we don't want them to mess around with the humans.

121
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,340
It's, uh, you know, they need to stick with their subgenius kind.

122
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,180
And like, as seen here on this slideshow.

123
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,860
Oh, my goodness.

124
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,440
Friends, it's a good thing this is the radio,

125
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,620
or we'd be off the air by now, I believe.

126
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,220
Oh, can you do that on the radio?

127
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,680
Can you do that without Vaseline?

128
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,220
Oh, breakdance Bob.

129
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,920
I got a Bob in my pocket, dear friends.

130
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,360
And he's waiting to meet you.

131
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,620
Well, what about, what did they say,

132
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,600
what did Connie have to say to the Mace Commission

133
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,780
when they came to her, uh, accusing her of being a major pornography publisher

134
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,860
with this new women's pornography line?

135
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,620
Uh, I mean, I mean, I understand.

136
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,320
As a matter of fact, let me level with you.

137
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,300
Reverend Chastity, let me, so to speak, shoot straight.

138
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,800
Rumors have circulated for years that the Church of the Subgenius

139
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,500
was merely the unwitting front group for a secret conspiracy of women.

140
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,580
A globe-encompassing coven, so to speak, which uses males,

141
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,260
uses us, both subgenius and pink alike,

142
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:22,600
as part of a vast breeding experiment by which you fems will hope to, uh, eventually, uh,

143
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:22,600


144
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,200
produce a messiah, a godlike being of incredible powers,

145
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,160
called the Kwisatz Haderach.

146
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,020
Yes, in fact, the famous Dune series of science fiction

147
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:35,240
is but a thinly veiled expose of a group which actually exists.

148
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:35,920
Is this true?

149
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,320
Uh, I, I, I, I, I, I don't know if I can discuss this right now because...

150
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,420
That you females have managed to keep this secret from all of us males

151
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,660
for a hundred thousand years until now?

152
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,180
Don't put this pressure on me.

153
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,180
I can't crack, I can't tell you the truth.

154
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,580
The all of womankind is counting on me.

155
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,620
Uh-huh, pretending to be oppressed all the time

156
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:01,480
so that you can use that as a guise to cover your actual iron-fisted strangle-hole

157
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,320
over male behavior?

158
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,680
I prefer the term velvet claw.

159
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,280
Yes, yes, the, uh, you cannot deny, though, that ye,

160
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,120
ye female ones possess the one treasure which few men,

161
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,760
subgenius or pink, can live without,

162
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,840
that juicy bait dangled before our eyes.

163
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,000
Ma'am, keeping us...

164
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,180
I thought you were going to say that we had mutual obligations

165
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,340
that you could not obligate.

166
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,320
Well, friends, that's the, that's the main thing.

167
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:36,480
It's the, it's a mutual obligation, as you can hear these people at Dobstown

168
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,360
here in the background, our home movie of life at Dobstown.

169
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,360
And I understand, uh, Reverend Chastity, that, that you were, uh,

170
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:50,240
for a long time, you, you were an honorary nun-snake mother superior in Dobstown?

171
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,000
Well, I, I did spend some time out there in my missionary field,

172
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,780
and, uh, I, I, I prefer that hands-on experience of reaching the public.

173
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,220
I'm sure you can appreciate that.

174
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,240
Why, just last summer, I was on a tour of the Fiji Islands,

175
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,200
healing them young Polynesian boys.

176
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,100
I tell you, some of them laying on ceremonies took hours and hours.

177
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,960
You cannot understand how exhausting that was.

178
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,520
Oh, praise Bob.

179
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,840
But I did that in the name of Bob.

180
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,220
Praise Bob, praise Bob, in the name, and right in front of him, too, I tell you.

181
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,420
I bet, I bet he was watching the whole time.

182
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,420
Well, he was, he was there with a video camera.

183
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,960
I'm sure that they will be available at the next church convention.

184
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,580
Now, uh, and you have trained, as I understand,

185
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,900
that when you were at the convent of the avenging Cyclops,

186
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:42,040
that you trained many of Dobstown's most skilled nun-snakes in the, in the, uh, arts of love?

187
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,060
Well, you could say I've riffed with the best of them.

188
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,040
Now, now, not to be confused with the hookers for Bob.

189
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,240
Oh, no, no.

190
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,660
Yeah, that was a, that was more of a, a, a grassroots movement that Bob,

191
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,880
as an idea, I think Bob actually got from the Children of God,

192
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,020
which is a Christian cult, which uses sex to get people to join the church.

193
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:12,920
Now, is it all right, do you think, to, to use sex to get people, humans or, or subgeniuses, whatever, to give money to Bob?

194
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,900
Well, I hate to tell you this, Reverend, but women have been using sex for years

195
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,140
to get just about anything from anyone.

196
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:26,680
Well, that's a, well, that's a, uh, yeah, and yet you deny that, that you're part of a, a conspiracy, an all-encompassing...

197
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,260
Oh, oh, I wouldn't say it's a conspiracy. No, no.

198
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,860
I, I, I, I, I can't admit to that.

199
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,540
Not when I have so many of my sisters listening in tonight.

200
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,880
And besides, even if you did admit to it, you know, nobody would believe it,

201
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,020
because the Church of the Subgenius, oh, it's just a joke.

202
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,980
Just a joke. And, uh,

203
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,360
Ahem.

204
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,060
But I understand now that as part of your training to be a nun snake,

205
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:57,680
that you, uh, you actually had physical contact with Bob Dobbs,

206
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,220
experienced the love of Bob in a physical way.

207
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,140
Yes.

208
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:01,860
Now, is this true?

209
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,880
This is true.

210
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:08,340
Can, can you describe what Bob was like in bed, in, in polite language for the radio?

211
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:15,440
Well, uh, uh, uh, uh, well, let's just say it was a deep, meaningful relationship that...

212
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,100
Deep, yeah.

213
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,500
...I, I, I experienced life at, at its fullest.

214
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,020
You could say it was, I was bursting forth with joy.

215
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,960
Oh, sweet mystery of life.

216
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,580
Oh, friends, look at those VU meters jump.

217
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,880
Oh, she's getting excited just thinking about the mighty, the mighty love of Bob.

218
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,680
Just like us male subgeniuses.

219
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,380
Well, I can't, we can't, we can't say that we, we covet Bob's wife.

220
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,140
But Connie, well, now, let's get on to the other thing here.

221
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,480
Now...

222
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,020
I am, I am...

223
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:49,480
You posed for this issue of Playboy here, the girls of the subgenius church.

224
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:57,960
Yes, well, as you know, Reverend, I was one of the first, at the first official subgenius church get-together.

225
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,420
As you remember, it was with Reverend Buck and, and you and I and a couple other believers.

226
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:09,340
And when I heard Reverend Buck break into a chorus of festering on the carcass of life,

227
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:13,960
I knew I had reached the religion that I was meant to be called to.

228
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,600
Oh, yes, dear friends.

229
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,660
And that's true, Reverend Belt, that's your last name, right?

230
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,340
Yes, it is.

231
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:33,000
Was, was, uh, the, at the absolute, the very first subgenius devival that was ever held anywhere, at least, and open to the public.

232
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:41,860
Bob, you know, formed the church in the 50s and he had secret, uh, secret parties, much like what you hear in the background here,

233
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,940
Uh, to get the church started.

234
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,680
But yes, those were the days.

235
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:53,140
Now, um, uh, now I notice in the, in the, in the girls of the subgenius church here with the Playboy interview,

236
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:53,920
Mm-hmm.

237
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:04,380
or the Playboy pictures, that, that many of these uber women, these subgenius gals, don't conform to the conspiracy's usual definition of, quote, good looks, unquote.

238
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:12,460
They look even more, they look like some of these girls here look like they got more yeti blood than Buck naked himself.

239
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,760
For instance, Miss Delaware.

240
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:13,940
Oh, yeah.

241
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:25,240
With the sloping brow, the bodily hair, the bowed short legs, and long muscular arms that identify one who is a, a, a direct descendant of the yetis.

242
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,780
But she had a good soul and a, and a wonderful personality.

243
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,440
Why, you should have seen that girl cook.

244
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,340
Oh, yes.

245
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,100
And could she keep house, I tell ya.

246
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,340
Yes, dear friends.

247
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,500
Well, you know, that's the thing.

248
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,720
Just don't taint your genes with, with the genes of a human.

249
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,940
Try to, you, you should go for those yetis.

250
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,780
They're the ones that carry, that carry the seed word of Bob, dear friends.

251
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,700
And they can certainly keep you warm in the winter.

252
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:55,160
Oh, gosh, I got some of that word all over the floor of the radio station, dear friends.

253
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,940
We're gonna have to move on to a tape here.

254
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,600
I'm gonna make you tell.

255
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:00,820
Sex.

256
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,020
Sex.

257
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,260
What?

258
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,380
Sex.

259
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:05,940
Praise Bob.

260
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,460
Sex.

261
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:08,860
Sex.

262
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,580
What?

263
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:11,860
Sex.

264
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:12,620
What?

265
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:13,920
Sex.

266
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,500
Apologies.

267
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:26,880
God.

268
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,260
enty of you today are making the wrong thing.

269
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,660
I made the dumb guess.

270
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,000
Now he's going to keep his noses forward 것합니다

271
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,500
of humanity and we've only begun the fight against the control by the real sexual deviance.

272
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:55,040
The repressed ninnies with insane super egos. They run around denying that it's a squirting

273
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:01,680
ooze and universe. And they think they're working for God, but hell, sex is a religious

274
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:09,680
sacrament. They can't take a joke, but don't take that literally now. Sister Chris here.

275
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:30,360
Television stations are bombarded by jokes from the studios of Hollywood. I don't care.

276
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,440
I don't care what lengths I go to anymore. All is fair and all that. Dr. Harris, you're

277
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,220
a doctor. A doctor. Doesn't that mean anything to you as a surgeon? I'm a doctor, Edith,

278
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,320
but I'm a man also. You're under arrest!

279
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,560
Something sick. Something sordid, vicious, and depraved.

280
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:58,140
Vagina. Vagina. V-A-G-I-N-A. It's a canal-like passage between the uterus and an opening

281
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:03,960
between the woman's legs. It is the place where sperm are deposited by the father during

282
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,560
the mating, including the passage towards the baby who passes into the new world which

283
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,040
is born.

284
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,900
It's a canal-like passage between the uterus and the baby who passes into the new world

285
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,000
which is gone.

355
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,380

job

394

I

395
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,780
built

396
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:34,940
with

397
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:34,940


398
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:34,940


399
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:34,940


400
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:34,940


401
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,040
don't

402
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,040


403
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,040


404
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,040


405
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,040


406
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,040


407
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,040


408
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,140
I got something for you.

409
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,660
This is the one and only Mojo Bag.

410
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:48,380
And with this, you don't need no long hair.

411
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,880
Or cool cigarettes.

412
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,100
Or cool guy shades.

413
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:02,960
Because you could have any woman you want with the Mojo Bag.

414
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:09,560
And you don't need no knife or gun.

415
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:16,780
Because ain't nobody can hurt you when you got the Mojo Bag.

416
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,240
But you too can have the one and only Mojo Bag.

417
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,900
Yeah, I'd give it to you for, oh, I guess about $8.

418
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,540
$8.

419
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,140
Oh, shit!

420
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:32,700
No!

421
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,980
No substitutes.

422
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,260
But one word of caution.

423
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,500
One word of caution.

424
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,160
Don't you never look inside the Mojo Bag.

425
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,460
Because it got the juju.

426
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,960
And that is hot stuff.

427
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,440
Come on.

428
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,380
Come on.

429
00:24:59,140 --> 00:24:59,940
Jeepers.

430
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,440
Yeah, hit the go.

431
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:02,940
Hit the go.

432
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:02,940


433
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,700
Friends, have we got poltergeists in this station again?

434
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,880
It happens every now and then.

435
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,600
This is what the conspiracy gets into.

436
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,240
There we go.

437
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,040
Oh, yeah.

438
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,720
Praise God.

439
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,480
Help me.

440
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,820
One channel only.

441
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,420
Oh, yeah.

442
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,600
We're going to have a parade, dear friends.

443
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,880
Oh, yes, children.

444
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,780
We are all God's children.

445
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,940
We are going to have a real good time.

446
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,100
At the first K-N-O-N Parade and Rally.

447
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,540
Saturday, December the 6th.

448
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:45,700
At noon, we are going to meet at Pax Park, just north of downtown on Harry Hines.

449
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,440
We are going to parade through downtown, children, on St. Paul Street.

450
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:55,660
Winding up in front of the Dallas City Hall at City Hall Plaza for a giant K-N-O-N Rally.

451
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:01,300
If your church organization or choir wants to participate in the parade with a float

452
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,940
or just marching with a parade.

453
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,080
Please call us up down here at K-N-O-N right now.

454
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,400
828-9500.

455
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:15,520
And dear friends, you see, of course, we're going to have a subgenius float down there.

456
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:22,040
I know, for instance, this is the first time this has been announced, I think,

457
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:26,720
but the Batmobile and Batman and Robin will be down there.

458
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:32,640
You know, they joined the church several years ago.

459
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,140
And when, actually at a time when they were very dissolute and disillusioned, friends,

460
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:43,860
with the, you know, they'd arrest these criminals and hand them over to the cops

461
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,400
and then some judge would let them out with a year's probation.

462
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,420
It's a conspiracy.

463
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,680
It is, friends.

464
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:55,000
And we're going to have that giant six-foot Dobbs head down there at that parade and rally

465
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,740
to try to fight for our freedom of communication and communication.

466
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,820
And fornicationalism, which we so enjoy.

467
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,540
Ah, yes, dear friends.

468
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,180
You know, Bob is the avatar of Slack.

469
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:16,060
I think we got some new listeners last week when we actually explained who Bob was.

470
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,760
But no less crucial, dear friends, in preparing Dobbs for Slack avatarhood

471
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,240
was his first and still primary wife, Connie,

472
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:31,400
seen in her early film appearance in the 1961 film Planet of the Blind Women.

473
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,640
She had been...

474
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,080
his childhood sweetheart in first grade.

475
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,840
But in 1955, more than 20 years later, they remet and remarried.

476
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,020
Her impact on Bob is inestimable.

477
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:48,440
Recently, indeed, a church of Connie's panties has sprung up and is gathering momentum

478
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,340
despite its rather juvenile basic premise.

479
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:57,600
Connie even sang with Bob's jazz combo, Bob Dobbs and the Doobops,

480
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:02,760
and gave him five sons, Bubba, Bobby Jr., Adam Cadman,

481
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,840
Shem, and Sean.

482
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:08,220
There's also a daughter, but the family Dobbs keeps her name a secret

483
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:12,180
in order to limit the number of suitors who would marry into this awesome dynasty.

484
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,420
Now, Connie wields enormous power, dear friends.

485
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:22,420
There's a whole group of women, witch women, I prefer to call them,

486
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,400
who worship Connie called the Sodality of the White Glove.

487
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,880
Now, I've encountered them.

488
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,640
Some of you may have read about the...

489
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:39,140
the time the church patriarchy was overthrown by the Women's Sewing Auxiliary

490
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,300
years ago in Chicago, and ever since.

491
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,120
You know, it started out to be a men's club, but now...

492
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,680
Like, for instance, Bob has at least one secondary wife and family in every state of the Union.

493
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:59,900
Families spread all over the world, and they all fiercely defend Bob as a companion and a provider.

494
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,900
And they insist that he always seems to have plenty...

495
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,460
of time to spend with each of them.

496
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,920
Just a moment with Bob is worth it all.

497
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:16,360
And this young bride of Bob, Chastity Belt, has sacrificed her own virtues up many times

498
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:25,960
in order to carry on the mighty business of Connie's church, as well as Bob's.

499
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,780
But we can't just talk about Connie, friends.

500
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,220
We're here to penetrate.

501
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,480
The essence of Chastity Belt.

502
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,400
This southern belt who embodies...

503
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,580
embodies, friends, and boy does she,

504
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,680
the subgenius feminine virtues of

505
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,700
A, enthusiasm,

506
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,780
B, practiced skills,

507
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,000
and a clean bill of health, see.

508
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:54,700
So, uh, Miss Belt, I'm sure our audience would like to really get inside you

509
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,600
and see what makes you tick or ooze.

510
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,800
Well, I like to think of myself as just your typical country girl,

511
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,280
out there saving the world from itself.

512
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,660
And in the name of Bob, I try to encourage

513
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,740
educational aspects and opportunities for women

514
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,820
in the workplace, in the home, in the bedroom,

515
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,040
um, back in the workplace again.

516
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,080
And we try to spread...

517
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,000
All over the house, friends.

518
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:23,920
All over the house.

519
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,180
All over the house.

520
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,640
Everywhere but the Safeway.

521
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,940
That reminds...

522
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:31,520
And that, you know, that reminds me of a lovely background type here.

523
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,260
This is a...

524
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,780
sent in by a...

525
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,880
young member years ago...

526
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,100
a couple of years ago

527
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,000
from the Dobbs Ashram.

528
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,080
Listen to that music.

529
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,160
Friends, can you hear Bob coming?

530
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,660
Bob is coming again and again, friends,

531
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,280
to save your soul.

532
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,520
Oh, God, yeah.

533
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,880
Hey, get Buck out of the record collection back there.

534
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,480
God!

535
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,980
Get down, Buck.

536
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,540
Get up.

537
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,700
Oh, not there, please.

538
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,200
And Buck's in heat again, dear friend.

539
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,160
Oh, look at that.

540
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,840
He can't even say hi, girls, anymore.

541
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,560
But what about the mutant men, Chastity?

542
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,120
What about the, uh...

543
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,620
Oh, the...

544
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,160
Is it the...

545
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,700
Is it...

546
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,240
How shall we say?

547
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,100
The statue del carne...

548
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,660
The estatua del carne?

549
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,460
The...

550
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,300
The meat itself?

551
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,300
Or is it the motion?

552
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,920
And would not a well-endowed epileptic

553
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,920
prove to be the best of both worlds?

554
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,260
Well, I tend to think that it's their...

555
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:31,380
their...

556
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:32,220
their...

557
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:32,240
their...

558
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,620
their total lack of pretense

559
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,080
and their non-knowledge of manners

560
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,800
that make them so educationally entertaining.

561
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,480
I have been educated on many occasions

562
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,480
by mutants

563
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,800
while I was spreading the word of the church,

564
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,900
and it was an uplifting

565
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,620
and inspiring

566
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,400
and very sweaty experience.

567
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,720
I'm sure you can appreciate it.

568
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,280
Oh, yes.

569
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,060
Clap them...

570
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,320
Oh, I've never had to clap.

571
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,360
I've never had to clap.

572
00:31:59,480 --> 00:31:59,860
...palms out there, dear friends.

573
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:00,940
No, but...

574
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,240
but the subject...

575
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:02,820
...past the genius virus,

576
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,900
we must continue to spread this...

577
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,340
Yes.

578
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,700
...this deliverance

579
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,360
among the...

580
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,940
the lost out there.

581
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,400
Now, how do you...

582
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,580
Besides spreading the seed of Bob,

583
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,320
as you do,

584
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,740
what about sex hurt,

585
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,440
Bob's discipline of sex hurt?

586
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:19,860
Is it...

587
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,380
How does this compare with, say,

588
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,940
sex among the Baptists?

589
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,240
Sex is okay to say on the radio, isn't it?

590
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,120
Well, as long as you don't really do it on the radio,

591
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,560
which can be rather painful

592
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,760
if you don't watch

593
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,740
where the knobs are.

594
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,260
I would have to say that...

595
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,300
The mighty knobs.

596
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,100
Never mind.

597
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,760
I won't even say it.

598
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,480
I would have to say that

599
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,420
Baptist sex and sex hurt

600
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,460
are very similar, of course.

601
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,960
Most marriage sex is sex hurt.

602
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,360
You hurt me,

603
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,000
I won't have sex with you.

604
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:52,760
Wait a minute.

605
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,420
What could be more painful?

606
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:53,720
Now, that's not...

607
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,680
As I understood it,

608
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,460
that was not...

609
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,300
Bob didn't...

610
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,020
By the discipline of sex hurt,

611
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,900
he didn't mean tying them up, necessarily.

612
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,300
Well, sometimes...

613
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:01,740
Or chaining them up.

614
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:01,740


615
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:01,740


616
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,600
Or chaining them down, necessarily.

617
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:03,960
No, but...

618
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,820
But more like...

619
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,780
Well, until it hurts, you know?

620
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,520
I believe the term is restrained sex.

621
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,640
Pleasure unrestrained

622
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,080
until something hurts so much

623
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,200
that you can't keep going.

624
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:15,720
And that's...

625
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,680
Friends, that's when you keep going anyway.

626
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,600
Yes.

627
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,000
And you will see Bob.

628
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,000
You will see Bob.

629
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,520
I've seen Bob on several occasions,

630
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,860
even when Bob wasn't there.

631
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,760
Calling out his name

632
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,140
and...

633
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,140
I bet your husband was wondering,

634
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,360
now, which Bob, huh?

635
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,800
Friends, there's Bobs everywhere,

636
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,300
but there's only one true Bob.

637
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,500
But, you know,

638
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,960
just like they say in the old song...

639
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,360
...

640
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,780
...

641
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,140
...

642
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,500
...

643
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:52,500


644
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,100
...

645
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:54,100


646
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:54,360
...

647
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:54,360


648
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,180
...

649
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:55,480
...

650
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:55,480


651
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:55,520
...

652
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:55,520


653
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:55,520


654
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:55,520


655
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:55,520


656
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:55,580
...

657
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:55,580


658
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:55,580


659
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:55,580


660
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:55,580


661
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:55,580


662
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:55,580


663
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:55,580


664
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:55,580


665
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:01,680
...

666
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:02,760
...

667
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:10,500
.

668
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:10,500


669
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,000
...

670
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,160
...

671
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:19,180
...

672
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:19,200
...

673
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:19,220
...

674
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:19,240
...

675
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:19,260
...

676
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:19,280
...

677
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:19,300
.

678
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:22,880
.

679
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:25,560
.

680
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:25,660
.

681
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:25,940
.

682
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:17,120
Right now I'm doing my subgenius new age music.

683
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,640
This is Sister Chris.

684
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,980
Subgenius beach party.

685
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,660
Subgenius new age dance music.

686
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,120
Oh yes.

687
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:31,380
The lovely Sister Chris with the half hour slack in New Jersey.

688
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,220
On Pinkton Hill Records.

689
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,460
Reading Cat Ladies.

690
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:40,620
When in the force of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the conspiracy

691
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:47,040
bonds which have confronted them with another and to assume among the powers of the squirting

692
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,820
universe the separate and unequal station to which the laws of sanity and hedonism entitle

693
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:52,960
them to live.

694
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:58,800
A decadent respect for the outrageousness of mankind's desires that they should declare

695
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,560
the forces which impel them to the separation.

696
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:07,340
We hold these truths to be self-evident that all subgenii are created horny.

697
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,080
That they are endowed by their creator with certain unalien rights.

698
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,200
That among these are slack, sex, and the pursuit of frap.

699
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:22,960
That to enjoy these rights clenches, unalien clenches are instituted among subgenius.

700
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,340
Deriving their just slack from the effect of the prop.

701
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,200
Frap.

702
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:27,780
Frap.

703
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:34,400
That whenever any form of the conspiracy becomes destructive of the slack it is the right of

704
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:40,160
the subgenii to alter or to demolish it and to institute new slack laying its foundations

705
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:46,280
on such frivolities and organizing parties in such form as to them shall seem most likely

706
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,800
to affect their sanity and hedonism.

707
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,940
Prudence indeed will demonstrate their sass.

708
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:58,440
Sacraments long established should not be abused for light and transient causes and

709
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:04,060
accordingly all experiences hath shown that subgenii are more disposed to hide out while

710
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:09,760
life is insufferable than to sell themselves by ignoring the slack to which they are entitled.

711
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:16,300
But when a long train of abusers and usurpers pursuing assumably the same object effects

712
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,160
a plan to squash them under the insolent despotism it is their birthright.

713
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:22,920
It is their right.

714
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:28,420
It is their duty to throw off such goons and to prime new slack for the future serenity.

715
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:34,420
Such have been the repeated sufferances of these subgenii and such is now the nirvana

716
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:38,520
which compels them to abandon their former styles of entertainment.

717
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:45,460
The history of the present glorps in all places is a history of repetitive banalities and

718
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:52,440
absurdities all having in direct consequence the establishment of an attempted stranglehold

719
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:52,920
over the future.

720
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:52,920


721
00:37:54,020 --> 00:38:00,060
Yet this punishment, through my being a king and a secretary, was anyway scooped out of

722
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,020
the early faces of the Roman royal family.

723
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,160
Much like the

724
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:03,160


725
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:03,160

730
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:21,280
is obtained, and when so hidden, they have notably searched to eradicate them.

731
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:27,300
They have refused to pass the laws for the accommodation of large districts of subgenii

732
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:33,320
unless they would relinquish the light of I and I, intercourse and intoxication.

733
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,300
I think we're going nowhere, man.

734
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,900
I think there's no slack right now.

735
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:38,920
I sound like Jerry.

736
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,000
Jerry?

737
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,860
Can I cut off your fingers?

738
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,760
And then you'll really be Jerry?

739
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,540
Too much bass drum will never get signed by Wyndham Hill.

740
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,080
You too can be a recording star.

741
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:12,640
That was Sister Chris, who works in the layout department at Screw Magazine, believe it or not.

742
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,320
It's true.

743
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:21,420
I love little girls, they make me feel so good

744
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:26,680
I love little girls, they make me feel so bad

745
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:31,840
When they're around, they make me feel like I'm the only guy in town

746
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:37,380
I love little girls, they make me feel so good

747
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:40,500
They don't care if I'm a one-way mirror

748
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,060
They don't write by my cold exterior

749
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,960
They don't

750
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,460
Ask me questions

751
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,000
They don't

752
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,580
Want to scold me

753
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,020
They don't

754
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,520
Look for answers

755
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,760
They just

756
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,600
Want to hold me

757
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,920
Isn't this fun?

758
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,640
What is this life all about?

759
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,000
Isn't this a dream come true?

760
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,720
Isn't this a nightmare?

761
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,440
Say you'll take my money

762
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,740
Say you'll take my clothes

763
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,740
Say you'll take my money

764
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,200
Tell me where to wear them

765
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:30,140
Become a piece out of this

766
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:37,680
Yeah, I got the money

767
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,020
You could ask me please

768
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:41,020


769
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:41,020


770
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:41,020


771
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:41,200
Try to be kind

772
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:41,280
Good times like them

773
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,360
It's been a while

774
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,200
And me, me, me

775
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:44,740
It's been a while

776
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:44,740


777
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:44,740


778
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:44,740


779
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:44,980
So true

780
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:44,980


781
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:54,080
Everything in the world, dear friends, it does take a freak.

782
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,320
So, so, well, we just got a call from a listener saying,

783
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,880
yeah, we'll join you in that mighty subgenius parade.

784
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:08,840
Actually, it's the K-N-O-N parade, but we got to get out there, folks,

785
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:13,640
and flaunt our abnormality to let it all hang out.

786
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:20,180
You know, we got to stay zipped up, so to speak, but...

787
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:26,480
There's letting it all hang out, and then there's public indecency.

788
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,020
Oh, and how would you define indecency, dear sister?

789
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,640
Would you care to define some right now?

790
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,500
Oh, yes, dear friends.

791
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,200
Well, this is a family show, so...

792
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:40,860
We better stop.

793
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,140
Or else educate them.

794
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,140
Family listening.

795
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:43,620
That's right.

796
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:43,620


797
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:43,620


798
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,600
The most important part.

799
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,720
Actually, we've got a copy.

800
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:50,140
We've got copies here tonight of both the Kama Sutra.

801
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,540
Ah, yes, the Kama Sutra.

802
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,960
I remember reading it to the goat woman after the state fair.

803
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,480
It worked wonders.

804
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,260
I love the state fair.

805
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,660
I saw lots of interesting things with goats out there.

806
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,580
They had a company out there, True Story.

807
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,860
It was, it was...

808
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,260
Don't mention True Stories to me, sister.

809
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,980
Magnum Seaman Works.

810
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,460
And they had...

811
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:18,560
Well, do anything for a buck on their card, and I believed it when I saw them selling semen under the table.

812
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:26,880
Those sailors out there, those mighty sailors, semen on the bounding main, so to speak.

813
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,820
Well, these were all in a little glass tube.

814
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:34,760
And proof, proof, dear friends, proof is all around us.

815
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:40,800
But, you know, Bob called sex the divine battle.

816
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,900
But is there an unbridgeable, undestroyable...

817
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,920
...barrier between men and women that will keep them forever warring against each other?

818
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:49,380
A.

819
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,340
I mean, uh...

820
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:58,220
You know, we believe that the, although the war between the states lasted only a few years,

821
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,580
the war between men and women is an ongoing process that shall never end.

822
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,680
But, friends, you better, you better praise Bob for that.

823
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,120
So don't succumb to humanist thinking.

824
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,520
Get out there and fight to the death.

825
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:17,940
The, the heavy combat of love, dear friends.

826
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,040
Huh!

827
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:23,700
Well, love doesn't always enter into it, remember that.

828
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,380
It takes a freak.

829
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,460
They said last time.

830
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,600
That's what the sign around their neck said.

831
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,780
White girls, they're pretty funny.

832
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,280
Sometimes they drive me mad.

833
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,600
Black girls just want to get...

834
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,300
Bob?

835
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:40,860
...don't know.

836
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,240
I just don't have that much chance.

837
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:43,940
Oh, yeah!

838
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:45,320
Help me, somebody.

839
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,960
Chinese girls are so gentle.

840
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,920
A little, such a tease.

841
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:58,260
You never know what power's gonna cook you inside those silky sleeves.

842
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,840
Give me all your money.

843
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,260
But, Reverend Belt.

844
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,080
Reverend Belt.

845
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,400
Yes, I'm sorry.

846
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,180
I was sitting here busy reading this.

847
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:11,760
I want to know why your copy of the Kamara Sutra don't have no pictures.

848
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:12,420
Oh, well...

849
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,440
Is this a Mieskommand?

850
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,760
Is this an exhibition expurgated report?

851
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:20,180
I took the pictures out to let them dry on the heater the other day.

852
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,440
Oh, yeah!

853
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,640
I should have worn a rubber glove.

854
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:29,160
Not only do we have in our possession the Kamara Sutra, but also the perfumed garden,

855
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:36,360
which is an ancient Arabic book translated, the treatise on love, translated by Sir Richard Burton.

856
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,100
Was that when he was married to Elizabeth Taylor?

857
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,540
No, this was a different Richard Burton.

858
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:43,440
This was one who lived...

859
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,020
Although there has always been a Richard Burton.

860
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:46,680
I'm sure.

861
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:50,840
And someday his head shall be launched in great rituals.

862
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,220
But that's years in the future.

863
00:44:53,880 --> 00:45:03,760
And, but this, these books, these old sex manuals have, will tell you a lot more than your modern day Bibles,

864
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,640
such as how to pick up girls and so forth.

865
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:11,880
This one here talks about men who are to be held in contempt, gals.

866
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,420
And you, I'm sure many of you know this.

867
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,580
Maybe you can identify with this.

868
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:15,200
It says here,

869
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:22,940
Know, O my sister, to whom God be merciful, that a man who is misshapen of coarse appearance,

870
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,140
and whose member...

871
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,460
Well, that's not going to...

872
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,320
Is contemptible...

873
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,180
Who's a member of a club?

874
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,500
...in the eyes of women.

875
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:36,420
And when such a man hath a bout with a woman, he does not do his business with vigor and in a manner to give her enjoyment.

876
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,760
He lays himself down upon her without previous toying.

877
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,320
He does not kiss her nor twine himself around her.

878
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:46,800
He does not bite her nor suck her lips nor tickle her.

879
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,460
That beast.

880
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:47,500
That beast.

881
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:50,920
And these are the pinks, my friends.

882
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,560
This is the pink style of physical love.

883
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:58,440
And I don't mean pink like, you know, in Penthouse...

884
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,300
No.

885
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,060
...or Hustler.

886
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:05,640
I'm talking about pink like, not like a baby's shiny behind, dear friends, but an evil...

887
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,680
Ooh.

888
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,580
...an evil kind of pinkness.

889
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:11,840
The pinkness of a McDonald's advertisement.

890
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,460
The pinkness of that person driving the Porsche that you know doesn't deserve it.

891
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,260
Amen. I do.

892
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,040
And a woman.

893
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,300
And a child.

894
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,940
Oh, bless the little children.

895
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:24,740
She fuck, she fuck, she fuck.

896
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,600
They do, don't they?

897
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,840
That's another good thing about families.

898
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:32,440
Yeah. Well, but you know, when you have kids, then they get your slack.

899
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,920
Boy, they sure do.

900
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:37,780
And especially when they wander into the bedroom at those inopportune times.

901
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,580
Or when they find your electrical devices.

902
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:45,980
Or when they find your Japanese manuals upon you.

903
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,640
Well, I bet you and I have many funny little...

904
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,740
We could tell.

905
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,420
...little anecdotes.

906
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:51,820
I could tell you embarrassing stories.

907
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,460
Yes.

908
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:56,160
From a woman who's lived better electrically, I'd rather not share any of them on the air.

909
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:57,780
Whew, praise Bob.

910
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:01,380
Yes, the solo fight of love.

911
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,940
But, as she said the other night...

912
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:05,000
Oh!

913
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,480
Hello, darling.

914
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,600
Hello, darling.

915
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:08,820
Hello, darling.

916
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:09,960
Hello, darling.

917
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,780
Hello, darling.

918
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:12,760
enga

919
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:16,480
Have you finished with dollars?

920
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,620
Don't come over.

921
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:26,580
Hey poor Mmmm...

922
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:26,580


923
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:26,580


924
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:26,580


925
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,880
Bring my wallet...

926
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,960
The Lord is around, let me help you...

927
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:36,960
Here!

928
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,960
Take this...

929
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,980
from a subgenius in England, Pete Scott.

930
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,960
Pete Scott, great Pete Scott.

931
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,200
But at the same time,

932
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,700
the fabulous Billy Goons had this to say

933
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:45,900
about the same subject.

934
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,500
Bang, bang, it said on the sixth floor

935
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,080
of the school book depository.

936
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:51,540
Oh!

937
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,240
I'm searching for that she's part of love.

938
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,820
Well, Bernie Smith says he knows a spot.

939
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,520
He says he's been there a lot.

940
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,300
He said he paid a visit.

941
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,280
Wait, now he flogs his bishop.

942
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,880
I'm searching for that she's part of love.

943
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:28,540
I'm searching for she's part of love.

944
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,400
I'm searching for she's part of your love.

945
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:33,200
Yeah, you will.

946
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,200
I'm searching here and there

947
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,780
deep inside your underwear.

948
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,960
I'm searching for she's part of your love.

949
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,500
I took that bishop to the middle kingdom.

950
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,300
It was like some wild animal show.

951
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,160
There were geeks and goons in here,

952
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,840
but the chief's wife was nowhere.

953
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,940
I'm searching for she's part of your love.

954
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,720
Come on, Allie!

955
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,960
I struck a new ground.

956
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:12,960


957
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,120
Gray

958
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:13,140
White

959
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:13,140


960
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:13,140


961
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:13,200
White

962
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,160
Blue

963
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:18,160


964
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:18,160


965
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:18,160


966
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:18,160


967
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:25,380
McLane

968
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:33,940
McLane

969
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:33,940


970
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:33,940


971
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:36,700
Milligan's friends searching for the G spot of your love.

972
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:37,860
That's Reverend Cleve Duncan.

973
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,600
I guess he's not, he sings in the background on that.

974
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,680
Went down on little Peggy Lee.

975
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,720
Said, baby, is this G spot I must see?

976
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,520
Said, feel it, use your head.

977
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,400
You'll never be misled.

978
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,140
I'm searching for that G spot of love.

979
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:02,100
Oh, friends, this is a juvenile hour of slack, isn't it?

980
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:02,900
It ain't that great.

981
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,120
Peter Pan shall never grow up, never grow old.

982
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,900
Now, what were you just talking about there, Reverend Chester?

983
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,920
I was confused.

984
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,040
I was so overwhelmed by that song.

985
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:22,380
I just, you know, you know, sex and karma in music these days is so intense.

986
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:28,220
You know, we use, we use sex as opposed to procreation to sell just everything.

987
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,400
While we use it to sell toilet paper.

988
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,460
Have you seen that commercial?

989
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:31,840
What the?

990
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:35,920
Woman in the diaphanous white gown and the naked little baby against her body.

991
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,920
Singing about toilet paper against the dark moon.

992
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:43,540
I kind of couldn't understand about the naked baby and the toilet paper

993
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:47,280
until I thought you hold that baby long enough you'll be using that toilet paper.

994
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:50,220
But we use, we use sex to sell everything.

995
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,780
And it's so prevalent in music.

996
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,020
Remember when it was whole lot of loving, whole lot of kissing.

997
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,080
You don't know what you've been missing.

998
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,340
Well, thanks to Prince and Madonna, now you do.

999
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:02,920
Oh, yes.

1000
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,860
Yeah, I love Madonna.

1001
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:10,100
She's done so much to enhance the image of young women in America today.

1002
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:16,300
Why, where else but in America could you see a young, overly underweared young lady

1003
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:21,540
dressed in excessively religious jewelry singing about being like a virgin.

1004
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:26,420
And now, praise her, she has at least gotten a little bit more respectable

1005
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:31,160
instead of like a virgin touched for the very first time, which was kind of boring to me.

1006
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:31,820
I don't know why.

1007
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:32,880
She'd be singing about that.

1008
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:35,400
I'm kind of distressed.

1009
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,180
You know, she was kind of indiscriminate.

1010
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:40,940
But now she's, she may be out having procreatory experiences.

1011
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,220
But dang it, she's being responsible.

1012
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:44,840
She's keeping her baby.

1013
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:46,800
Oh, friends.

1014
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:47,160
Yeah.

1015
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:50,800
And if you can't keep your baby, give it to the church.

1016
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:52,720
Yes, it's tax deductible.

1017
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:54,760
We've got the home for slackless children here.

1018
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:00,880
And friends, you know, you can't use, fetus brain tissue is a valuable resource in this country.

1019
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:05,800
We've had to go for the operations for the new over men and uber women.

1020
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:11,260
We've had to go to Malaysia, to China, because fetuses are so much more available in those places.

1021
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,280
Here, oh, they have sanctions against that sort of thing.

1022
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:18,620
But, you know, it's the only, fetus brain tissue is the only kind that will transplant.

1023
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,500
And, you know, because it doesn't reject.

1024
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,960
It's open to anything.

1025
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,580
And that's what you need to be.

1026
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,480
You need to blank your mind, dear friends.

1027
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:31,700
Blank it to everything except Bob or Connie, depending on your camp.

1028
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:34,900
And what you were endowed with by Wotan.

1029
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:35,960
Huh.

1030
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:42,020
And I don't care what people think.

1031
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:48,620
And I don't care how he looks when I'm not in my sleep.

1032
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,160
But this is not the whole story.

1033
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:11,160
Draperies, as I had now discovered, are much more than devices for the introduction of non-representational forms into naturalistic paintings and sculptures.

1034
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:20,740
What the rest of the normal see, only under the influence of drugs, the subgenius is congenitally equipped to see all the time.

1035
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:26,660
His perception is not limited to what is biologically or socially useful.

1036
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:27,920
A limit.

1037
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:36,900
A limit of the knowledge belonging to mind at large oozes past the reducing valve of brain and ego into his consciousness.

1038
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:42,420
It is a knowledge of the intrinsic significance of every existent.

1039
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:56,380
For the subgenius, as for the drug taker, draperies are living hieroglyphs that stand in some peculiarly expressive way for the unfathomable mystery of pure being.

1040
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:09,240
More even than the chair, though less, perhaps, than those wholly supernatural flowers, the folds of my gray flannel trousers were charged with isness.

1041
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:13,560
To what they owed this privileged status, I cannot say.

1042
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:26,360
Is it, perhaps, because the forms of folded drapery are so strange and dramatic that they catch the eye and in this way force the miraculous fact of sheer existence upon a man?

1043
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:26,360


1044
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:26,360


1045
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:26,360


1046
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:26,360


1047
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:26,360


1048
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:26,360


1049
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:26,360


1050
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:26,360


1051
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:26,360


1052
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:26,360


1053
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:26,360


1054
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:26,360


1055
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:26,360


1056
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:26,360


1057
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:26,360


1058
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:26,360


1059
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:26,360


1060
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:26,980
the attention?

1061
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:28,400
Look!

1062
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,280
Oh, yes, friends.

1063
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,940
You know, we just got another one of those calls

1064
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:44,640
where they go,

1065
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,100
Why are you doing this?

1066
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,820
It does, it does.

1067
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,800
It gets tougher and tougher, friends.

1068
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,060
And, uh, but,

1069
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,260
you know, I mean, why?

1070
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:57,380
Why would we, why would we?

1071
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:59,120
He said it was just as bad as those

1072
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,020
other bad religious shows.

1073
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:02,660
Friends,

1074
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,900
we've been trying so hard to be worse.

1075
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,400
We really have. I mean,

1076
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,360
it breaks my heart

1077
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:11,080
that we're doing this on the radio

1078
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,000
and no one has killed us yet.

1079
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,200
Do you realize what this says about America?

1080
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,720
We're number three.

1081
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,840
We're number three.

1082
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,640
So we're gonna just change tactics

1083
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,800
and just play some educational material

1084
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:23,840
here for you and I.

1085
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,240
Don't worry about it.

1086
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:26,560
Don't worry about it.

1087
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:27,580
Can you just say who's...

1088
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:28,660
It's not safe.

1089
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,640
No, it's not safe.

1090
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,380
Oh, get those calls.

1091
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:30,980
In Series 7,

1092
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,740
you learned about many of the interesting creatures

1093
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:35,200
who live on Mars,

1094
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,800
including the tiny, microscopic

1095
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:40,060
Gonococcus herihosia,

1096
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,540
or Martian peen worm.

1097
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,320
Today, with the help of a

1098
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,300
neutron micro-holographic scanner,

1099
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,920
we'll look into a dead Martian intestine,

1100
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,800
the peen worm's natural habitat,

1101
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:55,240
and see the whole life cycle,

1102
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:59,660
of this simple aeroniobe unfold as if by magic.

1103
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:03,380
As the miracle of reproduction begins,

1104
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:07,540
our lone hero is still a mere tube of psychoplasm.

1105
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,240
But soon, a frenzy of chemical activity

1106
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,300
called the Amphetophase seizes the microbe,

1107
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:18,100
and by the mysterious process called osmiotic blooming,

1108
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:19,900
it starts to clot.

1109
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:31,000
It grows a rudimentary megastamen and anthrax,

1110
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:34,780
and swiftly matures into the spore of sex A,

1111
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,520
the gameteoroid.

1112
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,420
Unscientifically, it might be called the male.

1113
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,920
He discovers his own nasophallosian tube,

1114
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,240
and performs hermaphroditics,

1115
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:56,360
which are a robotic autofusion,

1116
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,520
until he spills a secretion of preposterol.

1117
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:12,040
This triggers the morphase to begin,

1118
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,460
and up sprouts sex B,

1119
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:18,600
the so-called female, or nymph, load.

1120
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:35,040
Her thorax produces the Jovian knobs,

1121
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,160
and she even has a feeble nucleic eyeball,

1122
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,880
nearly as powerful as that of the male.

1123
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:46,460
A surprisingly complex courting ritual is initiated.

1124
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,080
She produces special chemicals called mojo bodies,

1125
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:52,680
which excite her partner.

1126
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:57,500
She places her stigmat on his cloacal apparatus,

1127
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,000
and performs parthenodulation.

1128
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:04,120
He achieves cytospasm and germiades.

1129
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,500
And, in nature's timeless tragedy,

1130
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:13,300
the helpless male falls victim to the eternal wiles of the female,

1131
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,380
leaving naught but a pool of albuminal spum.

1132
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:22,300
Using her oviduct as an oral groove,

1133
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:26,120
she saps every last trace of her former lover,

1134
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,040
as the layman would call him.

1135
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,720
Spermatogenocide is committed,

1136
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,880
and it's almost as if she's smiling.

1137
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,800
Now fertilized, she must drop the embryo system.

1138
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,580
The Gallin miles,

1139
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:00,300
which require a foldable body,

1140
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:00,360
are insMale by nature.

1141
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:01,320
So grateful is the poor perpetrator...

1142
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:16,580
The Foi şuào

1143
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:20,020
because he doesn't have any face.

1144
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:25,340
attention which was just the idea and friends they're all going to be down at that parade so

1145
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:33,440
hundreds and hundreds of seriously intense subgenius women who are looking for that

1146
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:39,960
opportunity to spread bob's word not going to manhandle any poor little girl

1147
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:45,560
and do you know that i have not been in a city for the last probably five or six years where i've

1148
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:50,240
not had to deal with children who this has been their affair since they were little children

1149
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,260
oh feel my love baby

1150
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:07,540
ears open for uh ron lindsey who's going to be coming in next to do the soul oldest show

1151
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:14,620
friends another form of slack slack you can drink out of your radio your friends oh yeah

1152
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:15,400

1153
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,920
the swinging love course is doing feel my love

1154
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,920

1155
01:00:55,400 --> 01:01:00,360
oh yes dear friends bob has a mighty big love for you and so does connie

1156
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:07,940
and there's room for all of us subgeniuses to crawl inside the mothership the escape

1157
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:14,240
vessels of the pleasure goddesses friends and and may and when that great rupture comes

1158
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,100
those

1159
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:21,800
Those who hate this show will be left down below on earth to fry in a hell of their own making.

1160
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,300
And we'll wave, we'll kind of be waving goodbyes.

1161
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:30,660
We're transformed into new bodies and new souls.

1162
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:35,560
Oh, yes.

1163
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:37,720
Happy trails to you.

1164
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:47,740
Friends, and you can, you, there are some few out there who intuitively know that, you know, you're not joiners.

1165
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,080
You don't want to join some cult.

1166
01:01:50,640 --> 01:02:04,320
But you do want to save your wallet in the end times when the strange occurrences that come about during the tribulation period.

1167
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,740
And friends, there's going to be diseases.

1168
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:09,220
You think there's bad diseases around now.

1169
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:10,600
You ain't seen nothing yet.

1170
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,280
So you're going to want to write for information from Bob Dobbs.

1171
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:19,580
Because only, you know, Bob is not the answer, but neither is anything else.

1172
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:25,720
And it takes a lot to realize that to get to the point where you can pull the wool over your own eyes.

1173
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,660
Oh, yes.

1174
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:29,880
And so we're coming to the end of another hour of slack.

1175
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:33,140
So sad that they only allow you one hour.

1176
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,360
But you need to write to Bob.

1177
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:35,280
Get that pencil ready.

1178
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:39,000
At the mighty, the mighty P.O. Box.

1179
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:43,560
And you don't even have to send money or anything.

1180
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,200
But it would be appreciated.

1181
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:51,960
Hold that envelope on your lap and think for a while about Connie or Bob or both.

1182
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:56,440
And drop it in the mail to P.O. Box 140.
