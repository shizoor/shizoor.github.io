1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:05,220
Stuck in a nowhere job? Tired of rhetoric about privacy rights,

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,840
illegal seizure, or innocence until proven guilty?

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,220
Don't get PO'd, join the P-lease.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,640
Yes, the P-lease, America's fastest growing organ of law enforcement.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,160
In just one day, you'll become a highly trained urinalysis deputy,

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,780
empowered by law to make on-the-spot urine checks.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,040
Watch the fun as you make them drop drawers and pee in a cup anywhere.

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,020
In crowded elevators, in church, or family barbecues.

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,600
If any testees have used illegal substances in the last six years, you'll know.

10
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,940
And as a P-lease deputy, you'll have the power to impound,

11
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,160
imprison, confiscate everything they own, including illegal substances.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,880
So the next time you hear them say civil rights, don't get PO'd, join the P-lease.

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,200
Just send $2, cash, check, money order, or credit card to

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,560
Urine Trouble, One Vicious Circle, Utter Missouri 1330.

15
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,920
Act now while off or last and get the amazing little stoolie fecal sampler.

16
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,560
Don't get PO'd, join the P-lease.

17
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,600
You say the taxman just took away your barrel and your bleep is freezing in a high wind.

18
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:14,400
Your car just made a sound like a dying moose and came to a halt on the off ramp after spitting out a bucket of gear teeth.

19
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,640
Just finished knocking back your third bottle of NyQuil during the Ren and Stimpy Festival

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,080
and you feel like taking a whiz on the electric fence.

21
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,520
The aliens removed your brain for their pathology studies and you don't even care?

22
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,000
Well, my friend, you're ready for a big healthy dose of the Stimpy Festival.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,460
The subgenius hour of slack.

24
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,740
No one knows how to put the m-huh back in Christmas like J.R. Bob Dobbs and his twisted henchman, the Reverend Ivan Stang.

25
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,940
Your good friends and prayer partners in your bid to secure your place in hell and stop worrying about all this unapproachable crapola.

26
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:48,840
So, refuse to take your medication for a week and tie yourself to the kitchen chair for the next neuron-poppin' episode of

27
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:56,680
The Subgenius Hour of Slack on that bastion of bogus southern hospitality, K-N-O-N, 89.3 FM in almighty Dallas, Texas.

28
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,980
Where the horses have silver wings, the whales have wings, and the birds have wings.

29
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,160
The girls all speak French and the politicians are honest.

30
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,420
Yeah, right, and Ross Perot's gonna pay off my student loan, too.

31
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,180
I mean, praise Bob!

32
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:14,540
Subgenius Hour of Slack

33
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,000
Have the technology, have the tapes.

34
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,040
Bob told me to make this. Not gonna resist.

35
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:23,700
And if during the proceedings a small chlorine-oxypropylene bag should drop down, open the receiving flap and inhale deeply.

36
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,580
Don't ask questions.

37
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,320
Prepare to have your mind scanned for possible bozosaurian traces.

38
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,260
Scanning now.

39
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:53,700
The only people here are people. They're the advanced techno-droids.

40
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,960
Techno-droids can't hold up much of a congressman.

41
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,300
The first of the subgenius.

42
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,220
For amusement they toss children into pits with hungry dogs.

43
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,700
Are we not, men?

44
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,200
We are the subgenius!

45
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,580
In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti, Amen.

46
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,820
Nones. No sense of humour.

47
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,560
Continuing. Take notes if need be. Call for assistance. Operators are standing by. Forward when notified. Void where prohibited.

48
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:35,380
Visitors only. Ten minute parking. Do not fold, spindle or mutilate except in the presence of Krishna, Mohammed, Buddha, Jehovah, Vincent Price or Bob.

49
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,620
There's the only one.

50
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,820
He is the strongest of all the immortals. He is the perfect one.

51
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,380
We are incidentally guested this morning by a distinguished member of the clergy.

52
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,780
The Right Reverend Archbishop.

53
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:07,320
I am happy to say that I have received a vision from J.R. Dobbs that you have been promoted to Archbishop.

54
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:07,880
Praise Bob.

55
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,100
Oh God, that's news to me.

56
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,180
That's pretty exciting.

57
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,460
I was just a sacred scribe until half an hour ago.

58
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,800
Well, I guess being on this national broadcast has had a very good reaction.

59
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,380
We had a story yesterday that I'd like to get to the bottom of, frankly, about cow mutilation.

60
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,400
Now, these cows were suffering from having their udders removed.

61
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,840
Their peni were sliced off, surgically I might add.

62
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,940
With incredible surgical precision.

63
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,660
Yes, it was.

64
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,460
And the other thing that was reamed out was their rectum.

65
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:51,180
I have no idea why anyone, and I quote from the Bible to give some testimony to the fact that this is going.

66
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,420
The fire of God is on.

67
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:59,360
God is fallen from heaven and hath burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them.

68
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,400
Am I only the escaped one alone to tell thee of?

69
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,860
That of course is Job chapter 1 verse 16.

70
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:09,840
Job.

71
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,600
Nowadays when you've got a stale economy you call them Job.

72
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,000
Job.

73
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,720
Cattle mutilations.

74
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,840
Can I give you some facts and see if you can verify these for me?

75
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,780
Oh, please do.

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,020
I am advised by a study done by my research director, Rob Robbie.

77
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:39,000
A tiny percentage are done by miscellaneous small cults like Satanists and the Davidians, bikers, etc.

78
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:52,620
About 10% are done by one major Odinist right wing Christian cult composed mostly of Texas oil millionaires who are essentially seeking, I guess, a ritualistic way of curing their impotence.

79
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,880
Now you know what Ross Perot does in his spare time.

80
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,860
Cattle mutilations.

81
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,700
Yeah, well he's got the silent choppers and, you know, all the equipment.

82
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,920
Well, I guess you really need it.

83
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,520
And the motivation.

84
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:21,220
I am advised, sir, and I am glad I have you face to face because I don't like to back down from these types of confrontations, but I am advised that a great deal of subgeniuses, part of your church, all right, fresh from Dobstown on their first initiation test,

85
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,600
are involved in these things.

86
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,200
And that they are not doing these mutilations and that it's not done as a test of their mettle.

87
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:37,360
It's a scientific fact that the only proper way, well, to define the future is by reading fresh animal bowels.

88
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,580
Well, I'm sorry.

89
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,720
This is a serious matter.

90
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,340
Hey, it's right there in Book of the Subgenius.

91
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,260
It says so right there in Black and White.

92
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,340
It does say that then.

93
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,560
Then you have admitted to that.

94
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,560
Well, sure.

95
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:56,340
I mean, you haven't lived until you've gone out on a nice little cattle mutilation initiation hunt.

96
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,160
Probably the largest and most ruthless gang of saboteurs in this country.

97
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,360
I know.

98
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,200
For six months they thought I was one of them.

99
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:12,460
For all the lawyers, doctors, ex-wives, and all the other gold diggers out there.

100
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,700
What is it, man?

101
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,680
Oh, and let them die with dignity.

102
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,300
Why, you.

103
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,000
You dirty.

104
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,800
But, boss, but, but, but, but.

105
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,820
Isn't it wonderful what you can do with some wire and a few electric bulbs?

106
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,940
A little child looks up at me, sometimes with their eyes open.

107
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,000
You know, right about 500 grams is when their eyes begin to open.

108
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,820
A half staff turns to me and says, Dr. Forroth, what do we do?

109
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,280
I didn't come in here with three points and a poem today.

110
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,540
I could care less whether you think I can preach a lick or not.

111
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,420
You understand that?

112
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:54,080
All I care about is saying, Thus saith the Spirit of God.

113
00:07:54,220 --> 00:08:04,120
All I care about is getting in the mountain and standing behind that desk with lips anointed from coals off the fire, ready to declare the word of the living God.

114
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,480
And I'm ready.

115
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,400
They were red as crimson, now they're white as wool.

116
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,780
You don't have to encourage somebody that knew they were a dirty rotten hunk of stink and sinful flesh.

117
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:32,300
No matter how you slice it up, no matter how you dice it out, it's still another eucystic, if it feels good to do it, anything goes, drug-induced hallucinogenic experience.

118
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:40,720
Well, we're speaking now, of course, as you know, with Father Joe Mama, who is at the end of the Democratic Convention parties.

119
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,840
We're looking down on the floor.

120
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,460
You can see at the subgenius convention just what happened.

121
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,380
We heard the news about Jesus and the handgun.

122
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,060
We'll be going to descriptions of that soon.

123
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,300
We just wondered what you saw from where you were.

124
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:58,640
Well, I felt that the proceedings were very interesting from an academic standpoint, of course.

125
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,360
I can say that without any hesitation.

126
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,000
That is, without any hesitation.

127
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,460
That the chaos that ensued was typical of that.

128
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:21,960
It was involving any sort of political assassination.

129
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,780
I personally think Jesus is a papsy.

130
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,500
Yeah.

131
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,960
He, uh, this magic bullet theory.

132
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,120
Yeah, me too.

133
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,020
The magic splinter theory also.

134
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:35,960
There are all these theories.

135
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:36,980
They're just theories.

136
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:47,220
Well, I mean, you know, I mean, they'd only try to, only Jesus would be accused of being able to kill a man with one bullet with three different entry rules.

137
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,840
I mean, you know, what do they think this guy is?

138
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,600
Some sort of God?

139
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,920
I mean, let's get real.

140
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,240
I believe we got a whole lot of folks sitting in church think they're saved that aren't.

141
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,520
That's the reason we got to hire 14 more preachers to counsel them all day long.

142
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,160
Shout now!

143
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,380
Shout now!

144
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:07,240
Oh!

145
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:17,200
Brother Rod, don't put that condemnation on me.

146
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,760
Let's play God.

147
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,720
My dear young man, you know as well as I do that God is dying all over the world.

148
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,060
Man invented him but doesn't need him anymore.

149
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,600
Man is God now.

150
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,320
As a matter of fact, he always was.

151
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,220
Overpopulation, pollution, famine, nuclear holocaust, war.

152
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,540
This civilization is driving us into the sea of extinction.

153
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,260
The keynote is control.

154
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,620
That's the province of politicians, not scientists.

155
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,640
Yes, but we're the only ones who are trying to combat the problem now.

156
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:05,680
In 20 years' time, we will be in positions of power and then we'll be ready to act for the good of humanity.

157
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:13,800
Ah, just like the church of the subgenius, dear friends.

158
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,180
Ah.

159
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:15,520
Ah.

160
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:24,480
We've been, uh, enjoying media barrages here on the Hour of Slack from many of our friends,

161
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,520
starting with the P. Lise by Brain Rot Theater,

162
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:35,880
uh, the Hell Pope Huey's new contributions and promos,

163
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,340
Reverend Joe Riley's evil bulldada barrage,

164
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,280
and the barrages of Dr. Legume,

165
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,460
and, uh, KHSU subgenius show,

166
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,540
and good Reverend Morton Downey,

167
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:56,300
and a wonderful collection of Reverend Parsley

168
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:02,300
from our dear friend Reverend Uncle Jimmy,

169
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:09,960
as well as some KPFA Berkeley puzzling evidence and Papa Joe Mama,

170
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,340
and more of these things coming up.

171
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,960
Uh, friends,

172
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,300
uh, by the way,

173
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,100
as, uh, Vincent Price was just saying there,

174
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,880
we got an amazing document in the mail,

175
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,320
uh, a top, uh, a copy of what supposedly is top secret material,

176
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,140
a document called Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars,

177
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:42,620
a blueprint for your eventual enslavement.

178
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:47,180
And, uh, I, I don't want to say who sent this to us.

179
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,560
Of course, this could, I suppose, possibly, uh, be a hoax.

180
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,420
Uh, whoa.

181
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:59,640
Oh, I can't put, I can't use that tape, friends, that tape deck.

182
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,060
I'm gonna use this one up here.

183
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,740
Did you hear that, that noise that came in?

184
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,320
There's no telling what they were trying to do to us there with that one.

185
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,920
But, you know, as the preface to this thing says here,

186
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,600
conspiracy theories are not a thing.

187
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,360
They're not new in history.

188
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:18,100
For example, plots to kill Caesar and overthrow Rome abounded.

189
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,940
But there are many who go out of their way to ridicule and silence

190
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,840
those who today speak of conspiracies.

191
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,740
Why do you think they don't want people to think about conspiracies?

192
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,440
Seldom does hard evidence emerge that by its very content indicates

193
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,460
it serves as a blueprint for a conspiracy.

194
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:42,140
Yet the very nature and information in the top secret Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars

195
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,100
introductory programming manual reads like a government technical manual

196
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,720
from some secret group of think tank planners who have put many years of research

197
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,360
and development into creating a new science of social engineering

198
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,720
so they can better manipulate the masses.

199
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,940
This document was uncovered quite by accident on July 7th, 1986,

200
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:10,340
when an employee of Boeing Aircraft Company purchased a surplus IBM copier

201
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,240
for scrap parts at a sale.

202
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,980
And discovered inside details of a plan hatched in the embryonic days

203
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:22,680
of the Cold War which called for control of the masses through manipulation

204
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,980
of industry, people's pastimes, education and political leanings.

205
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:31,760
It called for a quiet revolution pitting brother against brother

206
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,020
and diverting the public's attention from what was really going on.

207
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,280
And friends, here are some of the excerpts from this amazing document.

208
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,880
Energy is recognized as the key to all activity on Earth.

209
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,840
Natural science is the study of the sources of control of natural energy

210
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,980
and social science, theoretically expressed as economics,

211
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:06,300
is the study of the sources and control of social energy.

212
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,700
All science is merely a means to an end.

213
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,580
The means is knowledge. The end is control.

214
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,760
Beyond this remains only one issue.

215
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,720
Who will be the beneficiary?

216
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,720
In 1954, this was the issue of primary concern.

217
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,760
Although the so-called moral issues were raised,

218
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,800
in view of the law of natural selection,

219
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:38,780
it was agreed that a nation or world of people who will not use their intelligence

220
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,200
are no better than animals,

221
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,740
animals who do not have intelligence.

222
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:51,680
Such people are beasts of burden and stakes on the table by choice and consent.

223
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,940
Consequently, in the interest of future world order, peace and tranquility,

224
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:03,640
it was decided to privately wage a quiet war against the American public

225
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:08,360
with an ultimate objective of permanently shifting the natural and social energy,

226
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,180
or wealth,

227
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,780
of the undisciplined and irresponsible many

228
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:19,620
into the hands of the self-disciplined, responsible and worthy few.

229
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:26,420
In order to implement this objective, it was necessary to create, secure and apply new weapons,

230
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,820
which, as it turned out, were a class of weapons so subtle and sophisticated

231
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,920
in their principle of operation and public appearance

232
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,160
as to earn for themselves the name of society.

233
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:48,440
In conclusion, the objective of economic research as conducted by the magnates of capital, banking,

234
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,460
and the industries of goods and services,

235
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:59,100
is the establishment of an economy which is totally predictable and manipulatable.

236
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,540
In order to achieve a totally predictable economy,

237
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,180
the lower class elements of society must be brought under total control.

238
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:15,020
i.e., must be housebroken, trained, and assigned a yoke,

239
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,380
and long-term social duties from a very early age,

240
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,700
before they have an opportunity to question the propriety of the matter.

241
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,340
In order to achieve such conformity,

242
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:35,240
the lower class family unit must be disintegrated by a process of increasing preoccupation of the parents

243
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,160
and the establishment of government-operated daycare centers.

244
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,260
The lower class must be given the highest education,

245
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,700
and the highest education must be given to the children of the lower class.

246
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,480
The quality of education given to the lower class must be of the poorest sort,

247
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,440
so that the mote of ignorance isolating the inferior class from the superior class

248
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,320
is and remains incomprehensible to the inferior class.

249
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,600
With such an initial handicap, even bright lower class individuals

250
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,540
will have little, if any, hope of extricating themselves

251
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,260
from their assigned lot in life.

252
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:16,560
This form of slavery is essential to maintaining some measure of social order,

253
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,040
peace, and tranquility for the ruling class.

254
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:29,920
The silent weapon shoots situations instead of bullets,

255
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,380
is propelled by data processing instead of chemical reactions,

256
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,160
originating from bits of data instead of grains of gunpowder,

257
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,680
from a computer instead of a gun,

258
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,480
operated by a computer programmer instead of a marksman,

259
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,100
and under the orders of a banking magnate instead of a military general.

260
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,360
The public cannot comprehend this weapon,

261
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:01,700
and therefore cannot believe that they are being attacked and subdued by a weapon.

262
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,340
The public might instinctively feel that something is wrong,

263
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,160
but because of the technical nature of the silent weapon,

264
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,740
cannot express their feeling in a rational way or handle the problem with intelligence.

265
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,260
Therefore, they do not know how to cry for help.

266
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:26,280
Ah yes, and then it goes on to describe the silent weapon, dear friends.

267
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,860
Mr. Rothschild's energy discovery,

268
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:33,420
apparent capital as a paper inductor and so forth,

269
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:40,280
and they use a sort of shock testing by which the prices of commodities are shocked

270
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,960
and the public consumer reaction is monitored.

271
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:48,700
The resulting echoes of the economic shock are interpreted theoretically by computers,

272
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,520
and the psycho-economic structure of the economy is thus discovered.

273
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:58,800
It is by this process that partial differential and difference matrix,

274
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,460
that define the family household,

275
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,860
make possible its evaluation as an economic industry,

276
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:13,100
or in other words the household as dissipative consumer structure.

277
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:19,620
Then the response of the household to future shocks can be predicted and manipulated,

278
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,660
and society becomes a real regulated animal

279
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:28,840
with its reins under the control of a sophisticated computer regulated society.

280
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,900
The social energy bookkeeping system.

281
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,640
Eventually, every individual element of the structure comes under computer control

282
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,600
through a knowledge of personal preferences,

283
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,560
such knowledge guaranteed by computer association of consumer preferences.

284
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,340
Through the universal product code, or UPC,

285
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,620
the zebra stripe pricing codes on packages,

286
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,420
with identified consumers,

287
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,900
identified via association with the use of a credit card,

288
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:04,880
and later a permanent tattooed body number invisible under normal ambient illumination.

289
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:13,600
The document, dear friends, then goes on to describe the formula

290
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,580
for the economic model of the silent weaponry,

291
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,780
with various diagrams of the three industrial classes,

292
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,140
and looks sort of almost electronic,

293
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:31,200
the way it's laid out with the E-model of economic inductance,

294
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:36,140
time flow relationships, and self-destructive oscillations.

295
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:42,380
And then it comes to this little situation here, dear friends,

296
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,860
by which we find that the social welfare program

297
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:52,700
is nothing more than an open-ended credit balance system,

298
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,120
which creates a false capital system,

299
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,300
and a false industry to give non-productive people

300
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,780
a roof over their heads and food in their stomachs.

301
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,300
This can be useful, however,

302
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,460
because the recipients become state property

303
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,960
in return for the gift of social welfare.

304
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,340
They become a standing army for the elite,

305
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:20,440
for he who pays the piper picks the tune.

306
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,020
Those who get hooked on the economic drug

307
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,900
must go to the elite for a fix.

308
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,900
In this, the method of introducing large amounts

309
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,220
of stabilizing capacitance is by borrowing

310
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,360
on the future credit of the world.

311
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,060
This is the fourth law of motion,

312
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,600
and consists of performing an action

313
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,060
and leaving the system before the reaction

314
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,120
returns to the point of action,

315
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,360
a delayed reaction, and by this means,

316
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,000
politicians become popular in their own right,

317
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,780
and the public pays for it later.

318
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,160
In fact, the measure of such a politician

319
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,860
is the delay time.

320
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,780
The same thing is achieved by a government

321
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,960
printing money beyond the limit of gross national product,

322
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,360
an economic process called inflation.

323
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,980
This puts a large quantity of money

324
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,180
in the hands of the public

325
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,840
and maintains a balance against their greed,

326
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,920
creates a false self-confidence in them,

327
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,060
and for a while, stays the wolf

328
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,440
from the door.

329
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:28,180
But they must eventually resort to war

330
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,340
to balance the account,

331
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,840
because war ultimately is merely the act

332
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,160
of destroying the creditor,

333
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,760
and the politicians are the publicly hired hitmen

334
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,260
that justify the act to keep the responsibility

335
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,200
and blood off the public conscience.

336
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,260
If the people really cared about their fellow man,

337
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,280
they would control their appetites,

338
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,380
their greed, their procreation, etc.,

339
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,560
so that they would not have to operate

340
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,240
on a credit or welfare social system

341
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,820
which steals from the worker to satisfy the bum.

342
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,440
Since most of the general public

343
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,300
will not exercise restraint,

344
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,080
there are only two alternatives

345
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:19,680
to reduce the economic inductance of the system.

346
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,680
One,

347
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:25,220
let the population bludgeon each other to death in war,

348
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,360
which only results in the total destruction

349
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,160
of the living earth,

350
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,320
or two,

351
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,700
take control of the world

352
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,600
by the use of economic silent weapons

353
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,700
in a form of quiet warfare

354
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,480
and reduce the economic inductance of the world

355
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,560
to a safe level

356
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,700
by a process of benevolent slavery and genocide.

357
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,440
The latter option

358
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,220
has been taken as the obviously better option.

359
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,960
At this point, it should be crystal clear to the reader

360
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,460
why absolute secrecy about the silent weapons is necessary.

361
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,180
The general public refuses to improve its own mentality

362
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,380
and its faith in its fellow man.

363
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,620
It has become a herd of proliferating barbarians

364
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:16,000
and, so to speak, a blight upon the face of the earth.

365
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,380
They do not care enough about economic science

366
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,220
to learn why they have not been able to avoid war

367
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,060
despite religious morality,

368
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,020
and their religious or self-gratifying refusal

369
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,240
to deal with earthly problems

370
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,380
renders the solution of the earthly problem

371
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,960
unreachable by them.

372
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,000
It is left to those few

373
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,640
who are truly willing to think and survive

374
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,720
as the fittest to survive

375
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,520
to solve the problem for themselves

376
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,580
as the few who really care.

377
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:51,780
Otherwise,

378
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,880
exposure of the silent weapon

379
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,860
would destroy our only hope

380
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:03,320
of preserving the seed of future true humanity.

381
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,680
And see, dear friends,

382
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,140
I have gone and just

383
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,240
exposed the secret of the silent weapon over the radio,

384
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,320
destroying their hope

385
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,780
of preserving the seed of future true humanity,

386
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,780
but since when, my friend,

387
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,560
did we need to preserve full-blooded humanity?

388
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,120
Why, the full-blood human has not a drop of yeti blood in it,

389
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,020
and I don't see any point in us mollycoddling those people.

390
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,940
And as far as I'm concerned,

391
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,400
you should respond to this,

392
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,560
the secrets revealed in this document,

393
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,300
obviously written by the higher-ups in the conspiracy itself,

394
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:45,820
by...

395
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,480
uh, contributing to your voice

396
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,780
of the Church of the Subgenius in your area, dear friend.

397
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,400
Ah, yes,

398
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,160
because, uh, we love you

399
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,560
and want to save you from that

400
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,040
evil,

401
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,920
evile

402
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:06,960
conspiros.

403
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,500
Ah, yes.

404
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:22,920
You are always glory forever and same.

405
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,060
God understands.

406
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,580
He doesn't condemn you.

407
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:32,960
No!

408
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,440
Excuse me!

409
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,320
God does not understand!

410
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,720
No!

411
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,120
Excuse me!

412
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,980
God does not understand!

413
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,880
I was moist and fully self-actualized,

414
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,960
brimming with the vital juices of life,

415
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,520
a hero to every guy,

416
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,640
a source of lust to every girl,

417
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,440
and the nightmare of every mom.

418
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,300
Yes, I was flying high

419
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,500
and leaving a trail of delightful turmoil in my fetid wake,

420
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,820
but just as I thought it couldn't get any better,

421
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,320
just when I thought I was about to be elected God,

422
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,680
so as I could fix this mess good and proper once and for all,

423
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,720
Nigi sucked me dry.

424
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,320
I had my Harley all tuned up for a turf-ripping run

425
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,820
through the fields of middle-class complacency.

426
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,800
I was set to teach the fair maidens of the cheerleading society

427
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,680
what it meant to be left widespread,

428
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,820
grass-stained, and sweaty in the wake of my gladular excesses.

429
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,620
All thoughts of Tupperware, pink bows, and evening news

430
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:38,620
over a nice dinner skewered on the pike of my flaming societal rage.

431
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,720
Oh, yes!

432
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,780
I was fully prepared to set fire to everything in sight,

433
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,800
burning new pathways in the brains of the pink and mule-like masses.

434
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,780
I was a sling-struck, grumbling scum who haunt the malls,

435
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,180
making even my occasional excursions thereof

436
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,340
in pursuit of some minor plastic crap,

437
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,660
a sleigh ride through hell unbounded.

438
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,040
I was fully loaded and snorting

439
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,120
with hellish anticipation of the unforgettable rampage

440
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,140
which would splash the front pages of magazines and newspapers worldwide.

441
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:08,760
But suddenly, Nigi sucked me dry.

442
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,020
The lab was fully stocked.

443
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,320
The delivering subjects strapped down.

444
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,520
The batteries charged and the electrodes in place.

445
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,660
The drill bits were sharpened.

446
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,140
The clamps well-oiled.

447
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,100
The beakers filled with the vile fluids of my intent.

448
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,080
The hookahs were primed.

449
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,320
The incense burning.

450
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:36,840
The sacrificial chickens, goats, former employers, and imaginary enemies drugged and ready.

451
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,020
The generators were churning.

452
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,240
The light bill paid.

453
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:45,240
The guns loaded with the best explosive shells money could buy.

454
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,360
But suddenly, Nigi sucked me dry.

455
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,700
Summary.

456
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,480
This revealed at the provided only apartment,

457
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,660
due to removing engine load accenter of a right

458
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,800
cedering these pulse changes at three of this test,

459
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,460
were reinforcement of this crush of the horizontal barrier barrier.

460
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:12,260
Anthropomorphic dummies were reduced by removing strumant zone two.

461
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,300
Results are listed.

462
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,640
And the impact became clear the experience.

463
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,900
Demonstructural integrity.

464
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,020
And results, intrusion of the D-sectives.

465
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:28,580
Although the moment zone femur locations not pre and were 44.1 mile per hour intrusional, X.

466
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,460
Accelerometry.

467
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,740
Rather compartment and post-test measurement.

468
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,780
Injury criteria or damage.

469
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,520
Oh!

470
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,760
You can wear a fake beard and dark glasses.

471
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,240
You can trade buses, planes and rickshaws till you're dizzy.

472
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,640
You can nail the basement door shut.

473
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,700
Crank up the anti-virus programs.

474
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,980
Turn out the lights and muzzle the kids.

475
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:55,960
You can wear three rubbers, a gas mask and a raincoat and nothing else.

476
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,680
You can buy an arsenal of automatic weapons and nerve gases.

477
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,940
You can build your own pocket nuke.

478
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,180
You can dig a moat around the house and fill it with piranha.

479
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:10,400
You can buy a six pack of slobbering pit bulls and a gross of tigers for the perimeter.

480
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:19,480
You can put in voice print, retina print and tongue print computers with criss-cross lasers aimed at the doormat where the subject to be scanned will stand.

481
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:24,640
You can hire Batman, Hannibal Lecter and Hulk Hogan for bodyguards.

482
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:30,680
You can fly straight up in the air, screaming like a banshee, flinging fluids and vital organs everywhere.

483
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:38,980
But sooner or later, no matter how far you run or how big your gun, you're gonna have to look in the mirror like everybody else.

484
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,260
And admit to yourself.

485
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,000
Negi sucked me dry.

486
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,240
I'm gonna have to go to the bathroom and get my ass kicked.

487
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,560
Excuse me, God does not understand.

488
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,980
Excuse me, God does not understand.

489
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:31,740
Excuse me, God does not understand.

490
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:31,800
Excuse me, God does not understand.

491
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,960
You said I'd pick up my foot, but he'd put it down.

492
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,160
You said the steps of a good man are ordered of the Lord.

493
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,200
Lord, I don't want to fall in the ditch.

494
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,800
I don't want to be the blind leading the blind.

495
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:52,220
God, I need the Holy Ghost conviction to keep me on the right track, to keep me in the center of your will, to keep me progressing toward the glory.

496
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:56,660
I'm destined for the throne, and I refuse to take a bypass.

497
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,820
I refuse.

498
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:06,800
And we've got slaughtered men and women of God laying around us like cordwood.

499
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,260
They're dead. The life's gone out of them.

500
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,040
No unction, no anointing.

501
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:11,740
You know why?

502
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,460
They refused conviction.

503
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,500
They were numb to conviction.

504
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,720
They turned a deaf ear to the wooing voice of the Spirit of God, and now they're dead.

505
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,940
My God, that's worth the price of admission.

506
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,800
I know his name.

507
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,860
We didn't leave with Lucifer.

508
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,920
Telephone rang.

509
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,100
He would not stop.

510
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,480
It's President Kennedy calling me up.

511
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,560
He said, my friend Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?

512
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:51,680
I said, my friend John, the subgenius must have slack.

513
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,960
The subgenius.

514
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:53,760
Big boy.

515
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:54,900
Ring.

516
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,240
Ring, ring, ring, ring.

517
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,420
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.

518
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,320
Remember, there's a big difference between kneeling down and bending over.

519
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,580
We didn't leave with Lucifer.

520
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,780
Kill Bob.

521
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:06,940
Bob!

522
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,700
I know what you want.

523
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,740
You want to kill me.

524
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:19,720
.

525
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:19,820
.

526
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,900
.

527
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:26,720
.

528
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:26,900
.

529
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:26,960
.

530
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,160
can, you know, shoot the s*** with the best of them.

531
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,120
But what about nectar?

532
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,520
Well, when the fly finds it's time to mate, or rut,

533
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:52,540
he puts out his feelers, turns up his olfactory and other sensory nerve inputs,

534
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:57,360
and scans the horizon for the piquant, marshmallow smell of a female fly in heat.

535
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,260
Ah, lucky fellow, he's found one.

536
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:04,720
Yes, her mysterious dance seems to lift up his day and light up his night.

537
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,000
But it's all right.

538
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,800
As she comes to accept him, it's no secret that the fly's orgasmic pleasure

539
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,720
is matched only by his built-in proportionate inability to remain in a fixed location for any length of time.

540
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:19,060
For no sooner has the mating couple filled each other's goby nodules with albumin and spoo

541
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:23,520
than the fly, ever-touring, ever-seeking nectar, flies off to another destination,

542
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:27,580
smiling all the while as the facets in his mirror-like covering reflect grace,

543
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,500
land and mansions of endless stars,

544
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:33,320
thus filling in the blank spaces of nature's lost address book.

545
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,700
Is it all in the name of nature?

546
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:34,960
Is it all in the name of love?

547
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:39,220
Or is this conscious pest but a note in the marvelous symphony of nature's universe?

548
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,840
Perhaps we'll never know.

549
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,060
But the next time you see a common fly,

550
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,760
remember, there's more to this pesky fellow's life

551
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,820
than rancid oatmeal and his attraction to that light bulb over your bed.

552
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,840
Yes, one of nature's most misunderstood anomalies,

553
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,380
Mr. Fly will always be a part of

554
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,280
Our Insect World.

555
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,080
Woo!

556
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,340
Time to tip that time.

557
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,680
Here I am again,

558
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,560

Oh, kung hingi man discourage ang magaito,

hindi da bomba on palikula a little sex lang.

596
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,260
Dear Mr. Auri,

597
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:43,000
I am one of a million readers of your wonderful column,

598
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,200
which I believe can help me find a lot girl right for me.

599
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,560
I didn't even think before that I would be in need of your help,

600
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:54,280
for I had girlfriends, yet they all deceived me.

601
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,760
However, I don't blame even any one of them.

602
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,680
I've realized that we're not really meant for each other.

603
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,660
With regard to the girl,

604
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,860
the girl I'm looking for, she must be of a practical type,

605
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,620
Caucasian, Catholic, understanding enough to get my situation.

606
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,800
She must not be necessarily beautiful and not sexy,

607
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:16,800
but charming and sexy and beautiful and simple to please my sophisticated heart.

608
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,900
Eng-yag-ly.

609
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,700
She must be a teacher, even pursuing still such a profession

610
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:25,680
at 22 to 25 years of age, standing five to five.

611
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,840
Speaking of my humble self, I am an A-B degree holder,

612
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,640
and at present still pursuing my studies for a career.

613
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:38,000
BSE degree, and at the same time employed in one of the private firms in the greater Manila area,

614
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:44,020
making Manila folders. Till here, and I'll be hoping for the best of your kind, Hilt.

615
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:49,600
Thanks in advance, and more power to your column. Very respectfully, Tyrone.

616
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,360
The Stunt Geniuses.

617
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:13,840
P.O. Box 14006 Dallas, Texas 75214.

618
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:30,720
Praise Bob. That's right. That Malaysian address is Bob at Post Office Box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

619
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,540
And you really can.

620
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:32,440
Right.

621
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,940
For more free information from Bob at that number.

622
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:42,760
But I'll be giving that sacred post office box number again.

623
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:46,960
But in the meantime, I wanted to let you know what you have been listening to, dear friends.

624
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,340
We've heard Hell Pope Huey doing a Neagy Sucked Me Dry.

625
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,700
A lovely sort of testimony there.

626
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,160
More of Rev.

Parasly from Reverend Uncle Jimmy's tape that he sent in.

629
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,140
We've barely scratched the surface of that.

630
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,020
Dr.

631
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,880

And that was the Firesign Theater.

00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:28,300
Very rare recordings doing the Filipino ads there.

And.

638

649

653
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:18,480
particular time in that particular day uh just i guess it's a random choice on the part of the

654
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,980
aliens the men from planet x or the sex goddesses from planet x found cells better

655

tiresome like a little while but i was thinking about july 5th

665
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,560
oh it's it's kind of a ways away

666
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,540
you know it's not that funny you know but i'm very um not angry with them

667
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:44,840
Fireways way on July 5th. I remember, I remember Reverend, Reverend Stagg, he was talking, he was

668
00:43:44,840 --> 00:44:10,280
talking about that, what goes on. And he was telling the importance of 1998. And he, he was saying, he was saying, what was it he was saying?

669
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,780
Stay up all night.

670
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:44,380
And do an X day chance about how the time is not for their arise. And songs, you know, X day holiday songs like take me off to space, which we'll be playing soon. And on X day morning, of course, well, the grownups been up all night, but the kids get up real early because on X day, the children are allowed to eat breakfast.

671
00:44:44,940 --> 00:45:12,960
I said, well, we pulled up in the yard. I told the children here, I said, we're going to have ourselves a time tonight. I just knew that old church is going to be full of spirit. And it was honey. It was. We went in there. We, after we sung about three songs, they were shouting all over that church. I've never seen so many people in one church shout. And in a little while, they shouted themselves right around in back office. Three ladies and two men.

672
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:22,960
Well, now, when we were hooking up, we saw some curtains or something laying over some boxes back there. We didn't pay any attention to it. Didn't know what was in there and didn't care.

673
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:33,800
But in a little while, they came out around us with five of the biggest rattlesnakes I have ever laid my eyes on.

674
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,940
I like to die.

675
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:38,900
I like to die.

676
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:39,600
I like to die.

677
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:40,040


678
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:40,040


679
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,260
I like to die.

680
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:44,820
I like to die.

681
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:50,240
service was over, they told us that the biggest rattlesnake they had in that service was five

682
00:45:50,240 --> 00:46:03,020
feet long. Honey, the one they brought by me was 27 feet long. And let me say this.

683
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:08,000
I'm not knocking these people. I promise you I'm not knocking them. I don't know if they're

684
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,480
right or wrong, you know. I'll tell you, they claim that they read in the Bible where Moses

685
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:18,780
had enough faith to take up the service. And some members of their congregation claim

686
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:23,920
to have that much faith. And I'll tell you one thing I found out before I left there.

687
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:33,840
They had a whole lot more faith than what I had. Now, this one woman stopped about two

688
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:40,500
feet from where I was trying to pick and sing. I didn't even know what kiosk is.

689
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:50,740
She took that rattlesnake with a head as big as your fist and held it up and stuck it right down

690
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:58,320
in her face and shouted in its ear, if a rattlesnake's got an ear. She wrapped that thing around her

691
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:06,300
neck. She threw it down on the floor, kicked off her shoe, and put her bare foot on top of its head.

692
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,880
When she threw that thing down on the floor,

693
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:22,080
its tail missed my foot about that far. I done a little shouting myself.

694
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,940
And she thought I was in the spirit

695
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,020
and brought me one up.

696
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,900
What in the world are we gonna do?

697
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:51,180
And I said, just take it easy.

698
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,560
Don't panic.

699
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:02,480
I said, just look around and find out where the back door is.

700
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:07,660
She said, I already looked and ain't none.

701
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,140
I said,

702
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:13,460
I said,

703
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:13,460


704
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:13,460


705
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:13,460


706
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:13,720
I said,

707
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:13,720


708
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:13,720


709
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:13,720


710
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,020
where do they want one?

711
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,620
And this lady walked up to me. She said,

712
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:30,660
Brother Wendy, you mean to tell me if the Lord commanded you to take up the serpent,

713
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:31,860
you wouldn't take him up?

714
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:39,280
I said, yes, ma'am, I surely would. But he didn't and I ain't.

715
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,100
Then the devil pulls off a mask.

716
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:42,860
It's me, Bob.

717
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,520
When the devil...!

718
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,780
Why don't you kill three ponies?

719
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:48,780
What the?

720
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:49,140
Go to hell.

721
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:51,220
Go...

722
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,440
Oh my God, Go.

723
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:02,840
W 175.

724
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,300
Oh my manuscript.

725
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:03,300


726
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:03,300


727
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:03,300


728
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,340
Got to break this conspiracy.

729
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,880
We better get back because it will be dark soon.

730
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,400
And they mostly come at night. Mostly.

731
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:28,580
I need your body as a dwelling place while I am here on your earth.

732
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:30,400
Where do you put it? You got a hollow leg?

733
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:34,580
It exists in almost every city and hamlet in the country.

734
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:40,880
And you must stand united on this and stamp out this frightful assassin of our youth.

735
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,920
Because it is only through enlightenment that this scourge can be wiped out.

736
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:59,300
You're going to be ready for the finals in 1998, my friend.

737
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,160
Let me be slack.

738
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:09,060
Didn't you give me this year?

739
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,160
You don't do anything.

740
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:10,660
Just.

741
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:11,460
Accumulate me.

742
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,920
Why don't you buy me a vibrator?

743
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,900
Why don't I put it in your mouth and you hum?

744
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:23,580
Person walking down a sandy beach barefoot.

745
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,860
Whose foot has been numbed by Novocaine.

746
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:35,200
Steps on the jagged edge of a broken bottle, slits their foot and bleeds to death.

747
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,200
Because they never knew.

748
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:40,640
There was a problem.

749
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,740
My loss was his gain.

750
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:50,580
This was a manipulation, a tilting of the luck plane in his favor.

751
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,720
And what goes up must come down.

752
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:58,120
And when you're talking about the luck plane, you're talking about both sides at once.

753
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,380
One goes up, the other goes down.

754
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,200
I happen to be on the wrong end of the luck plane.

755
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:10,780
But Mr. Rob Dobson, you see, was on the right side of the luck plane.

756
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:10,860
And I was on the right side of the luck plane.

757
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,180
And I bet he had a damn good seat for tonight's game.

758
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,180
A wonderful paradise.

759
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:18,860
Is that a paradise?

760
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:19,640
Sort of.

761
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:26,060
He's on the coast up north here with all of his, well, what can you say?

762
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,320
Aliens, friends.

763
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,620
Oh, it's a family reunion.

764
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,080
What about me?

765
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:33,180
That's the code word we use, too.

766
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,100
Yes.

767
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:39,900
It's a mighty big family tree we subgenius grow from.

768
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:40,620
That's right.

769
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:45,620
You never can tell what sort of branches it can branch off.

770
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:50,560
Well, we're going to the convention floor right now for that report about Jesus and a handgun.

771
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:51,920
Now, let's see what they have to say down there.

772
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:56,520
Jesus was running around at the spa last night with a handgun.

773
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:56,960
Really?

774
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,800
You can see Reverend Stan there.

775
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:05,300
And a wound in his side and a crown of thorns, a loincloth, and a handgun.

776
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,700
He was looking for Bob.

777
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,040
He was hunting for Bob.

778
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:09,580
And so what happened?

779
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,400
He was bumming drinks.

780
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:12,720
He was real upset.

781
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,600
If you see him running around town, you be on the lookout.

782
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:16,720
Yes, he was.

783
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,540
And a wound in his side and a crown of thorns, a loincloth.

784
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,560
And then I saw him going off with Connie, too.

785
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,900
That's a drinking, fighting Jesus for you, I tell you.

786
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,000
He was fighting one guy.

787
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:28,200
He was a real nice guy, actually.

788
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:28,940
Did he miss Bob?

789
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,000
I wasn't around at that point.

790
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:31,160
No, no, he don't think he did.

791
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:31,720
I don't think he hit Bob.

792
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:32,360
He missed him.

793
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,000
Something must have happened.

794
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:38,340
We think the bullets were caught in some sort of void time warp or something.

795
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:38,460
Time warp or something.

796
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:39,200
Yeah, I saw that.

797
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,600
They were using an oz to stab each other.

798
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,960
That's always a problem with those deities.

799
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,440
One of the things you have to do on the show here is wash the little H-bombs.

800
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,220
I'm over here in the corner of the sink over here.

801
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,220
And you can wash their bodies.

802
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,360
That makes them all happy.

803
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,320
Okay, yeah, yeah.

804
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,280
Okay, we might have to leave the floor.

805
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:01,720
It looks like the crowd's getting ugly down there with the Reverend Ivan staying.

806
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:03,400
Uh-oh.

807
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,620
Uh-oh, they busted through the...

808
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,060
Are you afraid to die?

809
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:08,440
Are you afraid to die?

810
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:08,440


811
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:08,440


812
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:08,440


813
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:08,440


814
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:08,440


815
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:08,440


816
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:08,440


817
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,200
Well, there you go.

818
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,940
They busted through the third medium into Stang's brain.

819
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:20,040
They now reside there until we can perform the radio exorcism on the second half of the

820
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:20,320
show.

821
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:25,140
Yes, I was there in the bar that night, the night that Jesus was allegedly running around,

822
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,580
but that was no handgun in his pocket.

823
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,200
He was just happy to see another cult.

824
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:31,680
He wanted those followers back.

825
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:32,780
Customer service.

826
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:33,740
Yes, dear.

827
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:34,940
Papa Joe here.

828
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:35,880
And, you know, I'm...

829
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,360
You're far too young to remember this.

830
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:38,420
I'm a little bit older than you, but I'm a little bit older than you.

831
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:38,420


832
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:38,420


833
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:38,420


834
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:38,420


835
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:38,420


836
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:38,460
I'm a little bit older than you, but I'm a little bit younger than you.

837
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:38,580
Yes, and I can still remember it, but I can still remember it.

838
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:44,280
But, when I was a boy, we didn't have any of these weakling Jesus with the handguns.

839
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:50,520
We only prayed to an almighty God that puts fear in His disciples.

840
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,880
I'm talking about Jesus with the hand grenade.

841
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,800
Fear in his cereal?

842
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:58,740
No, Jesus, back in my day, Jesus had AK-47.

843
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,100
Jesus had a Stinger missile.

844
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:01,120
I know.

845
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,820
I just understand, that's the old world.

846
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,580
We're in new thinking now.

847
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:04,980
They had an AK-47, and they had a handgun.

848
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:06,600
See, that's what's happened today.

849
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,400
People get swept off the planet.

850
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:08,400


851
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,580
with these cheap imitations.

852
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:10,680
Yeah, but I don't know.

853
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,520
Call the Joe Mama.

854
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,560
What an imitation it is.

855
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:15,640
I think we have a list of high-ranking officials

856
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,360
that were there that night and were actually subpoenaed.

857
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:19,100
All right, punch it up.

858
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:19,640
Name.

859
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:24,500
Well, it has been alleged that certain high-ups

860
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:28,520
have carried weapons of destruction on their persons

861
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,120
during public appearances,

862
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,100
but this is merely a defensive measure, let me assure you.

863
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,700
These allegations have opened me up on the audience,

864
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,880
dispensing with people that didn't applaud loud enough.

865
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:42,020
These are purely exaggerations.

866
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:44,620
Okay, all right.

867
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,660
There was some shooting on the audience,

868
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,340
but it was target practice.

869
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:50,020
We were deliberately missing.

870
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,200
Tell the truth.

871
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,400
Okay, okay, so a few people were hit,

872
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,560
but that was from cricket day.

873
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:59,900
What a beautiful future it is.

874
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:04,740
Listen, what I lie to you, what I lie to you,

875
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:04,740


876
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:06,880
those people that died,

877
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,780
those were people that wanted to die.

878
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,420
They jumped up in the line of fire.

879
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:11,500
Would you lie to me?

880
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,580
What about that night you told me you were...

881
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:14,340
Oh, well, never mind.

882
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:17,360
Never mind, never mind.

883
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,380
Close the Ravens, never mind.

884
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:22,380
Help, help, help me!

885
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,240
He screamed at the orderlies

886
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,500
when told he was actually Farlow Fudd,

887
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,560
doctor of dental surgery.

888
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,260
He struggled with his bonds

889
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,220
and snapped his jaws at them viciously,

890
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,160
his mouth foaming like a St. Bernard's.

891
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:35,680
The drug's head showed some bitterness,

892
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,680
beneficial effect at first,

893
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,260
but as time wore on,

894
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,680
his violent reassertion of his fictitious persona

895
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,000
pushed aside any hope that chemical management

896
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
would lead to a breakthrough.

897
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:46,760
Get the electrodes, sighed Dr. Fine.

898
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:48,960
He shook his head and resigned frustration.

899
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:51,580
The man had already absorbed the full charge

900
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,900
of four diehard batteries and was still no better.

901
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,960
His burning devotion to this Bob Dobbs

902
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,000
was most disturbing.

903
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,740
Either it was the product of a fevered, sick mind,

904
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:03,380
or this Bob had somehow tormented the man

905
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,120
into a state of burning, psychotic loyalty

906
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:05,680
unlike any other.

907
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:05,680


908
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:05,680


909
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,140
Or perhaps it was both.

910
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:10,000
Hell poke Huey and Dee.

911
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:13,380
Well, regardless, I have a job to do, thought the doctor,

912
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,940
as he pulled on his thick rubber gloves and goggles.

913
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:19,100
And to think I used to enjoy this, he thought.

914
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,900
Something had to work soon.

915
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,920
There were only three orderlies left,

916
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,420
and one of them refused to approach this patient again,

917
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,740
even with the peril of being fired over his head.

918
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:30,140
As the raving man had put the others in the ICU

919
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:33,100
with snapped bones and large pieces bitten out of them,

920
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:34,660
the doctor couldn't really blame him.

921
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:35,660
Perhaps he was just a little bit too scared to do that.

922
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:36,800
Perhaps he really was the Pope of Hell.

923
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,200
He was certainly earning his self-imposed title.

924
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:40,260
Oh, well.

925
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,820
One last try with electricity,

926
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,940
and then it would be time to turn to firearms.

927
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,380
Suddenly, there were screams in the hall,

928
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,380
followed by a terrifying, rumbling crash

929
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:50,780
that sounded like someone had loosed a thunderhead in the building.

930
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:52,920
The multifaceted sonic chaos

931
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,920
made him feel like a frightened child again,

932
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,500
and his bladder loosened violently.

933
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,500
Against his better judgment,

934
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,600
he ran from the room and turned the corner

935
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,980
to see the orderlies in pools of their own blood,

936
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,980
their arms ripped from the sockets.

937
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:06,700
The vegetable burned, smoking,

938
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,260
and filling the air with the acrid tang of ozone.

939
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:13,320
Worse yet, one of them had been separated from his head,

940
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:16,480
which lay forlornly in the corner like a discarded ragdoll,

941
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:18,960
except that ragdolls didn't ooze loops of intestine

942
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,060
and purple-pink brain matter.

943
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,240
My dear God, his nose has been bitten off,

944
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,100
Dr. Fine thought as he vomited.

945
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,440
I guess he shouldn't have called the man names

946
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,020
when all this started, he thought absently,

947
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,640
part of his fractured mind shutting itself off

948
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,700
in a bid to prevent a complete breakdown.

949
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,180
There was a huge hole in the wall,

950
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:40,020
jaggedly rent as if some unimaginable force of nature

951
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:41,120
had gone berserk,

952
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,780
which was, ironically, exactly what had happened.

953
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,740
A few bricks fell from the smoking edges of the gash

954
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:48,440
as he watched, mouth agape,

955
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:49,800
vomitous, unwiped,

956
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,340
as he tried to wrap a protective cocoon around his mind

957
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:54,140
until he could get to some tranquilizers.

958
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,560
Hmm, Bob Dobbs and Hell Pope Huey,

959
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,400
he mused absently.

960
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,200
I'll remember those names.

961
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:22,040
Oh, yes, dear friends,

962
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:28,120
and you can remember the name of J.R. Bob Dobbs

963
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,820
by writing for free information.

964
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:30,540
That's right.

965
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:33,240
You can get all kinds of free stuff in the mail

966
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,480
just by letting us know.

967
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:41,500
you care enough to send off for that wonderful packet.

968
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:42,660
You can write Bob.

969
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,380
You got that pencil ready, friend?

970
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:46,520
I'm going to give you a couple of different addresses tonight.

971
00:58:46,620 --> 00:59:00,080
You can write to Bob at Post Office Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas at 75214.

972
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:05,240
Oh, yes, there's a lot more besides this radio show that you need to know about.

973
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:12,020
At P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

974
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:20,860
And our good friend Onan Canobite is apparently doing a book about SPK, the band SPK.

975
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:29,340
And he is looking for anything you've got, like interviews, discographies, tour data, names and addresses of members.

976
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,060
Right.

977
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:37,460
Any language, reviews, all contributors will be credited and all inquiries answered.

978
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:44,060
And you can write to Trevor Blake at Post Office Box 2321.

979
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:51,520
That's Box 2321, Portland, Oregon 97208.

980
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,320
That's Zip once again in Portland, Oregon 97208.

981
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:59,040
But that doesn't tell you about Bob.

982
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:00,800
Does it?

983
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:01,440
No.

984
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:02,460
No.

985
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,060
But this might.

986
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:11,420
Now, the conspiracy talks about something called deviant sex.

987
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:20,820
To the conspiracy, deviant sex is anything except having, trying to have a baby in the missionary position.

988
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:24,500
That's the only thing we consider to be a sin.

989
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:27,840
Am I preaching right now?

990
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:29,920
Am I preaching?

991
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:30,420
Right now.

992
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:33,640
That knew they were a dirty rotten hunk of stinkin' sinful.

993
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:35,300
Hunk of stinkin' sinful flesh.

994
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,140
Dirty rotten hunk of stinkin' sin.

995
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,040
Dirty rotten hunk of stinkin' sinful.

996
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:40,160
Hunk of stinkin' sinful.

997
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,300
Dirty rotten hunk of.

998
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,520
They were red as crimson.

999
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:43,520
Now they're white as wool.

1000
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,880
Dirty rotten hunk of stinkin' sinful flesh.

1001
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,280
Oh, now that's hogwash.

1002
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:50,540
Every person pulled his hair and clawed the ground.

1003
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:52,300
This is a battlefield, sir.

1004
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,260
This is no recreation room.

1005
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:55,220
That's it.

1006
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,520
That's the great sin.

1007
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:58,300
But.

1008
01:00:58,680 --> 01:00:59,160
But.

1009
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,900
Who wants to play Russian and magic?

1010
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:07,300
The next time if somebody wants you to go to bed with them.

1011
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,520
With or without a gun.

1012
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:19,280
You're packing along a loaded revolver with you when you go.

1013
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:26,880
And not only that.

1014
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:28,540
When you go to bed with that person.

1015
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:30,120
You're not just going to bed with that person.

1016
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:35,340
You're going to bed with every other person that person has ever gone to bed with before in their life.

1017
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,460
So just picture it as if you're all crawling into one bed together.
