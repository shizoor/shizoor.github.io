00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:03,940
🎵

3
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,860

is with inspiring music and yes it's all here i don't know it's a rich experience and it's

5
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,320
if there's something very strange about thinking i'm sure you think about this too about thinking

6
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,300
about uh how our voices are all preserved in these nooks and crannies and you never

7
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:54,920
know where it's going to go i mean in the ensuing years but here on knon again let me remind you

8
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:03,380
you're listening to the best the best radio show on this station

10
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:24,060

11
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:24,560
you

12
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:31,380
through a long and painful process of osmosis administered to the islanders and to

13
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:43,780
round eyes alike bringing about a sort of neo-zen or apocryphal meaning

14
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,360
when civilians are subject unto this feeling

15
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,220
they too

16
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:54,900
are subject to this feeling

17
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,380
enjoy listening to knon alice texas

18
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:10,880
and the frequencies ivan is oh that's 89.3 fm in doubt well ivan it's probably time for you to take

23
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:52,920
gosh

24
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:53,960
gosh

25
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:24,920


26
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:40,080
When will you turn your date with me if you could call

27
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,640
a turnkey

28
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,340
listen to this

29
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:41,840
rather like a

30
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:41,840


31
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:41,840


32
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,000
radio

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,820
here

34
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,440
right here

35
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:45,440


36
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:45,600
over there

37
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,340
Today, more than 80 stations across the country broadcast programs recorded more than 40 years ago.

38
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,660
Their gentle, homespun humor seems demeaning to time.

39
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,800
Almost like a flower frozen in amber, it lives on.

40
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,780
A tribute to the lives and the hearts of two men who have lived their way through the first broadcast

41
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,780
with the folksy humor and advice that would become their stock and trade.

42
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,680
Some of you may go crazy, but not me.

43
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,500
No radio commentator is going to sweet-talk me into bankruptcy.

44
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:08,160
I'm going to beat you up.

45
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,500
I'm going to beat you up.

46
00:05:48,460 --> 00:06:12,620
I'm going to beat you up.

47
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:42,420
I'm going to beat you up.

48
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:10,940
I'm going to beat you up.

49
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,960
I'm going to beat you up.

50
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:54,480
I'm going to beat you up.

51
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:41,540
I'm going to beat you up.

52
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,900
I'm going to beat you up.

53
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:42,660
I'm going to beat you up.

54
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:12,660
I'm going to beat you up.

55
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,460
Just enough eccentricity.

56
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,260
Huh?

57
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,620
For they are all there, but one.

58
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,000
And that's Bob.

59
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,060
And you just...

60
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,800
See, it's part of the zen.

61
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,380
This is all part of the zen of corporate butt-kissing.

62
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:31,960
Yes?

63
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,920
That's the idea.

64
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:39,460
Show just enough abnormality that they think you're being real up front and honest with them.

65
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,520
You know, just enough eccentricity that they think you're not...

66
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,120
hiding anything or being a sycophant.

67
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,060
And that's the idea anyway.

68
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,160
If it's a rogue, unsaved subgenius you're dealing with,

69
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,380
they'll see right through it.

70
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:01,600
Oh, yes, friends, because we only turn the cheek one time.

71
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,760
They cut out the part where Jesus said,

72
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,140
and then if he slaps you again,

73
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,620
flay him alive in front of his wife and family.

74
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,740
Oh, yes, but let's get back to the show,

75
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,560
the lovely old, old show.

76
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,540
We'll see what...

77
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,320
Oh, here's one new little bit of a tune from So-So Dada

78
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,120
up in New Jersey, wonderful So-So Dada.

79
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,500
Friends, I want you to remember

80
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,240
you're listening to the Church of the Subgenius,

81
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,700
and remember your pledges to this station.

82
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,860
It's so, so important.

83
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,500
Oh, yes.

84
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,280
Oh, yes.

85
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,280
Oh, yes.

86
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,600
Oh, yes.

87
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,000
Oh, yes.

88
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,620
Oh, yes.

89
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,380
Oh, yes.

90
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:28,400
Oh, yeah, friends, I almost forgot to tell you about the, it's time to start talking about this.

91
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:34,180
Now that it's 1994, you need to know about the Portland Pilgrimage.

92
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,440
Yes, on X Day, 1994.

93
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:46,980
1994, not 1998, but this year, there will be the greatest subgenius event since the last Dockstock.

94
00:13:47,280 --> 00:14:00,820
Yes, Reverend Orton Nenslow, Master Control, assassinated Nen Master, will be, well, we'll just see what he does now that we're announcing it.

95
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,480
X Day, July 5th, 1994, go to Portland, friends.

96
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,840
That's all I'm going to tell you right now.

97
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:16,900
Because if you are, well, it's true that we may dangle many bobs before you, and it is up to you to choose the correct bob.

98
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:25,020
Now, I will be giving you specific hints on how to do this, and so you can't say that you had any excuse.

99
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,920
And this is the way that we find out whether you are chosen.

100
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:37,420
If you are of a discerning nature, then that indicates you were chosen to go to Portland and make the pilgrimage, the X Day Pilgrimage.

101
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,880
In the name of Bob.

102
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,300
There will be no free rides for Janer, by the way.

103
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,420
That's one of the main selling points of this convention.

104
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,340
That's what Nenslow told me to say.

105
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,400
And here's his post office box number.

106
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,800
That's box 86582.

107
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,180
That's right.

108
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:02,820
Portland Pilgrimage, X Day, at, this is the place to be on X Day, 1994.

109
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,360
P.O. Box 86582.

110
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:06,860
Portland.

111
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,140
Portland.

112
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:07,200
Portland.

113
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:07,420


114
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:07,600
Oregon.

115
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:13,260
Zip code 97286.

116
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,740
And you can call the station if you didn't get that.

117
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,180
Will will tell you or something.

118
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:28,200
But I'm here to talk about the meanest, the baddest, the dumbest redneck that ever lived.

119
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,340
I'm, of course, talking about Bobby.

120
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,780
Bobby Cream.

121
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,340
When he was 12 years old, he was beaten by six other students.

122
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,460
His back was broken.

123
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:45,740
He was operated on by government, not doctors, but government scientists.

124
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,840
They rebuilt him into a man.

125
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,360
Nay, not a man.

126
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,640
A redneck.

127
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,500
No, not a redneck.

128
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,620
A scarlet neck.

129
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,520
Nay, not a scarlet neck.

130
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,820
A black neck.

131
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,440
He became Bobby.

132
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,840
Bobby Cream.

133
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,220
Now, I think you'll find that.

134
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,260
Bobby Cream.

135
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:07,400
Bobby Cream.

136
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,080
Is the tri-syllabic divine incarnation of redneckery.

137
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,180
If you just say the words, Bobby Cream.

138
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,440
Bobby Cream.

139
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,000
Can everybody just give me Bobby Cream?

140
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,040
Bobby Cream.

141
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:19,780
Bobby.

142
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,240
Bobby.

143
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,080
Bobby.

144
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,220
Bobby.

145
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:21,440
Bobby Cream.

146
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,140
Now, do you feel like if you just sat in a lotus position and just repeated, Bobby Cream.

147
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:31,200
Over and over, you could just go out and just rob a convenience store or steal a car or...

148
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,420
Bob.

149
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,380
Bob.

150
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:33,520
Bob.

151
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,400
Bob.

152
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:34,980
Bob.

153
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:35,360
Bob.

154
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:35,880
Bob.

155
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,220
Bob.

156
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,380
Bob.

157
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:36,460
Bob.

158
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:36,460


159
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:36,560
Bob.

160
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:37,460
Bob.

161
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:38,940
Bob.

162
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:38,940


163
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:38,940


164
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:38,940


165
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:38,940


166
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:38,940


167
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:38,940


168
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:38,940


169
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:38,940


170
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:38,940


171
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:38,940


172
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:38,940


173
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:38,940


174
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:38,940


175
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:44,540
And now, as we do the long expensive Crane Shot Interview, giant offices at KPFA Olympics,

176
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,560
Reverend Hela's stretched out, reading the morning news, preparing the show.

177
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,080
Do you see this, Farnsworth?

178
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,240
They claim that the ratings of the show are down 20%.

179
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,220
That's ridiculous.

180
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,040
I've never had so many people telling us how much they enjoy the clean, virile, masculine

181
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,880
taste of the show in the morning.

182
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,700
There's something about it that

183
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,240
sets you on the right way.

184
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,680
It's like drinking a big jolt of

185
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,600
jolt cola or hot

186
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,320
coffee.

187
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,540
I really do.

188
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,020
Boom!

189
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,400
I ain't got nobody

190
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:35,860
now.

191
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,900
I'm holding around, I mean.

192
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,780
When the sun go down,

193
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,300
I'm in my brown

194
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,040
boucher jello.

195
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,160
My roll.

196
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,460
Three moths, you let it fall.

197
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,580
Just touch you, grab you,

198
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,960
put it in a way that I

199
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,380
couldn't get it till I

200
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,140
had my right mind.

201
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,280
Still in the low time boucher jello.

202
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,380
You know, only the lucky can die,

203
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:10,300
and all of you who think you're in danger of death

204
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,380
are actually in danger of something far worse,

205
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,060
continued immortality.

206
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,660
Eternal boredom.

207
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,140
Closer and closer.

208
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,600
Into infinity.

209
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,920
You think that is nothing bad?

210
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,560
You haven't lived as long as I have.

211
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,620
Oh, the collar fell away.

212
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,100
But, yeah, I'm not supposed to talk about that either.

213
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,400
Too many secrets.

214
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,200
As the man said to Ivan Stang,

215
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,460
if you turn the tape recorder off,

216
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,480
I'll tell you the real story.

217
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,220
And he went for it.

218
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,300
Of course, again, it's no big conspiracy.

219
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,360
It's bureaucratic ineptitude,

220
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,500
which explains most of everything.

221
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,420
Yeah.

222
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,040
It's raining.

223
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,520
As the rain falls on the castle of Kahnstein,

224
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,240
only one yellow light shows

225
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,960
that the inhabitants is up.

226
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,060
And as we dolly a little closer,

227
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,920
we see...

228
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,240
Dracula.

229
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,340
It's Dracula,

230
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,340
but he's not doing what I expected him to.

231
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,320
It looks like he's squeezing a pimple

232
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,300
on the end of his nose.

233
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,960
This is ridiculous.

234
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,160
Well, you see,

235
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,440
he can't look in a mirror,

236
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,220
and so he's very clumsy at performing.

237
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,440
The problem with Dracula is it's so, um...

238
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,360
It's so binary.

239
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,300
Either you're with Dracula or against him.

240
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,820
Dracula's got a little short, stupid cape.

241
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,120
Because it represents...

242
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,200
That's too many teeth.

243
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,160
That's too many teeth.

244
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,700
There's just the powers of Dracula.

245
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,220
Look at that haircut.

246
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,160
That's ridiculous.

247
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,160
The power of evil.

248
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:02,840
Oh, man, great.

249
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,260
And then he goes to the policy security guard

250
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,040
in the bathroom and kills him.

251
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,780
The immortal Count Dracula.

252
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,020
No, that was Renfield.

253
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,280
The Dracula never went into that bathroom.

254
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,320
Oh, I see.

255
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,680
Oh, now he kills negative land.

256
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,300
Oh, that's cool.

257
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,580
Star value, I guess.

258
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,140
He ate the eyes, and he ate the flies, and...

259
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:18,920
Oh, yes.

260
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,400
A very popular character.

261
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,660
Well, our test audience for Dracula in New York

262
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,340
seems to lap it up,

263
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:26,780
as it were.

264
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,820
On their laptop computers,

265
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,720
they attend the virtual theater with enjoyment,

266
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,820
but now realize it's time to get back

267
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,260
to the fabric of their lives,

268
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,920
to resume the small connections

269
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,000
and the great,

270
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,020
which cause the seamless web work

271
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,460
of the fabric of life

272
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,720
to sparkle with unvarying intensity.

273
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,740
A president who could do

274
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,780
what no other president has done

275
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,880
since the beginning,

276
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,740
and the president of our republic.

277
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,880
Unite the people.

278
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,720
The universal empire.

279
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,200
Pennsylvania.

280
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,880
What a guy.

281
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,540
It's like an old Chinese legend.

282
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,040
The story of the blue will plate.

283
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,500
That was the name of President Dracula's yacht,

284
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,560
the Blue Willow.

285
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,840
Yes, it went down off Hatteras,

286
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,260
with no known survivors.

287
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:26,320


288
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,100
It was only less than,

289
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,160
well, it was actually less than half a mile from Oman.

290
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,580
And George Bush's gas-dizzling gunboat.

291
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,600
There were no callers.

292
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,840
There was no one except the mystery sound effect man.

293
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,940
Yeah, a tiny tape player at the end of the wire.

294
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,060
If only he would speak,

295
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,920
the Count's mephitic powers would be loosened.

296
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,620
And here, it's almost time to go see him.

297
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,580
In addition to the well-publicized ability

298
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,880
to transmogrify,

299
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:04,140
the vampire can also cloud the mind of his victims,

300
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,420
and can exert an evil hypnotic spell.

301
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,580
One does not need to look into the blazing eyes

302
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,500
of the fiend to be affected.

303
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,520
One may even be affected,

304
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,580
one's reflexes slowed,

305
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,560
and one's mind reduced into a torpid state,

306
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,800
from a distance,

307
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,980
as the foul creature,

308
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,800
the revenant,

309
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,440
works his malefic will.

310
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:29,980
What?

311
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,840
The only extermination of vampires that can be valid

312
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,680
must begin with a belief in their super old natural existence and activities.

313
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,980
I have devoted 20 years of my life

314
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,800
to hunting down these pestiferous fiends

315
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,000
and eliminating them.

316
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,600
Hey, guys,

317
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,940
if you're sending me on a guilt trip,

318
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,320
the least you might have done

319
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,080
was pack me an overnight bag.

320
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:03,140
One for my friends Liz Bean and Homosexual, too.

321
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,860
There's nothing wrong with these pinks,

322
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,480
and an expensive operation wouldn't prolong.

323
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,820
You know, friends,

324
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,980
the only bad thing about reincarnation is

325
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,840
that someone will get these osteocephaloids

326
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,460
for a past life someday.

327
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:25,420
Oh, they ought to be charged with assault

328
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,220
with a deadly weapon.

329
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,280
They need Preparation H with sunscreen in it.

330
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,320
This is right,

331
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,900
rigid Reverend Bill Burroughs said,

332
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,140
paranoia is simply having all the facts.

333
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,360
Just because you're not paranoid

334
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,560
doesn't mean they're not out to get you.

335
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,840
But as Jethro Bodine said,

336
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,940
once you've tasted the joys of outer bohemianism,

337
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,640
daddy-o,

338
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,440
you can never go back to the past.

339
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,620
You can never go back to squares, Bill.

340
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,500
Here we say,

341
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,320
honesty is the best policy,

342
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,520
but insanity is a better defense.

343
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,380
Pull yourself up by your own bra straps.

344
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,120
You don't need sex.

345
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,480
Sex needs you.

346
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:09,040
Oh, don't let this slice of lifelessness get you down.

347
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,680
Reality is highly overrated.

348
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,920
If we wanted a simple life,

349
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,380
we would have been born paramecia.

350
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:21,080
Ah, it seems like it's fallen to us

351
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,180
to change the world,

352
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,520
even though we weren't the ones that dumped in it,

353
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:24,940
diapers.

354
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,360
So friends,

355
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,600
grab the reins of this runaway stagecoach

356
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,680
and get back on the path to Slacktown.

357
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,440
The lifestyle you save may be your own.

358
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,100
Whoo!

359
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:36,740
Whoo!

360
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,820
Oh, no, no, no!

361
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:51,580
Hey!

362
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,000
Bayern,

363
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,360
japa,

364
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,480
green,

365
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,140
chainsaw,

366
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:21,140


367
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:21,140


368
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:21,140


369
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:21,420
Tell them to sign my Tattoo.

370
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,180
I can't find any room over on the bottom left

371
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:27,220
A group from down in the midst from the bus

372
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:31,400
It's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want

373
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:38,340
It's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want

374
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,180
You look all everywhere you turn

375
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,600
To roll your head up on the pleasure of death

376
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,820
The world's getting stuck on the tip of your tongue

377
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,160
She's the real thing but you knew it all along

378
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,280
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want

379
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:08,620
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want

380
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,560
Look into your mind, the water is

381
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,780
Looking into your mind

382
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,580
Spinning around the world

383
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,060
Rock on with just a minute's our own love

384
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,940
She's just a girl you want

385
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,440
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want

386
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:41,160
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want

387
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,720
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want

388
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:04,720


389
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,900
Spinning from somewhere you can't see

390
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,300
She's life on top of every next change

391
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,560
She's fun down on her own, I'll run if I love

392
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:20,580
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want

393
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,580
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want

394
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,040
Look into your mouth and walk away

395
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,940
Look into your mind, spirit

396
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,700
Why don't you just admit it's all a rush

397
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,560
She's just a girl you want

398
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:53,960
She's just a girl, girl, a girl you want

399
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,480
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want

400
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,940
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want

401
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:21,320
Everyone says I love you

402
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,220
But just what they said it for I never knew

403
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:31,860
It's just inviting trouble for the poor sucker who says I love you

404
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,440
Take a pair of rabbit's hooves

405
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,060
And start cutting chatter and begin to woo

406
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:48,600
And pretty soon you'll find a million more rabbits who'll say I love you

407
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:58,100
When the lion starts getting frisky and begins to roar

408
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:06,200
There's a lot of lions who know just what he's roaring for

409
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,320
Everything that ever grew

410
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,500
The goose and the gander and the gosling too

411
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:20,460
The duck upon the water when he feels that way too says

412
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,680
He's got a little bit of a heart attack

413
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:44,680


414
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:44,680


415
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:44,680


416
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:44,680


417
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:44,680


418
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:50,440
This is Rudy Schwartz Project, our friend Reverend Joe Newman in Austin.

419
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:58,760
In this case, not from his regular CD, but from a CD called Past Normal.

420
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:07,520
It's like a sampler of bands from this place called FOT Records, or FOT Records in Bloomington.

421
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,260
And there's some great stuff on there.

422
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,120
I may play the next song.

423
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,960
But first I should give you some credits.

424
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:21,560
Just before this one, you heard Girl You Want, the Devo song, performed by Soundgarten.

425
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:28,240
Prior to that, Reverend Susie the Floozy ending her little repression rant.

426
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,960
I think I'm going to have a different background here.

427
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:31,700
There we go.

428
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,560
There, I like that.

429
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:39,620
And Dr. Howell, of course, in Puzzling Evidence, talking about President Dracula.

430
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,240
And show ratings.

431
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,520
Sort of a sexy song called Hang It on the Wall.

432
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,560
It was a sexy song, believe it or not.

433
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:53,480
By that old guy that R. Crumb did the comic strip about.

434
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,740
The old blues musician.

435
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,000
I can't remember his name.

436
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,140
You'd have to ask Joe Riley.

437
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,980
And, of course, Jane or Hyperclete's there talking about Bobby.

438
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:01,940
Bobby.

439
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,520
Bobby.

440
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,440
And I'm not sure what next.

441
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,000
We're going to flip the tape in just a minute.

442
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,480
And we'll just see.

443
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,840
What comes up next.

444
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,060
¶¶

445
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,800
¶¶

446
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,640
¶¶

447
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,200

448
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,000

449
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,540

450

451

¶¶

452
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,420
¶¶

453
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,620
Well, now where's my CD number two?

454
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,600
What happens if I hit this thing?

455
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,460
I ain't getting nothing, friends.

456
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,920
They're trying to mess me up.

457
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,820
Well, I guess in that case, perhaps I'll...

458
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:14,560
maybe there's a lesson to be learned here. Maybe what I should do is forget the CDs,

459
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:21,420
forget the slick stuff, and go back to the good old days, yes? Now, at this point in the show,

460
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:28,260
we're going to let negative land and puzzling evidence, Dr. Howell, Palmer Vreedys, Gary

461
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:36,780
Brogfran, the band that dare not speak its name, take over. It seems about a month ago,

462
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:47,160
old Puz, as we call him, Puz Ev, was asked, but negative land was about to go on tour.

463
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:52,380
They do a radio show, or at least Don Joyce of negative land and the rest of them at some point,

464
00:32:52,400 --> 00:33:01,480
I don't know, do this show over the edge on KPFA in Berkeley. And they sometimes invite

465
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,560
puzzling evidence to come in and take that show when they're, in this case, they were

466
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:06,760
about to go on tour.

467
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:13,660
Well, puzzling evidence thought, now the band that dare not speak its name hasn't played together

468
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:20,260
in three or four years. What a perfect time to play together on the radio in front of everybody

469
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:28,240
and with negative land. So that's what's coming up here. For those of you old time hour slack

470
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:35,520
listeners, you will delight in these renditions of your old favorite band that dare not speak its

471
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,280
name hits.

472
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:42,460
Peapod, Dobbs, poster of Dobbs, and of course, the irrepressible Dr. Howell never shutting

473
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:50,740
up while the songs are being played. So it's oldies but goldies. For those of you new to

474
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:54,560
the band that dare not speak its name, you'll probably throw up.

475
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,380
I wonder if we could have a word with you, Dr. Weird.

476
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:06,260
Digitally, we can edit that, but what we'll need to be doing on track 24, we're going to be doing a

477
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:11,560
little more is, is using Jay's pick, the sound of Jay's pick being crushed by a steamroller.

478
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,800
And then we can, uh, then we can do the show.

479
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,600
You take the ability to talk for granted, don't you?

480
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,880
They don't respect the equipment.

481
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,200
They dance around wildly.

482
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,900
Then why shouldn't you? You talk every day of your life and you don't think much about it.

483
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,240
I'm in the band. I'll come, okay, I'm going to be on the band.

484
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,240
Okay, I'm giving backstage passes to all of you that are listening to the show.

485
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,260
What a band. This is the battle of the bands.

486
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,620
I heard Negative Land's gonna do a new album soon.

487
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,480
So we got hot and ran down here to KPFA to start on ours.

488
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,340
Yeah!

489
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,700
And you can join us.

490
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,620
We can play power chords like this.

491
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,880
He's giving enormous influence on the music of the 1990s.

492
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,520
The 1990s?

493
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,440
Mike Dario.

494
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,540
We hired some more guys.

495
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,380
That's all we can tell you about them.

496
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,020
Mike Dario is a former free dose.

497
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,840
And Reverend Hal.

498
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,960
But we're not gonna let them. You can't hear them.

499
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,520
They're just...

500
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,940
His gift to me, to Macquarie,

501
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,100
started a whole new wave of underwater music for fish.

502
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,820
I can't hear myself think.

503
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:36,180
What's the matter with your generation anyway?

504
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,700
Reach out with your generation.

505
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:41,160
Let's combine your shenanigans to the rumpus room and keep it down to a dull groove.

506
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,760
This guy can't hear himself think.

507
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,400
Let's do it this way.

508
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,720
More and more and more.

509
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,480
Did you see that thing, Hal?

510
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:53,020
Well, I went by so fast it was above my thresholds of perception.

511
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:59,580
I like to think of it as superliminal projection of a junior sample.

512
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,560
Oh no, look, the lawyer's line is lighting up.

513
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,280
Well, that's alright.

514
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,580
You know, every time someone calls, we make $2.95 an hour for them.

515
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:14,780
Yeah, but every time that lawyer line calls, we have to pay $3.95 an hour to some lawyer.

516
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,700
Well, somebody has to pay.

517
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:22,060
You don't expect these things to rub themselves, do you?

518
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,340
Now, you know, you boys...

519
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:30,720
Well, I've been looking at your performance evaluation and your contract is coming up for...

520
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,160
It really stinks.

521
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,160
Well, thank you for being so blunt.

522
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,220
Not at all.

523
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,140
I appreciate the bold, masculine directness of your voice.

524
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,960
4-4-2-5-1

525
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:47,680
Yes, 8-4-8-4-4-2-5-1, this is your night to serve.

526
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:54,420
Rather to get so hard to futilely attempt to contact the Transplant Radiant Show.

527
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:02,500
All the organs and organelles in the system have indeed been lifted and patched in.

528
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,920
To a new creation.

529
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,740
Stitched together out of the parts of other shows and youthful bone hormones.

530
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,940
And joie de vivre.

531
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,100
I wouldn't hit you.

532
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,100
I wouldn't cry to you.

533
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,760
I have your best interest at heart.

534
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:31,300
You know, if you have an enlarged and irritated prostate and have to get up several times a night for bladder-related complications...

535
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,180
Then why shouldn't you?

536
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,420
We will improve your problem.

537
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,480
And why shouldn't we?

538
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,640
It's the very least we can do.

539
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,920
Talk every day about an operation for severe varicose veins.

540
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,240
Don't have one.

541
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,280
Just listen to this program.

542
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,740
You'll forget that you have veins of any kind.

543
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:52,720
Now, some people are very concerned that they're developing a stomach paunch.

544
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,940
But when you listen, you won't worry about that either.

545
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,480
You won't need to use your eyeglasses at all.

546
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,760
Just your ears.

547
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,980
And you'll recover naturally.

548
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,500
Far beyond even your doctor's expectations.

549
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,380
Your hernia will heal in a matter of weeks.

550
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,220
It won't have anything to do with us, but that's part of the miracle of nature.

551
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,240
Your migraine headaches will disappear.

552
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:23,800
And your constant asthma attacks will sink below the level of your perception.

553
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:29,760
These are all improvements not usually covered in exercise manuals.

554
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,360
It's what we call...

555
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,100
Musicotherapy.

556
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:40,200
This anti-music of an industrial noise band, whatever that is,

557
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:47,000
is guaranteed to lift your spirits and even to get grandma and grandpa tapping their feet.

558
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,500
Mary Ruby, is Podunk wanting to know?

559
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,820
Yes, I'm sure she does.

560
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:58,520
Whose highly sophisticated vocal style makes the down-to-earth beat of bluegrass music

561
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,640
to the intoxicating laughter rhythm of the hall?

562
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:07,240
Well, I didn't get up yesterday and even know that grass is usually green and the sky is blue.

563
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,200
They're trying to convince me of things that are just not so.

564
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:14,120
While I know for sure that there is just one moon in the sky.

565
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:14,580
I'm bored.

566
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,420
Or...

567
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,440
Excuse me.

568
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,600
How does this have any value?

569
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,640
We need to enter into second food.

570
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,000
Yes, a second food.

571
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,800
Hold on to your pants.

572
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,080
Hold on to your hats.

573
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,220
We're going to have a lot of fun.

574
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,620
Because if you are interested in popular music,

575
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,960
and you possess a small telescope,

576
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:40,100
just plug your Walkman radio into your ears and keep listening to this anti-music.

577
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,580
Go out and focus your attention.

578
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,120
There's no reality.

579
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,980
You might make a momentous discovery.

580
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:49,100
One that would eclipse the discoveries of the world's greatest observatories.

581
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,780
You have a chance to zip it up.

582
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,080
Possibly.

583
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,160
Find an extra moon.

584
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,440
And why should...

585
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,660
Talk every day of your life and you don't think much about it.

586
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,140
Well, think about it now.

587
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,700
Because that little body might be hurtling across the sky

588
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,680
and only you with your backyard snooperscope

589
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,560
could be on to this amazing astronomical discovery.

590
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,900
And if you continue to listen to our program,

591
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:22,620
I, Dr. Howell, will tell you how you can spot this hurtling meteor of the sky.

592
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,920
But in order to be relaxed, including the optic muscles necessary

593
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,420
to focus on such an interesting discovery,

594
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:33,920
you must listen to a heck of a lot more anti-music

595
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,320
played by an industrial noise band, whatever that is.

596
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:43,480
You have a good chance to find this suspected second moon to the Earth,

597
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,000
a comparatively tiny meteoric customer,

598
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:50,260
an iron stone ball some four or five hundred feet across

599
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,720
without atmosphere and frozen to the core,

600
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,560
if you follow my instructions

601
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,220
and refer to page 43 in my book,

602
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,060
Seeing Your Own Brain.

603
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,620
Yes, it's a mysterious, strange little body

604
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,500
pulled from its course by gravity

605
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,720
and effected by comedy here on the Earth.

606
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,660
Believed to revolve around our Earth once every three hours,

607
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:18,640
traveling at an incredible speed of about three and a half miles per second,

608
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:22,800
it's worth a mile, about 2,500 miles per second.

609
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:27,900
Your modest three-inch meteor scope should reveal it.

610
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:33,900
But it's a small, scudding black speck that never passes across so unmoved it.

611
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,520
If the suspected second moon really exists,

612
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,120
it is reasonable to assume that occasionally it must pass between

613
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,520
the sun and moon, moving rapidly across in six or eight seconds.

614
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,300
Reports have been received that such a body has been observed,

615
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,880
but these must be substantiated.

616
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:56,320
The only way to leave the optic vein to see this tiny satellite

617
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,920
is to release it.

618
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,720
All the body's muscles,

619
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,360
all the body's connection between brain nerve and muscles,

620
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:07,020
only anti-music such as you hear on this program

621
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:11,940
is a sufficient counter to follow this awe-inspiring physical journey.

622
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,100
And once you've undergone this set of journeys,

623
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:19,040
not only will you spot Earth's tiny parasite satellite,

624
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:23,620
but you will be unable to keep from seeing it again and again.

625
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,500
The大概다는 3第의 acuerdo는

626
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:55,040
wanted to coincidentally piually

627
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,500
bigger than what you actually saw this evening,

628
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:57,540
you

629
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,040
Whoa!

630
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,940
Sit on the floor.

631
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:00,740
There we go.

632
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,940
Do I get to mix in here?

633
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,740
I think so.

634
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:04,700
You can do it on the piano.

635
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,940
B-pa-da-da.

636
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,080
I'm having a mix in here.

637
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,180
Whoa, maybe if I could get a little, uh...

638
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,420
Volumatic mix.

639
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:13,840
Yeah.

640
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,980
So, now that sounds really good.

641
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,680
I think I'm going to do it on the piano.

642
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:39,940


643
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:44,520
Let's do it.

644
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:44,880


645
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:48,360
Go ahead.

646
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,720
I'll do it again.

647
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,560
Put it on...

648
00:43:55,420 --> 00:44:01,640
And I'll take care of it when you hit the start.

649
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:02,820
Okay.

650
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,060
Also, you varietals out of the ao.

651
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:12,820
If people that aren't used to it, can have a little more practice of perseverance.

652
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,020
Try That.

653
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,900
Sounds good, shoot.

654
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:23,480
I'm just ahead of you

655
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:27,900
Are you scared, scared?

656
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,920
Are you close enough?

657
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,900
This is the good part

658
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,860
We're all carrying the posters down and ripping them up

659
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,920
We were playing the media cards

660
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:54,600
And the little listeners

661
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,720
All the little listeners out of KPFA

662
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,340
Are calling the station now

663
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:03,280
They can hear us playing from blocks away

664
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:08,400
But it's still a piece of paper

665
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:08,720
Oh!

666
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,300
You close the door

667
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,960
Are you scared, scared?

668
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:16,960
Are you close enough?

669
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,980
Are you close enough?

670
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,060
Closer enough

671
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,820
Why did you do this to me?

672
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,920
Now I see everything I never wanted to see

673
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,720
Now I'm everything I never wanted to be

674
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,800
Oh, closer enough

675
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,160
Why don't you let me be?

676
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:43,440
Oh, you closer enough

677
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:47,060
Are you scared, scared?

678
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:47,960
Are you close enough?

679
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:47,960


680
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:48,720
A little closer?

681
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,800
Or are you closer enough now?

682
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,680
Or are you closer enough?

683
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:54,680


684
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:54,680


685
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:54,680


686
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:54,680


687
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,380
That's Dobbsalicious, friends!

688
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:58,160
Yes!

689
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,100
Poster of Dobbs

690
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,760
Of that great old hymn

691
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,840
One of my favorite old hymns

692
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,000
This time performed with

693
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,860
A band that dare not speak its name

694
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,400
With Negative Land

695
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,700
Or actually it's

696
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,020
Let's see

697
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,740
I think our personnel on that was

698
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,520
Of course, Gary Brogue-Fran

699
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:17,960
On Vogue Radio

700
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:17,960


701
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:26,800
vocals and guitar, Palmer Vreedys on bass, Puzzling Evidence on drums, and somebody on keyboard,

702
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:33,800
possibly Dr. Howell. And while we're playing good old songs, but God, it's just such a sweet old

703
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:40,760
hymn, you know. While we're in the midst of doing old songs by our old friends, here's a song by

704
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:49,880
one of our new friends, Indian Rope Burn in Kent, Ohio. A fine band, Indian Rope Burn. This is a song

705
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:57,780
I got to see them play this live while at our last Subgenius Devival, our last tent show Devival

706
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:08,560
there in Akron. It was great. And this is a song they did, we'll see now, called Technoboard.

707
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,740
I will hit the little button.

708
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,840
It starts the song.

709
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,700
I will destroy you.

710
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:07,380
I will destroy you.

711
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:30,780
There you go. It says that now is the time to find my way to the top. Not stop. It's all in a game that I cannot win. Come again.

712
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:37,040
The battle for the mind of North America will be fought in this video.

713
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:37,800
Red.

714
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:48,060
The television screen is the retina of the mind's eye. Therefore, the television screen is part of the physical structure of the brain.

715
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:56,920
Therefore, whatever appears on the television screen emerges as raw experience for those who watch it.

716
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:03,600
Therefore, television is reality. And reality is less than television.

717
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,160
Watch this.

Honor Shirley Bassey.

00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:12,720
Goldfinger.

Just a little

830
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:35,760
But that day just was gone

831
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:51,960
Everybody wanted to have a little gold in their finger

832
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,180
They took a little gold in their finger

833
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,200
They took a little gold in their finger

834
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:57,720
They took a little gold in their finger

835
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,200
Big back gold finger

836
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,380
Big back gold finger

837
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,620
Big back gold finger

838
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:18,860
It was just a normal fleshy kind of hand, but the finger was golden.

839
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,240
I don't understand it.

840
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:42,820
It stood still for centuries, but one day everything just would seems like a little drop.

841
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:42,820

845
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,760
But we probably should have still said it.

846
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:43,760


847
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:43,760


848
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,300
Other than this,

849
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,540
I don't know if I cheeked him or targetted him, but she didn't like him a lot.

850
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:48,540


851
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:48,540


852
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:52,980
The agency should have been a few verses away.

853
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:53,040
It was supposed to be a issue with the economic commission.

854
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:53,180
But then nobody really prepared for that.
