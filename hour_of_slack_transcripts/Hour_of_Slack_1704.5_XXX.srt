00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:14,400

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,460
I'm so scared to death.

5
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,140
I'm so scared to death.

6
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,020
I'm so scared to death.

7
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,900
I'm so scared to death.

8
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:15,920
I'm so scared to death.

9
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:23,880
Fuck You, fuck you and your guns.

10
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,960
Also fuck your mom, but mostly fuck your guns.

guns

13
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:43,800
Little Billy Barton headed off to school Daddy's watching Fox News, sissy's in the

00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,600
a gun

20

Girls have never liked him, cause he is a putz

21
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,040
They don't understand him, bunch of fucking sluts

22
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,780
Billy's having problems, wants to join the clan

23
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,820
Flunking out of math, but at least he's got a plan

24
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:32,640
Daddy left the rifle hanging on the rack Billy finds the ammo and takes it from the

A disarmed parent...

29
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,880
No, you know what, that is an absolute crime.

30
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,260

35
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:50,760


36
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,900
These bitches, they calle a dog out

37
00:02:51,900 --> 00:03:13,480

You suck you stink

40
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,780
She left something in her car

41
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,020
She doesn't know where you are

42
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,120
She held up voodoo

43
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,740
You said, you were her boy

44
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:20,740


45
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:20,740


46
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,920
Fuck you and your guns.

00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,940
Also fuck your mom, but mostly fuck your guns.

48
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:33,120
I'd like to fuck your mom, but mostly fuck your guns.

49
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:44,980
That was my hero, the Rudy Schwartz Project, from the latest album, Postal Code of Ham.

50
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:53,100
And obviously, this is one of those triple X-rated internet-only hours of slack.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,380
Aside from another profanity-laced Rudy Schwartz Project song that'll close the show,

52
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:06,020
this episode is the third in a series of tributes to the late Dr. Katahdin Legim,

53
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:12,000
one of the most famous and colorful of subgenius preachers, and one of my best friends.

54
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,520
Uh...

55
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:13,660
Uh...

56
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:18,100
By the way, not only was he probably our most forceful preacher,

57
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,400
but he was also very skilled at computer graphics,

58
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,280
and he was an excellent writer, and shockingly imaginative at both.

59
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,800
He was also a troublemaker.

60
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:37,580
He did terribly provocative things in both the subgenius online world of forums and chats,

61
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,620
but also the real-life aspects of subgenius society,

62
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,640
and there really is such a thing.

63
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,580
And it's not actually very cult-like.

64
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,420
Legim made life very hard for people who wanted a real cult.

65
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,500
Sometimes he made it hard for me, but I always learned a lesson.

66
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:03,580
What I'm about to play here is a metaphorical fable by Legim

67
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:09,660
about sad, stupid, misguided, pasty-faced nerd bobbies.

68
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,760
Their fear of camping in the outdoors,

69
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,260
and the X-Day Drills,

70
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,120
which are all about subjecting pasty-faced city subgeniuses to camping,

71
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,160
the outdoors,

72
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,860
and what puzzling evidence called

73
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,740
the savage mind of the country's interior.

74
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,580
This fable, the legendary rape bear legend,

75
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,820
echoed down through subgenius from 2010,

76
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,300
when this was recorded,

77
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,080
to the present day.

78
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,640
It became a very prominent insight,

79
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,020
and it was a very popular side-joke meme in the church,

80
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:51,300
and it upset so many people that the endless references to it

81
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,580
eventually caused a very real and literal schism

82
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,820
within the X-Day Drills social world.

83
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:03,880
In 2016, a dozen friends dropped out of the scene completely

84
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,420
over the rape bear meme.

85
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,220
It is not PC.

86
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,040
Strangely, all of them thought it was fucking hilarious

87
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,420
when they first heard it in 2010,

88
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,040
as follows.

89
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,960
There was a time back in 1996.

90
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,600
It was the very first X-Day Drill,

91
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,000
and there was this young subgenius fella

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,200
who had heard all the radio shows and radio shows,

93
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,120
and read all the books,

94
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,980
and, you know, he was totally into Bob.

95
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,420
He said, well, I'm gonna go out,

96
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,720
and I'm gonna make that pilgrimage out to Brushwood

97
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,940
to hang out with my subgenius brethren.

98
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,060
And so he drove all day, and he drove all night,

99
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,760
and day after day he drove until finally,

100
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,780
in the middle of the night,

101
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,300
he pulled down that dark New York road

102
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,900
to where his campsite was.

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,560
And he got out of his car,

104
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,140
and he walked off into the woods to...

105
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,000
look for a camping spot.

106
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,860
And while he was walking out in the woods,

107
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,260
he crossed paths with a bear.

108
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,200
The biggest, nastiest fucking bear you ever saw.

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,180
And that bear raped him,

110
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,260
and raped him,

111
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,320
and raped him.

112
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,720
It raped him,

113
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,800
and raped him over and over again

114
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,460
in every orifice,

115
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,320
in every position that the bear could get into

116
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,040
for seven years.

117
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,260
After that seven years was over,

118
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,560
the bear became exhausted.

119
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,060
He rolled over and pulled his now drooping bear penis

120
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,660
out of the young subgenius' ass,

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,460
its tip still dripping with glee.

122
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,820
And that bear wandered away

123
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,980
for a long hibernation.

124
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,340
And that young subgenius got up,

125
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,580
and he was up on his wobbly legs,

126
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,040
and he began to walk,

127
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,420
and he was like,

128
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,080
thank you Bob for having this ordeal be over.

129
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,320
And suddenly,

130
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,980
he found himself surrounded by wolves.

131
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,320
And the wolves raped him,

132
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,200
and raped him,

133
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,260
and raped him,

134
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,080
and raped him.

135
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,300
They raped him over and over again

136
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,580
in all of his holes,

137
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,180
in all of the positions that the wolves could get into

138
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,260
for seven years.

139
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,500
It was me!

140
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,980
It was me!

141
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,520
Finally, being too worn out

142
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,920
to be of any pleasure to the wolves anymore,

143
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,300
the wolves scattered and ran off into the forest.

144
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,280
And that young subgenius began to walk,

145
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,200
and he walked and he walked,

146
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,840
and finally he heard the sounds of people,

147
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,500
and he came out of the woods

148
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,580
and was greeted

149
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,440
by a large man in a black

150
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,600
priest collar.

151
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,420
And he,

152
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,840
and that man in the priest collar looked at him and said,

153
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,520
brother, it took you a long time to get here,

154
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,480
but you're welcome here among us now.

155
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,780
And they raped him,

156
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,700
and raped him,

157
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,640
and raped him,

158
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,640
and raped him!

159
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,260
There were so many of them,

160
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,160
they made new holes,

161
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,180
and they raped,

162
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,720
and raped,

163
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,300
and raped,

164
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:32,800
and raped,

165
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,360
and raped,

166
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,840
and raped those holes.

167
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,160
For seven years,

168
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,180
in every position,

169
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:41,760
for seven years,

170
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:41,760


171
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:41,760


172
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,500
in every combination.

173
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,020
in every position,

174
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,120
And finally

175
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,940
he escaped from those people,

176
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,280
and he made it out

177
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,720
to Bailey Hill Road

178
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,860
and was hit by a truck.

179
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,780
His body was picked up by the local police,

180
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,920
They took him down to the local mortuary

181
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,500
where the mortician raped him and raped him

182
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,440
and raped him and raped him

183
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,280
and raped him and raped him and raped him some more

184
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,360
in every hole and in every position

185
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,520
and you can get into a lot of positions

186
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,040
when somebody's not complaining.

187
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,420
For seven years!

188
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,400
Finally, the mortician couldn't put the family off

189
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,320
any longer and they put him out in a coffin.

190
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,480
And his family came to mourn

191
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,040
and they came through the chapel

192
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,400
and they walked past his coffin

193
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,520
and they looked down at him and they said,

194
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,440
hmm.

195
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,760
And they raped him and raped him

196
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,300
and raped him and raped him.

197
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,980
They raped him and raped him and raped him some more

198
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,760
and spread out this immense chain of rape

199
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,760
that spread across the land

200
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,340
and everyone died of dog and bear AIDS the end.

201
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,920
And when the bodies began to overflow the local morgue,

202
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:32,100
they were spread out among the other morgues in the county

203
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,440
where they were raped and raped

204
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,440
and raped and raped and raped and raped and raped some more.

205
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:38,820
Woo!

206
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,140
And the moral of the story,

207
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,140
is that when you're driving around New York at night,

208
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,400
always read the street signs

209
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,120
because you might end up at Baptist camp like he did.

210
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,960
People are going to be trying to sleep tonight

211
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,760
and all they're going to hear in their heads is

212
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,160
and raped and raped and raped and raped and raped.

213
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:21,860
And they never had a chance to trust me

214
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:21,860


215
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,320
And I drank but I didn't put on any on.

216
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:29,380
That's night and it's night.

217
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:29,380


218
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,800
Everybody's fucking but me.

219
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,920
That's already happened-

220
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,120
Give me back my fountainç¾

221
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,180
Took it late

222
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:50,540
Some girls even balled two or three

223
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,580
And then they just seemed to trade

224
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,740
I can't get laid

225
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,720
A dazzling urban guy

226
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,240
Like me

227
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,000
And though it's well made

228
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,380
My pussy's useful only when I pee

229
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,000
Everybody's fucking money

230
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:49,580
I'm dying of terminal lust

231
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:57,340
Christ, it's so depressing to see

232
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:05,500
My plumbing covered with rust

233
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,720
My plumbing covered with rust

234
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:06,720


235
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,980
My sex life is so gloomy

236
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:24,780
Even my dog won't do me

237
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,080
Everybody's fucking

238
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,820
But me

239
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,860
Everybody's fucking

240
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,940
But me

241
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,940
I guess I don't have no class

242
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:04,040
Lustful guys behind every tree

243
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:13,640
It's just a pain in the ass

244
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:22,740
The men just seem to duck me

245
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,320
I wish they'd suck

246
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,580
And fuck me

247
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,720
Everybody's fucking money

248
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,360
Everybody's fucking money

249
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:06,260
It's just a pain in the ass

250
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:06,280
I can't get laid

251
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:06,300
Some girls even balled two or three

252
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:06,300


253
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:06,300


254
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:06,340
My pussy's useful only when I pee

255
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:06,520
I can't get laid

256
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:06,520


257
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:06,720
I guess I don't have no class

258
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:06,720


259
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:06,720


260
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:06,720


261
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:06,720


262
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,080
I have not the slightest idea who performed that song.

263
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,660
Not a clue.

264
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,200
The year after Legume sprang the Rakebearer saga on the world,

265
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,960
he brought us another story based on true events in subgenius history.

266
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,880
This is from 2011.

267
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,820
Speaking of...

268
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:42,460
Those who do not volunteer to give, we always have Reverend Legume to beat it out of them.

269
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,980
Legume is here.

270
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,100
Hi, doctors.

271
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,260
Howdy ho.

272
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,580
Hail Legume.

273
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,140
The preacher from the Black Legume.

274
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,020
I was going to actually use this on stage later,

275
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,500
but I wanted Stang to have a good recording of it,

276
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,560
and it seemed like a really good afternoon for a Dr. Legume story time.

277
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,300
All right.

278
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:04,800
All right.

279
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,280
Oh, boy.

280
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,860
Tell us a story.

281
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:09,960
Okay.

282
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,480
It's Dr. Legume story time, and today's story is...

283
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,360
It's about choices and the choices that you make.

284
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:22,900
Once upon a time, many years ago, last Wednesday,

285
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,980
there was a town known as Pinkstown.

286
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:30,620
Pinkstown was a very nice town with a lake and a park

287
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,820
and the cleanest streets you've ever seen.

288
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,800
Every lawn was purplish.

289
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,400
Every garden was perfectly trimmed.

290
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,200
Every garden filled with lovely flowers,

291
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,680
and every person was happy and satisfied.

292
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,320
There was no crime or pollution in Pinkstown,

293
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,040
and every Sunday, the houses were empty,

294
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,840
and the churches were full.

295
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,160
At night, families would walk in the park

296
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,200
or engage in the many wholesome family activities

297
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,400
available to the Pinktown's people.

298
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,540
At night...

299
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,540
Oh, wait.

300
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,300
At every night, the only eatery in town,

301
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,140
McDonald's,

302
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,720
Hamburger Heaven,

303
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,760
was filled to capacity with hungry Pinks.

304
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,560
Old Man McDonald worked every day and night,

305
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,220
making his hamburgers

306
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,320
and happily feeding the hungry bellies of the townsfolk,

307
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,560
and had done so for as long as anyone could remember.

308
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,800
He was beloved by all.

309
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,140
One day, a great noise was heard throughout the town.

310
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,400
It was a jarring calliope,

311
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,640
the music emanating from a curious wagon that rolled into town,

312
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,180
covered with flashing lights.

313
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,800
The wagon rolled down every street in Pinkstown,

314
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,220
with a great booming voice calling out,

315
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,680
Follow me to total satisfaction.

316
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,400
Startled by this amazing machine,

317
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,280
the people came out of their homes in droves,

318
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,940
following the outrageous machine until it stopped in a vacant lot

319
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,160
across from McDonald's Hamburger Heaven.

320
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,700
The great wagon wheels retracted,

321
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,180
and it settled to the ground.

322
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
Hatches opened,

323
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,240
and mechanical limbs flailed the air

324
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,400
as the machine transformed from a strange garish wagon

325
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,960
to the most amazing futuristic structure

326
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,980
the townsfolk had ever seen.

327
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,840
Roof-mounted loudspeakers proclaimed for all to hear,

328
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,680
Friends, my name is J.R. Bob Dobbs,

329
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,900
and I welcome you to the grand opening of my new,

330
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,820
fully automated restaurant,

331
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,240
Burger God Hunger Fuckers.

332
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:34,780


333
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:34,780


334
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:34,780


335
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:34,780


336
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:34,780


337
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:34,780


338
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:34,780


339
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:34,780


340
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,140
Burger God Hunger Fuckers.

341
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,500
Fireworks shot from the roof as a giant flashing neon sign lit up

342
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:46,040
and bathed the entire street in the glare of glowing, garish profanity.

343
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,480
The people were outraged.

344
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,520
Oh my God, hide the children's eyes, cried a mother.

345
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,520
We will not tolerate this in Pinkstown, cried the town's preacher.

346
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,000
Anger and frustration filled the air

347
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,800
as people wielding torches and pitchforks

348
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,780
tried in vain to burn down the structure.

349
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,200
Even as the seductive scent

350
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,540
of the most savory burgers you've ever smelled

351
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,540
wafted over the crowd

352
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,080
like a mouth-watering fog.

353
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,580
Despite themselves,

354
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,440
the people suddenly found themselves ravenously hungry.

355
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,760
They could not resist.

356
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,940
They must have a hamburger now.

357
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,620
As the townspeople began to surge

358
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,980
towards the door of Burger God Hunger Fucker,

359
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,840
the preachers cried out,

360
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,800
Wait, do not give in to temptation.

361
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,040
We cannot succumb to the lure of this horrific affront to our decency.

362
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,920
We will go to McDonald's and enjoy his hamburgers instead,

363
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,540
as we always have.

364
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,420
When nobody buys any hamburgers from this obscene mechanical monster,

365
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,640
it will no doubt go away.

366
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,900
So the citizens packed themselves into McDonald's

367
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,520
and ate more hamburgers than they had eaten in one night

368
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,180
in the history of McDonald's.

369
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,060
The lines were around the block and halfway through town

370
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,780
as drooling Pinkstownians fought.

371
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:03,920
And the townspeople were all over the place.

372
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:03,920


373
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:03,920


374
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:03,920


375
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:03,920


376
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:03,920


377
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,400
And so the townspeople fought the urge

378
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,500
to give their business to the Burger God Hunger Fucker.

379
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,500
Rolling eastward on US-1 was a dented green Buick

380
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,620
driven by a hungry young subgenius

381
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,840
named Reverend Funny Name.

382
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,120
Reverend Funny Name had been driving for days,

383
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,860
looking forward to his first X-Day vacation

384
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,800
and to enjoy the fellowship of his many subgenius friends.

385
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,280
He'd made very few stops during his pilgrimage,

386
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,780
but as he neared the pinnacle,

387
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:33,780


388
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:38,860
he was overcome by the alluring smell of hamburgers.

389
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,220
He could not remember ever smelling a hamburger this savory,

390
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:47,020
and he could not resist the hunger that seized him.

391
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,240
And he saw the line for the hamburgers,

392
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,220
and he smelled the hamburgers,

393
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,460
and he drove to the center of town,

394
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,780
and he looked at McDonald's, and he's like,

395
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,340
man, there is absolutely no way I'm waiting in that line.

396
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,480
And then, looking over his shoulder,

397
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,420
he saw the garish glow of the sign and said,

398
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:03,760
I'm hungry.

399
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,760
Oh, snap!

400
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,560
Burger God, hunger fucker!

401
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,560
He pulled into the drive-thru,

402
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,420
and after perusing the menu,

403
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,580
told the order bot,

404
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,280
I'd like the number 13 happy fucker fun meal

405
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,600
with a double hunger fucker burger, please,

406
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,160
with a big-ass mega fuckload of chili cheese fries

407
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,720
and a small motherfucking Diet Coke.

408
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,840
For his health.

409
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,840
As he pulled away from the lot

410
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,760
with his huge meal on the seat beside him,

411
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,180
the townspeople shook their fists at him

412
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,620
and gave him dirty looks.

413
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:41,100
Reverend Funny Name pulled back onto the highway

414
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,600
and continued east toward his destination.

415
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,640
It was the greatest meal of his life.

416
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,720
He not only ate that hunger fucker burger,

417
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,400
he ate the hunger fucking hell out of it.

418
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,080
It was so good,

419
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,300
he never wanted to shit it out.

420
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,700
He reached into the back,

421
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:03,860
grabbed a bag,

422
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,300
and retrieved the toy surprise

423
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,440
from his happy fucker fun meal.

424
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,260
It was a shiny plastic box

425
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,820
with a red button on top.

426
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,040
He pressed the red button and waited.

427
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,760
He pressed it again.

428
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,980
What a pile of junk, Reverend Funny Name said,

429
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,600
as the Burger God hunger fucker detonated,

430
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,640
leaving nothing left of Pinksville

431
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,160
but a smoking crater.

432
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,520
The end.

433
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,560
Freeze!

434
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,880
A beautiful tale, Dr. LeGue,

435
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,020
not just a...

436
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,980
It makes me hungry just thinking about it.

437
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,720
Ready to get your hunger fucked.

438
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:51,820
Bob also tried to market a type of beer

439
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,700
called Beer God the Thirst Fucker.

440
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,340
And these ad agencies he hired

441
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,320
would always try to talk him out of it.

442
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,860
But he actually opened a chain

443
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:06,080
of both Beer God and Burger God in Louisiana.

444
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,040
Yeah, I remember you told me about it years ago, obviously,

445
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,220
which is why I remembered.

446
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,200
Well, that will be on the, uh,

447
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,520
one of those X-rated internet-only hours of Slack.

448
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,520
Well, you know, last year,

449
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,480
I was able to put together an hour of Slack real easily.

450
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:25,240
I just used all the stuff that was too filthy

451
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,720
to use at all, if you were gonna bleep it.

452
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,100
So it was, uh, it was your,

453
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,240
your tale of the seven years of rape,

454
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,300
uh, that went on and on and on seven times.

455
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:43,120
Probably the most ripped-off meme of the year.

456
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,560
There was that entire New York devival

457
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,760
was centered around your story

458
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,420
of the, of the subgenius raping bears.

459
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,060
And, uh...

460
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,540
It was definitely a night of all rape.

461
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:59,920
Yeah, it wasn't all, uh, an all rape.

462
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,800
Well, it was one of those rape ex-days, you know?

463
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,020
You don't, we don't, we don't get those all the time.

464
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,320
I'm sorry, ladies, uh...

465
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,240
Hey, the weekend's...

466
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:12,460
...and boys.

467
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,620
You know, it can still happen

468
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,960
the 5th, you know.

469
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,720
If you need rape and stuff,

470
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,220
I'm sure there are some geniuses around

471
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,320
who'll lead you in the right direction.

472
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,380
The very reason that they, uh,

473
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,520
make it, uh, illegal to broadcast, uh,

474
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,600
those dirty words is because they don't want people

475
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,080
to be reminded of the fun things, you know,

476
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,160
the things in life that are free.

477
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,120
When you stop and think about it, uh,

478
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,180
nearly every word that's on that list

479
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,900
is something that everyone does on a regular basis

480
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,100
or had to have done somewhere along their life

481
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,840
in order to, to exist.

482
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:43,620
I mean, no one would...

483
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,400
Or, or wishes to hell they could.

484
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,160
And yet, so we're going to take that action

485
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,300
and we're going to say,

486
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,100
that's the word you can't use,

487
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,720
that's the word you can't speak,

488
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,380
that's the word you can't think.

489
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,120
If you ever needed proof of the conspiracy,

490
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,980
what greater proof is there?

491
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,060
So, not only that, but, uh,

492
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,740
not only should you use those dirty words,

493
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,420
you should think those dirty words

494
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,100
and act on those dirty words

495
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,480
whenever you can

496
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,700
and whenever you are supposed to not.

497
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,560
Just do it.

498
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,200
Think it.

499
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,060
Say it.

500
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,360
In spite of the con.

501
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,700
You know, you should be the new Captain Kangaroo

502
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,240
or romper room teacher, Papa Joe.

503
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,860
Uh, this next recording is much more recent

504
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,940
from a live podcast radio show

505
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,700
at the, uh,

506
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,640
20X Day drill of 2017.

507
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,500
20X Day.

508
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,460
Uh, I was surprised to find this recording

509
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,980
because, uh, right after that drill,

510
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,780
I had to pack up the entire

511
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,800
subgenius archives and move them to Texas

512
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,300
and I never even got to half of the recordings

513
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,160
from that one.

514
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:54,660
And neither Legume or I was at 21X Day last year.

515
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,600
So I'm glad I found this recording.

516
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:00,100
It's Dr. Legume with Dr. Argus Fox

517
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,240
and Reverend Susie the Floozy.

518
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,440
So, uh,

519
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,780
you'll come help me make fun of peas?

520
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,800
Who wants to tag out with Legume?

521
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,600
Oh, Cosmex swamping out.

522
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,200
Oh, now the show has begun.

523
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:19,840
Uh-oh.

524
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,700
I will come help you make fun of peas.

525
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,040
Hi, Miss Floozy.

526
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,460
Hi, Dr. Legume.

527
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,940
What's going on?

528
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,500
Oh, the only thing going on,

529
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,040
the only thing up around here is my blood pressure.

530
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,960
I'm just angry.

531
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,320
Well, there are some parts of me that are up

532
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,240
that just never seem to go down.

533
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,300
Most people drop stuff off at the, at the Goodwill box,

534
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,560
but I think peas actually just shops at it.

535
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,480
Those are some classy shoes.

536
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,380
Which hobo did you steal them off of?

537
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:54,960
Batman.

538
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,960
Uh, you off of Batman?

539
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,440
Two different hobos from the look of it.

540
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,380
Did you meet Batman with the, with the gangly Robin

541
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,700
we dropped off the other day?

542
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,360
He's hanging out with Victor Framptzopula outside of the clinic.

543
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:07,660
Ha.

544
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,780
A gangly Robin, yeah.

545
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:13,080
Batman and, and, and super stretch Robin edition.

546
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,940
Hell, he looks like somebody super stretched him out long ago.

547
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,280
Yeah, I wouldn't, not Dick Grayson, more like, uh, Dick Raisin.

548
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,900
Dick Raisin.

549
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,920
Dick Raisin.

550
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,580
And the Raisinettes.

551
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,140
What?

552
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:33,240
It's a chorus kick line cavalcade of pure comedic comedy genius.

553
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,960
Comedic comedy is much better than regular comedy.

554
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,460
Because it's funny.

555
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,840
It's twice over as good.

556
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,820
Yeah, it's twice as funny.

557
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,640
Just trying too hard.

558
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,920
Trying too hard?

559
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,080
Oh yeah, I understand.

560
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,720
You know, I've, I've listened to Reverend Pease up here trying too hard.

561
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,840
Trying too hard?

562
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,140
I mean, it's hard to understand much of what he says, you know, because he mumbles.

563
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,440
Itchy, you can't.

564
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,040
And you can't really look at him because he's got that, you know, that weird eye thing that he's got, you know, that kind of.

565
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,120
The imbecile.

566
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,280
Between his chin and his head, the place you just can't stand to look at.

567
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:01,640
Yeah.

568
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,580
Yeah.

569
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,840
It's a disease.

570
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:12,920
He's got that kind of weird bend to his head that looks like he had been kicked really hard or something and it just never flexed back into shape.

571
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,480
It's kind of like Don, Don Martin drew him.

572
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,760
Especially the way the toes have that extra joint and then the flap.

573
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,940
My favorite Don Morton sound effect is Pease.

574
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,880
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

575
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,200
I haven't been up behind a mic in a long time.

576
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,440
Now I know how Reverend Pease feels up here.

577
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:40,020
You know, but yeah, the difference being that, you know, Reverend Pease just sits here and never says anything funny.

578
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,880
He keeps his jokes hidden in his hat.

579
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,580
That's why he never takes it off and why we haven't heard anything.

580
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,540
That's not the worst thing he keeps in his hat.

581
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,960
You ever see when he takes it off and all those used Kleenexes fall out?

582
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,860
I don't even want to guess which hat.

583
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,000
I don't even know where the legend he came from with them.

584
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:05,220
Yeah, we were all passing around church air and balloons last night, but he just sucked on a Magnum for about two hours.

585
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,820
It was depleted after the first hit, too.

586
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,480
He just couldn't get the taste out of his mouth.

587
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,280
I can't use them.

588
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,500
Condoms on me is like wrapping a shotgun in Saran wrap.

589
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,760
My sperm count is so high that you have to chew before you swallow.

590
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,020
Pease, it's...

591
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,900
I'm all for it!

592
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,320
Trigger!

593
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:25,740
Dammit!

594
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,580
We've triggered Mother Miller.

595
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,300
I could macrame your sperm.

596
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,580
Make a wallet out of them.

597
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,720
Maybe a coin purse.

598
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:39,220
Tails!

599
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,320
They look like fucking otters!

600
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,580
Well, it was Laguma that was telling me the other day that sperm have teeth.

601
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,300
It's true.

602
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,780
Sperm do have jaws and teeth.

603
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,840
Well, I don't know if they have actual teeth, but they do have jaws.

604
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,400
They got lamprey mouths.

605
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,240
Yeah.

606
00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:02,400
Desmond Morris, the guy who wrote The Naked Ape, did a documentary on human sexuality.

607
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:07,340
I think it was called Human Sexuality by Desmond Morris.

608
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,500
Oh, fucking...

609
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:17,040
And about 48 minutes, yes, about 48 minutes into the video, they show a part of...

610
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:24,380
They show a scene where they had taken the semen from two different men and put it in a...

611
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,840
They put them into one ovulating female.

612
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,540
And they had a micro camera in there that filmed what was going to happen.

613
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,840
Reality show.

614
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,780
And what these sperm would do is they would fight.

615
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,360
Fight!

616
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:36,600
Fight!

617
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:36,760
Fight!

618
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:36,760


619
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,060


620
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,220


621
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,240
Fight!

622
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:37,240


623
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:37,320
Fight!

624
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:37,320


625
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:37,320


626
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:37,340
Fight!

627
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:37,520
Fight!

628
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:37,520


629
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:37,660
Fight!

630
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:37,920
Fight!

631
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,060
Fight!

632
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:38,400
Fight!

633
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:43,500
I mean, you see the pictures and you think of them as being just like this round thing with a tail.

634
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:49,100
But once you get that close up look where they're ready to fight, those things open up into fucking jaws.

635
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:56,400
And they'll clamp on to the opposing sperm and thrash them around in like an alligator death roll until they die.

636
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,040
Wow.

637
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:06,300
And then they will build walls from the bodies of the dead to prevent the live sperm from getting to that egg.

638
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,380
I shit you not.

639
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:12,900
If sperm have teeth, whatever bit Pease's mother eggs must have been buck tooth.

640
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:19,340
As I was watching that, the only thing I could think was, are we really the top species here on Earth?

641
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,020
They're not like us.

642
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:27,920
All they're doing is swimming around creating new vehicles to carry them around and reproduce themselves.

643
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,700
Each one of us produces billions of them.

644
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,620
We're just a biosphere for the sperm that drive us.

645
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,120
Men, can you not agree?

646
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,740
What's the first thing you think about when that dick gets hard?

647
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,260
Getting them sperm and spreading them around.

648
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,900
We got nothing to do with this.

649
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,600
And I think, oh, it's going to be, yeah, it has nothing to do with us.

650
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:55,920
We're just like, we're like alligators and they're like the birds on their back with the, picking the little bugs off and shit.

651
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,800
We're just walking, we're Uber for sperm.

652
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,640
We are sperm Uber.

653
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,680
Yeah, but I've got a $50 coupon.

654
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,100
Damn.

655
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:07,220
And so.

656
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,800
And that's why when I was very young, I got a vasectomy.

657
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,200
I would not let that conspiracy beat me.

658
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,240
Fucking A.

659
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,280
I outwitched my own sperm.

660
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,140
I doomed the future to a legumeless bloodline.

661
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,100
Deny them our essence.

662
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,480
That's right.

663
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,360
Deny them my essence.

664
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,100
That's why you only ever see me drink pure blood.

665
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,460
They're just pee in the air.

666
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,640
Well, Pease has kids.

667
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,580
Locked in his basement.

668
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,120
That's what, that's what Pease thinks that too.

669
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,160
Pease thinks he has kids.

670
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:52,880
Sculpted from the potter's hands with discount Play-Doh.

671
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,220
That's not Play-Doh.

672
00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:00,540
That's more of that sperm that's so thick you have to chew it before you swallow it after that.

673
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,280
Molecules the size of watermelons.

674
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:04,800
Moose.

675
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,880
Extra thick.

676
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,480
Pour it over your pancakes.

677
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,260
Speaking of pancakes.

678
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,640
We had pancakes.

679
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,080
We had pan- I didn't get pancakes.

680
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,680
I had a couple.

681
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,160
I didn't get pancakes.

682
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,880
I was, I was hiding in my tent from rape bears.

683
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:30,740
Because I was pretty sure that after I tilted the luck plane the other night that I was going to be completely annihilated by any cosmic force.

684
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,600
But I don't want to hear that I get blamed for not getting picked up on the fifth.

685
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,960
Compounded transgressions.

686
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,420
With a googol.

687
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:44,460
With a googol, a googillion of microaggressions.

688
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:52,200
An exponential chain of atrocities that erupted in a final flaming orgasm of violence.

689
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,440
Again.

690
00:34:54,740 --> 00:35:01,300
I have to admit I was, I was really proud of Reverend Fox for burning that Bob dummy.

691
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,140
I know that in years past somebody would have run up and said,

692
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,720
No Reverend Fox, no you have to get permission, you have to check with us, we're never going to let you do it.

693
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,160
He just picked that son of a bitch up, walked up.

694
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,660
The chair too.

695
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,280
All starey eyed.

696
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,840
Lifted that Bob up over his head and he just paused there for a second.

697
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,760
Like he was just waiting for that perfect moment for the stars to come into alignment.

698
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:35,100
And he flung that body down onto the, onto the pyre and it snapped over backwards like when Homer Simpson bounced down the mountain and landed on that-

699
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:35,840
It was a rock at the end.

700
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:39,680
Yeah, it was a beautiful thing to see.

701
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:48,280
And I knew that probably some people would be upset but shit I'm the one that put the most work into building that thing and I loved every fucking minute of it.

702
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,080
And the part I loved best was the fact that you didn't clear it with anybody.

703
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:57,440
You just took it upon yourself to make yourself a fucking legend at X Day.

704
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:04,320
And that's what everybody should do is to try to make themselves a legend at X Day but don't try too hard or we'll fuck you up.

705
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,080
He was a hell of a guy.

706
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,720
He was a helpless vessel of Dobbs hand.

707
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,060
It wasn't me.

708
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:12,880
He was like one of those hand puppets with somebody's fingers up his patoot.

709
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,900
Oh you can lay that I was born this way thing on me but we know the truth.

710
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,240
Oh no he was wearing guide clothes.

711
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:27,920
This was a conscious decision made by you and a consenting alien robot baby radio wave.

712
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:35,080
That robot baby alien wave is the psychic ether that I will huff off of a red-

713
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:35,600
egg forever.

714
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,540
That was some.

715
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:44,300
I have to admit there was some shit about that thing that really genuinely scared me a bit.

716
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:51,740
I mean when I was up on stage working with that thing I was pouring fucking sweat up here from that thing.

717
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:57,700
And that crystal every time it got near the microphone it would cause a feedback.

718
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:02,960
I thought it was you doing it but it was every time it got near that the crystal got near the transmitter.

719
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:03,700
The voodoo.

720
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,280
It would just huff.

721
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,220
It would cause the microphones to all buzz and hum.

722
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:18,380
And it was later I was putting it in the box and I looked at it and the gauge I don't know why the gauge glows.

723
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:22,380
And I even when it's not exposed to light the gauge glows.

724
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,860
I thought it looked like it was on but.

725
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:25,700
It wasn't.

726
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:26,560
Fuck.

727
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:32,300
And so now I'm sitting here thinking how will I know if I got radiation poisoning.

728
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,800
Will my hair fall out?

729
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:38,400
I mean how will Reverend Stang know if he's been poisoned by it?

730
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,740
Will his nut shrivel up?

731
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:43,220
You'd think that was when he was replaced by the robot.

732
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,020
Oh.

733
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,940
I'm not allowed to disclose robot information.

734
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,440
He wasn't about to risk his nut.

735
00:37:54,120 --> 00:38:00,360
Also in 2017 Dr. Laguime told us yet more of his children's stories and fables.

736
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,260
At the last X-Day drill he attended.

737
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:12,240
Actually it was the last one I attended too but I plan to be at the next one barring any more family tragedies caused by Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.

738
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,640
God how I hate fatal, painful and incurable diseases.

739
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,160
To me that's worse than the whole conspiracy put together.

740
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:29,360
Anyway here's Uncle Laguime's story time from July 3rd, 2017.

741
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,100
So it's story time with Uncle Laguime.

742
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,600
Yeah.

743
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:42,240
Long ago in a distant land there lived a handsome king.

744
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:49,140
He owned land as far as he could see and his land was fertile and abundant with wildlife.

745
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:55,480
The handsome king had everything a king could want but was missing one thing.

746
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,140
He was terribly lonely.

747
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:03,560
And one day he set out on his faithful horse Grunion in search of a bride.

748
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:11,980
He rode to every town and hamlet in the kingdom and had no success until one day at the very edge of the kingdom.

749
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:16,620
He spotted the most beauteous woman he had ever set eyes upon.

750
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,580
He introduced himself and she was very impressed with his kingly stature.

751
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,180
He said to her,

752
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,640
Many days and nights I have ridden in search of a bride.

753
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,400
And you are by far the fairest in the kingdom.

754
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,800
Soon after the two of them were wed in a lavish and elaborate ceremony.

755
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:38,920
Never in the history of the kingdom had there been so fair a queen.

756
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,500
Her quarters were the height of luxury.

757
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:45,940
Silk and bed and lace and servants to wait hand and foot upon her.

758
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,320
She had 100 beautiful Persian cats.

759
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:52,840
And each of them had their own servant.

760
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,140
Autumn soon came to pass.

761
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:56,880
And then winter.

762
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,560
When spring arrived the queen went before the king and said,

763
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:04,500
I have hired the greatest lawyer in all of the kingdom.

764
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:08,080
And I am divorcing you and taking half of everything.

765
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:14,220
The king grew angry and shot that skanky bitch right between the fucking eyes.

766
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:18,640
Then he poisoned her beloved cats and eviscerated all of the cats' servants.

767
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:24,300
And burned all her stupid shit and threw her body off the roof where it was devoured by coyotes.

768
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,120
And then the king hunted down and shot her.

769
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:26,900
And then he shot the coyotes.

770
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,580
And burned down all of the villages in his kingdom.

771
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,320
And killed all of the women and children.

772
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:35,100
And castrated the men and made them eat their own severed cocks.

773
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:38,480
And then he hanged himself with his own intestines and died.

774
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,420
The end.

775
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,740
Six Semper Tyrannis.

776
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,280
Death to all kings.

777
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,480
In days long past.

778
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,140
There was a rabbit who wanted to be a man.

779
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,640
He hopped around the grass like other rabbits.

780
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:04,460
But while they sat around nibbling dandelions he was dreaming of being a man.

781
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,400
One day he was hopping around the woods.

782
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,640
And he met a bear.

783
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,120
He asked of the bear,

784
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:17,720
Mr. Bear, have you ever wanted to be anything but a bear?

785
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:23,540
And unsheathing his giant throbbing bear penis he said to the rabbit,

786
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,360
Why no, Mr. Rabbit.

787
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,860
I am strong and fat and the master of the forest.

788
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:33,740
He did not rape the little bunny as you probably hoped or expected he would.

789
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,260
Instead he peed on a juniper bush.

790
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,740
Mr. Rabbit then said goodbye to Mr. Bear and was thankful he did not get raped.

791
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:48,400
Mr. Rabbit decided he would go to the people and ask them to teach him their strange ways.

792
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,960
So that he might learn to be a man.

793
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,880
Mr. Rabbit hopped out to the highway.

794
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,240
And was immediately smashed to a mushy pulp by a cement truck.

795
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:02,420
His body lay there in the hot sun buzzing with flies as car after car ran him down.

796
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:07,280
Until he became an elongated smear in the right tire rut of I-35.

797
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:13,840
Rain and maggots and the forces of decay broke his body down into those basic of organic components.

798
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,440
And he was reincarnated as a person.

799
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:22,200
He was born on a cold winter's day addicted to crack and heroin.

800
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,540
Which his street hooker mother called crack-a-win.

801
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,200
He was deformed with a club foot and a tricked knee.

802
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,280
And he was deaf and blind and he had an irritating high pitched whinny when he talked.

803
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,100
And he smelled really really bad due to a glandular condition.

804
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:42,160
He had one eye missing completely and gnarly teeth and acne and a small cock.

805
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,300
And delusions of a future career in pop music.

806
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,700
And he walked like a chicken and his anus leaked all the time.

807
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,080
And he stuttered and he wasn't very smart.

808
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,180
He was a little boy.

809
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,200
He was ugly as fuck.

810
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:56,720
He never cleaned his fingernails and hung around with Irishmen.

811
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:01,640
And he was uncircumcised and rife with smegma and Jesus did not love him.

812
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:06,760
He had orange hair like Ronald McDonald and it had lice and he never washed it.

813
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,960
He grew up to be a very unhappy man.

814
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,580
No woman wanted him.

815
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,640
No homosexual was so desperate as to have him.

816
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,360
Dogs wouldn't lick peanut butter off his genitals.

817
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,240
Children ran screaming from the sight of him.

818
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,020
And spurned his offer of candy and van rides.

819
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,560
He drank a lot.

820
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:34,140
And one night he was driving drunk and crashed his car into a tree and died by the side of I-35 while trying to avoid hitting a rabbit.

821
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:40,020
The rabbit was pregnant and sometime later gave birth to a litter.

822
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,680
One of the litter was a fat and healthy male.

823
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,980
His body contained the reincarnated soul of the dead man.

824
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,240
He spent his whole life hopping in the grass eating dandelions.

825
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,020
And never once dreamed of being a man.

826
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,780
One day men from the city came into the forest with nets.

827
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:01,640
And they captured the bunny and all of his family.

828
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,820
They were taken to a huge building where men in white aprons ground them alive into dog food.

829
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:11,540
In the nearby village lived a man everyone called Uncle John.

830
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:15,400
Uncle John's dogs liked the dog food very much.

831
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:19,100
The rabbit flesh ground into the horse meat was very savory.

832
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,720
The dogs were very fat and happy.

833
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,140
They were well fed as their master was very rich.

834
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,080
One day Uncle John came to the kennel where they all lay.

835
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,040
Corpulent on dog beds.

836
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,980
And he raped them all.

837
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:39,200
He raped them and raped them and raped them and raped them and raped them and raped them and raped them and raped them.

838
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:46,500
And he raped them and raped them and raped them and raped them and raped them and raped them and raped them and raped them and raped them and raped them and raped them and raped them and raped them and raped them.

839
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,360
and raped them and raped them and raped them and raped them and raped them and raped them and raped them and raped them and raped them.

840
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:49,360


841
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:54,600
and raped them, and raped them, and raped them, and raped them, and raped them for seven hours,

842
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:59,120
because he had to be at the office early and was too busy to devote seven years to it.

843
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:06,700
I love to rape dogs, Uncle John said to himself, and I gave them all AIDS with my horrible diseased cock.

844
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:12,480
With his rape lust satisfied, Uncle John laid back in his luxurious rich bastard bed,

845
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:17,700
lit a cigarette, took a huge satisfying lung full of the savory tobacco smoke,

846
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,900
exhaled an impressive cloud, and fell immediately asleep.

847
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,820
That night they all died in a tragic fire caused by careless smoking.

848
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:27,760
The end.

849
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:34,000
Now didn't we just see what could happen with careless smoking last night?

850
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,200
Okay, that's what I've got for you guys for now.

851
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,480
I've got a couple more, but I'll do them maybe later.

852
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,460
Time to go get Bob-tized.

853
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:46,840
Let's go.

854
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,760
Let's go dip some shits.

855
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,280
We're gonna make dip shits.

856
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,900
Just like our parents did before us.

857
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,520
That recording was from a video cam, unfortunately,

858
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,460
because I wasn't there to double check the main audio recorder.

859
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:14,620
I was taking it easy that X-Day drill because it's time for me to do that

860
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:17,680
and let younger subgeniuses worry about me.

861
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,540
I'm not recording everything.

862
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:25,820
And besides, Sandy Boone's professional film crew was there shooting and interviewing.

863
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:30,920
That documentary about the church is finished, by the way,

864
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,220
and it's making the film festival circuits.

865
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:37,900
And I'm pretty confident that it'll end up being widely seen.

866
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:44,660
And yes, this hour of slack is obviously going to be a lot longer than an hour.

867
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,300
That's okay.

868
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,680
It's okay.

869
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:50,980
Yeah.

870
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:04,720
Some of that has to be cut out for us,

871
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:04,940
ì¤í° iPhone 10 and so many articles

872
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:04,940


873
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:04,940


874
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:06,340
I'll give you the answer in many days in another videobleack-'

875
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:09,940
I hope so.

876
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:16,540
because I'm wanted in Washington.

877
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:17,680
And I know you're gonna continue that kid belt, which is all right.

878
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,600
a lot of it until now when I went looking for legume recordings. He did a

879
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:30,240
lot of spouting and ranting at that 2017 drill. Discovering these recordings that

880
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:35,640
I wasn't there for has been a real happy surprise for me. Legume put in a lot of

881
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:41,260
what we might call podcrust time with the upstart subgenius show called Time

882
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:48,840
for the Show. In this case with Dr. Argus Fox and Reverend Pease.

883
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:56,120
Hey Pease, why don't you come up here and take Reverend Flusey's spot? She says she doesn't get up here.

884
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:02,200
Come on Pease, come sit with us. Come on Pease, there's no such thing

885
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:06,340
as you can't talk anymore. I've heard you at four o'clock in the morning, Pease.

886
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:11,240
Here Pease. Here Pease. Pease, Pease, Pease, Pease, Pease.

887
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:20,240
If you leave there's a dress coming. Oh he's gonna load up on a little

888
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:25,880
of a rape bear urine. If you drink enough rape bear urine you can actually ward

889
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:32,540
off rape bears by releasing that urine through your sweat and perspiration.

890
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:34,880
Pease.

891
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,860
Oh look at this, Pease has nothing to say.

892
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:41,220
Pease.

893
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:48,480
Pease has nothing to say. Did you say all your words Reverend Pease? Did you, did you

894
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,760
mumble them all out now?

895
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,140
Now don't forget Reverend Pease to enunciate your words at the microphone.

896
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:05,520
Enunciate means talk. That's right. Take those words like I said, roll them around in your

897
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,660
mouth for a while and then spit it out. Pretend it's a cock at the bus station.

898
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:10,060
Oh.

899
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,120
I'm stuck on the table. Do I get a beer?

900
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:14,800
Yes.

901
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,960
Somebody, somebody get me a beer.

902
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,520
That would be nice.

903
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,300
Who invited you up here Pease? Oh wait, that was me.

904
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,180
First mistake of the day.

905
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:33,760
I gotta adjust my liquids. Okay, so, to you.

906
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,160
Reverend Pease.

907
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,860
It's a pleasure. It's a pleasure Reverend Pease.

908
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,260
That makes one of you.

909
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:40,540
You know, well, Argus Fox.

910
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,540
I just wanted to say.

911
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,960
The pleasure is all yours.

912
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:46,420
Oh thanks, yeah, I didn't want one.

913
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:50,360
You know, Reverend Pease, there's something I've been wanting to say to you. You spend

914
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,960
far too much time on the microphone.

915
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,240
Well, then why'd you ask me to come up here again? I can barely speak.

916
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:59,700
Well, because I figured there was no harm in it since you already spend far too much

917
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,340
time on the microphone.

918
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:04,540
Maybe, maybe if we get you to do another hour you won't say another word for the next two

919
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:04,720
days.

920
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:09,320
Well, that's a good plan. I can't find fault with that. But listen, there's been so much

921
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:15,420
revelations here at this X Day. And someone had to be the voice of reason to counter the

922
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:22,680
propaganda and the robot's things, terrible, tirade of hatred and fear that he holds over

923
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:29,480
all of us. And I took that mantle. I didn't want it. It was thrust upon me. And I feel

924
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:36,180
that I've served the church well in these dark hours. And, you know, I'm fighting a

925
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,300
good fight for you people.

926
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,160
See the incredible Pease.

927
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,280
26 cents.

928
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:44,820
Turn around. You missed the Pease.

929
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:54,580
I'd like to hear more, Reverend Pease, about your alien robot stang conspiracy.

930
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:03,040
Well, first of all, I think conspiracy is a strong word. We have documented facts. We

931
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:09,140
have clowns right now rushing documents taken from robot stangs, very own people.

932
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:09,140


933
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:39,140
We have this manual who they serve in the netherworld's

934
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:47,400
We'll pay to know what you'll really drink tonight live at the Thorazine Urine Suboxone Bloodstream Podcast Double Hour Special.

935
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,380
Making sure the game doesn't put a kick me sign on my back.

936
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:52,120
No, I wouldn't put a kick me sign on your back.

937
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,100
He just tattooed it across your head while you were asleep.

938
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:56,860
Stab me.

939
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:06,760
That's always so much fun when you go up and stick that stab me sign on somebody and by the end of the hall they're dead.

940
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,300
I think that would be a great tattoo.

941
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:11,620
I'm going to have Amy Munson tattoo that right on my chest.

942
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,880
It's going to say stab me.

943
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:17,120
I want to get a tattoo across my knuckles that says trigger warning.

944
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:23,540
I'm going to put a little target, a little crosshair target right above it.

945
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:24,640
It's going to say stab me.

946
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:26,920
What do you think, Legu?

947
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,340
I think I'd listen to that.

948
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:31,180
Take me up on that?

949
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,220
I'd take you up on that.

950
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,880
Sounds like a great deal for everybody.

951
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,460
I don't know what your tattoo is telling me to do, but I don't like it.

952
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,280
Yeah, it is kind of...

953
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,560
It's alien, isn't it?

954
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,500
It's sucking me into the vortex of your skin and it's...

955
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,960
It's my new natural camouflage.

956
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:47,320
It's a dark place there.

957
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,960
It's all from the biomechanical organs inside of Legu.

958
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,240
Yeah, you know...

959
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,120
For all we know, Legu could be a robot too.

960
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:00,900
For all you know, I could be the only one here.

961
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,660
Not a robot.

962
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:06,980
No, we know that Fit Julie is controlling everything from the force.

963
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,320
Made to be a robot.

964
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:11,740
So yeah, we're just going to have to start checking people.

965
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:12,760
We'll get the magnet.

966
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,160
What time is the check?

967
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,680
We mentioned it earlier and I forgot.

968
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,040
I think it's important information.

969
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,200
We should get it out there again.

970
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,320
Probably after hamburgers.

971
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,300
After hamburgers.

972
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,760
Post-hamburger robot check.

973
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,740
So for those of you that...

974
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,420
Look for people chewing oddly.

975
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:29,980
Chewing oddly, yeah.

976
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,480
There's going to be some special sauce.

977
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:34,780
And now, is that part of why the truck didn't do well?

978
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,900
Because of the...

979
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,420
The chewy sperm you added to the burger?

980
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,860
Well, we wouldn't put it in the burger.

981
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,020
Just as an accoutrement?

982
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:44,700
Yeah, it came in a side cup.

983
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:45,220
Okay.

984
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:46,140
You could dip it.

985
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,160
That sounds tasty.

986
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,960
It was kind of like marshmallow fluff with extra salt.

987
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:52,420
Caviar.

988
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,260
Of the gods.

989
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:04,340
So, what do you think of this new revelation that there's a possible FBI agent on this?

990
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:05,200
Well, I...

991
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,760
I see the note that was...

992
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:07,360
Oh.

993
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,040
Mysteriously thrown at me.

994
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,720
To examine the evidence.

995
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,900
Wrapped around a rock and knocked me in the head.

996
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,900
I love that shade of pink ink.

997
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:18,940
Now, this is an important fact.

998
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,500
This is written in pink ink, as Lagume kindly points out.

999
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:27,920
And it does have some hugs and kisses from the FBI agent, which I think is sweet.

1000
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,160
That's nice.

1001
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:29,940
They're people, too.

1002
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,120
Which means they're probably really nice.

1003
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,700
I don't know that this information should be released to the general public, man.

1004
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:36,660
I really don't.

1005
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:37,740
Now is the time.

1006
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:39,540
Well, well, we didn't...

1007
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:40,580
We didn't like...

1008
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,420
All time, but time left.

1009
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,840
Now is the moment.

1010
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:45,300
I don't know here.

1011
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:45,900
It says...

1012
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:47,120
Dear...

1013
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,700
Well, you read this already, didn't you?

1014
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,440
Yeah, I read it.

1015
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:50,080
Oh, well, then we're...

1016
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,400
There's nothing else to do here.

1017
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,660
I know that second word's a little hard, but I actually think it's on your birth certificate.

1018
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,500
Dear retard.

1019
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,780
Well, I...

1020
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:00,780
The possibility that...

1021
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:01,660
As we all know...

1022
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:06,060
Here at X-Day, there could be an FBI agent here infiltrating, and that letter seems to suggest...

1023
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:06,440
My plan...

1024
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:06,860
That's just...

1025
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,960
Is to go up to the FBI agent and say,

1026
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,320
Hi, I'm Pease.

1027
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,100
Want to be friends?

1028
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,920
So, I think I've got a plan.

1029
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,300
You guys are on your own.

1030
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:20,120
What if he may already be someone you think is your friend?

1031
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:20,800
Well...

1032
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,060
I mean, somebody you would never suspect.

1033
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:23,960
That'll be awesome.

1034
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:27,840
Somebody very, very close to you.

1035
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:33,340
You know, the thing is, you still get to maintain the story and film rights when things like this happen to you.

1036
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:35,680
So, you might, when you get out, have an opportunity.

1037
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:37,960
You know, you're not going to be the only one.

1038
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,140
Fox, Fox, I figured it out.

1039
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:44,120
I figured out the trigger word they used for your Manchurian candidate experience with Bob.

1040
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,020
Thank goodness.

1041
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,020
What was it?

1042
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,060
I've got problems, man.

1043
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,180
I've got problems.

1044
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:54,740
I believe the actual word that triggered his programming was the word...

1045
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:55,920
Percolator.

1046
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:57,440
Percolator.

1047
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,300
Do you have problems, man?

1048
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:00,400
I was polite, though.

1049
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:01,660
I did ask him to move it.

1050
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:06,200
Oh, that was probably one of the men in black who put that...

1051
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,360
Percolator there for you to spot.

1052
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:13,280
I still feel kind of secure because I've seen all 17 people here.

1053
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:15,200
It would have to be...

1054
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:15,540
Intimately.

1055
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,860
You're the only one I really don't know, Legume.

1056
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:19,420
That's right.

1057
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:26,800
My concern has now become increased because that's just what the FBI would do, is turn Legume against us.

1058
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:36,000
He'd been a deep plant for 20 years, and now, finally, while I'm at X-Day, he springs his giant trap shut and collects us all.

1059
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,380
Or perhaps...

1060
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:43,020
One swift blow, and the Church of the Subgenius is no longer a thorn in the side of the conspiracy.

1061
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:44,460
I hope that's not true.

1062
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,480
I hope it's not true.

1063
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:46,640
Because I love you.

1064
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:47,360
But still.

1065
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:49,720
I hope it's not true.

1066
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,280
I'm afraid I can't comment on that.

1067
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,380
There goes Fit Julie.

1068
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:54,640
There goes Fit Julie.

1069
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,620
Okay, now I can comment on that.

1070
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:57,000
No.

1071
00:56:58,700 --> 00:56:59,740
Wait, what was the question?

1072
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,000
Hey.

1073
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:06,260
You know, someone who's missing this X-Day is Dr. Dark is not here.

1074
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:10,240
Sadly, he's having serious health challenges.

1075
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:16,780
But Princess Petal has brought the material to make a card so that we can all send him Bob's blessing.

1076
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:18,180
Awesome.

1077
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:19,500
Oh, yeah.

1078
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:20,180
That's a great idea.

1079
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:23,600
If everybody could sign the card for Dr. Dark, that would be awesome.

1080
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:27,620
If it wasn't for Dr. Dark, I wouldn't have made it to the last X-Day.

1081
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:28,320
That's correct.

1082
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:32,740
So, on my behalf, I know that I would wish him quite well.

1083
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,400
Let's not be that extreme, you know.

1084
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,140
So.

1085
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,820
No, I think Chaz has him beat by a decade.

1086
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:46,400
Again, LeGame is referencing people that, you know, 50 years ago, maybe 100 years ago, were in the church.

1087
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,360
Yes, that's right.

1088
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:56,240
The people who made it possible for you to come out here and sit here at the microphone talking about those old men who were long dead.

1089
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,000
To them guys.

1090
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:02,880
Like that stupid old grandpa who died fighting the Japanese in World War II.

1091
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:06,080
Well, where are you going with that, man?

1092
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,420
Everybody's got a grandpa.

1093
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:15,340
All of those old times of geniuses were just hokey old mysteries drowned in the dust of mundane obscurity now.

1094
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:23,480
Do you subscribe to the belief that World War II was just a cover to move everyone from Earth to Mars where we now live?

1095
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:26,360
We're all secretly living in Montana.

1096
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:28,780
I knew it was crowded.

1097
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:33,160
Way to go, Argus.

1098
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,840
It's not a secret anymore.

1099
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:35,740
Jesus.

1100
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:38,520
This is the worst next day ever.

1101
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:40,080
We've given away all our secrets.

1102
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,220
We've changed dates.

1103
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,720
There's a robot staying right in the muck.

1104
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:46,440
And there's just nothing sacred anymore.

1105
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:47,860
We've done none of this.

1106
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,500
We're not responsible for any of this.

1107
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,900
Yeah, I just showed up, man.

1108
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:54,520
We're just puppets here dancing on the end of Bob's strings.

1109
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:58,800
How is this any of our fault?

1110
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:01,120
Well, I'm not saying it's anybody's fault.

1111
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:04,220
I think it might be your fault, if anything.

1112
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,120
Why would it be my fault?

1113
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:06,420
Why would it be my fault?

1114
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:06,420


1115
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:08,440
Because I'm tired of taking the blame for all this shit.

1116
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,660
Nobody's blaming you.

1117
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:16,340
You're the one, a self-admitting FBI plant that's been here for 20 years to finally spring his trap shot.

1118
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:19,060
And now you're saying that I'm the bad guy.

1119
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:23,320
That's the beauty of it.

1120
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:25,080
Not giving a fuck.

1121
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,260
There you go, man.

1122
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:27,700
Take the blame for what?

1123
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:28,160
No.

1124
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:29,300
Take a load off.

1125
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,060
It's not mine.

1126
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,300
Take a load off, Annie.

1127
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:32,400
Take a load off.

1128
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,760
I'll take a load off on you, peas.

1129
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,120
Take a load off.

1130
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:36,400
That's a 25-year-old.

1131
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:37,020
That's a $25 fee.

1132
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:39,500
That's right.

1133
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:40,420
You'll take a load.

1134
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:41,760
If you look at my back, you'll see a menu.

1135
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,820
He would have said that's not going to happen last year, but he's in a bad place, folks.

1136
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:46,520
I got troubles.

1137
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,760
Yeah, he's in a bad place.

1138
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:49,100
He's sitting between us.

1139
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:50,240
He's in a bad place.

1140
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:52,020
$25 a shot.

1141
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,420
We're going to get peas' money back.

1142
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:54,920
No.

1143
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:57,580
So store it up.

1144
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,600
Let's buy back peas' membership in the church of the sun.

1145
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:05,100
Who will bid to buy Reverend Peas' membership?

1146
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,280
I'll bid $35.

1147
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:06,700
$35.

1148
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:09,580
Bidding starts at $36.

1149
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:13,200
That's a true subgenius song.

1150
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:13,640
I'm sorry.

1151
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,820
We wouldn't let you bid, but you're about to be on the ban list anyway.

1152
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:17,560
Nice.

1153
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,120
Maybe Frop Trula can give me a ride home.

1154
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:22,420
Perhaps, but I doubt he will.

1155
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:23,540
Probably not.

1156
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:23,980
He's mad.

1157
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:29,800
At least not without a stop at the bus station for you to enunciate around his testicles a few times.

1158
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:30,880
Enunciate?

1159
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:31,740
Is that what you call it?

1160
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:34,020
It's fancy tongue work.

1161
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:35,720
That's the fancy words.

1162
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:38,240
I forgot about that, Reverend Peas.

1163
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,440
Way to speak to your audience.

1164
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:41,020
I am it, Peas.

1165
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,780
Peas, you're the entire audience.

1166
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:44,940
I know it.

1167
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:49,200
Because if anything, a subgenius radio program is always punishing to an audience.

1168
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:51,680
If you think about it, we're all our own audience.

1169
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,160
I know I'm my own audience.

1170
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:55,840
Great work.

1171
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:57,620
Masterly.

1172
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:00,340
You guys get half the shit that goes on here.

1173
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:02,720
You know that, don't you?

1174
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:05,100
You only really see the surface humor.

1175
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:10,180
You never actually get the real punchline that the ones in the know get.

1176
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,500
Break the surface tension in the port-a-potty.

1177
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:14,800
There is a sacred codex.

1178
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:18,120
Every time you see something funny, think about it real thoroughly.

1179
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,940
Cogitate on the thought of what you've seen.

1180
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:22,700
Move it around in your brain.

1181
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:26,500
Like that fantasy of you enunciating around a pair of balls in the bus station.

1182
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:32,640
I'm surprised, Lagune, because, you know, many secrets were revealed today in the surprise spring up show.

1183
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:35,700
And for you to bring up these kind of things.

1184
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:43,900
I was at the top of the points when those secrets were kind of revealed and the important selection process of what was or what was not at Dobbs Head.

1185
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:48,340
These things were all revealed today to some of the church members for the first time.

1186
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:49,720
That's good.

1187
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,320
You know, that's going to play well on radio.

1188
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,560
Plays well with the audience, though.

1189
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:54,360
Yeah, it does.

1190
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:55,620
Radio.

1191
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:56,600
Wait a minute.

1192
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:57,960
There are people in the audience.

1193
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,040
There are going to be people listening to the radio.

1194
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:05,040
There's thousands upon thousands of subgenius all across this great land.

1195
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:05,600
There's like.

1196
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,280
It's only you, Pease.

1197
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:11,180
None of us actually are members of the Church of the Subgenius.

1198
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:16,300
This has all been an elaborate scam to lure you here so we could laugh at you and make fun of you.

1199
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:32,440
Philo Drummond had this idea back in 1977 to bet Reverend Ivan Stang that even if it takes 50 fucking years, he can get this motherfucker right here to sit at a table and be completely humiliated between the two of us.

1200
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,420
And everybody is in on it but you.

1201
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:35,360
I'll pay.

1202
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:36,380
I'll pay for that for an hour.

1203
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:37,040
So.

1204
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:37,500
Everybody.

1205
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:38,300
So.

1206
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:39,820
Time to let the cat out of the bag.

1207
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:40,800
Point and laugh.

1208
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:45,400
Now we're going to put you in a bag.

1209
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:48,300
Why you got to hurt my feels like that, LeCun?

1210
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:50,700
Why you got to be like that, man?

1211
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:53,540
I'm just trying to have fun.

1212
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:54,840
It's just his natural hospitality.

1213
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:56,240
I only do what your parents have paid me to do.

1214
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:59,380
I'm just trying to get home on the saucers like everybody else.

1215
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,340
You can't tell me I'm doing it wrong.

1216
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:04,560
My question is valid.

1217
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:04,960
You can get on the saucer.

1218
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:05,160
You just need to get in.

1219
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:05,700
I only do what your parents have paid me to do.

1220
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:05,700


1221
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:05,700


1222
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:05,700


1223
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:07,040
The trick is not in doing it right or wrong.

1224
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,140
You can hang on to the bag by the windshield wipers.

1225
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:13,160
The trick is in doing it without falling on your butt.

1226
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,560
More enlightenment from looking at you.

1227
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:17,300
I don't know how much more of this my brain can take.

1228
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:24,640
Well, if it's anything like your, how much work that you can put into choosing your drug

1229
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,700
dealers, then maybe, maybe a good bit.

1230
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:28,900
I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.

1231
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:29,260
Maybe a good bit.

1232
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:30,100
Man, I got troubles.

1233
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,480
I got some troubles, man.

1234
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:35,460
Is it like blues song worth?

1235
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:35,700
I don't know.

1236
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:35,700


1237
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:35,700


1238
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:36,540
Men

1239
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:40,980
Don't ask me.

1240
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:42,180
Don't ask me.

1241
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:44,660
I've done my best up here.

1242
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:45,400
I'm sorry.

1243
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:46,500
Could you repeat that?

1244
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:47,860
You're mumbling again.

1245
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,040
I'm sure I'm not.

1246
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:52,800
Well, you sure are because I'm having a lot of trouble understanding what you say.

1247
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:53,480
Let me know.

1248
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:57,900
Some people were born with a silver spoon in their mouth.

1249
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:00,300
But peas had a crack spoon.

1250
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:01,760
That's by design.

1251
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,080
That's by design.

1252
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:06,620
Cosmically, it needs to be that way for me to be peas.

1253
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:08,480
It's nice for you to point that out.

1254
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,360
But it is a requirement to become peas.

1255
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,060
You have to have your soul patch exactly like that.

1256
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:15,240
Uh-oh.

1257
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:16,220
Everyone knows this.

1258
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:17,400
Is that where you store your soul?

1259
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:19,700
Everyone knows this, Legume.

1260
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:22,160
If you hung out more, you'd know these things.

1261
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:25,120
I don't mean to be, like, soul patch phobic or anything.

1262
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:30,500
You know, I mean, if you don't feel comfortable with this, you know, we can switch to another subject.

1263
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,560
Peas, you don't have to go away angry.

1264
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,460
You just have to go away.

1265
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,540
We could go back to the mumbling again.

1266
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:37,780
I'm timing Legume.

1267
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:38,680
That's all I'm doing.

1268
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:40,320
I'm keeping records for science.

1269
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:44,160
We're just, uh, are you done now?

1270
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:44,500
Oh.

1271
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:45,180
I'm just listening.

1272
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:48,120
Science will not remove the humiliation of peas.

1273
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,960
I'd like to give Reverend Peas two minutes to refute my charges of his semen.

1274
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:56,300
You have to go much, much harder than this news of you rattling on for 15 minutes to humiliate peas.

1275
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:57,000
Please.

1276
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:57,960
Please, peas.

1277
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:59,060
This is hour three.

1278
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:01,360
I'll give you a chance, Reverend Peas.

1279
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,500
I'm giving you a chance here.

1280
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:03,260
Give me a chance.

1281
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:06,940
Who are you to give any subgenius a chance?

1282
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:08,120
Oh, I can give you a chance quite easily.

1283
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:08,880
All I have to do is stop talking.

1284
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:11,040
Subgeniuses make their own chances.

1285
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:11,760
Right?

1286
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:14,140
I'm going to give you a chance to talk without me interfering.

1287
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:14,280
What's that?

1288
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:15,340
Subgeniuses?

1289
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,260
Don't make me mansplain this to you, son.

1290
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:17,700
Oh, please.

1291
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:20,140
That's going to, we're going to hit all the bases.

1292
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:21,760
We're going to do a trifecta, brother.

1293
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:22,020
That's right.

1294
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,120
We're going to do the trifecta.

1295
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,340
We're going to do the trifecta.

1296
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:24,820
Come on, man.

1297
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:25,380
Here's eggplant.

1298
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:29,460
I got four bucks on the third race, and if you come in last, man, I'm going to be mad.

1299
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:30,020
Are you?

1300
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,080
Put a bet down for me, would you?

1301
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:34,220
Yeah, you're going to be out there.

1302
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:34,600
It's going to be.

1303
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:35,860
And here it comes.

1304
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:36,920
And here it comes.

1305
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:37,480
And here it comes.

1306
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:38,180
And here it comes.

1307
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:38,600
And here it comes.

1308
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:39,120
And here it comes.

1309
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:40,260
And here it comes.

1310
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,180
He'll take that one.

1311
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:42,920
I'll finish this one.

1312
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:46,640
Did you guys see how the whole Sunday just kept talking?

1313
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:47,220
It's like.

1314
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:47,780
That's right.

1315
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:48,460
It's like you choked with him.

1316
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:50,260
Oh, yeah.

1317
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:51,460
Subgenius style.

1318
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:55,920
Tree, tree, tree.

1319
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:59,260
Hi, this is Joe, and I'm not home.

1320
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:03,000
But I would sure like to know you, Carl.

1321
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:09,100
So if you leave your name and your phone number, I'll call you back and I'll get home.

1322
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:09,720
Hey, hey.

1323
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,180
Tree, tree, tree.

1324
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:16,980
Cut your goddamn fucking trees out, you goofy motherfucker.

1325
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,680
You got three stuck up your ass.

1326
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:24,560
Is that why you say tree, tree, tree?

1327
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:26,940
Hey, Joe, and I'm not home.

1328
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:30,480
Goofy motherfucking tree ass motherfucker.

1329
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:32,380
I'm a bitch and bitch motherfucker.

1330
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:42,980
I'm a bitch and bitch motherfucker.

1331
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:43,160
I'm a bitch and bitch motherfucker.

1332
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:44,220
I'm a bitch and bitch motherfucker.

1333
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:48,620
The sun god awakens from the slumber of millennia.

1334
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:53,540
Eyes crusted over, his joints stiff from inertia.

1335
01:06:55,040 --> 01:07:02,280
He flips on the lamp of the universe and watches as filth encrusted cockroaches of Andromeda

1336
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:06,060
scurry beneath cheaply stylish appliances.

1337
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,860
Resting on glistening quartz.

1338
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:14,280
Countertops in Medusa's tastefully appointed cuisine.

1339
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:22,960
A smooth, unbroken surface, save for a small, pulsating orifice near the center.

1340
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:25,460
Father has talked to you.

1341
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:26,640
Dispatch into the toilet.

1342
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:35,420
Fumes and gases pierce the space-time fabric emanating from the orifice nestled in brown,

1343
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:40,140
passing through eons and galaxies and beyond.

1344
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:40,240
Passing through eons and galaxies and beyond.

1345
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:40,240


1346
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:40,240


1347
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:48,420
The lives of glistening wax, where pod-spackled life-forks composed of chlorine gas argue

1348
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:54,800
pointlessly over sandwiches as if a higher-priced margarine would have made any difference.

1349
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,060
But tell me more.

1350
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:05,700
Crossing abruptly through shabby office furniture, housed in a corrugated metal warehouse on

1351
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:10,200
the outskirts of Topeka during the last year of the Harding.

1352
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:33,080
A sad house with a broken Purple ÑÑÐ¿.

1353
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:33,080


1354
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:33,080


1355
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:33,080


1356
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:33,080


1357
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:33,080


1358
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:33,080


1359
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:33,080


1360
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:33,080


1361
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:33,080


1362
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:33,080


1363
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:33,080


1364
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:33,080


1365
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:33,080


1366
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:34,560
St accompagne.

1367
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:47,520
His anus was brown, that's what the ladies all said

1368
01:08:51,360 --> 01:09:00,540
His anus was brown, they wanted a guy who smelled like turpentine instead

1369
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:11,680
He was a man from Kansas, his pockets lined with gold

1370
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:22,360
Wrapped in a burlap canvas, there was mildew in the folds

1371
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:30,520
A warm gentle spray that disinfected all that stench

1372
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:37,140
Tail and acrid fabric, the ladies approved

1373
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:44,280
As soon as they noticed that the sphincter was elastic

1374
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:50,940
So fashions change, the world keeps spinning

1375
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:58,940
Won't you look at him now, he's the toast of the town

1376
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:03,300
Because his anus is brown

1377
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:07,980
Music

1378
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:28,920
So

1379
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:58,920


1380
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:28,920


1381
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,820
And don't forget, for even half a second

1382
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:34,400
To praise Bob
