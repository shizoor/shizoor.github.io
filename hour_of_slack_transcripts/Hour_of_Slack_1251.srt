139
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,800
hahahaha

140
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,800
مل

141
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,460
forget it, she walked up to me at the counter and in a very sexy voice asked me what I had to offer

142
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:09,060
in the trouser department. Apparently she wanted to buy some flared crimpling slacks for her

143
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,440
long-legged father's birthday. Very partial to bright colours it was. Anyway, I told her I was

144
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,220
almost certain I'd have something with a good length that would satisfy her and asked her to

145
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:25,200
follow me upstairs. Well, after going through me trousers, she surprised me by saying that she

146
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,460
really fancied the large pink pair that I had. Not only did they hang well, but she thought they

147
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:36,960
looked really attractive, particularly the way they swung about loosely when I walked. Mind you,

148
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:41,780
she wasn't too sure of the size at first and had me lay them out on the counter so she could measure

149
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:48,480
them up. She also ran her fingers admiringly down the crease. Well, she decided to go for it, asked

150
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,940
me how much. I says three and a half quid. She asked me rather cheekily if I would go down. Well,

151
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,180
you know, thought about it. I said no. She said no. I said no. I said no. I said no. I said no. I said no.

152
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:55,640
I said no. I said no. I said no. I said no. I said no. I said no. I said no. I said no. I said no.

153
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:00,240
Longer the hard, decided to drop them for her, which I did there and then. What fun,

154
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:05,080
backwards and forwards, over the counter. A good bit of haggling, and no mistake.

155
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,660
I was thinking about this, right, because I've been back to that shop, because the weather's

156
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,980
beginning to change a bit. Getting a bit parker, isn't it? Well, I tell you what, I went out the

157
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:19,100
other morning and me buns were so cold it started to change colour. I'm not kidding. When me very

158
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:24,940
sexy lady friend, sexy Sam, saw me coming towards her, me purple hair sticking out me coat,

159
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:30,040
she told me to get it covered immediately. So I said, I'm going to the shop to buy a hat,

160
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:36,680
a fur one. Well, when I got there, you know, I asked sexy Salea, the very sexy lady friend hat

161
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:42,880
assistant, to show me what she had, you know, in her fur department. She said she'd be only too

162
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,060
pleased to show me what she had downstairs, and led me to the basement, where I could see

163
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:53,700
everything she had on full display. I tell you what, you wouldn't believe how much she had.

164
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,160
She had every kind of fur in the world. She had a lot of fur, and she had a lot of fur, and she

165
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,160


166
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,120
had a lot of fur. She had a lot of fur, and she had a lot of fur. I was going to go for a fox fur,

167
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,560
but as soon as sexy Salea said she had a particularly nice beaver that I might be

168
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,740
interested in, immediately changed me mind. Well, you know, after getting it out for me,

169
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,600
I've got to say I've never seen such a big bushy one like it in all my life.

170
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,640
Well, when I asked her if she could, you know, try it on for size, she said,

171
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,520
I might find it a bit tight at first, but if I buried me head deep enough, then it should stretch

172
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,140
a little to accommodate me fully. Tell you what, she weren't wrong, and when I looked at it in the

173
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:31,860
mirror, you know, sideways on, I could see it had slid in perfectly. Well, you know, after that,

174
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,740
she then said she'd summat round the back that I might be interested in, led me into the storeroom

175
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:42,980
to show me a selection of gloves that had just arrived. Well, I was obviously interested, but as

176
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:49,860
I didn't know what size I was, I had to get sexist Salea to measure my hand. Well, after asking me to,

177
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,700
you know, give her a finger, which I promptly did, she then asked me to stick my thumb up.

178
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,140
No, I didn't. I didn't. I didn't. I didn't. I didn't. I didn't. I didn't. I didn't. I didn't. I didn't.

179
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:55,320
I didn't. I didn't. I didn't. I didn't. I didn't. I didn't. I didn't. I didn't. I didn't. I didn't. I didn't.

180
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:00,380
problem at all. Within minutes, she declared, as she was holding her measuring tape, that I was

181
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:05,440
extra, extra large. Well, then she had to take a phone call, but while she was on the mobile,

182
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:12,100
I took the opportunity of rummaging in her box until I found the perfect fit, and when I withdrew,

183
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:20,600
sexist Salea nodded appreciatively at my great big leathery pair. Dressing up for the ladies, yeah.

184
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,480
Re apenas era, emaide um bro promoting assangemmd

185
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:31,480

188
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:38,260
Speaking From His Album, It Was a Wonderful Night.

189
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:01,140
the only real religion, because it's the only one that admits it's so totally full of crap,

190
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,240
that makes it pretty much the only valid one. Don't you agree?

191
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:11,720
Anyway, you can always get more information about this church by checking us out on the internet,

192
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,180
www.sebgenius.com.

193
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:21,600
And what's it about? Well, it's about the great super salesman J.R. Bob Dobbs,

194
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,320
who discovered in 1953 that there was a conspiracy of normal people robbing away the slack of all the weirdos,

195
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,440
abnormals, disbelievers, or those who will believe anything, which is what we're looking for, friends.

196
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,100
Those who can join us in this nameless fight against that conspiracy of normal people.

197
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,940
And how are you going to get slack, and how are you going to fight the conspiracy?

198
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:47,400
Here's our secret. We won't tell you. It's up to you, because only you know what's best for you.

199
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,580
So, praise God, I don't even know what's good.

200
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:58,200
Coming up next, I've got to get this show done in a hurry, so I can go on to some serious, serious slack.

201
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:03,980
I understand that when you get married, you can have sex, and I've heard a lot about that.

202
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,260
I was just so anxious to check it out.

203
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,780
Well, so I'm going to let the older tapes take care of the rest of the show.

204
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,220
Praise Bob.

205
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,060
Bob.

206
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:12,400
Bob.

207
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:18,620
I heard Mojo almost had mutiny in New Zealand because he kept spewing Bob.

208
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,220
And we have...

209
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,360
People that work for the company who actually go to church and stuff.

210
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,300
Well, I guess that's their problem.

211
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,520
And they got absurd by the effect of Bob upon their cataclysms?

212
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,180
Yeah.

213
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,460
Oh, my dearth.

214
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,060
So they felt threatened by Bob.

215
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,820
Their God.

216
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,180
Their God.

217
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,340
They felt like their God wasn't standing a chance against Bob Dobbs.

218
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,980
They might be listening right now.

219
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,360
They were feeling a little sick.

220
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,500
They might be listening even right now.

221
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,580
Well, you know, there's some people have the kind of God that has to...

222
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,440
That needs help from his followers.

223
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,740
A weak, pathetic, sad God who can't take a joke.

224
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:02,040
Who can't take an insult and whose followers have to thrash them.

225
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,560
A God whose hands and feet wounds have never healed, nor that long-kneed spear in the side necks.

226
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,820
Then you got old Bob.

227
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,240
They'd been festering for thousands of years and even before the hams came out.

228
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,680
Now, old Bob, he's a better sport.

229
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,580
And his followers are pretty good sports.

230
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,420
They listen to him.

231
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,100
Check it out.

232
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:18,800
There he is right there.

233
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,840
Bob's being tortured.

234
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,260
Some sport with hams right now.

235
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,440
They average about 27, 28.

236
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,240
Inches.

237
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,040
What?

238
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,100
Oh, my God.

239
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,120
That's a new record.

240
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,420
Well, it's old for brownies.

241
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,760
Oh, I see how you could get it that way.

242
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,240
Those are all girls whose first few marriages didn't work out and they decided to get back into uniform.

243
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,680
Fortunately, we sell enough cookies to keep a roof over our heads.

244
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,340
Door to door.

245
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,620
No, most of the girls sleep right here in the barracks.

246
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:47,920
No, no.

247
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,080
DobbsTown.

248
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:50,700
Cookies.

249
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,420
They sell the cookies door to door.

250
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:52,840
Oh.

251
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,420
Bob cookies.

252
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,140
We go out every night at the stroke of midnight.

253
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,780
Oh, stroking at midnight.

254
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,260
Yes.

255
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,860
Well, there's no time during the day.

256
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,060
I give my lectures during the day.

257
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:04,920
Oh, I could see.

258
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,620
I teach my girls the basics of a happy, successful life.

259
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,560
Things like cooking and...

260
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,580
No, dum-dum.

261
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,040
Things like alimony.

262
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,780
Oh, and then one week each month...

263
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,740
And shaving their vaginas for Pazuzu.

264
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,380
Uh-huh.

265
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:27,220
Uh, each girl has a tent all to herself and each one has her own mess kit, bed roll, and a flashlight.

266
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,400
The girls just love it.

267
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,140
Oh, that sounds very interesting.

268
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,660
Where do you have these encampments?

269
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,140
Uh, Fort Dix, New Jersey.

270
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,280
Fort Dix.

271
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:37,880
There you go, Dave.

272
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,500
Fort Dix.

273
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,400
Man, Dave, he...

274
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:40,800
Fort Dix.

275
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,880
Dave exploded there.

276
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,540
I'm sorry.

277
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,680
I had a bad vision.

278
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,820
That was pretty weird.

279
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,960
It was intense, Chaz.

280
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,040
It scared us.

281
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,760
It was like right in my prefrontal lobe.

282
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,440
Your mother sucks Bob in hell.

283
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,660
I could see it.

284
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,620
Right in the front of my head.

285
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,580
Stang and I were both actually, like, scared when you did that.

286
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,760
I thought it was going to come out of my head and leap onto the turntable for the love of God.

287
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,800
Like a Harryhausen animation.

288
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah, like one of those...

289
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,900
Pulling Dave's forehead open from inside and leaping out a little homunculus.

290
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,000
With kind of a Dave look to it.

291
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,840
Tiny little man, come out.

292
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,940
And a big prehensile...

293
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,980
Tiny little man, come out.

294
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,940
...chemical-like appendage.

295
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:20,920
Baby.

296
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,920
The world is a ghetto.

297
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,420
Remember, folks, in Sector 49...

298
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,780
But you can put a nice little horn soundtrack to it and it's not so bad.

299
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,740
Come on, baby.

300
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,420
Get on down.

301
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,620
When the windows open a little bit.

302
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,680
Sit down next to me.

303
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,620
Let me tell you about old Bob.

304
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,360
See, just like you can't imagine me as Satan.

305
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,680
You need a light.

306
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,460
Like, all I see is hot buttered corn right there.

307
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,400
You know what I'm saying, bro?

308
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,580
I mean, I can't see you as...

309
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,960
Like, the dulcet tone, you know.

310
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,620
Any one of them kind of singers, you know, like...

311
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,180
What, you mean I'm not doing the Isaac Hayes thing right?

312
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,460
Well, I just can't see you.

313
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,420
Hey, baby.

314
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,440
Hey, baby.

315
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,480
Well...

316
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,060
The Isaac or Barry Jones.

317
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:13,060
Hey, I just made a musical joke.

318
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,100
Hey, Chaz.

319
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,800
I just made a musical joke.

320
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,000
I said the Isaac or the Barry Jones.

321
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,500
Hey, baby.

322
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:24,860
Yeah, yeah.

323
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,860
Baby, baby.

324
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,180
He's my baby.

325
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,020
Sector 49.

326
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,720
Necks will be shaved at 3 p.m.

327
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,380
The world is a ghetto.

328
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,820
Ring my bell, baby.

329
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,580
There will be no forehead painting.

330
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,400
There will be no absurd behavior

331
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,660
among the lunger lesions

332
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,440
and the bonger lesions.

333
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,480
The world is a ghetto.

334
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,040
Lesions.

335
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,460
There'll be no...

336
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,540
smoking in the gas chambers.

337
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,040
There'll be no puffing

338
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,200
in the town of hogs.

339
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,200
Please go to the restroom

340
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,640
before you're strapped to the table.

341
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,060
Run slowly.

342
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,220
Do not walk with your head lifted

343
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,640
or your eyes skyward,

344
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,020
but run slowly to the nearest convenience area.

345
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,480
Step on the stopping blue line.

346
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,260
If your family wishes to witness your execution,

347
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,760
make sure they have the pink backstage pass

348
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,460
before they enter the death chamber.

349
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,040
I gotta give it up.

350
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,500
Security to aisle B.

351
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,340
Now I can't...

352
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,780
The Kmart special tonight is a floundering of ham,

353
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,980
some pieces of old-estute periodical

354
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,040
from the period before this.

355
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,500
This is propaganda.

356
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,280
Zop, zop, zop, zop.

357
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:50,880
Zop.

358
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:50,960


359
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:52,660
Zop.

360
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,580
Dr. Muffy, the walls are clean now.

361
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,220
All the blood's been washed into the sewer.

362
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,920
Yo, box is a ghetto.

363
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,080
All the barbed wire's down now

364
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,400
and everything looks like it used to look here in Cleanville.

365
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,040
Before the bungalows exploded.

366
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,720
I don't do it.

367
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:15,820
I don't do it.

368
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:15,820


369
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,940
That's the reason.

370
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,400
To be true, I think we still have problems here in Dobstown.

371
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,340
Some very, very deep psychological problems.

372
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,860
Dobstown is a ghetto, baby.

373
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,680
Oh, wow.

374
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,480
That's terrible to see.

375
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,020
Dobstown is this world.

376
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,220
Oh.

377
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,700
You ain't in the world until you've been to Dobstown.

378
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,740
And you can't escape the world until you have escaped from Dobstown.

379
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:56,660
And you ain't in the world until you have escaped the world.

380
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,120
You're not in the world until you've been to Dobstown.

381
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,120
And you can't escape the world until you've been to Dobstown.

382
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,960
So, I don't even know what you're talking about.

383
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,300
All right, I think we're done.

384
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:10,520
We're done.

385
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,620
Do you really have to do that to get to Dobstown?

386
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:12,660
No.

387
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:15,740
I'm done.

388
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,420
I'm done.

389
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,020
I don't even know what you're talking about.

390
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,280
Bob! Bob! Bob!

391
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,500
Artimaya Salinas' mix of I Dream of Bob, so appropriate,

392
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,460

Sorry, Mom, but I'm a drunk, a drunk.

00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:50,160
I love you, Mom, but I'm a drunk, a drunk.

I miss you, Mom, but I'm a drunk, a drunk.

501
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:05,720
Send money, Mom, cause I'm a drunk, drunk, drunky donkey.

502
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,320
I'm sorry, Mama.

503
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,980
I never meant to do you any wrong.

504
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,300
You know it's just sometimes I work so hard.

505
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,400
I need a little more.

506
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:42,040
A little beer, a little wine, a little hard liquor.

507
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,840
But none of that's important, Mama.

508
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,400
What's important is that I love you.

509
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,960
You love me, too?

510
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,920
I love you, too, dear, but your papa was the same way.

511
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,980
Oh, Mama, that means so much to me.

512
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:06,820
Well.

513
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:11,520
I used to do art, but I gave it up.

514
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:16,340
Cause it was too much work, and it didn't pay,

515
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,620
and it was just a pain in the ass.

516
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:24,400
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway.

517
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,280
What the fuck?

518
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,680
What the fuck?

519
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,000
What the fuck?

520
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,660
What the fuck?

521
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,160
What the fuck?

522
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:36,700
So now I ski and watch TV, cause that's a lot more fun

523
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:41,560
and relaxing than what I really want to do with my time.

524
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,420
Art gets old when no one pays you or even understands.

525
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,880
What's the point?

526
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,400
Unless I was gonna do it just for me.

527
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:54,440
But I'd really rather just ski and watch TV,

528
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:57,840
cause that's a lot more fun for me.

529
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,780
And I might as well have fun, cause that's the life's for,

530
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,620
you know, Rap Royal Augusto and all that.

531
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:06,680


532
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:06,680


533
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:06,680


534
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:06,680


535
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:06,680


536
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:12,600
And I'm alive now, but someday I'll have to die.

537
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:16,420
And then I'll be dead for a long time.

538
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,240
For a long, long time.

539
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,000
For a long, long, long, long time.

540
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,980
For a fucking forever, in fact.

541
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:28,420
So I might as well ski and watch TV now, while I have a chance.

542
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,780
Don't have time to waste on art.

543
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,100
And I don't believe in God.

544
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,440
I'm not that dumb.

545
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,660
So what's art even?

546
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:36,660


547
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,580
What's art even for if you don't get paid?

548
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:44,600
And I'm sick of torturing myself and of wondering if it's done yet.

549
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:49,660
And I'm sick of hanging out with all those dumb flakes who think they're so smart.

550
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,760
And I might as well just listen to the music that I grew up with.

551
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,280
That's the only music that ever really moved me.

552
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,960
And who stops just a friend?

553
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,140
It's not real.

554
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,860
And now I can get all those old great songs again.

555
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,240
On CD.

556
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,160
Cause they sound better.

557
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,200
And last longer, I think.

558
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:14,080
Oh, I'm so glad to be alive.

559
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,680
In this modern age.

560
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,000
And that's why I don't want to die.

561
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,460
But there's not a whole lot I can do about that now.

562
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,560
Except maybe eat more vegetables.

563
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,000
And I think I better marry my girlfriend.

564
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,500
Cause it's such a risk nowadays.

565
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,660
Even though I'm not one of those people.

566
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,660
And I'm probably sick of it.

567
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,520
But you can never be too sure.

568
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,120
And so we can marry.

569
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,320
And ski.

570
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,660
And watch TV.

571
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,600
Together.

572
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,860
And feel free and happy.

573
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,600
Without having to worry about art.

574
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,020
What a pain.

575
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,940
Flattered through with all that.

576
00:33:54,260 --> 00:34:02,180
And now I've got all I could really reasonably expect to get out of life.

577
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,180
Anyway.

578
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,500
Anyway.

579
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:05,960
Anyway.

580
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,400
Anyway.

581
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,240
Anyway.

582
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:08,240


583
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:09,880
Anyway.

584
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:12,900
Wait.

585
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,420
What the fuck?

586
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,900
What the fuck?

587
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:17,800
Anyway.

588
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:17,800


589
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,160
What the fuck?

590
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:18,660
What the fuck?

591
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,140
What the fuck?

592
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:19,140


593
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:19,460
Fuck, fuck.

594
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,040
What the fuck?

595
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,060
What the fuck?

596
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:23,760
What the fuck?

597
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,460
What the fuck?

598
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:24,600
What the fuck?

599
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,380
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

600
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,660
What the fuck?

601
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,600
What the fuck?

602
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:30,540
Fuck, fuck.

603
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:30,620
What the fuck?

604
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:30,940
What the fuck?

605
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,420
What the fuck?

606
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,200
Anyaway.

607
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,200
O&O

608
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,380
Little Theodore from his album Idiots Are Closer to God, truly a subgenius anthem.

609
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:49,960
You can contact Little Theodore at 3277 Raleigh Street.

610
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:59,040
That's R-A-L-E-I-G-H Street, Denver, Colorado, 80212.

611
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:04,120
Or Little Theodore at yahoo.com.

612
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,640
The Theodore part is spelled with an F.

613
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:14,180
Or check the new web link pages at www.subgenius.com.

614
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,160
And for that matter, you can write to Subgenius Foundation for that free information.

615
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:27,540
P.O. Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

616
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,020
And now, back to...

617
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:36,920
Back to the Euclid Tavern in Cleveland, where that devival with Einstein's Secret Orchestra is already in progress.

618
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:46,640
Now we can get back to what we started out doing, which is saving souls from themselves.

619
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:52,780
Yes, friends, we're here to save souls from themselves.

620
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,460
To save people from the false slack that they chose by default.

621
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,820
Just by ignorance.

622
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,700
Following the man.

623
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:07,760
Just because they didn't recognize the power of their own slack.

624
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:15,540
And slack, friends, when you truly take the attitude of slack,

625
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:20,900
you have a power that the Pope of the Vatican would kill for, and has killed for,

626
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,720
the power to fail.

627
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,180
The power to fail, my friends.

628
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:28,580
If we were geniuses, we'd call it...

629
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,480
The Archivist of the Genius.

630
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:35,800
But this is the kind of church it's a little easier to qualify for.

631
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:41,980
As the great subgenius Pareto, whoever the hell he is, once said,

632
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:50,560
Give me a fruitful error anytime full of seeds bursting with its own corrections.

633
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:55,420
You can keep your sterile truth for yourself.

634
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,480
And friends, it's true.

635
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,620
False prophecies abound everywhere.

636
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:07,500
For instance, everybody thought that whoever got the most votes would win.

637
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,920
Prophecy failed!

638
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,860
Sorry days are here again.

639
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,560
Mr. Big Dick Cheney says it's time for lots more nuclear power.

640
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,980
See who we got on the board.

641
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,280
We got Condoleezza Rice.

642
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,460
She works with Exxon.

643
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,960
We got Cheney.

644
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,760
He works with Hucker Puff Rebellion, Swank Incorporated.

645
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,260
We got Dimsha and Dimwit, the working for the oil companies.

646
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,200
We got oil, nuclear power.

647
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,680
We got the Caesars.

648
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:53,040
We got the Caesars.

649
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,580
We got the Caesars.

650
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,440
We got the Caesars.

651
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:57,440


652
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:57,460
We got the Caesars.

653
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,340
We got the

654
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,980
We've got the caesars.

655
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:16,080
Thank you.

656
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,120
Thank you.

657
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,400
Thank you.

658
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:37,180
We've got over 2 million known pollutants that can cause cancer, skin lesions, brain tumors, thoracic confusion,

659
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,820
loss of Republican identity, congregations in the Middle East.

660
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,720
Misconnected rumors.

661
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:50,000
The long-spinning thing on DNA with the sperm and virus.

662
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,480
Chicken and spasms.

663
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:57,060
And what the fuck is the use?

664
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,320
The iodine.

665
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,840
The 1, 3, 1.

666
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,800
The sky's not a thyroid.

667
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,120
All the run and the krypton.

668
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,200
We're in five.

669
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,780
It's making it hard.

670
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,060
Just to stay alive.

671
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,580
The iodine.

672
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,440
The 1, 3, 1.

673
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,720
The iodine.

674
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,640
The 1, 3, 1.

675
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,560
There's no more running through the middle line.

676
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,600
No more looking everywhere.

677
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,660
Shake it for me, man.

678
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,880
I'm a poison man.

679
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,780
Shake it for me, man.

680
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,340
It's all right.

681
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,880
There's no more running through the middle line.

682
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,960
No more looking everywhere.

683
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,980
Shake it for me, man.

684
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,140
I'm a poison man.

685
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,200
Shake it for me, manager.

686
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,800
Shake it, baby.

687
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,360
Thank you.

688
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,300
Thank you.

689
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,660
Boys and girls gathered here in the name of freedom.

690
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:02,020
I know some of you have hardly reached your 14th birthday.

691
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:09,000
Some of you are wearing those pearl-cockled necklaces given to you by your ancient grandfathers.

692
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,960
And we know the nuclear devices you will carry.

693
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,620
But the identify you that you will not be carrying into town today

694
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:17,240
will cause you instant sainthood and martyrdom.

695
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,940
You will be lifted on high.

696
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,460
So there's no reason to cry, children.

697
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,560
Each one of you are a little bum,

698
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,940
armed and ready to pop.

699
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,240
I don't want to prices.

700
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,000
Ah.

701
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:39,320
Ah.

702
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,840
This is not going to fit in here.

703
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:41,960
Bedtime's coming.

704
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,440
I feel like I could pop all night, baby.

705
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,280
I don't know if I can walk to town with this thing.

706
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,540
You're my radar love, hon.

707
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:57,040
The implantation devices make sure that each child walks the straight and narrow path to his destination.

708
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,040
The objective or target, as it is known at Control,

709
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:05,840
is to make sure that each child removes itself as it removes the target.

710
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,760
So there are no witnesses and no disclaimers allowed past the curfew now.

711
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,900
What do you think, Dave, about the fact that...

712
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,960
Damn it, they're not even going to hide anymore, are they?

713
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:28,360
No.

714
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,120
No.

715
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,620
No, they're just right out there.

716
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,660
We're having an oil problem right now.

717
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,720
We're not making enough money to who knows what.

718
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,440
They're just not even going to hide it anymore.

719
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,000
Nope.

720
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,440
They're just going to rape everything they can.

721
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,080
And in the four years they have...

722
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,680
Or only two, really, because they know they're going to lose the Senate.

723
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,100
Oh, Jeb's son will be the next Bush emperor.

724
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:51,920
And then...

725
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,760
Jeb's son?

726
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,280
You mean the little Puerto Rican kid?

727
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:55,840
Yeah, yeah.

728
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,180
The one granddad called the little brown one?

729
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,560
His father called him the little brown one?

730
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,020
Yeah, George Bush Sr.

731
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,920
Oh, is that the little brown one?

732
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,560
The little brown one, right?

733
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,320
Well, I'm glad he's spreading his genes around.

734
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:11,220
And kind of like...

735
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,500
He's like one of the folks now, but...

736
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,440
That's good.

737
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,700
You have a brown child.

738
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,580
I'm learning...

739
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:16,440
How did that happen?

740
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,880
You know, I realized that I was serious when I...

741
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:24,740
It sunk in that I really was trying to learn Dutch from that little Berlitz book.

742
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,740
You mean you're saying you're actually thinking of repatriating the feces?

743
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,140
I...

744
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,520
Well, you know...

745
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,080
I don't want to be part of the empire.

746
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:32,820
I know what you mean.

747
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,400
I don't want to be on the Death Star.

748
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,060
I know.

749
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:41,080
I grew up believing that America was the rebel force.

750
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:41,560
The rebel forces.

751
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,440
Peanut in a big, huge drum.

752
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:47,880
And now it's like, well, the rebel forces, this is the Death Star, man.

753
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,100
Howdy, folks.

754
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,140
Come on down to America, Inc., where you'll be forced to pay for...

755
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:54,860
Everything.

756
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,060
But it's not.

757
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,420
It's convenient, friends.

758
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,440
Ah, memories.

759
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,860
This is the most convenient...

760
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:00,380
Ah, memories.

761
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,180
They used to shoot at us.

762
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,460
Now they shoot near us.

763
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:11,140
Well, I heard about the softer, the more friendlier bullets that they're using on the...

764
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,000
Kids these days.

765
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,820
Well, they don't think they were using friendly bullets in Cincinnati.

766
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:15,380
Ten soldiers and bob dogs coming.

767
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:21,280
I heard they use the little bouncing bullets now.

768
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,360
Not in the West Bank of Gaza, they don't.

769
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,200
No, no.

770
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,220
They're using really lead bullets still.

771
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,100
Yes, there's still lead.

772
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:27,720
And even the Army.

773
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,420
What do you think about this?

774
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,760
The Army has switched to a...

775
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:36,500
The Army has switched to a bullet that is environmental friendly.

776
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,660
It's some sort of other...

777
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:39,320
It's not lead.

778
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,820
It's biodegradable bullets.

779
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:41,380
Yeah.

780
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,120
Oh, my God.

781
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,240
The family still has to pay for it.

782
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,320
So that we only kill humans, not the person.

783
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,080
They probably got a big conservation tax break for that.

784
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:48,800
Yeah.

785
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:51,340
The idea, of course, being, you know, this is the way...

786
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,060
Think of the research that went into that.

787
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:57,680
Gentlemen, the war of the future will be a clean war.

788
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,480
A war that you and your children can stand to fight.

789
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,780
An effectively deadly bullet, but yet easy on the mind.

790
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,400
You know, somebody had to not repent.

791
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,640
Easy to mop up after.

792
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,720
In order for that bullet to be developed,

793
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:14,660
somebody had to not repent or quit their job or slack off.

794
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,280
That's the age-correct way of thinking of it.

795
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,600
There was a point where somebody could have repented,

796
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:19,700
quit their job and slack off,

797
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,920
and then somebody else would have had to develop that bullet.

798
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,500
Said, no, sign the check and put it in my rectum right here.

799
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,500
But instead, they said, no, if I don't develop this bullet,

800
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,800
somebody else is going to do it.

801
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,740
So I might as well not repent, quit my job or slack off.

802
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:32,060
I got to tell you guys something.

803
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,720
I'll be known as the guy who developed the environmental bullet.

804
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,060
The environmental bullet.

805
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:38,800
Yeah.

806
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:39,340
Yeah.

807
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:39,620
Yeah.

808
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:39,660
Yeah.

809
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:39,700
Yeah.

810
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:39,700


811
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:39,700


812
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:39,700


813
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:39,700


814
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,140
No, the guy in the Doobie Brothers who's supposedly a missile defense expert.

815
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,060
Bend over and spread them, baby.

816
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:50,340
Here comes my environmentally cool bullet.

817
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,500
Thank God I've been shot.

818
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:01,580
I can almost see the future of America as my life oozes out here on the sidewalk.

819
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:06,140
Thank God for the safe, clean bullet that just ended me.

820
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,520
Ended you?

821
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:08,540
Did I?

822
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:09,560
Did you?

823
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:09,700
Did you?

824
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,380
Did I end at that moment?

825
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,160
No.

826
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:15,100
You know, we have a friend who was in a band who's kind of like,

827
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,440
this song is just important today.

828
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,720
Why aren't kids, like, marching and stuff?

829
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:21,640
For what?

830
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,240
Yeah, they're not shooting them yet.

831
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:23,320
Stop.

832
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,840
Once they start shooting them, they're going to go.

833
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,440
You're thinking of the old America.

834
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:28,280
This is America Incorporated.

835
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:28,680
Right.

836
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:32,300
We don't actually, I mean, come on, man.

837
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:36,260
Do I have to spell it out as many of my employers?

838
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:36,980
Yeah, this song does.

839
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:37,940
This is what I don't disagree with.

840
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,260
It's Incorporate America.

841
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:39,700
It's Incorporate America.

842
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,940
Come on now, get with the program.

843
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:45,520
Read from the same page and remember the talking points.

844
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,280
Point number one.

845
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,520
Things are better than they've ever been.

846
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:51,140
And worse than they've ever been.

847
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,740
All the kids know today is they want their job.

848
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,020
Well, that's all there is.

849
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,460
There's the job.

850
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,440
Endless drudgery.

851
00:46:58,660 --> 00:46:59,560
The life.

852
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:00,640
Well, sort of.

853
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,620
And the job.

854
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,640
And, well, the job.

855
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,820
I'm not going to rock the boat.

856
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,800
I want the job.

857
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,660
Chaz, you told me you were not only going to rock the boat,

858
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:12,420
that you were going to rocket butt that boat right into another world.

859
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:13,440
Rocket butt that rocket boat.

860
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:13,600
I know.

861
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,400
I mean, I'm just.

862
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,600
You're getting wanting to go.

863
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:20,240
You're wanting to really climb on there and go to a world where people actually think normal or something.

864
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:20,920
I don't know.

865
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:21,960
Yeah, definitely.

866
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,340
It's becoming very important to build that rocket.

867
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:26,840
To get off.

868
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,220
To get off.

869
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:28,080
To get off.

870
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,480
It's becoming very, very, very important now.

871
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,320
Yep.

872
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:32,980
I want to get off.

873
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,340
I don't want to stick around here.

874
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:37,660
Exactly.

875
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:38,040
Exactly.

876
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:41,520
I just did buy a house in Cleveland.

877
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,140
I'm building my own Amsterdam.

878
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:47,340
Yeah, but you also built yourself a nice canal boat in your mind.

879
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:47,860
You know.

880
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:50,220
With the little hair and green thing in the front.

881
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:50,680
You know.

882
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:55,660
I'm also learning foreign languages.

883
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,540
So that they'll let me go there.

884
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,340
Are you learning Enochian?

885
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:02,560
Well, I've been living in my house for five years.

886
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,580
And for five years, I've been installing each day.

887
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,460
I dig out a little area in the foundation.

888
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,840
And put in another composite rocket motor.

889
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,900
So the house is about two-thirds now.

890
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,440
Completely surrounded and strapped with rocket motors.

891
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,800
So in another year or two.

892
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,360
But the timing is so fiendishly important, dude.

893
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:28,520
So devilishly tricky to get every rocket to go off at once.

894
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,020
What happens if half of them go off and the other half don't?

895
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,640
Oh, you have a kind of...

896
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,620
You've got a tilted house, dude.

897
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:36,200
Really?

898
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:37,980
The misfiring is just going to send that thing...

899
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:38,980
It would end up in Arkansas.

900
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:42,220
Well, you would hope it would end up in Arkansas.

901
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:45,300
Well, I'm not middle of Lake Erie.

902
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:46,040
It doesn't matter.

903
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:49,300
As long as I reach seven miles per second in any direction.

904
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:50,940
That'll be...

905
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:51,920
Even down.

906
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:53,240
I'll be able to get Earth orbit.

907
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,460
Chaz, I'm afraid you don't want to go seven minutes per second in any...

908
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,320
I mean, seven seconds.

909
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,940
You know, that speed in all general directions.

910
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:01,820
Because that would be...

911
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:03,080
You would be exploding up.

912
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,100
If you were, you know, not ahead of direction.

913
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,240
What's going to happen here?

914
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,660
It can't happen here.

915
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,560
I've been checking it out for a while, baby.

916
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:16,740
I'm telling you, my dear, that it can't happen here.

917
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:19,280
Can't it?

918
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,320
I've been checking it out.

919
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,560
Checked it out a couple times.

920
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,940
Yeah, it's happening here right now.

921
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:31,620
And as we watch the sun go down on our democratic freedoms,

922
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:34,660
the freedoms that we've taken for granted for so long...

923
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:35,820
Oh, no, but we still have all those freedoms.

924
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,840
They're even more convenient than ever.

925
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:38,780
As long as you...

926
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:41,720
As long as you...

927
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:42,680
The line.

928
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,760
As long as you want what they want, you can have anything you want.

929
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:51,940
We want what they want.

930
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:53,620
But I want what Bob wants.

931
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,100
I want what we all want.

932
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,480
I want a worldwide cataclysm.

933
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,820
I want chocolate pudding delivered to me by aliens.

934
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:06,900
And I want some female chocolate pudding delivered.

935
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,180
As frequently as possible.

936
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,020
As the old salivary glands can move.

937
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,360
Sometimes they...

938
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,180
They don't move.

939
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,140
Of course, that's not the first part of it.

940
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,620
That's the end of it.

941
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:22,560
The first part is much more laconic and obscure.

942
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,460
I mean...

943
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:28,860
Well, that's more artistic, you know, when you're obscure and hard to understand.

944
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,380
That's more artful.

945
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,920
And, you know, Dave, if we were a little more artful,

946
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:36,140
we'd probably be getting paid a little better.

947
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,920
But instead...

948
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:38,580
We're...

949
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,280
You just...

950
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,160
Low-grade showbiz clowns.

951
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,940
We might as well be the guys that sweep up behind the elephants at the circus, you know?

952
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:48,860
Well, we do that, too.

953
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:52,300
The dwarfs with the little pooper scoopers.

954
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:54,380
Well, we also do do that.

955
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:54,920
Yeah.

956
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,200
I mean, at least I've been going back.

957
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:57,720
I don't know.

958
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:59,500
Some people think they're too good to work.

959
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:02,200
But, you know, as long as I'm getting a paycheck,

960
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,000
I don't mind what tumbles out of there.

961
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,160
I've seen worse things.

962
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,860
And I've picked up worse things.

963
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:11,800
You've stuck your arm all the way up worse places than where that came from.

964
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Yes, that is true.

965
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,000
I don't want to go into the grim details.

966
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,760
You tried to get your head all the way up into worse places, but I...

967
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:23,840
I was almost a microcephalic baby from that incident.

968
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,740
And I was almost returned to my native home in Canada

969
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:30,780
and buried alive there for the whole incident.

970
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:31,420
It was just...

971
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,420
I don't know.

972
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:36,100
17.

973
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:36,380
17?

974
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,540
In London, it struck a compromise.

975
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,320
That's in England, you know.

976
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,020
Dodger Stadium, it struck out.

977
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,240
In Munich, it struck first.

978
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:47,260
Ha, ha, ha.

979
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:47,980
Take your head down.

980
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:56,300
Chaz is trying to bring back the fake rebellion of the 60s,

981
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:00,820
which, of course, was actually co-opted from the very beginning.

982
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:01,580
Okay, you start.

983
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:05,680
The John Lennon glasses were trademarked before.

984
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:07,700
Before John Lennon was even born.

985
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,720
Before Jack Kerouac and Cassidy and all those guys...

986
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,460
It was all planned out ahead of time.

987
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:15,420
...were actually mind-controlled for quite some time.

988
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,460
Yeah, but what good did it do?

989
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:18,260
Not a damn thing.

990
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,300
It was early in the morning.

991
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:21,580
The energy was so, so weak.

992
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:24,740
The poor people below could hardly stand to look up.

993
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,400
Their necks were craning, but still, it looked like it was...

994
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,200
Wait.

995
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,160
This is...

996
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,660
Dave, you're stuck in the 60s, man.

997
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,280
No, man, I'm not stuck in the...

998
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,040
Get with it, dude.

999
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,080
It's the 90s.

1000
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:35,580
No, wait.

1001
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:36,920
I need reading glasses.

1002
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,520
It's the aughties or the zeros or the...

1003
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:42,020
Yeah, it's the modern age.

1004
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:42,980
What is that feeling?

1005
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,200
It's contemporary.

1006
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:44,680
It's new.

1007
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:45,220
It's now.

1008
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:45,780
It's now.

1009
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:45,840


1010
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,580
...muzzles rise up in your neck and the back of your brain tingles

1011
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,460
like there's a little teeny...

1012
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:53,860
a chameleon in the back of your neck.

1013
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:56,740
What is that feeling when your shoes drop off

1014
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:59,080
as you're walking down the street and they wave goodbye to you?

1015
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,480
What is that feeling?

1016
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:01,820
What is that feeling?

1017
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:04,880
And we hope you've enjoyed it half as much...

1018
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,320
What's that?

1019
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:07,500
...blue stain in your undies.

1020
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:11,600
Have you been keeping bad company again?

1021
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:15,820
Have you been hanging with those who hang too far?

1022
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:17,780
Yeah.

1023
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:18,880
Yesterday I bought a new car.

1024
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,180
Today I bought a new horn for it.

1025
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,180
Herb Alpert.

1026
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,800
You know, the sick thing is,

1027
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,500
Rowan and Martin's laugh-in was actually kind of

1028
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,500
the hippest thing going at the time.

1029
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,440
I can hardly afford to buy my groceries.

1030
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,420
I can't believe it.

1031
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:42,840
that make me wonder if the college boy had thanked him

1032
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:47,080
or what he was trying to do with all this strange, strange radio equipment.

1033
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,940
Oh, actually, it's in Idaho.

1034
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,520
Would you mind saying that again?

1035
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:51,740
Idaho?

1036
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,760
That's quite interesting. We pronounce it OSHIAO.

1037
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:56,080
The first of the decades,

1038
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,020
Oh, I've always wanted to make a cowboy.

1039
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:59,540
I mean, meet a cowboy.

1040
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:00,840
Really?

1041
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,420
Really. I yelled across the river,

1042
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,400
Well, you won't see me to cały Abend.

1043
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:05,400


1044
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,080
The right idea?

1045
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:11,420
It's just a shame that polygamy never caught on among the married people of this country.

1046
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:14,080
They can't have fun with polygamies.

1047
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,040
They can't help it if they're not tall.

1048
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:26,980
No, no, it's not the same guy.

1049
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,160
This man was confused.

1050
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:33,520
He was pointing and asking questions, and I just couldn't answer.

1051
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,340
I had no idea what he was talking about.

1052
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,860
We really learned the three R's.

1053
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,520
Reading, writing, and rhythm.

1054
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:43,600
Specifics, barking, and playing with ourselves.

1055
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,320
These are the new rules.

1056
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:51,560
This is the new regimen for a new human race.

1057
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:55,180
One that will not only conquer the stars, but conquer the bars.

1058
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,540
With the waiting thud of their own furry feet,

1059
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:01,560
they'll smash down every door and you'll be behind it.

1060
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,380
Standing there, guarding.

1061
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,720
Standing tall for America.

1062
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:11,640
That really moves me, Dave.

1063
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,320
I'm so glad that you're here.

1064
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,420
It's just the tear gas.

1065
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,520
Such a sincere...

1066
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,660
Oh, man, it's the tear gas and the mind control, man.

1067
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,820
I don't know what I'm saying. I'm crying.

1068
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:25,400
Oh, man, I...

1069
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,860
Get it together, man.

1070
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:27,640
It sounds like Mambo music.

1071
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,200
You're on the air.

1072
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:29,800
Come on, come on.

1073
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,380
None of this emotional baloney.

1074
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,120
Get it?

1075
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,020
Hey, guys, you know, I was wondering,

1076
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,580
the funny thing about doing a late-night show like this

1077
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:41,800
and getting a lot of, you know, really out-there callers.

1078
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,840
Last night, little Jimmy Spliff called three times

1079
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:49,540
and he was, you know, doing his own variety of rocket science.

1080
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,660
But here at the, you know, the Kingdom Dome,

1081
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,140
there's a lot of complaints.

1082
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,220
You know, we've had problems before,

1083
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:59,800
but we're gonna hang in there as long as we can.

1084
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,780
I mean, as far as I'm concerned, the gallows have been built,

1085
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:04,760
so let's keep hanging.

1086
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,400
And nobody's gonna talk about your shoes

1087
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,140
or say that, you know, you left the eggs in there too long

1088
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,100
or there's just, you know, some problem with you.

1089
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:18,200
You know, everyone's gonna just be cool with that.

1090
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,080
Hey, who were you hot for on the laugh-in,

1091
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:22,640
Rowan and Martin laugh-in show?

1092
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,240
I like Goldie Hawn.

1093
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:24,560
Chaz.

1094
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,920
Yeah, I figured you'd be the Goldie Hawn.

1095
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,220
There was Judy Karn,

1096
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,360
which is a little cute English chick.

1097
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,080
Nah.

1098
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:32,280
Nah?

1099
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:32,740
No.

1100
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:34,640
You liked Joanne Worley.

1101
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:35,420
Me too, man.

1102
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:36,700
I was really into it.

1103
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:37,760
I understand.

1104
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:42,380
She's kind of large and kind of heavy-boned

1105
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:44,020
and loud and obnoxious,

1106
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:50,360
but that wide, wide, wide mouth just invoked...

1107
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,380
The Queen of Hearts look.

1108
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:52,760
You like that Queen of Hearts look,

1109
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:56,600
off with their heads and referring to your structures down there?

1110
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,300
Yeah, I don't know what it is.

1111
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,820
I can't put the two and two together.

1112
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,620
Her laugh was just very infectious.

1113
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:04,260
There's no doubt about it.

1114
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:10,100
I wonder where she's at now and how large and old.

1115
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,960
She's in the old actor's home in Pasadena, California.

1116
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:18,240
Sitting out in the backyard watching the Cupid pee in the pond.

1117
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,280
She's had her last turkey sandwich for today, though.

1118
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,940
She's going back in sight for her meds.

1119
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:29,260
Does that little boy ever finish peeing?

1120
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,240
Does he just pee that forever?

1121
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,020
Never.

1122
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:35,140
Keep your back to the wind.

1123
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,640
Keep your hat tied.

1124
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,880
Keep sat in saddle.

1125
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,500
Quedan tus cajones en el...

1126
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:47,360
The rebel forces, this is the fucking Death Star, man.

1127
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,460
And as you might have guessed,

1128
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,740
this hour of Slack has been a rerun of an old episode,

1129
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:59,000
a number 787 from the year of 2001.

1130
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,580
We'll probably be back live,

1131
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,160
next week,

1132
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,300
or at least with a new edited show,

1133
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:09,520
but this month we've been finishing up

1134
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:14,520
stage one of the huge secret subgenius project

1135
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:17,200
that I so love to hint about.

1136
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:22,260
And we're behind on promoting X-Day,

1137
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,240
the annual subgenius festival

1138
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,580
to end this planet's dominance by humans

1139
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:32,560
and to replace it with the dominance of subgenius.

1140
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:35,880
Which you can learn about at subgenius.com

1141
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:40,200
if you're interested in the X-rated real life aspect

1142
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:44,340
of our august mind control sex cult.

1143
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,340
Now that I've mentioned the sex cult part,

1144
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,060
you probably wonder where the X-Day festival is.

1145
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:55,080
And it is in far western rural New York state

1146
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:59,080
at a permissive campground.

1147
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,160
Anyway, it's good that we have over,

1148
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:06,220
over 1,250 reruns to choose from.

1149
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:09,880
And this particular one is largely thanks

1150
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,220
to the late great professor Chaz Smith

1151
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:17,240
and his ESO Swamp Radio show,

1152
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:21,900
which was on WCSB in Cleveland for many years.

1153
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,980
And it was like half of the hour of slack

1154
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:26,040
for about a decade.

1155
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:30,000
So praise Chaz, praise Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

1156
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,140
and praise all the contributors.

1157
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,700
And all the other stations that carry this show.

1158
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,040
And praise the individual subscribers.

1159
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,220
And, oh heck, why not,

1160
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:43,560
praise that one listener

1161
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,420
who happens to be listening

1162
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:48,360
right at this very second.
