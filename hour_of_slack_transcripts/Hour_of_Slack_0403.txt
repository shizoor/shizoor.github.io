All the animals come out at night.
Buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies.
Sick, venal.
Someday I'll run.
The rail rail will come and wash all the scum off the streets.
I go all over.
I take people to the Bronx, Brooklyn.
I take them to Harlem.
I don't care.
Don't make no difference to me.
It does to some.
Some won't even take spooks.
Don't make no difference to me.
Each night when I return the cab to the garage, I have to clean the back seat.
Some nights I clean off the blood.
Twelve hours of work.
I still can't sleep.
Damn.
Days go on and on.
They don't end.
All my life needed was a sense of someplace to go.
I don't believe that one should devote his life to morbid self-attention.
I believe that someone should become a person like other people.

Nobody wanted a God Almighty that could have used to sleep, but the song refused to die.
Just kept on refusing to die.
Mouths wide open.
You do the first hour upon awakening early in the morning.
Let us call it the morning offering.
Christ, the visible expression of the invisible God.
Shot to share it, but I didn't shoot the death to die.
God answers prayer in the morning.
Amen.
God answers prayer at noon.
God answers prayer in the evening.
To keep your heart in tune.
Jesus may come in the morning.
To keep your heart in tune.
To keep your heart in tune.
I guess that you are a character that you are.
Everything is hush-hush.
Operation Sandust.
Hush-hush.
Everybody connected with it.
Hush-hush.
Everybody except me.
Because I know something they didn't know I knew.
Now you get away from that.
The best it's a road I like.
With your disguises and your tricks and your pony IDs.
Howdy, folks.
I just got my open boards back.
They did a headlock three minutes ago.
So you'll have to forgive me.
That's right.
We're here to have a real damn home devival tonight.

Where we know that all you need is a four-wheel drive, a six-pack, a chainsaw, a handful of pills, and a half dozen orifices.
And you can have you a damn subgenius.
Oh, hell yes.
We promised you pills.
And we're going to give you pills.
Not conspiracy chemical dope.
Our hero's face is on every TV.
You're the one that thought of the mayonnaise.
And it's a body.
Remember the last time we talked about this old body of ours, Bob?
Yeah.
Yeah, I remember, Dad.
No.
Oh, here's a match.
Your pipe's gone out again.
When a man and a woman are married, Bob, they love each other very much.
I can't get no satisfaction.
I can't get no satisfaction.
I can't get no satisfaction.
I'm trying to make some girl.
Suck it to me, baby.
Let's spend the night together, making love.
Light my fire.

Bob is not a fan club.
Bob demands only your total, if erratic, devotion to his almighty word.
Now, a lot of these musicians are geniuses and some of them are philosophers.
And some of them aren't very smart.
That's right.
It went through three generations of musicians.
All the musicians who start playing a song.
You're dead now.
Not the song.
Oh, no.
No way.
That old song ain't gonna die.
No siree.
Just when you thought it was dead, it started over again.
Until it was in a hypnotic, endless loop.
Forever cycling and recycling through itself.
Mutating and perambulating over its own frequency distortions,
bursts of sound and sight.
But still.
Overall, it refused to die.
It couldn't die.
It was impossible to die.
The fabric of the universe was threaded in the fact that it couldn't die.
If the song that refused to die died, time and space as we know it would cease to exist.
It was the most important thing in the universe.
More important than the president.
More important than the United States.
More important than the United States.

More important than the world.
More important than God.
It was the song that refused to die.
The song that held the very fabric of time and space together.
If it died, everyone would die.
It couldn't die.
It had to stay alive.
It kept just wearing out musicians over the years.
Through the centuries, the song kept going.
Every now and then, they fought for it.
They fought it would die, but it just couldn't die.
Sometimes people would forget about it, but on the edge of their consciousness, it sat there like an overgrown turd.
Just flatulently expressing itself in cosmic gaseous emissions.
Bursting forth, they were now there to remind people that it couldn't die.
It wouldn't die.
It never died.
It refused to die.
It refused to die.
This is Captain Ogre Shoes with a message for the children of tomorrow.

Questioned about EFG's support of the ruling party by HIJ news reporter KLM

President Oh said as long as the PQRs continue to support anti-T activities in the U.V. region,
he'll be lending off full weight behind the T-classes.
She loves him. She feels contempt for him.
She feels incredible rage toward him.
She loves him.

She feels contempt for him.
She feels incredible rage toward him.

Forgive me.
Forgive me.

Holy go, this dog wasn't walking like this before. Notice the way he staggers now.
He's truly delivered. Look at him, he's touched.
Look at him, he's touched.
Look at this little dog. He came in in a wheelchair, now he's delivered.
Come on little dog, show the folks, folks, this is it.
See what God is doing.
There it is, living truth, it's happened before your very eyes.
We'll take our next call now on the Bible Quiz. Thank you.
Hello, are you ready for the Bible Quiz?
Yeah.
Okay.
The passage, be not drunk with wine wherein is excess, but be filled with the Spirit, is found in the book of Ephesians. True or false?
True.
That's right, it is true. It's Ephesians 5.18.
Okay, this is a very important question.
Can we fade that music down a bit?
Sorry.
I want to make sure this is difficult. I want to make sure you hear everything. Okay, are you ready?
Number two.
Yeah, in arm.
In Genesis 9, Noah, of Noah's ark.
Tell us about it.
Noah became drunk and was sexually molested by his son Ham. Is that true or false?
False. Come on.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, that's incorrect.
This is not mind control.
Do not be alarmed, but research teams have proven that brain worms do exist.
Carnivorous little parasites, worms of teeth.
They do this. Do this.
They're in there.
Gnawing and tearing away brain tissue.
In fact, your head works like an incubator for the breeding and feeding of these filthy little...
Your monkey mind goes chitter-chatter, chitter-chatter.
Where do they come from? Nobody knows. Why do they multiply?
Bad attitude.
I can't do this. I can't do that. I can't do this. It's impossible.
It'll never work. Worms.
There's only one way to stop them.
A turtle, a chuckle, a giggle, guffaw.
A yuck.
Ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha.
Hee hee.
Hee hee.
Oh ho ho.
Ha ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
The End
The End

OK. Here we are. It's side two already- already
of your, uh, sub genius, radio ministry hour of slack.
uhhhh.
What have we been hearing? We...
heard a little bit of news from The Red Zone.
Thanks from, uh, or for, to
uh, Thomas, formerly of W.R.E.K. in Atlanta.
We heard, uh, St. Jane or Hyper 프� corsetā¬'s trailer for
for that terrifying, blood-curdling film, The Real World.
And Pastor Dick with his Bible quiz,
which I don't think we've quite heard, haven't heard the end of that yet.
And Reverend Ivan Stang trying to explain
who your guru and our boss, J.R. Bob Dobbs, is.
He is swinging love corpses with the song that refused to die.
And before some more Bible quiz, we heard Mr. John Bartles
with his tune, Hangin' by a Thread, from the album Born to Lick Salt.
A fixation on great big fat women, doesn't he?
Well,
uh,
earlier we heard some, some of, some from,
uh, the Rudy Schwartz Project.
We're going to hear something else now.
This is something called, uh, Mississippi Ball,
and I will, I will read from his liner notes.
Albuquerque Ball contains themes from two films of Ed Wood Jr.,
Orgy of the Dead, and Plan 9 from Outer Space.
Orgy was written by Jaime Mendoza Nava
and performed in the film by the Chilean National Orchestra.
Plan 9, according to Rhino's Golden Turkey album,
was written by Trevor Duncan.
However, Rudolph Gray in his Ed Wood Jr.
biography, Nightmare of Ecstasy, highly recommended,
claims that it is really a piece called Iron Foundry,
written by a little known composer named Masaloff.
I would tend to trust the latter credit.
So, uh, here's a couple of pieces, as I say,
it's in this one piece from, uh,
Orgy of the Dead and Plan 9 from Outer Space.
And also you'll hear a young lady reading from one of Ed Wood Jr.'s, uh,
uh, porno novels.
You'll know it's him.
And I hope you know who the great Ed Wood Jr. is,
the much maligned transvestite filmmaker.
Uh, soon to be the subject of a major motion picture from Mr. Tim Burton.
Watch for that.
And here is Albuquerque Ball by Rudy Schwartz Project.
Thank you.
Flora.

Now I'm going to eat it all up.

They like to use everything in the book.
Murder and eroticism,
murder and eroticism,
It was a kind of murder case that friends and neighbors said didn't make sense.
They didn't understand.
They didn't understand.
They didn't understand.
They didn't understand Christianity is stupid.
Are you ready for the Bible quiz?
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
The passage, be not drunk with wine wherein is excess, but be filled with the Holy Spirit,
is found in the book of Ephesians.
True or false?
True.
Thank you.
That's correct.
Okay, number two.
Are you ready for this one?
No.
You want to risk the first one and go on to the next?
Okay.
In Genesis 9, Noah, of Noah's Ark, Noah became drunk and was sexually molested by his son Ham.
True or false?
Yes, that's correct.
It is true.
It's in Genesis 9, 20 to 27.
That's very true.
A lot of people don't know that.
Yes, but does it matter?
Does it benefit our history right now?
Yes, but it is a question in the Bible quiz.
You're not here.
What?
You're not here?
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you from the psychotropic console.
Oh, I thought I was doing...
What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.
Oh.
But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
Oh, great, great.
Okay.
So these collars are in this.
They've been artificially implanted as an emergency.
An emergency measure.
Right.
I can just punch up and just make them up.
Here, I'll put echo on this one.
We can't snap you out of your fantasy.
Okay, well, that's all right, because I'm doing...
Try to talk you down.
Yeah.
Think about it.
Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure.
Right, right.
Everything after that, the chases, the jump-started dream...
The sweet at the Hilton.
Right, right.
Are all elements of ego trip.
Oh, my ego trip.
Well, it's pretty powerful.
I use it pretty powerfully.
Would you mind opening the door?
No, I don't want to open the door.
But, you know, I have a...
I have a tendency to say, now, wait a minute.
This is not going to destroy somebody's life.
I firmly believe...
I don't really believe there's any great big conspiracy either.
But I have to say that that's the way you enjoy things,
by tearing up guitars, by throwing drums around,
by going into tantrums, by becoming crazy on stage.
Is that the message that we really want to give to young people?
And just when you thought it would never die,
a hero...
A hero came along...
And put the song out of its misery.
He killed the song that refused to die.
A hero.
A glowing beacon of slack
amid the toils and trials and tribulations
of the song that refused to die.
Overcome by total slack,
the song began its death throes.
Starting to die
took a long time for the song that refused to die.
Yes, indeed,
it was the end of the beginning of the song that refused to die.
Or was it the beginning of the end of the song?
Somewhere between the two,
the song that refused to die
began its mighty death throes.
The throes that would last throughout all eternity.
Forever tortured in its death.
The song that was forever dying
did indeed die forever.
Some people said that was a lot like refusing to die.
But for some, the song had indeed begun its death cycle.
And therefore could be considered to have died,
or at least was in the process of dying.
And would therefore one day indeed be dead.
You or I won't be here to see it.
Oh no!
We never last that long.
The songs that refused to die
took centuries, decades, even weeks to die.
Would you like to risk number two and go on to number three?
I need to know that.
Okay, the Bible states, clearly,
that drunkenness is a sin.
True or false?
True.
True?
Okay, why did Jesus turn water into wine?
Exactly.
Uh, what?
To make everybody happier at the time?
If the Bible clearly states that drunkenness is a sin,
why did Jesus turn the water into wine?
Well, I figure he did it because,
he meant not to have excess,
and to enjoy yourself,
loosen up a little bit,
part of it, you know, not blow it.
Ah.
That's, uh, what people tend to believe sometimes,
if they're not educated in the word.
But, uh, when you start talking about, uh,
uh,
Gain and Oinus, which are Greek and, uh,
what was that in a one?
Uh-huh.
They're, they're roots, which could mean.
The Hebrew was Gain and the Greek Oinus.
And we translated from those words into the English,
the word wine.
But you see, when a Hebrew got up and said Gain,
and the Greek said Oinus,
he did not necessarily mean wine.
It sounded like in an English version,
they always translated Gain and Oinus as wine,
and they shouldn't always be translated that way.
Gain and Oinus could mean many things.
It could mean grapes, grape juice, grape syrup,
raisins, and then, friend,
it could even mean jam and jelly,
and finally, it could be fermented in alcoholic beverage.
In fact, the Septuagint,
which is the Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament,
translated by 70 scholars,
when it comes to this word that you have in your English,
the English version, wine,
33 times in the Septuagint, a reliable version,
it says grape juice, grape juice, grape juice.
Well, you say, since I'm not a Hebrew or Greek scholar,
how do I know what's right?
Well, common sense will tell you.
Leviticus 10, 9,
Do not drink wine or strong drink.
Thou and thy sons with you,
when you go into the tabernacle of the congregation,
that you may put difference between holy and unholy,
between clean and unclean.
Yeah, but that's when man goes into the temple,
he's not to mix the holy and the unholy.
But in the New Testament, 1 Corinthians 3, 16,
the body of the Christian is the temple,
and we ought not to mix the holy with the unholy.
Thank you for calling.
And while we're watching all this,
look who's debating the fate of the entire show
somewhere in corporate hell.
Uh-oh.
This format scares me, frankly.
Well, it's not very funny.
I agree.
It's not very funny to me.
I didn't understand it.
I didn't know what was going on at any time.
I heard that a lot.
I think that we could use it.
Is it comedy or what?
I can't follow it.
It's a little bit, uh...
I don't know.
It was good.
It's a little too fast.
I didn't understand it.
I didn't...
Oh, it's worse.
I agree.
It's worse than fast.
Too fast.
I agree.
It went...

Anyway, go back to what you were playing.
Go back to what you were playing, sir.
I'm the weatherman. I've come out of the closet.
I hope he doesn't pretend to speak for all homosexuals.
That's another thing. I don't like it when people say the word homo.
It's homo. Say it slowly. Enunciate every syllable.
Homosexual. Say it correctly and come out on the dumb, stupid come out line.
If I can say it, so can you.
Homosexuals.
And the store doesn't have any of the other kind.
For more enjoyment and greater efficiency,
That's interesting.
I hear sound right here.
All mixed up.
Your father and me go back a long way, sir.
Totally confused now.
I think that if you are one of them, then it's a...
Go ahead.
It's up on you to explain to people what being one of them means.
Mother's hysterical, difficult...
What it was, what it's like.
You can't explain it.
It's gotta be something that makes it different from being one of us.
I haven't had a girlfriend in like ten years.
Well, at least you had a girlfriend then. Maybe that means you're not one of them.
Hard to say.
I'd also like you to know that I've had sex with electronic equipment.
Ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Okay, the big question.
The big cheesy stain in everybody's mind that just won't go away today is,
Where did we come from?
How did we get here from there?
What was there that wasn't?
And where was that what that wasn't from?
In the first place, we'll hear the Mediterranean is Dr. Winston Tabor.
Ah, howdy again, friends.
Winnie Tabor with you.
You know, friends, where do we come from?
Are we just a vast ocean of squiggly squishies eating and being eaten?
Living in a sea of diseased, grotesque air creatures.
We can't even see.
Look.
And is all this twisted, living muck, all this endless, infinite, universal gunk,
just like some big throbbing probe looking for an orifice?
Probably not.
Maybe it's more like the random hostility of unthinkable winged alien barbarians
who made it all up to be like a big, cold dreamsicle they could just suck dry.
Anyway.
Let's show the film.
Now we're doing a close-up on the damage structures.
And here's the image processing of the HAL module.
Oh, hi.
Am I on TV?
Yes, of course.
Well, uh...
I'll show you his mission scenario now.
Oh, I know that.
You're not supposed to be looking at that.
But, um...

I'll pull the camera up to head level now.
We'll be killing that night of slack shooting...
shooting tape in just a moment, Tom.
Ah, yes.
Uh...
And now, using our computer interfaces...
It's coming up.
Uh, and, uh...
We go into signal conversion mode.
A to D, B to D back to A.
We seem to have lost contact with our...
Using sound simulation to approximate tapes and records.

Hey, you want a Bible quiz question?
Yeah, sure.
Where's my...
Where's my notebook?
Listen to this.
Okay.
In Genesis 9...
Yeah.
Noah...
Yeah.
Of Noah's Ark...
Yeah.
Became drunk and was sexually molested by his son Ham.
Is that true or false?
Really?
Really?
Really?
That's true.
It was answered earlier, so I'll give you the answer.
It's true.
It's in the Bible.
Okay.
Look it up in Genesis 9, 20 to 27, if you want to hear a good story.
Yeah, that's pretty cool.
That's pretty cool.
It's for the Bible, it is.
Yeah, that's nice.
Have you ever read...
Somebody else there?
Yeah, have you ever read the Song of Solomon?
No.

Did you read the Song of Solomon?
You mean the song?
A song?
No, the Song of Solomon.

If you're born into it.
And one of them will officially come up with a King James Version of the Bible.
That's a bitchin' rad bitchin' tune there.
Mojo can really play the drums.
He was stuck down in this group thinking he was laying down on those tracks.
That's not a reality on those tracks.
Now how about the song Backside of Reality?
Our audience here is very familiar with that song.
We play it every week.
That was back in our acid days.
Back when we used to consume a lot of LSD.
Yes, I know that about me.
The Swingin' Love Corpses at one time was a hippie LSD band.
Yeah, we don't really like the Ragdolls.
We don't talk about it.
We don't really advocate it.
We did expand our consciousness.
But I thought that you were a little bit more of a fan of the band.







You condone contracted consciousness.
We condone contracted consciousness-ness.
Yeah.
Expanded consciousness-ness.
Consciousness-ness.
Consciousness-ness.
Well, some of your music actually has been LSD influenced.
Right.
And that is...
What is the similarity here?
I'm reminded of the 60's garage band.
That's like LSD with lollipop sugar donuts.
LSD mushroom mountains appearing from the sky.
We got high on high doses of sugar.
That's what it was.
Look at that listing of sins in Galatians 5.
Verses 19 to 21.
17 of them.
If you have 26 Americans to kill.
S-I-M-S-I-N-S.
And you've already killed 17 Americans.
P-L-O-T-I-N-S.






How many Americans does that leave for you to kill?
Simplot.
S-I-M-S-I-N-S.
Why are they children?
P-L-O-T.
S-I-M.
Why are they children?
P-L-O-T.
You put the murder in you.
Simplot.
S-I-M.
S-I-M.
S-I-M.

Well, winter is nearly half gone and I still have plenty of food left here in my nice warm
house.
I wonder who that could be.
Come in.
Won't you lead me?
Mother dear, I am here amongst my books.
I hear some noise.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.












Oh.
Oh.
Oh.

Hello, Bible quiz.
Okay, here he goes.
It's all yours.
Here's your question.
In Genesis 9, Noah of Noah's Ark became drunk and was sexually molested by his son Ham.
True or false?
Come on.
True or false?
False.
That's true.
False.
False.
Don't contradict him.
Look up.
Do you have a Bible?
Mackenzie.
If you have a Bible, look up Genesis 9, 20-27.
It's very kind.
I'm Alron McKenzie, and welcome to my church.
That's Noah with the cute little animals.
Get out!
Okay.
True!
True, that's right.
More, more!
The Bible clearly states that drunkenness is a sin.
I really don't want to talk over this particular piece of music.
This piece of music has been making me smile so much lately.
See if you recognize what film this is from.
We'll talk about it later.
Way back, beginning of Side 1, Albuquerque Ball from Yodlin' Satan.
The most recent album we've seen from Rudy Schwartz Project.
If you want to reach Rudy Schwartz Project, write him in care of Joan Newman at 5404 Avenue F in Austin, Texas, 78751.
Then Negative Land from Helter Stupid, back in the days when their biggest problem was being implicated in murders.
This country murders one thing, but you mess with some big rock band's trademark, and then you're asking for some trouble.
Pause.
Puzzling Evidence was strapped in the implant chair, followed by Swinging Love Corpses, a song that refused to die.
More Pastor Dick.
Score yourself on that Bible quiz, dear friend.
Doctors for Bob and Outer Space.
I've never seen them any other place.
And you heard the weatherman coming out.
Shadow Vision brought us Dr. Winston Tabor.
More Helter Stupid.
Dr. Philo Drummond explaining his influence to Reverend Ivan Stank.
Music.

Music.
Music.

Music.


Music.
Music.
Music.

More than a few of you recognize that piece of music is a very faithful cover by the Rudy Schwartz Project of the
haunting dance theme from The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and became Mixed-Up Zombies, a film which more, more lives up to its reputation.
