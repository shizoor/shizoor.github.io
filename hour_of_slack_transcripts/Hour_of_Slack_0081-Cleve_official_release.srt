1
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,540
Well, I hate to do this to you, but at the Rock and Roll Alternative and at KNON especially,

2
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,760
things are like Mussolini's trains and they operate on schedule dead on.

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,920
It's right at 9 o'clock.

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:24,480
This is KNON Dallas and it's time for Reverend Ivan Stang.

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,820
Say no to the Church of the Subgenius.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,960
Here, let's inject a little less levity into these proceedings.

7
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:51,620
Children of Earth, I am Mantor, one of a new race, a Sektor from the planet Symbion.

8
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,880
Welcome to your Sektor's read-along book.

9
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,660
As you read this story, you will understand how important

10
00:00:59,660 --> 00:00:59,980
my work is to you and to the world.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,400
My message is, you are my witness.

12
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,600
Children, to you I swear the truth.

13
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,160
This story will show you that being too proud can be a fault

14
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,700
and it can make a warrior lose the battle.

15
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,820
The lid's off.

16
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,340
It's gonna be louder beyond Ontario than it's gonna be here.

17
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,060
Those sounds...

18
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,080
Give me the child.

19
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,220
Sarah, beware.

20
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:58,940
Now...

21
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,900
We are ready.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,460
Ready to begin the story, Invasion of Skall Island.

23
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,080
Don't...

24
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,260
Here on Symbion, things are rarely peaceful.

25
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:15,360
They haven't been for centuries, since the time of the great cataclysm,

26
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,060
a terrible time of destruction, when our ancestors, the ancients,

27
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,000
sealed the story of their race and the secrets of their learning and technology

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,660
in the biocontrol centres we call high.

29
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,620
Man!

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,420
Get up off that chair!

31
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,580
Follow me!

32
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,840
Ready?

33
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,260
Go!

34
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,760
The subgenius hour of slack!

35
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,360
What?

36
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,100
Welcome, potential initials.

37
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,020
I love you.

38
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,380
I love you.

39
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,340
I love you.

40
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:50,340


41
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:50,340


42
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:50,340


43
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:50,340


44
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:50,340


45
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:50,340


46
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:50,340


47
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:50,780
I love you.

48
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,160
I love you.

49
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,040
I love you.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I love you.

51
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,520
I love you.

52
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,360


53
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,280
I love you.

54
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:12,840
I love you.

55
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,220
Costume makes perfect sense in the text.

56
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:22,640
I'm 나중에 abominable.

57
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,140
I personally don't allow indirect audio.

58
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,080
For any longer termination of a product or service, commit to audio Kempe.

59
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,980
Or to the scientific community.

60
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,940
I have been generous up until now.

61
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,020
But I can be cruel.

62
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,700
Generous?

63
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,600
What have you done that's generous?

64
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,320
Everything.

65
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,000
Everything that you wanted, I have done.

66
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,100
You asked that the child be taken.

67
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,340
I took him.

68
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,980
You cowered before me.

69
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,000
I was frightening.

70
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,520
I have reordered time.

71
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,060
I have turned the world upside down.

72
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,520
And I have done it all for you.

73
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,400
Come with me now, as together,

74
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,400
we relive a dangerous adventure in our planet's history.

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,860
Mark the tale well and take heed.

76
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,800
There is much to learn.

77
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,380
Our planets are alike in many ways.

78
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,420
What happened to us could happen to you.

79
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,740
Listen well, children of Earth.

80
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,280
Uh.

81
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:27,680
Uh.

82
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,240
I don't think I need to worry about it.

83
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,420
Well, there once was a man.

84
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,200
The world's greatest salesman.

85
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,640
And he had devised a plan.

86
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,200
To get the shackles from our feet.

87
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,900
Oh, I think it means he's gone.

88
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,580
A martyr for the cross.

89
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,440
For the battle.

90
00:04:59,680 --> 00:04:59,900
Huh.

91
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,660
Oh, yeah.

92
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,760
He's just taken five gallons of gunnery.

93
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,860
It's a big thing.

94
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:05,740
And he's gone again.

95
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,440
Who knew that the first shot.

96
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,880
That playful shot.

97
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,080
Yeah, it probably was a shot of tequila.

98
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,020
Oh, he's gone.

99
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,840
But he's got a hard driving pipe.

100
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,400
He's got a hard driving pipe.

101
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,080
The gas smoke all through.

102
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,180
Oh, yes, dear friends.

103
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,880
I don't think he's just talking about smoking either.

104
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,920
Nay, I'm, uh.

105
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,900
Smoking and choking and choking and bogan.

106
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,340
Oh, dear friends, we've got a DJ.

107
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:27,560
Oh, dear friends.

108
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,140
Degenerate.

109
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,320
Degenerate show here tonight.

110
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:36,160
Uh, it just flew in from, well, actually up from Austin, but.

111
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,100
One of them places.

112
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,960
It was bred in Boston, I'm afraid.

113
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,320
Now, the last show.

114
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,680
But he's only a crumb down here.

115
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,100
The last show, we stirred up a lot of hate.

116
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,760
Uh, talking about cruelty to animals and how much we liked cruelty to animals.

117
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:57,540
But, you know, we just like to rile up the people who don't bat an eye.

118
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,800
When they see humans get massacred.

119
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,820
But if a horse falls down and gets sick, then they cry.

120
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,240
But, uh, it'll be much worse tonight, friends.

121
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,460
Much, much worse.

122
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:17,060
Because, uh, we have as our guest a veteran of some of the top disgusting novelty bands of subhuman history.

123
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:26,440
Uh, he's, uh, instrumental in the, uh, fabulous Billy Goons, the Swinging Aeriodites, the Suede Cowboys, the Rude Smurfs for Wotan, the Sports Palace.

124
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:32,260
And now keyboardist for some, uh, what is it, a spin-off band from, uh, Billy Goons?

125
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,100
Yes, the Broad Street Carpet Munchers.

126
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,660
We are the world's only living Billy Goon tribute band.

127
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,480
Friends, this is Reverend Brother Cleave Donut Duncan.

128
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,400
The only official roving E-Missionary of J.R. Bob Dog.

129
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,900
That's right. Coming to your town, coming in your town, and coming all over your town.

130
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,620
Right here on the A1 for the B3.

131
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,420
That one actually, uh, that, that gets me.

132
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,360
That gag comes up later on in the tape.

133
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,660
Uh, of course, we're not on live, friends. You understand that.

134
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,040
We never bring Cleave in here live.

135
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,520
No, because of the...

136
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,260
Because there's just no telling what...

137
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,940
I actually just had to do the whole thing from remote, because I heard about this no alcohol rule at the, uh, radio station.

138
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,200
And they wouldn't let me bring my bottle of Mezcal in, so I just said, I'm just gonna do it from Reverend Stang's living room.

139
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,480
And that's why we have the phone hookup right here, and we're doing it on the one from that.

140
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,860
Oh, praise the Lord.

141
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,420
Well, anyway, uh, dear friends, uh, as you know, uh...

142
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:33,080
As you, as you probably already know, Brother Cleave is also the founder and secret master of the Multifarian faith.

143
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,660
The Multifari...

144
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,460
Praise the silver stream of the...

145
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,800
The silver stream of Multifari.

146
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,520
The worshipers of the holy hops, the sacraments of the monk.

147
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,900
And, uh, these things will be fully explained, dear friends.

148
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,860
All mysteries of life will be explained.

149
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,260
This is probably the most censored show I have ever had to do.

150
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,240
And if you, uh, make a game of it.

151
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,580
Listen close and see if you can hear where the cuts are.

152
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,400
Let's go.

153
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,560
And sometimes it just, uh, you know, we just use, we just use Bob, but, uh...

154
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,260
Oh, yeah.

155
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,620
So, we move then, therefore...

156
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,800
Man, do y'all really wanna know?

157
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,600
Do you really even wanna know what, what...

158
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,880
It's gonna be an all Cleave night, folks.

159
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,080
All this stuff is...

160
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,960
It's sick, it's bad.

161
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,020
It's horror.

162
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:23,880
We are the type of people that like to not only laugh at those, uh, those cattle mutilations, but also at them people mutilations, too.

163
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,940
So come on, give us a call.

164
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,400
You can be offended just as easily as we can.

165
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,140
And I can't be offended at all.

166
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,720
That's 823-7490 or 828-9500.

167
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,800
Talk to the Willa Dobbs.

168
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,200
Huh.

169
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,300
I say we like to party, rock the party.

170
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:41,860
Bob.

171
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,040
Don't get off the...

172
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,700
Bob.

173
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,120
...party.

174
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,560
Welcome to the end times, boys and girls.

175
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,860
We're gonna shock, shock the house with your brain and the world.

176
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,900
Bob is getting down with you here tonight.

177
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,400
Bob is getting down to help your plight.

178
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,380
Bob is coming here tonight.

179
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,740
Bob is here to ease your strife.

180
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,980
Comet suckers let Bob into your life.

181
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,240
Well, I'm MC Cleef.

182
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,220
I'm the master of rap.

183
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,400
I'm a daughter like my mother.

184
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:05,900
Mom.

185
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,720
Your lips gonna clap.

186
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,960
Y'all sitting around saying, oh, woe is me.

187
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,160
Well, I'm here to tell you it ain't worth P.

188
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,600
The end times is here.

189
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,360
Yeah, we the best.

190
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,060
Time to make a pay for the...

191
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,280
Mom.

192
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,100
...gums of the past.

193
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,240
Who else is gonna have to go through a rebirth?

194
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,400
And that means paying the spaceship Earth.

195
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,960
This will come from Planet X to remove from us the pain for sex.

196
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,120
In the meantime, we will have our say.

197
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,420
Get slack and fornicate every day.

198
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,480
Knock the conspiracy on its...

199
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:31,860
...boss.

200
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,220
Make your life a...

201
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,100
...fucking gas.

202
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,300
Take your jokes right to the hip.

203
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,620
Make the normal suckers flip.

204
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,960
Take the time to rape their minds.

205
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,220
Tell them to blow it out their behinds.

206
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,300
Take all their money, give them what's your worth.

207
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,960
And continue to smirk till the rebirth.

208
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:20,480
Don't waste your time, just let it disappear and this Mumbo as far back as it gets.

209
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,100
It's now or never.

210
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:21,980
It's here this time.

211
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,960
Tomorrow's our last show.

212
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:24,940
National assembly scene.

213
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,060
If you want to know the truth, then that's a fact.

214
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,240
Somebody scream, give me more slack.

215
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,520
Give me more slack.

216
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,660
Do you like slack?

217
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,720
I like it.

218
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,020
I say, I love slack.

219
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:36,920
I love it.

220
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,260
Do you want slack?

221
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,260
I want it.

222
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,480
Do you need slack?

223
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,380
I need it.

224
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,780
You're like Niggie.

225
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,980
I want it.

226
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,360
How about Anani?

227
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,860
What about Nunu?

228
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,300
Look out for Jackie Dismal.

229
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,340
Get down for broke, friend.

230
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,640
Ride my Jehovah One.

231
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,960
Do you like naturalism?

232
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,380
Because of all conditions.

233
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,740
And illuminate.

234
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,940
Stop as a recouple.

235
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,220
Out of the world, not called for.

236
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,180
Do you like Bob?

237
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,100
Yeah.

238
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,660
Do you like Einstein?

239
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,320
Yeah.

240
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,100
I can find no drum man.

241
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:13,500
No.

242
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,160
I'm a bustling evidence.

243
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:15,800
Yeah.

244
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,560
What about Dr. Spivak?

245
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,180
No.

246
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,660
I'm a pacifist Niggie.

247
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,320
Yeah.

248
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,120
I'm David M. Hyatt.

249
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:22,640
Yeah.

250
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,520
Come on, Bob.

251
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:23,940
I'm a reindeer.

252
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:24,760
Yeah.

253
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,440
St. Jane or Hartley.

254
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:26,940
Yeah.

255
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,440
Got to be convenient.

256
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,000
Yeah.

257
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,780
I'm a reindeer angel.

258
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,340
Yeah.

259
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,800
I'm a little physical.

260
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:33,640
Oh.

261
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,060
I'm a cyclops.

262
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,980
I'm a team of experience.

263
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:36,540
Yeah.

264
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,820
Well, I'm Reverend Cleve, the bassist on a blowfly.

265
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,860
Dr. Rudy Ray Moore.

266
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,060
And while I'm Steve Dolomite.

267
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:43,880
I ain't the next.

268
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,380
I know what's what.

269
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,740
Babe, I like the shape and size and contour of your butt.

270
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,940
So come on over here and give up the gas.

271
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,200
Whip some scum to me, fam.

272
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,600
Or give me all of your cash.

273
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,620
Return you honor to work.

274
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,720
Don't worry about your soul.

275
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,020
Because when the exits come, you'll be right on my pole.

276
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,180
To Dobson, Malaysia we will go.

277
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,580
When you drink the cool air to go home, home, home.

278
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,220
I'm a little physical.

279
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,260
I'm a little physical.

280
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,720
I'm a little physical.

281
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,760
I'm a little physical.

282
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,200
I'm a little physical.

283
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,340
Now I might be lying there with an ice pack on my nuts.

284
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,860
Or maybe I'll chase some other fine fucks.

285
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,440
But at least you won't have to wear all the machinery.

286
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,680
And you'll be free from the conspiracy.

287
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:21,260
Watch the fire burn your face while we make our way to outer space.

288
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,600
And while you're wishing upon a star.

289
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,060
You'll probably lose me and some at the cellar bar.

290
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,040
Come on, Cleve.

291
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,080
That's your 17th bottle of night chain tonight.

292
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,800
Let's go home now before you pass out right here on the street.

293
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,520
Woman, I can drink more wine and stay sober.

294
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,940
And then all the heathen Hindus in Asia.

295
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,680
Yeah, I heard that before.

296
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,380
Get your popsicle sticks and let's get your damn dead home.

297
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,820
Damn, hope there's something good on TV.

298
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,620
For whatever intimidation and injustice lie with decency and honor.

299
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,060
Let the doctors arise.

300
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,440
And arise they must.

301
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,180
For within every one of us there is a doctor.

302
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,660
A dormant doctor.

303
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:01,880
A supreme arbitrator who can be summoned to intervene when crises threaten the

304
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,220
stabilities and well-beings of our heartlands.

305
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:04,840
Yeah.

306
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,820
Now let's party.

307
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:08,980
Yeah.

308
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,180
Well, friends, that was Slackmaster Cleve and the spurious jive.

309
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,220
And inside everyone is a doctor.

310
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,020
But fortunately not inside everyone is a doctor.

311
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,060
And that's Cleve.

312
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,640
That's probably the Bob forsaken truth right there, because I'll tell you,

313
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,860
if it was a world full of me right here, I think I'd probably just kill myself

314
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,800
and take the load on home because I don't know what I'd do if I was confronted

315
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,580
in the morning with waking up and finding me everywhere.

316
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,440
One is bad enough, dear friends.

317
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,860
Bad, bad, bad.

318
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,460
Popes Cecilia is going to find out tonight as she actually has to go through with

319
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,240
the results of the win a date with Cleve contest.

320
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,840
A mere horrifying thought, because I've been known to throw a curveball and a

321
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,820
fastball and a big ball at about ninety eight miles an hour.

322
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,380
If you know what I'm talking about, dear friends.

323
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,580
Is it time for the disclaimer yet?

324
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,160
Oh, yes. Yes.

325
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,220
Thank you very much.

326
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:10,500
You know, the friends, the opinions expressed by Brother Cleve Duncan are not

327
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:17,040
the necessarily or I can guarantee not shared by the radio station or its

328
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,220
management or the entire church of the subgenius.

329
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,760
Membership aside from Cleve or myself or the Willa Dobbs or Popes Cecilia.

330
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,060
Definitely not after this, as you'll see why.

331
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,440
How do you like those?

332
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,720
Isn't censorship wonderful?

333
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,560
I think it makes it even filthier than it was before.

334
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,440
It does. It does.

335
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:41,280
Because kids, it's like kids look at a censored poster or censored picture and

336
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,120
they just imagine what is behind that black bar.

337
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,940
That's right. You know, so much.

338
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,780
It's even worse than the real.

339
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,320
Definitely is.

340
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,180
I remember when I was

341
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,260
a small child and the I was at least forty nine years old and the Johnny Cash

342
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,600
song came out, a boy named Sue, and they had that little blip on it on the radio.

343
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,080
And when I finally found out what it was, I was mortified because everything I

344
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,040
thought it was was definitely a lot fouler than it turned out to be.

345
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,720
Matter of fact, you could even say it on the radio right now what it is.

346
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,760
But maybe I probably should forget it.

347
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,760
Well, dear friend, this is going to there's going to be some variety here because this

348
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:24,560
Cleve thing has has produced and played in so many different.

349
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,220
Well, pretty, pretty much low class

350
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,920
dive bands, the low of the course.

351
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,760
Yeah, exactly.

352
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,780
And in that, you know, in this category, we're talking about the best.

353
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,920
But first,

354
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,780
you're going to hear some subgenius ranting here.

355
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,280
It was recorded in Dallas last time Cleve made a revival here.

356
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,920
This is at the old Twilight Room.

357
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,160
Club. I remember falling down those stairs.

358
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,600
At least at least you can remember that, you know, Reverend saying, I think we

359
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,680
should probably point out at this point that I am the only member of the Church

360
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:06,340
of the subgenius that has had close personal contact with both Blowfly and

361
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,100
Dolomite Rudy Ray Moore. That's right.

362
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:15,480
This man, aside from being a wine connoisseur and author of wine art,

363
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,500
we'll talk we'll probably get around to the current faves in the

364
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:26,500
wine world here, but also a scholar of black party records and rude Rastafarian songs.

365
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,360
The whole gamut of self-expression.

366
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:34,200
Yes. In fact, I tried to pull cuts from those things all morning.

367
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,580
I worked on that and couldn't find but a sentence or two here and there.

368
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:43,140
You know, just enough to kind of tweak your interest.

369
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,440
I do try to find them.

370
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,020
Blowfly rules.

371
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:54,740
I'm coming all the way from Boston, from Boston, Massachusetts,

372
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:04,240
home of the fabulous Billy Goons comes brother Cleve Duncan.

373
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:04,720


374
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,300
you know, I came all the way down from Boston, Massachusetts,

375
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,740
to talk to you all tonight, and I'll just give it a little little thing here about

376
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,320
what we call

377
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,760
the way of the Malta Far-Eye.

378
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,240
They see, I lived about seventeen hundred miles from here.

379
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,380
And back when Reverend Ivan Stang and Dr.

380
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,340
Philodrumma were starting the Church of the Subgenius at the same time,

381
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:38,120
I started something I also called the Church of Malta Far-Eye.

382
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,160
What we believe in is the sacrament of the holy harps.

383
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,220
The sacrament of the malt.

384
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,020
We saw Ed McMahon come down on a TV commercial one night and told us that all

385
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:58,720
we had to do was drinking up beer and drinking up what it looked like and snort

386
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,920
up enough what it looked like and just keep on doing all the kinds of drugs

387
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,200
and drinking everything we want to do, then we would be saved.

388
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,500
Save face bobs!

389
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,540
Save face bobs!

390
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,200
So we knew that it was something we had to do because we knew that there was a holy

391
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,680
power.

392
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,680
Power.

393
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,540
And it was going to be straight through disfigurement.

394
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,260
Disfigurement.

395
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:30,080
Because the more disfigured you can be, the more holier, the more higher you will be.

396
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,900
You know, the conspiracy likes to talk to you and tell you that

397
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,300
if you eat certain foods you're going to be sick.

398
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,260
Or if you smoke cigarettes, you're going to be sick.

399
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,880
Or if you drink a lot, you're going to be sick.

400
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,980
Take that job.

401
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,620
Drink it.

402
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,320
If you take it as

403
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,140
many poisons and toxins as there are out there in the universe,

404
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:53,920
Toxins!

405
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,700
Then you can build up a superhuman tolerance.

406
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:02,400
You know, you read a lot of science fiction books and see these old movies

407
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,140
and they're talking about like after the end of the world.

408
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,660
Who's all that's left after the end of the world?

409
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:09,880
Cockroaches.

410
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,260
Cockroaches?

411
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,920
So if you want to see the end times, eat hot dogs.

412
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,760
Eat meat, eat raw meat, eat beer, eat aluminum.

413
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,920
Eat it all.

414
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,460
Because that is the only way that you're going to be safe under the system.

415
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,700
The only way you're going to be able to survive.

416
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,540
The only way that you're going to be able to see the end of the world.

417
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,140
It's probably.

418
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,840
Raw meat, raw meat. Raw meat, raw meat, raw meat, raw meat.

419
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,260
You know what a lot of people say?

420
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,360
Well, all you're doing is poisoning yourself.

421
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,820
All you're doing is just hurting yourself.

422
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,140
I've seen so many people that go into their own health.

423
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,180
They're sick all the time.

424
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,720
They don't know what health is.

425
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,800
They don't know what it is.

426
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,580
Because if you're poisoning yourself so much,

427
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,740
and you are sick all the time,

428
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,080
then you are going to be truly healthy all the time.

429
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,420
This is a sick world, brothers and sisters.

430
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,760
A sick, sick, disgustingly degenerate world.

431
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,860
And there is no way to get around all the poison that we live in.

432
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,520
Oh, sure, you can say,

433
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,480
oh, well, maybe one day we'll clean it all up.

434
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,820
Maybe one day there'll be no more air pollution.

435
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,380
Maybe one day there'll be more toxic waste dumps.

436
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,580
Maybe no more nuclear power plants or something.

437
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,840
Oh, no, that is ideological dream.

438
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,800
You can't use that dream.

439
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,160
Fight reality.

440
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,580
Hit reality right upside the head.

441
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,360
Right here.

442
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:44,720
Fight it.

443
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,500
Fight it the way it looks.

444
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:51,480
And then you can have the power and strength to disfigure it.

445
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,280
It's the only, only way.

446
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,460
Only way.

447
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,820
So my message to you, however short it might be tonight,

448
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:04,260
is to continue to put in as many poisons as you can into your system.

449
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,120
Just build up that superhuman immunity.

450
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:13,420
And that is the only way that you can make sure that Bob's plan happens right.

451
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:13,800
Right.

452
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:14,380
Right.

453
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:21,940
That is the only way that Bob is going to be able to come down to this planet back again

454
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,240
from his ideological dim written self.

455
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,180
Now that he's a dead man, the only way he's going to be able to come down

456
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,420
and separate the men from the boys and the idiots from the stooges

457
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,700
is to come down and just take the job.

458
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,680
The job.

459
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:44,160
And it is for the suckers who live all around.

460
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,040
You.

461
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,100
It's for you.

462
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,740
They're always putting you down.

463
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,180
B.

464
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,140
It's for Bob.

465
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,200
He gives us our bread.

466
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,640
G.

467
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,460
It's for the guns they put to your head.

468
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,020
Head.

469
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:03,200
E.

470
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,140
It's for the eunuchs they want you to become.

471
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,600
N.

472
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,220
It's for your.

473
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,580
Glance.

474
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,640
They wish they had some.

475
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,020
Yeah.

476
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,060
Yeah.

477
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:14,140
Yeah.

478
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,280
I.

479
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,960
Is for the eyes in the back of my head.

480
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,640
You.

481
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,400
Is for us.

482
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,500
They want to see us dead.

483
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,500
Dead in the ground.

484
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:24,940
This.

485
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,920
Is for the.

486
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,800
Bad stuff.

487
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,140
That's all over town.

488
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,920
I'm a soft genius.

489
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,400
And I ain't no clown.

490
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:33,940
Yeah.

491
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,060
I know what Bob wants us to do.

492
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,060
Well, look who's on.

493
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,720
No.

494
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,480
I know.

495
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,080
I'm not even.

496
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,080
I don't even want to give.

497
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:44,480
The order.

498
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,600
You know, I don't want to have anything to do with that.

499
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,680
I don't want to know about it.

500
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,220
So just don't tell me about it.

501
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:50,460
Okay.

502
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:50,980
That's all.

503
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,080
But just now get out of here.

504
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,960
W is for woman, which is the cradle of sin.

505
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,120
But you feel like you in heaven once.

506
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,200
Happy New Year.

507
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,720
Hey, you queer.

508
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
Happy New Year.

509
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,560
Happy New Year.

510
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,120
Happy New Year.

511
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,120


512
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,920
Hey, fairies.

513
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,360
Happy New Year.

514
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,720
Happy New Year.

515
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,840
Everybody gets to sing happy New Year new.

516
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,340
I miss you so much.

517
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,440
Happy New Year.

518
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:27,860


519
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,420
You happy New Year.

520
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:44,140
You know, I try a lot.

521
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,220
Try to make new friends

522
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,680
They do this, they piss, they get all of his ass

523
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,280
The goods are drinking again

524
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,040
He sets his alarm for an hour

525
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,640
He gets up and takes a shower

526
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,260
I'm pretty used to being a jerk

527
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,060
But it's gonna go to work

528
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,740
It's two hours late for a good hour

529
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,280
The goods are drinking again

530
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,300
They try to make new friends

531
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,500
They do this, they piss, they get all of his ass

532
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,260
The goods are drinking again

533
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,620
He sets his alarm for an hour

534
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,020
He gets up and takes a shower

535
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,060
He gets up and takes a shower

536
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,400
He gets up and takes a shower

537
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,100
I'm pretty used to being a jerk

538
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,960
But it's gonna go to work

539
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,720
It's two hours late for a good hour

540
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,300
Well, the goods are drinking again

541
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:59,320
They try to make new friends

542
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,640
They do this, they piss, they get all of his ass

543
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,260
The goods are drinking again

544
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,060
Well, the goods are drinking again

545
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,260
They do this, they piss, they get all of his ass

546
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,880
The goods are drinking again

547
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,840
Well, the goods are drinking again

548
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:41,240
The goods are drinking again

549
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,180
People better pick anai

550
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,920
And that sounds nice

551
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:00,580
Yeah, that sounds nice

552
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:00,640
You know, you just gotta make good money

553
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,280
And he's like, can I get one and five?

554
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:01,460
I'm gonna go a year and they do

555
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:01,460


556
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:01,460


557
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:01,460


558
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:01,460


559
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:05,700
Oh, there's some, the Avengers

560
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:05,820
There's Prince Over here

561
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,180
The first last person costs a million dollars

562
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,540
Here's three receivers

563
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:07,740
If you can buy anything

564
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,220
I've lost outstanding feedback

565
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,940
Go onuntry poker!

566
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:10,940


567
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,560
you wouldn't want to hang on to it for long.

568
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,300
It becomes good stuff after a while.

569
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,540
But we used to have to play these shows,

570
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,640
and when you have like 28 people in the band,

571
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,540
you never really can tell how many people are actually going to show up.

572
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,260
Some nights there might have been too much whiskey,

573
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,540
and there might be three people on stage.

574
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,360
And some nights there could be 40.

575
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:36,140
And some nights people like Fred Blassie and Captain Lou Albano would come down.

576
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,980
And well, it was just sort of like one of those things.

577
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:44,940
And we discovered that if we played in bands,

578
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,060
then you'd get free beer at the clubs and free whiskey.

579
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,080
So we said, well, why not?

580
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,160
So we put together a band and became sort of a local,

581
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,960
I don't know whether you'd say legend or hazard.

582
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,740
It was pretty dangerous for me, friends.

583
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:08,300
The time that Pope David Meyer and I preached in Boston at the Spit Club, aptly named,

584
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:08,640
Yeah.

585
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,680
in Boston.

586
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:09,880
The...

587
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:09,960
Yeah.

588
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:09,960


589
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:15,700
The goons played first and started throwing food around up on stage.

590
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:16,420
And the audience...

591
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,000
No, not on stage.

592
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,240
We were throwing it at the audience.

593
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,380
Bowls of spaghetti at the crowd.

594
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,340
Yeah.

595
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,660
Well, they picked up the hint and then just threw it right back at us ranters.

596
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,760
So there was less of us.

597
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,860
I still have some pasta in my shorts.

598
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,400
I was wondering about that.

599
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:33,860
Jeez.

600
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,800
Yeah, really.

601
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,820
Thought I went to some Italian restaurant today.

602
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,560
But no, I'm afraid that's the way I stink every day.

603
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,580
Just sort of like one big bowl of pasta.

604
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,420
But I'll tell you.

605
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,520
And then there were pie fights on stage and all sorts of things.

606
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,180
Then the promoters used to have to...

607
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:53,960
They'd have us open for like the big bands that would come over to Boston from different places.

608
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:59,020
And then they wised up about that pretty damn soon after like half the crowd would leave

609
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,400
or sometimes they wouldn't even bother to show up because they knew we'd be playing.

610
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,320
So it was just one of those things.

611
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:09,220
Hay fights and pie fights and mud fights and spaghetti fights and head pro wrestlers.

612
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,840
The whole gamut of it all.

613
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,380
That was...

614
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:16,520
You know, it became such a thing though that it was just too big to control.

615
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,320
And it got more and more spinal tap-ish every day.

616
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,500
Whereas like everything just turned into like your life became Billy Goon.

617
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,320
That's why we have the Billy Goon Tribute band out now.

618
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,760
Because the original was just so great, so powerful, and just made people drop so many

619
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,940
draws that we knew it was just too dangerous to be able to bring it onto the road live.

620
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,740
So the Tribute band...

621
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,200
Yeah.

622
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,560
The Tribute band has come out and I don't even perform with them anymore.

623
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,720
Aren't they playing at one of those little clubs here in town, Reunion Arena or something

624
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,760
like that tomorrow night?

625
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:53,580
No, actually, I think the only reason we stopped in Dallas was to play up here and then they

626
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:57,060
wouldn't let our instruments in the front door because-

627
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,880
That's because they use living creatures for instruments, friends.

628
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,440
That's right.

629
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,860
It said no alcohol, they wouldn't even let any of the other guys in the band up because

630
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,120
they are just living alcohol.

631
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,180
They're just mere walking...

632
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,360
They're just walking fluids, which is kind of an interesting thing.

633
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:16,240
I myself had my entire body turned into a fluid hydraulic system many years ago by my

634
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,900
compatriot, Dr. Felix Krul, MD, who took all my internal organs out that I didn't need

635
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,520
anymore and just put this whole fluid hydraulic system in now.

636
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,160
So I don't even have to bother eating anymore.

637
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,700
Acubating can't be beat.

638
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:33,860
Well, that ought to get us into the multifarian rant here, which I think is somewhere along

639
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,160
here in this tape.

640
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:35,860
I think it's time.

641
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,080
It's getting harder and harder to find the show in this room, friends.

642
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,380
I've got something for you, baby.

643
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,740
Float within the cave of harmony.

644
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,300
Oh, that cave.

645
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,820
The mighty cave.

646
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:00,820
That cave from whence we came and to which we must return.

647
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,480
Oh, let us back into the cave.

648
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,120
Only temporarily.

649
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,080
But please let us.

650
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,060
If we can't.

651
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,780
If we can't get our whole body and at least some small portion of it.

652
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,560
And at least our heads.

653
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,660
And at least our German helmets.

654
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,240
Ah, yes, dear friends.

655
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,800
We can be a perfect family.

656
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,140
You can dance, do you?

657
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,720
It's shocking to find.

658
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,700
To set your mind.

659
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,500
Like you're behind.

660
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,080
To get a soft spanking.

661
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,660
Spanking anytime.

662
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,540
Daddy.

663
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,500
Sock it to the circuit.

664
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,220
You've seen the rest.

665
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,600
The amount.

666
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,780
LSD.

667
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,080
Now see the P.

668
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,200
You see.

669
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,720
DNA.

670
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,080
Watch them go to the moon.

671
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,260
The O.T.V.

672
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,220
11.

673
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:11,880
The left is spanking all the ladies.

674
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,580
Hey!

675
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,840
And now.

676
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,880
The P.

677
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,580
The P.

678
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,280
The P.

679
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:20,280


680
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,880
The P.

681
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,220
The P.

682
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,820
The P.

683
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,740
The P.

684
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:25,760
The P.

685
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,580
The.

686
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,060
11.

687
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:49,080
The P.

688
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,080
The P.

689
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:51,340


690
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:51,960
The P.

691
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:51,960


692
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:51,960


693
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:51,960


694
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,340
And now.

695
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:49,680
What the Multifarians preach and believe is based on the concept of strength through disfigurement.

696
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:55,360
Beer in itself is an integral yet not exclusive element in the Multifarian way of life.

697
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:04,580
Most American beer drinkers are fat, lazy, snuggle-ups who have little desire or knowledge of the true powers of the brew in which they partake.

698
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,740
Most people drink to escape problems and reality.

699
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:16,080
Multifarians, conversely, drink to create problems for those nobles around them so they can indulge in the holy horror of PARTY HARTY

700
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,520
and be the true social buffoons they were in fact born to be.

701
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:28,840
That is why the darkest day on the Multifarian calendar is the dreaded AMATEUR NIGHT known to pink boys as NEARZE

702
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:33,700
when every normal feels obliged to get pie-faced even though they don't understand the power

703
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,060
and therefore ruin the good times of we stooges who take the job every day.

704
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:45,940
All these idiots do is crowd the bars, talk loud and stupid, smash up the roads, smell awful, and give alcohol a bad name.

705
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,660
Fortunately, these gnats will kill off themselves any time.

706
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,980
They will kill each other due to the fact that they DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE POWER.

707
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,920
The Multifarian not only understands the power but knows how to use it and abuse it to his or her advantage.

708
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,780
One power is the holy sanity flush.

709
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:08,140
The great power of the Malt is to make every member a space shot for NASA, a true astronaut.

710
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:17,180
Every morning after a disfigurement bout, the Multifarian enters the tabernacle of extra meditation prepared to BLAST OFF to shoot the moon, so to speak.

711
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:21,000
This great cleansing process clears the head as well as the intestines.

712
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:26,060
Its effectiveness is doubled if it's performed after a wake-up call game of Hide the Salami.

713
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:31,940
The Multifarian will then have gotten rid of all the substances that reside in the Gouda Chakra region

714
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,900
and will head off to the bar feeling like a new stoge.

715
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:41,200
A new lightness and quickness of step will send the Multifarian on his way to face another day.

716
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,420
Another important element in the way is the act of getting REFLECTED.

717
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:50,740
While having a bout with the PLATE OF PAIN, i.e. the mirror of disfigurement,

718
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,060
by taking in the sacrament of what it looked like,

719
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:59,560
the BRAIN AMA, in which the contents of the brain are hosed out at breakneck speed,

720
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:06,220
thereby removing all unwanted particles and boosting the buildup of the loose parts into a more cohesive force.

721
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:11,660
If the beer takes care of the lower torso, so the what it looked like takes care of the upper.

722
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,620
The cleaner something is, the better it works.

723
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,400
But it cannot be so clean as this.

724
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:20,880
If it is to remain totally purified, this brings us to the DIET of the Multifarian.

725
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:26,060
Essentially, the worse something is supposed to be for you, the better in fact it is.

726
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,660
You are told by the medical and governmental lackeys all about what you should do and what you shouldn't do to have a better life.

727
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,800
They tell you all that stuff to keep you weak.

728
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,500
They know of the power, the power of the Malt, but they lie about it to you.

729
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:41,560
They tell you how to live right and how to eat right and how to exercise right, but they're all WRONG.

730
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,260
They're just trying to keep you in your self-imposed place

731
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,180
so they can retain psychological balance.

732
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,700
They're trying to keep you in your psychological powers over you.

733
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,120
If they told you how radioactive you REALLY are,

734
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,500
they wouldn't be able to scare you with horror stories of Russians and bombs.

735
00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:00,240
If they told you that after the bomb falls you'll feel the same way you do now,

736
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,100
they'd just be a little less of you,

737
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:07,960
then you wouldn't be so concerned with trying to play their idiotic games with their enemies because no one would give a...

738
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:14,980
The only way to live, therefore, is to partake in as many poisons available,

739
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:18,300
thereby building up a superhuman immunity system.

740
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,020
Just because the rest of humanity has worked to stop evolution doesn't mean you have to.

741
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:27,320
Remember the insects in the DDT? Made them pretty strong, didn't it? Ha ha ha.

742
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:33,020
How about them cockroaches? Who do you think is gonna take over the torch from man after we've gone the way of the dinosaurs?

743
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,980
Eat junk food, eat and drink tons of chemical preservatives,

744
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,920
put hot sauce on everything and anything, the hotter the better, burn a hole in your digestive tract,

745
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,960
listen to everything so loud it makes you sick,

746
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,440
make your ears ooze, you'll never need a Q-tip again,

747
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:52,980
your ears will be so clean you'll be able to hear somebody fart from across the street,

748
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,780
eat raw meat, don't forget sushi and hot sauce,

749
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,160
build a tolerance, you will survive,

750
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,160
by partaking in the yin-yang of poison, enter poison, exit,

751
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,800
you will build a strength unknown to others, keeping clean while remaining poisoned.

752
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:12,360
And when it comes to exercising, don't bother with jogging, don't bother with nautilus,

753
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,680
don't bother with any of that other corporate nonsense,

754
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,800
just f*** the way of the multifari, shall not be forsaken.

755
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:41,720

Thanks, Weeping Cyclops.

763
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:36,560
Thanks, Weeping Cyclops.

764
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:46,800
Well, they do Bon Jovi, what is it, Living on My Hair.

765
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:52,520
Oh, I'm a millionaire, living on my hair, you know, something like that.

766
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:58,200
Yep, so friends, you can see why, if Cleve is in your band, fire him for success.

767
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,980
That's right, it's the only way.

768
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,400
All my troubles seem so far away.

769
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:23,320
Now I need a place to hide away.

770
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:28,340
Oh, I've been living yesterday.

771
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:36,800
Suddenly, well, I'm not half the man I used to be.

772
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,700
There's a shadow hanging over me.

773
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:41,700


774
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:47,520
Oh, I've been living yesterday.

775
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:55,260
Why she had to go, I don't know.

776
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,000
She wouldn't say.

777
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:08,520
I said something along the lines of yesterday.

778
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:12,720
Yesterday.

779
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,560
All my troubles seem so far away.

780
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,120
Now I need a place to hide away.

781
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,420
Oh, I've been living yesterday.

782
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,180
Suddenly, well, I'm not half the man I used to be.

783
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,160
There's a shadow hanging over me.

784
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:35,680
Oh, I've been living yesterday.

785
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,580
Yesterday.

786
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,160
Yesterday.

787
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:41,640
Yesterday.

788
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:41,700
Yesterday.

789
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,240
Suat espaço us.

790
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,340
Suat espacio ten squ légion.

791
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,580
Today, I am one of your men.

792
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,400
What?

793
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:54,480
London!

794
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,760
кожел Walsh!

795
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:57,760


796
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,740
No, no.

797
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,840
It sounds like a lot of shit.

798
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:06,580
Well, here's one of them.

799
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:06,580


800
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:06,580


801
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:06,700
We know how to do it just fine if we meet him.

802
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:06,700


803
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,220
And one of my habeas get married.

804
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:08,960
Don't, yeah.

805
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,620
God knew we knew.

806
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,700
They got all his testimony.

807
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:11,700


808
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:11,700


809
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:11,700


810
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:11,700


811
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:11,700


812
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,160
I believe in yesterday

813
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:15,740
Suddenly

814
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,560
I don't have the man I used to be

815
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,660
But it's shadowing over me

816
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:26,020
What I believe in yesterday

817
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,200
It's reggae time

818
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,700
One, one, two, two, three, and

819
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,440
Yesterday

820
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,100
I and I had troubles, my

821
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,940
Oh, but I've seen you so far away

822
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,640
I sense enough, be bad, boy, bad

823
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,420
Maybe you can make my troubles go away

824
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,840
Why don't you go back up in the mountain, man

825
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,240
Find the Paul McCartney guy, bring me the big slave

826
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,380
Cause I believe

827
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,000
Oh, such a day I did not have the guy that I might have

828
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,080
I wouldn't quit, man

829
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,700
Cause I've been speaking the final words of the native country, man

830
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,960
Bring me the bongo man

831
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,080
Polka time!

832
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,240
One, two, three, two, two, three

833
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,320
Follow me

834
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,620
War be mine

835
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:10,840
I'll be yours

836
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,380
It hurts

837
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,000
You must have beer

838
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,800
Oh, I took his spare bongo

839
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,020
Oh, I'm a man, we gonna have another beer

840
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,620
We must have the beer

841
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:26,040
Cause yesterday we believed in more beer

842
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,680
Oh, I'm getting fibrous

843
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,360
Sour Broccol, my

844
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,420
Cause I smell like sour broccol

845
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,340
Enough of this ethnic crap

846
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:38,440
How about a little avant-garde free-form jazz?

847
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,880
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen

848
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,880
Time for an Irish jig

849
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,840
One, two, three, two, two, three

850
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,320
Heaven be praised, lad

851
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,180
Short and be gone a real, your Irish jig

852
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,720
Oh, may the saints be praised

853
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,920
May you have a six-pack and a potato

854
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,820
Because you might have a seven-course meal

855
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,360
Oh, short and be gone a real bread in your throat

856
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,980
Oh, it must be true, lad

857
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,540
The saints be praised

858
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,060
Oh, may the saints be praised

859
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,640
It's bluegrass time

860
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,700
One, two, three, four

861
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,160
Yesterday

862
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:31,820
Daylight

863
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:34,340
I'm a turn the lights up on our way

864
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,300
Oh, man, I need a beer

865
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,580
Oh, I need a beer

866
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,540
Oh, I need a beer

867
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:40,740
Yesterday

868
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:41,940
Daylight

869
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,420
I need a beer

870
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:47,320
Oh, where's the happy little Sam McCoy?

871
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:51,440
Oh, how I miss this town

872
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:52,900
Yesterday

873
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,300
One more time, Gary

874
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:01,780
No, you're off the seat of our way

875
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,540
No, give us our way

876
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:08,740
The night, the night is your destiny

877
00:45:46,140 --> 00:46:03,440
The night, the night is your destiny

878
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,400
You can walk on my shoes

879
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,840
But you can't dance a step in my feet

880
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:14,560
You can walk on my shoes

881
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:18,960
But you can't dance a step in my feet

882
00:46:42,120 --> 00:47:04,460
You can't dance a step in my feet

883
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:34,520
You can't dance a step in my feet

884
00:47:34,540 --> 00:48:04,520
You can't dance a step in my feet

885
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:34,020
You can't dance a step in my feet

886
00:48:54,820 --> 00:49:04,520
You can't dance a step in my feet

887
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:34,520
You can't dance a step in my feet

888
00:49:34,540 --> 00:50:04,440
You can't dance a step in my feet

889
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:34,160
You can't dance a step in my feet

890
00:50:34,540 --> 00:51:04,520
You can't dance a step in my feet

891
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:34,520
You can't dance a step in my feet

892
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:47,240
You can't dance a step in my feet

893
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:34,520
You can't dance a step in my feet

894
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:04,520
You can't dance a step in my feet

895
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:34,520
You can't dance a step in my feet

896
00:53:34,540 --> 00:54:04,240
You can't dance a step in my feet

897
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:07,320
You fools, you dupes, you pigs

898
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,140
Give me your money

899
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:11,420
You won't need it in the future

900
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:15,000
The future offers you not but destruction

901
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,640
You know what I mean?

902
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,100
I mean, I

903
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:26,880
I dare you to kill me

904
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,200
I am a soft genius

905
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,920
That's all I need to be

906
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,520
I'm one of the greatest

907
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:34,520


908
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,200
Good guys

909
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,580
My cons shall prevail

910
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:40,840
Let out the crazy man inside you

911
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,140
He knows what's what

912
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:45,300
Smile when you call me a fanatic

913
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,320
Or you say

914
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,300
Me, primate

915
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,720
Me, overman

916
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,460
You think I'm dumb

917
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,820
But you are blind

918
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:56,100
To the conspiracy that runs your life

919
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,560
And you have your geniuses

920
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,560
Running things for you

921
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,560
And you think they're gonna make things safe

922
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,020
And simple and easy

923
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:04,500
And all that free stuff

924
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,680
That I call unmediaful

925
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,280
Well, I'm a soft genius

926
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,620
And I'm gonna make things safe

927
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,340
And simple and easy for me

928
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:15,200
And the entire soft genius race

929
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,340
Even if it means wiping out your sick society

930
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:19,380
In total

931
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:21,380
With no more sentiment involved

932
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:22,880
In swatting the fly

933
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,500
All this that we might survive

934
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,840
The end times

935
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,160
You know why?

936
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,540
Because I am

937
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:31,520
I am

938
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,760
I am

939
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,840
I am

940
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,500
I am

941
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:35,320
A soft genius

942
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:36,340
I say

943
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:36,620
Bob

944
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,480
Oh, you blow-dried

Trailer and camp

953
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,300
Ball-sharp

954
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,300
Hair-curled

955
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:49,920
Motorheads

Cock holsters

957
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,960
All you dupes

958
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,760
The corporate big money

959
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:55,920

00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:00,740
Trilateralists

965
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:01,880
Establishmentarians

Backstabbing

969
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:06,980
Poverty spreading, bomb wielding, meringue headed

970
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:10,620
Pencil necked, eraser headed, politicals

971
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:12,220
Kill the conspiracy

972
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,640
Kill them and eat them

973
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,620
Who do you think you are?

974
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,840
What do you think you're doing?

975
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,060
Do you think you got it good?

976
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:23,420
Well dispose of those illusions

977
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,440
Dispose of them all right now

978
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,840
Because on July 5th, 1998

979
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:31,000
At 7.30 in the morning

980
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,440
You shall be judged

981
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:36,860
Yes indeed I tell you Zach you buy

982
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:39,240
You shall, you shall be judged

983
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:42,260
And not by some jury of your peers

984
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:46,320
But by an axe cold calculating alien race

985
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,800
With moral standards radically different from your own

986
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,620
If you don't follow Bob

987
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:53,880
You won't escape their scrutiny

988
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,860
If you are not a made up subgenius

989
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:58,800
You just aren't good enough

990
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,200
You will fly

991
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:00,980
You will fly

992
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:02,720
Well we will par-pay

993
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,980
Give me another beer Zach you buy

994
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:08,320
Give me another nice big, big bottle of Thunderbird

995
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,500
I'm gonna get down and do it right here

996
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,520
Nasty and dirty

997
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,660
You know why daddy?

998
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:13,640
You know why?

999
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:20,520
Because I am a subgenius

1000
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:21,900
That's right

1001
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,520
I drive my own car

1002
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,180
And I ride my own ticket

1003
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:27,500
There is such a thing as free lunch

1004
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,200
And I'm gonna eat it daddy

1005
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,560
Because you know why?

1006
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:36,520
I am, I am, I am

1007
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,920
A subgenius

1008
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:50,660
Or kill me

1009
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:57,620
Oh I wouldn't be surprised if that very thing happened Dr. Duncan

1010
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:59,200
You know?

1011
00:57:59,300 --> 00:57:59,600
Yeah

1012
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,520
There's probably those who would love to do it

1013
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,920
There probably are

1014
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,380
You know I wouldn't blame them in the least

1015
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:07,400
And some mornings dear friends I think that it's me I should just kill

1016
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:11,080
I wish we could tell them where they could go and kill you this week while you're in town

1017
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,380
But I guess we'd better not

1018
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:14,760
Well it's Rico's Rhythm Room down off of I-45

1019
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,520
Just about 8 miles south of here

1020
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:20,120
And you can see the Broad Street Carpet Munchers down there

1021
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:23,580
And if you're young and willing then we're old and swilling

1022
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:24,580
And we'll be taking the job

1023
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:29,560
But you know dear friends while I have you here and speaking to you from here in the

1024
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:29,580
South of here

1025
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:29,580


1026
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:29,580


1027
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:32,600
The beautiful studios of K-N-O-N here in Dallas, Texas

1028
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:37,460
I really have to give you my own personal endorsement

1029
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:38,440
My personal life story

1030
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,160
You know friends years ago I was confused

1031
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:44,080
I didn't know which way I was going except for the bottom of the bottle

1032
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:48,880
But then dear friends I met Bob and all of a sudden that bottle was turned upright and

1033
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:49,920
right down my throat

1034
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:55,300
Yes dear friends you know Bob came to me one day and he said you know if you send me $20

1035
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:59,560
I guarantee that within a good year or so I'll be able to sell you a bottle of wine

1036
00:58:59,560 --> 00:58:59,560


1037
00:58:59,560 --> 00:58:59,560


1038
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:01,120
So you will never have to work again

1039
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,300
You can have a whole life of slack

1040
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:05,680
Yes money will be falling at your feet

1041
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:10,480
Women's will be coming up and tying up your toenails and just having a good old time there

1042
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:16,220
Yes indeed and dear friends you know I sent that $20 in and you know guarantee that I

1043
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,240
am standing right here in Dallas, Texas

1044
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:22,360
Two years to that day I had slack

1045
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:25,640
And to this day dear friends I still have slack

1046
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:29,520
I don't work and I have about $400 just sitting in my pocket right now

1047
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:31,900
And a couple of other thousand just back in my hotel

1048
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:38,120
Five bank accounts, two Swiss chalets and wines, women's and songs everywhere all over the globe

1049
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:41,800
I've spun this whole globe four thousand times and I ain't even stopped yet

1050
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,760
I'm gonna be spinning for a lot more longer

1051
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,860
So I want you out there not to be a Bobby

1052
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:51,040
No no I want you to get down

1053
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,340
Get down in that checkbook

1054
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:54,100
Get down with that thing

1055
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:57,440
And send money to K-N-O-N

1056
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,560
Right here in Dallas, Texas

1057
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:06,680
And I don't know what the address is but of course this is not an on-air solicitation for the Church of the Subgenius

1058
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,880
No, no dear friends you know where you can find that out

1059
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,340
You know how you can find out about

1060
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:14,460
We only have about four minutes I need to tell them where to find that out

1061
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:17,580
About post office box 140306

1062
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:20,280
In Dallas, Texas 752144

1063
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:27,040
Or we have a small, not a major subgenius devival, probably just be me out there

But this Friday night at 10 o'clock at the Sheraton downtown in Live Oak

And what building is it in?

1067
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,480
The Southland, yeah the Southland building

1068
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,520
My friend, subgenius devival

1069
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:51,900
Now I want y'all to stay tuned for Robert Wisdom's Show American Music Party

1070
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:55,240
And I was fixing to play your tune

1071
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:59,260
The One Last Drop

1072
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:00,560
Ah yes

1073
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:08,120
Tune, but instead I think I'm gonna go to the Suede Cowboys or the Swingin' Erudites doing Stand By Your Man

1074
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,480
Ah yes, Swingin' Erudites

1075
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:11,220
Yep, we'll get in

1076
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:15,020
Not to be confused with the Swingin' Love Corpses, that will be settled out of court

1077
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:16,080
Praise Cleve

1078
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:22,360
Thank you friends for letting me take up your time and take up your mind and kick your behind

1079
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:35,060

01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:59,540
And we'll have a good time

1087
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:04,840
Doing things that we don't all understand

1088
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:13,660
But if you love him, be proud of him

1089
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:21,080
I guess the next line is try to do the things that he understands

1090
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:22,600
Very nice

1091
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:31,600
Cause if you love him, all be proud of him

1092
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:37,560
Cause after all, he's just a man

1093
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:43,500
Everybody, stand by your man

1094
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:49,260
Give him to all to thank you

1095
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:51,460
And some reward

1096
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:52,580
The company

1097
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:53,440
The debt

1098
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,760
The dots are cold and golden

1099
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,440
Stand by your man

1100
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:05,020
And tell the world he loves you

1101
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:09,420
Keep giving all the love you can

1102
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,700
Sing you animal

1103
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:17,600
Stand by your man

1104
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,080

1105
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:23,480

01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,340
Oh, boy, oh, boy

1108
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:34,640
Oh, boy, oh, boy

1109
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:34,640

1111
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,560
