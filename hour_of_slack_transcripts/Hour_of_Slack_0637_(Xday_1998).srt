1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
Look out! God is right behind you!

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,700
The Subgenius Hour of Swag!

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,240
Goodbye.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,400
Goodbye.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,860
Goodbye.

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,740
Goodbye. Goodbye, Earth.

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,120
Ah, yes, dear friends.

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:32,480
Well, I sure do feel sorry for any subgeniuses that are listening to this show from Earth.

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,080
If any radios or transmitters are still working, and I know that some are,

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:46,420
but, you know, in theory, by the time you hear this, you'll be dead or wishing that you could die.

11
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,960
Actually, I don't feel sorry for you.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,900
You knew about the 30 bucks and you just didn't have the faith in Bob.

13
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,100
I guess that Spice Girls connoisseur.

14
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,880
It was more important or something.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,240
Now I've got Spice Girls sex goddesses if I want them, but I'm already bored with them.

16
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:09,060
I've only been on my escape vessel for a couple of days, and I'm already totally sated with pleasure.

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,660
Of course, I cheated. I used time control to turn those couple of days into a couple of months.

18
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,600
And I've already done everything I ever dreamed of doing, and then some. I haven't killed anybody.

19
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,900
Not specifically, anyway. I'm real proud about that.

20
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,320
Olivia

21
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,560
Hello, Brendy.

22
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,480
Nice tonight?

23
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:37,980
Man, it's time to go back home.

24
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,560
Hoping to continue my work here.

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,740
You know, not with Bosman.

26
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:51,740
Yep, sir.

27
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:56,100
fifth grade teacher that made me lose that spelling bee when she pronounced the word I was

28
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:04,880
supposed to spell several. She pronounced it serval. And she died for that. I had to bring her back to

29
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:12,120
life and then kill her. And I went back and scared the bee Jesus out of several old bosses of mine.

30
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,440
Just terrorized them and taunted them. Made fun of them for being cheap losers who thought 30 bucks

31
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,400
was too much for eternal life and pleasure. Sort of like a you.

32
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:31,460
Yes, as I look out from my huge view screen at the planet Earth far below me, it's all lit up like a

33
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:38,460
Christmas tree right now. But all those little lights are nuclear explosions. Those are cities

34
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:43,420
being nuked and then instantly reconstructed so they can be nuked again. It's kind of cool.

35
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,160
And guess what, friends? I didn't even use a tape recorder and microphone

36
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,420
to record this. I just used a tape recorder and microphone to record this.

37
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,860
I just thought about it. And the show is instantly finished. It's a good one, too.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,380
I'm just thinking about what you hear me saying right now. And the WOM computer reproduces it as

39
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:04,160
a sound. All the way down to that trademark cheap mic tinny sound that I used to get in my Earth

40
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,600
studio.

41
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:13,180
I fooled you, didn't I? I'm not really on my escape vessel, folks. I'm actually recording

42
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,420
this 11 days before X-Day. And some of the stations are still on. I'm not really on my escape vessel,

43
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,240
but some of the stations are probably playing this before X-Day. And if it's after X-Day,

44
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,800
well, eh, no telling. But, friends, it's the last show I'll do before we leave for Brushwood,

45
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:34,500
New York, where the big X-Day gathering is for world Earth subgeniuses, soon to be ex-Earth

46
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,400
subgeniuses. I thought that this might be the very last hour of slack. And it might be for any

47
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,940
stations that still exist after X-Day. They'll probably all want to play nothing but hour of

48
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,400
slack in a vain attempt to kiss Bob's ass. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

49
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,420
And I suppose I could have the leftover dumbass bobbies send out reruns. I thought about starting

50
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,900
with hour of slack number one, which is really quite awful. And then when they get to this show,

51
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:06,100
which is number 637, they could just start the loop again. But then I thought, well, hell,

52
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,880
I might want to keep doing the show just for yucks, mainly for an escape vessel audience.

53
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:16,020
After all, it could be in widescreen 3D Technicolor and surround sound, and I wouldn't even have to

54
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,180
go searching for the tapes.

55
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,840
would all just fly together automatically.

56
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,920
So I don't really know what the future shows

57
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,080
will bring, friends.

58
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,120
I've been doing the ESO show on Thursday nights

59
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,480
as well as this show, and we have tons of material

60
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,540
from those that we might leave behind

61
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,840
for the Earth stragglers.

62
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,720
I don't know, we'll see.

63
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,240
In the meantime, hat friends,

64
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,080
this is the last Earth Hour of Slack.

65
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,760
So I should shut up and get on with the tapes,

66
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,780
of which we have plenty, actually.

67
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,880
We've got a Suzy the Floozies final X Day show,

68
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,960
which promises to be full of collages.

69
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,340
I've got me explaining X Day

70
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,160
to the High Times Radio Hour host.

71
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,900
That's, friends, it's proof that some brain cells

72
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,060
you probably do need to keep.

73
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,300
We've got recordings from the Papa Joe Mama's last preaching

74
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,140
and Jane Erslash's last preaching in the Atlanta Defival.

75
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,900
And so, friends, let us go deep, deep, deep, deep, deep.

76
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,640
And I hope to see you on the escape vessels

77
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,240
if you're hearing this before X Day.

78
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,040
If you're hearing it after X Day

79
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,320
and you're not on the escape vessels,

80
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,320
it's just too damn bad, ain't it?

81
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,880
Yes, praise, praise Bob.

82
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,000
Friends, I am getting excited.

83
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,360
I'm getting so excited.

84
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,780
10 days, 11 days.

85
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,280
And I shall be...

86
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,700
I shall be the lord of my own planet.

87
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,180
A planet of apes.

88
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,380
No, of beautiful, naked dinosaurs.

89
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,900
Yes, and yetis.

90
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,260
And yetis are president.

91
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,880
Friends, I'm hurt, Bob.

92
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,560
Oh, friends, I have to tell you before I forget,

93
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,220
I gotta tell you something kind of funny, kind of sad.

94
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,260
Yes, we are being...

95
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,140
We are being flooded with $30 memberships

96
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,920
and phone calls and faxes.

97
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,620
All of a sudden, now there's a week left,

98
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,840
and now they decide, now they decide

99
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,940
they want to interview Reverend Stang

100
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,740
or they want directions to Brushwood,

101
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,040
which indicates that they weren't members to begin with.

102
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,940
You know, they didn't really need to spend that X,

103
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,140
they didn't need to be subgenius ministers before.

104
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,800
And now there's something going on

105
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,960
and they're afraid they might miss out on it or something.

106
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,260
Now, at the very last minute, they're like, oh, well,

107
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:44,260


108
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:44,260


109
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:44,260


110
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:44,260


111
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:44,260


112
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:44,260


113
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:44,260


114
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,880
I'll decide, oh, now, just in case,

115
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,020
maybe I better get saved.

116
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,900
And you know what, friends?

117
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,020
That's just too damn bad

118
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,380
because we're kind of busy around here.

119
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,180
They may have to pay extra

120
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,760
to get that membership expedited, shall we?

121
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,680
You know, we haven't, we thought about,

122
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,200
we considered raising the price from $30

123
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,400
to $30,000 this week.

124
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,160
Maybe we should.

125
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,200
You know, Bob, I just wanted to give the dumbasses

126
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,820
one last chance, and sure enough, boy,

127
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,240
they are coming out of the woods.

128
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,020
They're coming out of the woodwork.

129
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,280
You find out when the world's about to end,

130
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,400
that's when you, that's when the dumbasses show their cards.

131
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,460
But I gotta give them credit.

132
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,300
They're not as dumb, a bunch of dumbasses

133
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,600
as the ones who just thought it was a joke

134
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,140
and never, you know, they'll,

135
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,620
I think that I'll bet you, I'll bet you anything

136
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:42,540
that we get thousands of orders for memberships

137
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,220
in the deserted post office.

138
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:44,340
I mean, I don't know if I'd be able to get out

139
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,680
of that post office box in Dallas, Texas,

140
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,080
in the week after we have left the planet.

141
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,480
Ugh, humans, God.

142
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,160
Oh, but look to the skies, Seekers.

143
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,720
Things are gearing up.

144
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,140
The exos are on the way to help us

145
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,120
immunize our eschaton.

146
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,900
Oh, and I'm lying here, sprawled on the red carpet

147
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,720
to greet our alien visitors.

148
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,200
I'm not even gonna start talking about that.

149
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,100
Gee, how would Uriel dress for this one?

150
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:23,100
Ooh, well, when in doubt, you know what they say, go naked.

151
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,940
Yeah, somehow flesh always goes with anything.

152
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,920
Which is lucky because I have more important things on my mind right now than my wardrobe.

153
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,120
Susie?

154
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,820
Oh, there's something on her neck.

155
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,200
Wild Boy decides to try to get Susie.

156
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,280
If he can only get the green disc from her neck, the spell will be broken.

157
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,280
Oh, but look what's happening.

158
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,520
Korhor and Zorad see them.

159
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,960
They are engulfing and freezing them in big yellow clouds.

160
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,300
It's easy to get your favorite New Age selection.

161
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,360
If you want the main selection, do nothing.

162
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,660
It will be sent to you automatically.

163
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,380
Those of us foolish enough to still believe that we are the only intelligent life in the universe

164
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,060
are very much like those who told Columbus the Earth was flat.

165
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,180
We present...

166
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,020
We present our next chapter in the New Age America video catalog, UFOs.

167
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,920
By 2001, the last barrier to space will be overcome.

168
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:29,260
By 2001, an interstellar spacecraft from the star cluster Pleiades will arrive on Earth.

169
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,800
By 2001, the Space Brothers will be helping Earth prepare to become the 33rd member of an interplanetary confederation.

170
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,280
Sound fantastic? It is. And it's true.

171
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,840
Greetings, friends.

172
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,500
I am Uriel.

173
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:53,600
And we are Unarius and preparing the Earth people for the great space fleet landing, the starship landing in 2001.

174
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:59,540
Read the script, you old bat. It's 1998. 1998!

175
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,420
Would you let the aliens land, please?

176
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,040
They might be here to pick me up.

177
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,820
Yes, there are unidentified flying objects because one did what he did.

178
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,100
One UFO did pick up Elijah and took him off.

179
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:23,380
I can tell you based on 2 Kings chapter 2 and Elijah, there is intelligent life on other planets.

180
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,700
They were asked to come over here to talk to these people.

181
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,220
They had in their mind that they... it was just a big joke.

182
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,000
Because after you've been taken aboard a UFO, it's kind of hard to top that, alright?

183
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,680
They have Alcoholics Anonymous. They don't have Alien Anonymous.

184
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:43,820


185
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,380
Uriel... how are you all doing?

186
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,660
Good... good.

187
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,840
Some new faces here.

188
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,400
Some new. Some familiar.

189
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,880
We are known as Allaisia.

190
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,800
We are a tenth dimensional entity.

191
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,340
You might say we are the light that permeates all existence.

192
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,320
Hey, if you're so light, how come you're so freaking fat?

193
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,240
Everybody has to have something to do.

194
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,840
Imagine that possibility for a moment.

195
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:44,000
The light that permeates all existence is channeling through an extraterrestrial walk-in

196
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,360
in this room here in Boston.

197
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,060
What extraordinary times you live in.

198
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:02,600
This must be a very extraordinary time to be in existence on this planet.

199
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,820
Do you find it to be so?

200
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,920
Seems to be a lot going on these days, doesn't it?

201
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,900
Have you heard of Krishna consciousness?

202
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,260
This part is a crazy man.

203
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,360
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

204
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,880
Right, that'll work.

205
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,740
A new and better life awaits you on our distant home planet, Plastonia.

206
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,000
Hmm, makes sense.

207
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,280
I've never heard of these movementarians.

208
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,960
Are they some kind of church?

209
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,380
Who cares what it is?

210
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,820
The point is these are some deep-seated,

211
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,220
decent, generous people that I can take advantage of.

212
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,980
But what if they try to talk us into something?

213
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,760
March, march, march.

214
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,680
Remember when those smooth-talking guys tried to sell me a timeshare vacation condo?

215
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,920
You bought four of them.

216
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,340
Thank God the check bounced.

217
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,520
No, I beat the system.

218
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,580
Watch yourself, Dad.

219
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,140
You're the highly suggestible type.

220
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,000
Yes, I am the highly suggestible type.

221
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,480
Do you like the little clearing of energies we did for you yet?

222
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:09,780
Yes.

223
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,340
Very much.

224
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,400
Lifetime's worth of karmic patterning.

225
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,240
Dysfunctional pictures of reality.

226
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,860
You don't even know which ones we got.

227
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,840
If you're lucky, it will be done so completely you will never have known you were any other way.

228
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,860
Let's try the chant.

229
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,820
Everyone loves a chance.

230
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,360
Everyone loves a droning, repetitive chant.

231
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,400
Attention, everyone.

232
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,720
Let's all give thanks to the leader for this glorious day.

233
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,920
The leader is good.

234
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,860
The leader is great.

235
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,760
We surrender our will as of this date.

236
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,080
The leader is good.

237
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,280
The leader is great.

238
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,540
We surrender our will as of this date.

239
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,560
I love the leader.

240
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,240
What?

241
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,180
I've joined the Movementarians, and so have all of you.

242
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:55,940
We what?

243
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,800
All I had to give them was our life savings, the deed to the house,

244
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,020
and a commitment of 10 trillion years of labor.

245
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,820
I can't go along with this, Homer.

246
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,740
Marge, when I join an underground cult, I expect a little support from my family.

247
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,700
Dad, do you think you might have been brainwashed?

248
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,780
I have not been brainwashed.

249
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,340
Kill the girl.

250
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,900
Kill the girl.

251
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:15,540
Homer!

252
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,180
What?

253
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:16,880
What did I say?

254
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,620
Church, cult, cult, church.

255
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,540
So we get bored someplace else every Sunday.

256
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,320
Does this really change our day-to-day lives?

257
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,280
Of course not.

258
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,020
If this is my model of how it's supposed to be done,

259
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,760
ha, catch me on the next go-round, okay?

260
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
Maybe skip it.

261
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,340
You're going to skip me altogether.

262
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:41,580
Hot damn, we better send somebody down there and start some new myths and legends.

263
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,600
Get some new archetypes going.

264
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,060
These guys aren't going to do a damn thing with those ones.

265
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,900
They're going to hold back as long as they can.

266
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,000
Callum Francis, hi, in the air.

267
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,400
Right now, we have on the line somebody very special, Ivan Stang,

268
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,140
the sacred scribe of the Church of the Subgenius.

269
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,600
He has just written a book, Revelation X.

270
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,340
And in this book, he talks about something that's going to happen on July 5th

271
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,040
at around 7 a.m. in the morning.

272
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,580
The true descendants, the chosen ones, the high unpredictables of the subgenius church

273
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:18,120
under the last bob would be rewarded in the great rupture, the X-Day,

274
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,960
when the men from Planet X will come and we will, faithful, shall be lifted up in power and glory

275
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,240
to escape vessels of the sex goddesses fleeing while enjoying on TV the cataclysms on Earth

276
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,160
and being transfigured into overmen and uberwomen.

277
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:30,900
What am I reading?

278
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,360
Ivan, what am I reading here?

279
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,840
Well, you're reading what sounds like a really good deal for only $30.

280
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,480
What's happening? What's happening on July 5th?

281
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,400
I mean, I'm going to be having a barbecue out in the Hamptons somewhere.

282
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,380
I can't be ready for this.

283
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,360
Well, if you were a minister in the Church of the Subgenius,

284
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,940
recognized by Bob Dobbs, you know, our guru and the...

285
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,340
Bob Dobbs? Who's Bob?

286
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:59,280
Well, that's sort of like asking who's Jesus or who's Muhammad.

287
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,060
Bob is the...

288
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,660
The living avatar of slack who pretty much founded the Church of the Subgenius

289
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,560
when he discovered in the 50s that there was this conspiracy of normal people,

290
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,480
an actual unthinking conspiracy of normal people,

291
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:21,320
stealing away the slack of the mutants, the abnormals, the misfits, disbelievers,

292
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,240
and those who would believe in anything.

293
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,740
And around this time, the...

294
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,840
What many cultures, simple peoples, refer to as God,

295
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,500
actually this invisible space monster named Jehovah One,

296
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,180
came down unto Bob,

297
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,560
immaculated Bob, put him in the vision,

298
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:48,100
and revealed to him that on July 5th this year at 7 o'clock a.m.,

299
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,440
starting at the Pacific International Date Line,

300
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,560
just so you don't get confused,

301
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:59,760
the sex goddesses from Planet X shall arrive, rupture up the subgenius dues-paying members

302
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,820
in power and glory.

303
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,220
She superficially

304
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:09,660
but the teach about that it over to let you speak Lord Jesus Christ

305
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:09,660


306
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:15,140
Well, I once read in a reading on the Bullets to Neol Wish buenas authority on ηПzugλων

307
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,240
of your knowledge that Jesus's техν ζ dette π juicy permisskå ate collectors of allちθ lucrato

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:30,800
inceподν μτυ habe δ Coin of immaculate conquest ingratitude from Putin.

309
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:36,720
In your book, you're talking about Barbie dolls disguised in packages of artificially contaminated food

310
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,480
who are wielding chainsaws.

311
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,160
You're talking about cities being looted of everything down to the bare rock.

312
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:41,540
What is it?

313
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,080
In flames?

314
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,680
Is it smoldering?

315
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,420
This does not sound like a cool thing.

316
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,560
Hey, look.

317
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,220
Bob sold it.

318
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,580
We smoked it.

319
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,980
That settles it.

320
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,620
I mean, what kind of a religion would this be if we didn't have lots of monsters

321
00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:01,380
and fleeing scantily clad babes and tremendous rewards for those who believe

322
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:07,120
and horrible, terrible, oh, man, the blood and guts are going to be awful,

323
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,060
but only for those who deserve it.

324
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,360
The world will only end for those who deserve it.

325
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:12,720
I see.

326
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,400
Those who had no faith in that man, Bob.

327
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,000
How do you join your church?

328
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,120
I mean, it's, you know, I...

329
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,320
Well, number one, it's called the Church of the Subgenius,

330
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,120
so right there, that qualifies most people.

331
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:27,940
Yeah.

332
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,080
The only other thing you really have to have is the 30 bucks.

333
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:36,040
Now, most of the people who join the church aren't really the true children of Bob.

334
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,380
They just want to think they are for whatever perverted reason,

335
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,920
and we're happy to take their money.

336
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,620
Uh-huh.

337
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,460
Now, who is spending that money more wisely?

338
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:51,860
Those preachers, such as myself, spending it on yachts and cars and houses and wives,

339
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,500
or...

340
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,000
The followers.

341
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:55,540
Yeah.

342
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,960
Who do you rather see spending it?

343
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,380
I mean, what are the followers spending it on?

344
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,260
I don't know.

345
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:01,820
This...

346
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,400
Preachers?

347
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,700
Yeah, that's true.

348
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,440
At least the preachers are spending it on something worthwhile.

349
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,140
And I'm thinking about this more and more on a more, you know, more subgenius levels.

350
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,580
I encounter myself.

351
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,500
It makes more sense to me what you're saying,

352
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,420
and mainly because, you know, I need another joint, man.

353
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,200
Well, you guys need to put down that cheap conspiracy street stuff.

354
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,460
It's kid stuff, man.

355
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,300
And you move up on the...

356
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,160
You know, with...

357
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,900
What we do, actually, is just rip pages out of the book of the subgenius

358
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,900
and cram them right into our exit wounds.

359
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,320
I'm...

360
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,180
You know, this is...

361
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,060
You know, I'm telling you, you know, Ken, I don't know...

362
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,940
I might have a little trouble following this today.

363
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,780
I mean, I smoked a little bit, man, but I...

364
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,340
And if it's...

365
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,960
Oh, if it's drugs you're interested in,

366
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,320
perhaps you'd like to know about the sacred Tibetan herb habifropzipula.

367
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,360
I'm getting a little bit paranoid here, Ken.

368
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,200
People are always going,

369
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,940
Hey, Bob, he's smiling like that.

370
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,300
He's got...

371
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:54,820
He's got that pipe.

372
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,480
He must be smoking pot or something.

373
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,460
Listen, I gotta get a drink.

374
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,420
I gotta get a drink.

375
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,400
How can we get a hold of you?

376
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,260
I mean, people who would want to get a hold of you and talk about this

377
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,160
in a little bit more detail.

378
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:10,040
The best way, of course, is just to call the sacred 1-800 toll-free number.

379
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:17,420
Actually, it's 1-888-669-2323.

380
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,280
That is not a joke.

381
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,960
Neither is the amazing illegal website, www.

382
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,300
www.subgenius.com.

383
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:26,580
Okay.

384
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,120
For those geniuses out there, subgenius does not have an O in it.

385
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,480
All right.

386
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,020
And, of course, the sacred P.O. box.

387
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:41,160
Write Bob at postofficebox140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

388
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,980
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.

389
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:44,980
Praise Bob.

390
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,080
Ivan, thank you.

391
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,300
It's been a...

392
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:47,500
Kill me.

393
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:47,960
It's been a...

394
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,320
I gotta go here, Ivan.

395
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,400
This has been a pleasure.

396
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,480
Listen.

397
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,540
Listen.

398
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:53,620
Listen.

399
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,960
We gotta take a break here, man, because I gotta calm down.

400
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:02,520
Callum Francis, I'm high, high on the air.

401
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,760
You want slack?

402
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,840
You want slack?

403
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,200
The world ends this July.

404
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,640
Special miracles being worked by the hands of Bob.

405
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,440
You want slack?

406
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,340
They die.

407
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,420
Bob.

408
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,160
Bob.

409
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:17,940
Bob.

410
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,340
Bob.

411
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,940
But there was one thing that puzzled me about it.

412
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,040
When the spectator pushed the button,

413
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,880
the electric bells did not ring.

414
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,000
Ah, that makes it a work of art.

415
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:27,640
Gotta go.

416
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,740
Smith is making a slack.

417
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,520
A swell party.

418
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,840
A swell party.

419
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,120
A swell again.

420
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,520
Elegant party.

421
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,040
This is...

422
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,200
The High Times Radio Hour.

423
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,620
Bob.

424
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,180
Bob.

425
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,120
Bob.

426
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,040
Bob.

427
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:43,820
Bob.

428
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,260
Bob.

429
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:44,440
Bob.

430
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,620
This is the subgenius hour of slack.

431
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,480
Aren't you sick of it?

432
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,600
This so-called new religion,

433
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,140
is nothing but a pack of weird rituals and chants,

434
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,080
designed to take away the money of fools.

435
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,660
Let us say the Lord's Prayer 40 times,

436
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,700
but first let's pass the collection plate.

437
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,220
Somewhere in outer space,

438
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,660
God has prepared a place,

439
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,480
for those who trust him and obey.

440
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,660
Jesus will come again,

441
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,260
and though we don't know when,

442
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,160
the countdown's getting lower every day.

443
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:31,200
Ten and nine, eight and seven, six and five and four,

444
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,500
call upon the Savior while you may.

445
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,260
Three and two, coming through the clouds in bright array,

446
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,840
the countdown's getting lower every day.

447
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,200
Listen.

448
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,300
Did you hear what I just heard?

449
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,120
Yes.

450
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,300
Very unusual.

451
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,200
What was that noise, CD2?

452
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,240


453
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,600
You're listening to the subgenius hour of slack,

454
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,980
the radio show that squirts funny white stuff all over you when you pull it.

455
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,580
Let Figger off, they'll be choking on our dust come morning.

456
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,000
You fools, both of you.

457
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,920
You're being used, don't you see?

458
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,740
As Pastor Byron Smith here's taking up the slack.

459
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,900
Oh, you want slack? I'll give you slack.

460
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,480
You're not putting me out for pastoral, I quit.

461
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,980
Consider this my resignation.

462
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,620
Effect immediately.

463
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,560
I'm free now.

464
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,700
I'm free now.

465
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:21,880
I'm free now.

466
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,940
Have you heard it's in the stars?

467
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,700
The original words are still true.

468
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,480
Black, black, black.

469
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,700
Next July, we July with bars.

470
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,360
The world ends this July 5th.

471
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:45,040
Well, did you ever, did you ever, did you ever, did you ever see a dream walking like I did?

472
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,680
The original words are still true.

473
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,560
A useless object made useful.

474
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,540
Repent.

475
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,600
Quit your job.

476
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,660
Slash off.

477
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,800
You want slacks?

478
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,860
You want slacks?

479
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,860
The world ends this July 5th.

480
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,940
You want slacks?

481
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,060
You want slacks?

482
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,240
Yes, you may die.

483
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,420
Special miracles could be worked by the hands of Bob.

484
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,900
But there was one thing that puzzled me about it.

485
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,800
When the spectator pushed the button, the electric bells did not ring.

486
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,920
Ah, that makes it a work of art.

487
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,300
What I always want is to be accepted, not understood.

488
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,260
But there was one thing that has puzzled me about it.

489
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,760
You want slacks?

490
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,480
You want slacks?

491
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,760
You want slacks?

492
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,020
Did you see?

493
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,400
But there was one thing that has puzzled me about it.

494
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:45,400


495
00:24:46,500 --> 00:25:02,920
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

496
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:07,680
This is a day of special miracles being worked by the hands of Bob.

497
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,900
Oh, unbelievable, friends.

498
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,840
special miracles actually being worked by the hands of Reverend bleep Oh

499
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:22,240
Abernathy the guy who's been introducing this show for so long so many years and

500
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:31,100
he has been introducing so many shows for so long for so many years and has

501
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:37,740
recently been working for high on the air the High Times radio show which I

502
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,220
don't think we get that around here so I thought I'd just play that interview

503
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:49,340
that they did praise bleep Oh an amazing collage there that he put

504
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:54,820
together I guess while he was working on that interview editing as well that was

505
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:59,440
not bleep Oh doing the interview that was bleep Oh doing the editing dear

506
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:07,440
friends and we value our editors here Suzy the floozy edited the collage that

508
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:10,380

00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,120
we've been listening a bunch to and we're about to hear

510
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,240
friends oh and

511
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:14,640

yes

513
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,000
Oh

514
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,120
Oh

515
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,320
Oh

516
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:28,320


517
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:48,160
Oh, the mankind's all-easing dreams come true

518
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:58,460
Where one can live in peace with every grace

519
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:05,420
Aboard this silver starship of the sea

520
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:09,140
This silver starship out in... I thought it was Paisley, actually.

521
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,320
And here we are, up on the spaceship,

522
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,480
looking down at our fellow extraterrestrials in human bodies

523
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,560
who have become filled with these myths, legends, and archetypes

524
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,320
and who have forgotten how easy it can be,

525
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,180
how beautiful it can be,

526
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,220
how wonderful and fulfilling it can be,

527
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,260
and who have forgotten they don't have to die for it.

528
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,620
As he watched this battle from high above the arena,

529
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,840
Darkseid felt his anger growing inside him.

530
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,340
Finally, he could stay silent no longer.

531
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,980
Enough! I can stand to watch no more!

532
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,640
My faithful minions battle among themselves.

533
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,480
It is too much to bear.

534
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:01,600
Then, turning his attention to the superpowers team, Darkseid continued.

535
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,440
Your Earth has not heard the last of me yet.

536
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,120
I'll not stop until it lies a useless cinder in the universe.

537
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,320
Get me Uranus.

538
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,240
Uranus, that letter is a sir.

539
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,140
I am the Thing from Uranus.

540
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:21,480
Whether or not you believe in spacecraft,

541
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:27,060
whether you are aware and conscious of the many, many thousands

542
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:33,840
of higher intelligent super beings that are projecting their love and their light

543
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,960
and their intelligence to the Earth world,

544
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,720
whether you're aware of these...

545
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,800
so-called psychic...

546
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:42,960
happenings...

547
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,900
do, above all things, believe and be aware

548
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,320
that we brothers all, one and all, and we number in the many thousands,

549
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,520
we are projecting to you with all of our hearts

550
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,400
the infinite love that stems from the most high dimensions.

551
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,740
Once we collect enough money for fuel,

552
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,700
our leader will throw open the doors of the forbidden world.

553
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,180
We will build a golden barn where we will all board our intergalactic vehicle.

554
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,900
Rose 1 through 31st, upon our arrival,

555
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,500
we will begin our new perfect lives on Blisstonia,

556
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,980
well known for its high levels of bliss.

557
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:29,320
Yes, dear friends, and speaking of bliss and editing,

558
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,180
once again, Reverend Susie the Flusie editing this beautiful collage,

559
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,300
X-Day collage, final X-Day collage.

560
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,640
Last week's show, by the way, was all edited by Chaz Smith

561
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,920
of Einstein's Secret Orchestra, the cantor of our church,

562
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:48,480
who will actually be the main maestro, I think,

563
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,080
at the X-Day celebrations in Brushwood.

564
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:54,520
So, friends, Einstein's Secret Orchestra, Bill T. Miller,

565
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,800
King of Slack, and Doctors for Bob.

566
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:05,220
Maybe we can play the tapes for whoever's left over after X-Day.

567
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:05,860
We'll see.

568
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:09,100
We shall see, won't we now?

569
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:29,060
X-Day Caution, a warning by Reverend Peter Hipwell.

570
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,060
The effects of X-Day on Earth

571
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,140
might be extremely varied,

572
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,180
and of course, devotees of the prophetic literature

573
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:42,060
will be all too familiar with the litany of likelihoods

574
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:46,420
such as vitriol mists, earthquakes, tidal waves,

575
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,720
polar ice melt, axial bends,

576
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,940
spiraling out of orbit into the sun,

577
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,200
spiraling out of orbit into deep space,

578
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,020
the atmosphere being skimmed off into space,

579
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,640
the collision with Mars,

580
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,700
compression of Earth to a full stop-sized point,

581
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,740
the birth of a new moon,

582
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,760
the birth of 1,800 new moons,

583
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,780
which orbit a couple of dozen times at most

584
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,700
and then crash straight back into the planet,

585
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,120
straightforward evaporation,

586
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,760
the rousing of the suspended in a near-dead state

587
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,100
in radioactive mud for 200 million years

588
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,440
of teleschizophrenic castration lizards

589
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,200
from the seabed near Java,

590
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,900
supersonic volcanoes,

591
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,860
the addition of 200 IQ points to all living matter,

592
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,880
acausal pain loops,

593
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,780
lead-lined clouds,

594
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,620
fisting,

595
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,300
starfish-headed men,

596
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,980
quantum pointlessness,

597
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,300
rayonification, and so on.

598
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,280
All signs of the end times.

599
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,740
Well, all of this may be extremely gratifying,

600
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,140
but at this point, I would like to issue

601
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,800
just a few words of caution

602
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,280
after a few words of explanation.

603
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,840
X-Day can be conceptualized

604
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,880
as a sheet of tissue paper.

605
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,120
The big sneeze is inevitably followed by a big wipe.

606
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:13,080
The saucers can be conceptualized as twin lobsters,

607
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,720
each locked by its pinchers

608
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,980
to a nostril of the Dobbs head.

609
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,420
Now, imagine a situation.

610
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,980
The whole Dobbs head, made out of a rubber sheet

611
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,140
and stretched by the force of gravity

612
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,100
or incontinence, whichever you prefer.

613
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,840
As we all know, this induces balls

614
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,840
to appear at the bottom of the dobs

615
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,280
of these quasi-conical shapes,

616
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,800
the dots, which represent planets and stars.

617
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,680
The nasal cavity in this topology

618
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,600
provides an excellent route for rapid space travel,

619
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,960
yet there are only two nostrils,

620
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,540
the egress and the...

621
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,780
Well, it's unprintable here, but it starts with SL

622
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,660
and ends with CK.

623
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,660
The two holes must be hyperspatially aligned

624
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,140
with the correct amount of dot distortion.

625
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,600
The precision of the X-Day arrival date

626
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,760
is no mere accident, friends.

627
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:06,160
Yet, one might expect that a lobster

628
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,700
moving through the nostrils

629
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,400
would inevitably cause a certain degree of irritation.

630
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,020
Correct.

631
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,420
It is entirely possible that this would result in a

632
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,180
quote, sneeze, unquote,

633
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,640
a catastrophic topological collapse,

634
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,560
spattering of spatial ink, so to speak,

635
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,960
producing new dots and hence new balls.

636
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,240
The effect on sheet space would be one of temporal,

637
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,840
temporal melting via quantibule mixuration,

638
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,380
morphing everything into a parallel reverse

639
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,440
orthogonal dimension universe,

640
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,640
or PROD universe for short.

641
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,320
Parallel reverse orthogonal dimension universe.

642
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,820
And recent observations through the Wondoscope

643
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,900
PROD parachute camera-style device

644
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,980
at the ZPK Institute reveal that there are only

645
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,900
four coherent possibilities for Earth

646
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,500
in a PROD universe.

647
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,220
I think I'm only going to tell you the first

648
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,180
two or three.

649
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:05,860
In para-one universe, let's say parallel universe one,

650
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,540
humanity evolved, but with certain minor

651
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,620
genetic differences.

652
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,440
In this existence, everyone is nice to each other.

653
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,020
The people are kind, polite, considerate, and loving.

654
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,940
They are also as boring as hell.

655
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,280
And tiny as their minds are, they do have a rude sense

656
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,460
of awareness of the tedium of their existence,

657
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,860
which they express through their incessant whittling.

658
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:32,540
The average lifespan is 17 years, most of which

659
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:35,340
is spent suffering hideously from foot problems

660
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,880
that would send present-day chiropodists gibbering

661
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,560
for shelter.

662
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,960
They embrace death regarding it as the exit

663
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,620
from what they call the life worms and the entrance

664
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:50,560
into the so-called cave of stumps, which is talked

665
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,560
of in hushed tones as a place where the corn god

666
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,880
Decheese reaps the souls of those who do not die

667
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,940
idiosyncratically.

668
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,940
And pickles them in a kind of spiritual formaldehyde

669
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,720
and threshes the rest to dust.

670
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,720
Thus, their main interest in this parallel universe

671
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,480
lies in planning out novel bravura methods of suicide.

672
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:15,000
For instance, we observed one gentleman who was lacerated

673
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,940
to death in an intense bout of barnacle humping.

674
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,080
Those who do manage to devise a new, more entertaining

675
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,740
method of terminating their existence are fettered

676
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,540
as heroes for a while until the minds of these pathetic

677
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:27,920
individuals die.

678
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,560
The next day, the world is swamped by new thoughts

679
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,320
of extinction.

680
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,960
In Parallel Universe 2, subgeniuses gained control

681
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,000
of the planet in 1984.

682
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:43,980
The world is now a sterile ball of glassy rock

683
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,220
and they're all dead.

684
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,440
I'm going to skip over Parallel Universe 3 because

685
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,300
it's sort of boring.

686
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,100
In Para 4, a world that is futuristic from our perspective,

687
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,740
everyone wears thigh-high silver boots, sunglasses,

688
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,060
and nothing else.

689
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,140
They're all permanently tanned and extremely sexually promiscuous.

690
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,680
Unfortunately, there are only 12 of them and they are all robots

691
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,380
acting out predestined parts, a vestige of the once extensive

692
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,340
entertainment system the humans built for themselves.

693
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,360
They all died out because they evolved to a form which had

694
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,680
an extremely specialized diet.

695
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,720
And then they ran out of sesame seed buns and starved

696
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,080
to death.

697
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,100
This is the situation as it stands according to current information.

698
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,740
Thank you very much and good night.

699
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:39,420
That was written and posted to alt-slack by Reverend Peter Hipwell,

700
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,520
who is a British subgenius.

701
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:47,160
And I did not attempt to do that in a British accent.

702
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,700
That's my signal, friends, to leave.

703
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:56,300
That was Emot Zepol and Cosmic Voyeur in the background.

704
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:00,180
And now, friends, it's the last hour of Slack.

705
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,140
Well, at least the last one I'm going to do on this planet.

706
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:07,380
And I don't know what it's going to be like after that.

707
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,220
You know, I don't really care about those of you who are being left behind.

708
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:18,140
And so, let us celebrate this, our final, let's call it our final week

709
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,580
on Old Ma Earth.

710
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,300
Praise Bob.

711
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,700
So returning to a world that no one remembers.

712
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:35,160
But only those with experience of starvation that'szone.

713
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:42,300
So that's something ran out back though.

714
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:42,300


715
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:42,820
And source of the只是 is ability.

716
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:48,400
In which the only thing to remember people where to come back from into some

717
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,260
granite tema.

718
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:56,180
So well, for those of you that went this way,

719
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:56,280
I'm done yet.

720
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,300
Galaxy, Clark Kent here.

721
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,440
Dr. Tripper speaking of the observatory.

722
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,640
Yes, Dr. Tripper.

723
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,680
What can I do for you?

724
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,820
Well, it seems, Mr. Kent,

725
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,260
my telescope is picking up a strange sort of,

726
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,960
well, what I can only describe as an electrical storm,

727
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,160
which is approaching the Earth rapidly.

728
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,140
I thought the news media should be advised.

729
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,980
We're Orion and Maya from planet Plomatose

730
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,360
requesting permission to land.

731
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,780
We have brought our technician, Andra, with us.

732
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:34,680
Affirmative.

733
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,000
Disengage your laser force field and begin your entry.

734
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:45,060
When they land, it will be a day of days.

735
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,440
Can you imagine what it would be like

736
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,120
when they land?

737
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,120


738
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:53,460
To have these 33,000 very intelligent,

739
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,700
advanced spiritual beings

740
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:59,360
to come down into this negative consciousness,

741
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,420
this negative atmosphere?

742
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,760
As long as UFOs remain in the air

743
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,700
and perform impossible acrobatics,

744
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,260
we can all enjoy arguments about who is hallucinating.

745
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,340
And the military can tell the anxious citizens

746
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,740
you did not see a flying saucer.

747
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,360
That was Venus.

748
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,320
Or swamp gas.

749
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,900
Or migrating geese.

750
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:19,340
Or whatever.

751
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,600
But all that changes when the UFO lands

752
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,520
and aliens disembark.

753
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:29,900
The whole world will immediately have a step up,

754
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,660
and a big one.

755
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,820
And it will be a wonderful thing,

756
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,020
and I can hardly wait.

757
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,820
Are those the friendly aliens from that new planet Plomatose?

758
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,440
Yeah, I think so.

759
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:42,120
Ah!

760
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:04,880
We missed!

761
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,080
Superman! Superman!

762
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,840
Thank goodness you've come!

763
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,280
But what are we going to do?

764
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,380
I'm sure these alien creatures are friendly,

765
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,420
but they're unwittingly destroying us,

766
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,660
and we have no way of communicating with them!

767
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:17,780
Superman!

768
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,280
Superman! You've got to do something!

769
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,680
If we can't talk to them,

770
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,660
then we must communicate without words.

771
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,140
ESP. Thought transference.

772
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,240
It's the only way.

773
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,000
Everyone, concentrate.

774
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,140
Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.

775
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:36,320
Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.

776
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,100
Don't masturbate.

777
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,140
Playing with yourself is playing with fire.

778
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,600
Let Bob take things in hand.

779
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,260
Believe in yourself.

780
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,240
Believe in yourself.

781
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,760
You're a brave little afraid out goat,

782
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,860
loving the alien.

783
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:58,540
You're a brave, little afraid out goat,

784
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,340
believing the game is a game,

785
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,900
loving the alien.

786
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,680
And you're a leaf.

787
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:14,760
You're loving the alien.

788
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:19,100
The living the strangest thing

789
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,340
Loving the alien

790
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:29,460
Soon enough, the saucer was 100 feet in diameter

791
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,740
with portholes around its rim.

792
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,560
The light from the portholes was a pulsing purple.

793
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,860
The only noise it made was the owl song.

794
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,940
It came down to hover over Billy

795
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:45,180
and to enclose him in a cylinder of pulsing purple light.

796
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,200
Now there was a sound of a seeming kiss

797
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,400
as an airtight hatch in the bottom of the saucer was opened.

798
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,200
Down snaked a ladder that was outlined in pretty lights

799
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,240
like a ferris wheel.

800
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,900
Billy's wheel was paralyzed by a zap gun

801
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,780
aimed at him from one of the portholes.

802
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,740
It became imperative that he take hold

803
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:08,080
of the bottom rung of the sinuous ladder, which he did.

804
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,140
The rung was electrified

805
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,780
so that Billy's hand

806
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,100
locked onto it hard.

807
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,280
He was hauled into the airlock

808
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,160
and machinery closed the bottom door.

809
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,320
Only then did the ladder

810
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,700
wound onto a reel in the airlock

811
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,680
let him go.

812
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,960
Only then did Billy's brain start working again.

813
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:55,900
He was forced to leave the airlock.

814
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,840
It was a crazy beat

815
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,320
it just stopped me dead rock.

816
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,080
The rung was electrified

817
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:11,100
so that Billy's hand locked into the airlock.

818
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:11,160
Only then did the ladder wound onto a reel in the airlock.

819
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:11,160


820
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:11,160


821
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:11,440
so that Billy's hand locked into the airlock.

822
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,740
Even he Heavenly

823
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:25,940
spacecraft megaphone

824
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,580
stopped in its orbit to track

825
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:29,580


826
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:29,660
Insects barely jumped on the airlock because if為

827
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:29,660


828
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:29,660


829
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,500

strength played by Butch T за seres нет其力

831
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,060
That's my husband!

832
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,740
He's our husband now.

833
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:51,440
Yay!

834
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,060
I'm glad I'm back.

835
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,800
Because the moment that sweet, sweet beer hit my tongue,

836
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,400
I was born again!

837
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,000
Hallelujah!

838
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,440
Now I can show all of you what I've come to realize.

839
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,480
The reason we're not allowed in the Forbidden Barn

840
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,000
is because there is no intergalactic spaceship.

841
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,560
He's taking our money just so he can

842
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,120
build one hell of a spaceship!

843
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,800
Homer Simpson, because of your lack of faith,

844
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,440
you've ruined mankind's chance for salvation.

845
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,620
Nice going there, Homer.

846
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:32,720
Oh, my gosh. Maybe he was telling the truth about everything.

847
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,860
Oh, mercy. He's the real deal!

848
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:36,880
You've got to be kidding.

849
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,240
Nope.

850
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,580
Well, if you're not kidding, you've sure been around a long time.

851
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,060
Who are you?

852
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,100
Oh, I've been around all right.

853
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,920
Hey, Mitzi, pinch me. I just did.

854
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,360
Ouch! Then you must be real, mister.

855
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:55,260
As real as that spaceship heading for the moon.

856
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:59,440
Lucas, a ranger in the forest, hears a strange buzzing noise.

857
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,060
He turns around and is suddenly covered by a yellow light.

858
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,480
It's a flying saucer, and it's landing in the trees.

859
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,460
I'm telling you, I didn't know that.

860
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,000
I saw a creature from another planet.

861
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,540
Maybe you just dreamed it.

862
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:15,620
Oh, yeah? Well, when I came to, I was covered with a sticky translucent goo.

863
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:16,740
Explain that.

864
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,920
Yeah, I'd like to know, too.

865
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:23,740
According to Junior Skeptic Magazine, the chances are 175 million to one

866
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:27,180
of another form of life actually coming in contact with ours.

867
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:27,740
So?

868
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,360
It's just that the people who claim they've seen aliens

869
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,900
are always pathetic lowlifes with boring jobs.

870
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:36,800
I'll tell you, too, that's starting to depress me about UFOs.

871
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,440
The fact that they cross galaxies around the world.

872
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:39,820
Wherever they come from to visit us.

873
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,920
And always end up in places like Fife, Alabama.

874
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,940
Maybe these are not super intelligent beings, man.

875
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,340
Maybe they're like hillbilly aliens.

876
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,800
Some intergalactic Joad family or something.

877
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,600
Oh, you don't want to land in New York or LA?

878
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:58,020
Nah, we just had a long trip.

879
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,700
We're going to kick back and whittle some.

880
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,600
Oh, my God, they're idiots.

881
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:06,260
We're going to enter our mother ship in the tractor pull.

882
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,000
My God, we're being invaded by rednecks.

883
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,200
My biggest fear.

884
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:22,480
Last thing I want to see is a flying saucer up on blocks

885
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,740
in front of some trailer, you know?

886
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,520
It'll be depressing.

887
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,200
Some bumper sticker on it.

888
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,460
They'll get my ray gun when they pry my cold, dead, 18-fingered hand off of it.

889
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,180
Reports from Moscow indicate a catastrophe has occurred

890
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:38,440
since 6 o'clock Friday morning.

891
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:39,740
We haven't heard a word.

892
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,880
SOS, SOS, alien creatures are landing.

893
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:44,600
Alien creatures are landing.

894
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,500
Lois stands paralyzed before the television set.

895
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,660
Superman zooms through the window and comes to a screeching halt beside her.

896
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:54,540
Lois.

897
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,140
Superman.

898
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,540
That's a big hot dog.

899
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:00,540
At least it looks like a hot dog, Pee-wee.

900
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:07,180
I think it's a flying saucer from outer space and it's landing on the deck.

901
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:07,800
Huh?

902
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:11,680
And so Jack handed him Pinky's halter and took the saucer in return.

903
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:19,440
She's gonna grab it, scoot it, get it, rip it, skim it, gun it, break it, zoom it, vacuum it.

904
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:22,180
I've done what I want, don't want your love.

905
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:25,460
I don't want your money, girl.

906
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:28,580
Said all I want is to keep your money.

907
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:34,040
Oh, just move back into your body.

908
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,440
Hey.

909
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,160
Hey.

910
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:37,540


911
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,260
The

912
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:46,720
Andly��을

913
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,220
The

914
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:48,260
And delay .

915
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:48,660
Ö

916
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,880
Ö

917
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,800
begin mining immediately.

918
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:52,980
It's late.

919
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,140
With this planet as a mineral supply,

920
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,100
we can easily dominate the entire galaxy.

921
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,660
We've got to stop them.

922
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,220
Da-lucka, tombo.

923
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,160
Good idea.

924
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,540
You hide, and I'll get them to come out.

925
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:04,980
Dad, there you are.

926
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:05,600
Do you want to come?

927
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,200
Hi there.

928
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:07,680
Susie.

929
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:10,100
Dad!

930
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:11,700
Susie.

931
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:12,640
Bigfoot.

932
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:13,920
Bigfoot.

933
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:14,760
Susie.

934
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:15,740
Bigfoot.

935
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,520
We've got to stop meeting like this.

936
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,280
Susie.

937
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,920
Go, sotra, wild boy.

938
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,120
Bigfoot, look.

939
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,580
Oh, I can't keep that little girl voice up.

940
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,320
Hey, Bigfoot, get a load of these.

941
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,560
Bet you ain't seen nothing like this that wasn't out covered

942
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,200
with matted fun fur.

943
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,200
Oh, damn, the Seekers are back.

944
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,800
Hey, hey, make yourself scarce.

945
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,960
Oh, Seekers, you surprised me.

946
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,320
Oh, I'm just lying here on the floor in this unnatural position

947
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,900
because I was, uh, yeah, I was just checking out

948
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:49,900


949
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,240
this brochure I got from the Planet X Travel Center.

950
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:55,260
Oh, look.

951
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,180
Hey, it's going to be just like a carnival cruise

952
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:03,300
designed for perverts, but without all the boring jerk-offs.

953
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:07,200
Plus, you get to personally kill Kathy Lee Gifford every hour

954
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,260
on the hour.

955
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,400
Man, now that's a floor show.

956
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,800
Oh, but hey, look what it says here.

957
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,660
Yeah, that's just the beginning of your lavish space cruise.

958
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,320
To a bright new tomorrow.

959
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:27,240
Your every desire shall be attended to by an army of accommodating,

960
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:31,620
multi-adaptive, sex-crazed alien body servants.

961
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,320
Oh, wow, this sounds choice.

962
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,980
Oh, and oh, look at the tempting spread in the dining salon.

963
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:46,700
Oh, wait, there's a picture of me and the squid from the 96X Day drill.

964
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,900
Oh, that darn stamp.

965
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,480
Oh, but oh, that squid.

966
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,540
Oh, look-a here.

967
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:02,860
Oh, they got 55-gallon tubs of ice prairie squid in each stateroom.

968
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,760
Oh, and oh, here's a shot of the giant viewscreens

969
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,360
in the hospitality orgy room where you'll be able to watch

970
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:15,380
those obnoxious boys who made your sixth-grade life a living hell.

971
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:19,840
Oh, as they scream in agony and fry into fish.

972
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,060
Oh, and oh, look at the little bitters.

973
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,320
Well, you know what I mean.

974
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:29,960
Oh, and look, there's actually a shot of a couple of Xs there in the background.

975
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,360
Damn.

976
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,600
Wow, are those genitals?

977
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,540
Hey, I gotta get a better look at this.

978
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,520
Oh, where's my earring?

979
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,000
Oh, let me magnify it through a rhinestone.

980
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,000
Oh.

981
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,640
Oh, damn.

982
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,820
That's just a platter of fettuccine.

983
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,120
Figures.

984
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:56,640
Oh, but look, they've got their ubiquitous little handbooks

985
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,360
and their fleshy pseudopods there.

986
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,160
Yeah, they never go anywhere without them.

987
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:02,500
Hmm.

988
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:07,040
How to serve man.

989
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:11,460
Geez, it looks like they're a whole race of bottoms.

990
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,960
Yeah, just like me.

991
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:17,220
Oh, hey, I can switch hit in a pinch.

992
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:22,560
Oh, and it'd sure be a refreshing change from being a brain-battered victim.

993
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:28,660
Oh, but that's exactly what we need right now.

994
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:33,520
Because it's going to take a little brain battering to get us ready for the rupture seekers.

995
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:37,440
So strap yourselves in especially tight right now.

996
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:43,340
And use all the straps you got, not just the big red ones.

997
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,560
Because you're gonna need them all.

998
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,720
Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry.

999
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,560
I ate all the Dramamine suppositories.

1000
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:53,360
Ugh.

1001
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:59,740
Mm, but you can catch this spew in this old frat baggie.

1002
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,640
And try to aim for a change, okay?

1003
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,380
I wanna go with Bob.

1004
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:08,520
I wanna go to the ball club.

1005
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:09,300
I wanna go with Bob.

1006
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,580
The first time in the fall of 1953,

1007
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,540
which was the time that I got into the industry,

1008
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,340
I was a member of the UFO field.

1009
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,580
So he got into it a year or so before I did.

1010
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,360
Don't worry, Bob, I made a great deal with it.

1011
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:23,200
In a flash of insight that might have been wholly spurious,

1012
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:24,980
he knew what this thing must surely be.

1013
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,160
It was some kind of cosmic switching device,

1014
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,680
routing the traffic of the stars through unimaginable dimensions of space and time.

1015
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:33,500
He was passing through a grand central station of the galaxy.

1016
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:35,040
And what do you think he saw?

1017
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,760
Why, the saucer his mother had drawn out the door into the garden

1018
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,720
had become a huge spaceship, a real flying saucer,

1019
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:43,380
which was twice as big as Jack's house.

1020
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:46,240
So the man had spoken the truth after all.

1021
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,500
Since the door of the flying saucer stood quite close to Jack's window,

1022
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:52,520
he opened his window and then leaned out and opened the saucer's door.

1023
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:54,880
And then, without a moment's thought,

1024
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:58,440
he jumped inside the entrance to the saucer and closed the door behind him.

1025
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,140
Oh, wow, look at all those dials and meters.

1026
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:05,580
Oh, I'd sure like to fly this thing somewhere,

1027
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:07,640
but I don't know how to fly a ship.

1028
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,540
Jack looked around and around,

1029
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,020
and soon he found a button that said,

1030
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,320
Press Me in big red letters.

1031
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,880
So Jack pressed the button.

1032
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,240
Your spaceship's computer.

1033
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,200
You have pressed my button.

1034
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:21,460
Now, tell me what you wish.

1035
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,040
Your wish is my command.

1036
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,720
Oh, are you a fairy godmother?

1037
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:27,960
No, I am a computer.

1038
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,040
As I said, what is your wish, young captain?

1039
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,300
Captain? Wow.

1040
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:37,080
Well, I'd like to travel to a planet that had no noise, actually.

1041
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:40,360
Oh, I'd love to find someplace that was just the opposite of Boom Boom,

1042
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,300
where there's lots of quiet all the time,

1043
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,660
and you can hear yourself think.

1044
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,700
That'd be great.

1045
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:46,300
As you wish.

1046
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,520
Last off time is one minute and counting.

1047
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:50,680
Put on your seatbelt and sit back.

1048
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,480
Last off time is 45 seconds and counting.

1049
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,100
Better close your eyes.

1050
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:57,580
Last off time is 30 seconds and counting.

1051
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,180
Take off your shoes.

1052
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:00,760
You'll be more comfortable.

1053
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:03,600
Last off time is 15 seconds and counting.

1054
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,700
Bye-bye, Boom Boom.

1055
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:06,680
Bye-bye.

1056
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:12,300
Six, five, four, three, two, one.

1057
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:13,920
Blast off.

1058
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:28,260
T minus five, minus four, minus three, minus two, minus one.

1059
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:29,640
Ignition.

1060
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,220
Lift off.

1061
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,400
Wee, look at it go, Betsy.

1062
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:35,320
Come on, Apollo.

1063
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,500
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1064
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:38,880
No.

1065
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:43,360
Go, Apollo, 69.

1066
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:47,120
Rocket, baby, off of the island.

1067
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,660
We feed the fire.

1068
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,320
Now's the time.

1069
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,020
Fly, Apollo, 69.

1070
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:58,940
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1071
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,220
Drifting like a stone doll.

1072
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,860
This is the rebel outlaw.

1073
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,560
Agent for a vacant world.

1074
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,340
Living in the shame.

1075
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:08,660
In a shame club.

1076
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,420
Working for that same love.

1077
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,800
Shake it while you can.

1078
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,240
Something girl.

1079
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,720
Happy man.

1080
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:19,820
One, two, two, our cruelest child.

1081
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:21,480
Freak out.

1082
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:22,960
Freak this.

1083
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,820
Not a problem.

1084
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,080
Not a miss.

1085
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:29,380
Go, Apollo, 69.

1086
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,080
Rocket, baby, off of the island.

1087
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,600
We feed the fire.

1088
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:36,300
Now's the time.

1089
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,320
Fly, Apollo, 69.

1090
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:38,320


1091
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:38,320


1092
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:38,320


1093
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:38,320


1094
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:38,320


1095
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:38,320


1096
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:38,320


1097
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:38,320


1098
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,080
Go, Apollo, 69.

1099
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:39,900
Go, Apollo, 69.

1100
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:39,900


1101
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:39,900


1102
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:39,900


1103
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:39,900


1104
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:39,940
Yeah, yeah.

1105
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,560
Fly, Apollo, 69.

1106
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,780
Yeah, yeah.

1107
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,980
Fly, Apollo, 69.

1108
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,100
Oh, wow.

1109
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,540
Wasn't that something, mister?

1110
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:56,640
Certainly was.

1111
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,280
Funny thing, though.

1112
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,280
Funny?

1113
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,160
Going to the moon is funny?

1114
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,700
Hey, take it easy.

1115
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,360
You little swine.

1116
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:08,200
And it was time we started reaching for the stars.

1117
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:08,300
Oh, I see.

1118
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:08,300


1119
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:08,300


1120
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:08,300


1121
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:08,300


1122
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:08,300


1123
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:08,300


1124
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:08,300


1125
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:08,300


1126
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:08,300


1127
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:18,300
Minus five, minus four, minus three, minus two, minus one, ignition, liftoff.

1128
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:25,100
Why, it seems like only yesterday when I heard the first countdown and the whoosh of a rocket

1129
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:31,720
aimed at the sky, and I said to myself, Sam, there's a new frontier up there in the sky.

1130
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:34,580
And I felt young again.

1131
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:36,440
Yeah, yeah.

1132
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,180
Yeah, yeah.

1133
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:38,280


1134
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:38,620
Fly, Apollo, 69.

1135
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:44,960
Eight and seven, six and five and four, call upon the Savior while you may.

1136
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:53,120
Three and two, coming through the clouds in bright array, the countdown's getting lower

1137
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,300
every day.

1138
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,440
Captain shout.

1139
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,820
Yes, Loosenut?

1140
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:00,320
Where's Jerry?

1141
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:01,920
Well, Loosenut.

1142
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:04,320
I'm afraid he might've missed this space trip.

1143
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,540
Oh, no.

1144
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,080
I wanted Jerry to go along.

1145
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:08,260
Well, go.

1146
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:14,120
Well, I did too, Loose Nut, but you see, I've told him time and again he needed to get ready

1147
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:18,060
and get everything all prepared so when we was ready to leave that he could go along.

1148
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,960
Well, I wish he was here.

1149
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,720
Well, Loose Nut, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about it now.

1150
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:29,080
You see, that's just like a lot of people that would like to go to heaven.

1151
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:33,760
They want to go, but they keep putting it off until tomorrow and say, well, I'll get

1152
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,380
ready then.

1153
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,460
I'll wait till tomorrow and do it.

1154
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:41,540
And finally, when the time comes up for them to go, they never make it because they've

1155
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:42,440
waited too long.

1156
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:46,140
Why would anybody want to miss heaven?

1157
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:50,360
Well, Loose Nut, not people don't really want to miss heaven.

1158
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,600
They all want to go down deep inside, but it's just like Jerry.

1159
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:56,200
They failed to get ready.

1160
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:58,900
Would you describe heaven to me?

1161
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:02,480
Yes, the best way to do it is the way the Bible says.

1162
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,980
Jesus said in my father's house are many mansions.

1163
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:35,860
You're listening to another clever quote from the

1164
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:39,820
irreverent Friday Jones on this subgenius hour of slack.

1165
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:41,460
Isn't it annoying?

1166
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,020
Ah, the show's over.

1167
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,260
Go back to sleep.
