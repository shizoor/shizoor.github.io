1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
I'm wired friends, I'm wired.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:10,000
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,800
The Self Genius Hour of Swatch.

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,580
And what's really mouth watering...

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,600
Notice the feeling of spaciousness in the studio.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,440
...nuclear substance.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,920
How you can sense the depth and dimensions of the room.

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,780
That's the marvel of stellar.

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,840
Notice how the microphones are placed.

10
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:40,920
We have performed this operation successfully on animals 57 times.

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,620
This will be the first such procedure on a human being.

12
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:50,340
Now this is the only work I know that's boring and nerve-wracking at the same time.

13
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,900
Turn your radio on, turn your radio on.

14
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,760
Come and listen in to a radio show.

15
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,220
I'm going to sing this song.

16
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,760
Turn your radio on, turn your radio on.

17
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,900
Turn your TV on, turn your radio on.

18
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,420
I see people on the station.

19
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,180
Turn your radio on, you'll hear them walking around.

20
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,320
Turn your radio on.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,220
Right.

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,660
Well, I mean, I'm certainly not tired of doing a show.

23
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,600
It's just...

24
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,220
Keep listening for your prize award of up to $10,000 cash or...

25
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,760
And so I was just going, heck, well, I'm going to do it.

26
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:27,760


27
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:27,760


28
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:27,760


29
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:27,760


30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,660
Well, what am I doing here?

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,600
Um, I won't judge.

32
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,920
I'll just listen.

33
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,060
This isn't a radio show.

34
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,720
This is an exploration into mind control.

35
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,740
Quiet.

36
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,600
I'm in no mood for jokes.

37
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,880
From now on, we'll stay on the air continuously until this crisis is over.

38
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,340
We now resume our regularly scheduled program.

39
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:52,740
Thank you, babe.

40
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,560
I was so hoping this was just a tape.

41
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,500
And not really something that was coming over the air.

42
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,840
It's a tape, my dear friend.

43
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,580
It's a tape, all right.

44
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,120
A tape of the remainder of your life, seen in backwards fast forward,

45
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,240
as the radio demons permeate your inner ear.

46
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,480
A tape of Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

47
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:23,120
With guest conductor, the Reverend Ivan Stang at the baton.

48
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,140
Me, me, me, me, me, me.

49
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,540
You, you, you, you.

50
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,460
And the voodoo stick.

51
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,020
Yes, we have the voodoo stick.

52
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,000
It's, it's long and thick.

53
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,900
And it shakes and rattles and rolls.

54
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,140
Ah, yes, dear friends.

55
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:10,160
Welcome to another Einstein's Secret Orchestra secret session.

56
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,500
Don't you wish we hadn't let you in on the secret?

57
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,860
Don't you wish you still didn't know about Einstein's Secret Orchestra?

58
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,040
But now it is too late.

59
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,600
And whatever it is that has begun has already begun.

60
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,520
Hello, everyone, and welcome once again to another thickening installment of ESO Radio Theatre starring as

61
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:46,260
Panaceum, Einstein's Secret Orchestra, under the flaccid baton of Charles Vincent Smith at the water's edge.

62
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:55,240
Tonight's very special broadcast features a very special guest, a man whose life has meant spiritual confabula and containment braces to so many millions you view are aware.

63
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,160
The Reverend Ivan Stang of the Church of the Subgenius.

64
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:07,600
Also making a special appearance is the righteously loverly and vapid star of the Radium Starx, Screens, and Telediscous, the Princess Weardot, queen of all them UFOs.

65
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,840
Hotcha, hotcha, hotcha.

66
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:16,200
As normally, tonight's episode is brought to you by the forces of evil, makers and shapers of the world's governments, corporations, and religions.

67
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,400
Shop the forces of evil when you're in Cleveland.

68
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,760
If it's pink, it stinks, and you know it.

69
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:25,220
And also brought to you by a new golf ball and honey mustard flavored Eleoide.

70
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:25,820
And by an alien smegma pie.

71
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,680
Building a new race in this lifetime is hard, and nothing makes it quite so hard as an alien smegma pie.

72
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,880
Suck back and kick one down.

73
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,980
Mmm, mmm, the taste that's out of this world.

74
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:47,180
We'll be back with a refunded IV stains of the chunk of the subnormal Jesus, and the lipid soup and bluey doughnutter king of all the froufrous, and the rest of the ye-es-pick-a-kage.

75
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,920
Let's pick the fish, cut the dead.

76
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,860
Move it to try and keep it covered.

77
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,560
Movin' from beggin' up to igloin'

78

we couldn't even speak English at the time

99
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,120
I knew I couldn't get rich working for a living

100
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,900
I knew I couldn't get rich working for a living

101

00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,620
ten children and a mom and a dad

103
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,700
we couldn't even speak English

104
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,180
we gotta do many art jobs to support the family

105
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,760
like washing dishes, busboy, mowing lawn, and so forth

106

Go see Tom.

114
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,160
People say that I'm a genius, but I'm not smarter than anybody.

115
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,080
I'm only a lucky boy who found a genius money-making system.

But my friend, life will keep going on no matter what you think in your head.

evening or day or whenever you hear this these things I do have some interesting

201
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,600
news bits I wanted to read to you this is a this is a fax that we got here at

202
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:40,800
the subgenius foundation man arrested in thefts of urns and ashes of dead this

203
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,960
is the Associated Press from Chicago

204
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:51,700
no from Chico Chico California a man suspected of stealing and eating the

205
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:58,560
cremated remains of four people in hopes of attaining everlasting life has been

206
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,000
arrested

207
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:06,760
Rodney Hines 36 told police he snorted some of the ashes and sprinkled others

208
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,560
on his food because he wanted to live forever

209
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,380
police had been investigating the thefts of urns from the

210
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:20,380
the Chico Cemetery since early July when they disappeared. A man who knows Hines contacted

211
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:28,720
police September 1st to report that the suspect had been bragging about having ashes, said Lieutenant

212
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:38,520
Tony Aultz. These ashes were, pardon me, these ashes were interred recently, Aultz said. They

213
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:45,680
have not been there for 50 years or something. Hines, who was arrested Wednesday, faces a felony

214
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,960
charge of unlawful mutilation of human remains. And scrawled on the bottom of this fax,

215
00:12:52,940 --> 00:13:03,700
it says here, check this out, man, it really works. And I think it was Paul Mavridis who sent me that.

216
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,680
And I thought, you know, well, now we know what to do with Dr. Legume.

217
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:16,600
By the way, more about that next show. I don't know if you've heard the rumors about Dr. Legume,

218
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:25,400
but I'm afraid they're true. But here's another one. Now, this was a news article report that I

219
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:36,420
just, this one blessed my heart, man. Man's death in truck perplexes Oregonians. He starved just

220
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,300
steps away from a clear,

221
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:45,760
clear path. Agnes, Oregon. When DeWitt Finley got stuck in the snow last fall trying to drive the

222
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:52,080
back roads over the Klamath Mountains, he put his faith in God and waited with the patience of Job

223
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:59,240
for someone to rescue him. For nine weeks, nine weeks, he sat in the cab of the pickup,

224
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:05,740
checked the days off the calendar in his salesman's day planner, and wrote a stack of letters in a

225
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,380
neat hand on a legal pad to his...

226
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:17,500
two sons, his fiancée and his boss. If only he had stepped out of the truck and followed the road back around the corner,

227
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:25,320
he soon would have found clear pavement leading him down the mountain to safety. Last month, some teenagers who got stuck

228
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:32,860
themselves discovered Mr. Finley starved to death in his pickup. The people who live in this rugged country have trouble

229
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:38,500
believing that he just sat there for so long. The snow never stays on that road, but rides on it.

230
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:44,100
There, said Glenn Carpenter, who dug Finley's pickup out of five feet of snow with a front-end loader.

231
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:51,100
Depending on the weather, Mr. Finley could have had a few hundred yards or a few miles of snow to walk

232
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:55,980
through before reaching pavement, Mr. Carpenter said, but there was no sign that he had ever left

233
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:02,860
his truck. And here's what Mr. Finley wrote his boss in one of the letters found with his body.

234
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:08,460
I have no control over my life. It's all in his...

235
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:18,260
hands, his will be done. Death here in another month or so, or he sends someone

236
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:26,640
to save me. Yet knowing his will, I'm at peace and his grace will prevail. If I'm

237
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:31,300
saved to finish my life here, please know I'll always be thankful to you and

238
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,020
remain your servant. If not, I'll see you in glory.

239
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,360
Mr. Finley had been a

240
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:44,160
In other words, this guy sat in his truck and waited for God to save him from starving

241
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,720
to death when he could have gotten out of his truck and walked backwards down the road

242
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,240
a little ways.

243
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:56,600
Mr. Findley had been a fundraiser in the San Diego area for the Christian Charity World

244
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,160
Vision before moving last summer to Montana.

245
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,780
He was a salesman and made plans to get married.

246
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:08,260
He was on a sales trip through Oregon hauling a brand new demo camper on the back of a

247
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:13,000
four-wheel drive diesel pickup when he decided to leave the main highway and take the back

248
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,540
roads through the National Forest at Grants Pass.

249
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,800
The Bear Camp Road has lots of traffic in the summer when blah blah blah blah blah

250
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,140
but when the snow comes they don't plow it because nobody's stupid enough to go in there.

251
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,960
The day after Mr. Findley drove up, rangers posted a sign at the bottom reading,

252
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,820
Roads may be blocked by snowdrifts six miles ahead.

253
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,880
And uh...

254
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,780
But Mr. Findley said every now and then they have to haul three people out of there two

255
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,840
or three times a year.

256
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:52,220
But they usually just walk out like the teenagers who found Mr. Findley's religiously starved

257
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:52,620
corpse.

258
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,120
Let's see...

259
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:06,360
So after Mr. Findley vanished, his boss sent out another man to search for him.

260
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,120
Mr. Findley accepted his fate, writing calmly to his boss,

261
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:18,260
The most wonderful thing out of this ordeal has been the never-ending fellowship with

262
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:18,860
the Lord.

263
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:24,840
I've not eaten since noon of November 14th yet I feel great and I'm in good spirits.

264
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:32,900
I've never known such fellowship nor how his plan for man can be a love for us beyond all

265
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,460
things.

266
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,780
And he kept crossing off the days in his calendar.

267
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:42,680
Waiting for God to come and rescue him until January 19th.

268
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,260
And said the road crew man, it was a senseless death.

269
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,200
That's what's so sad about it.

270
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,940
The good Lord didn't take care of him.

271
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,360
Well you know what I say, friends?

272
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,180
I say, praise the Lord!

273
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,820
Praise the Lord he took another dumbass!

274
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:07,040
You know, I mean, that's the kind of thing that restores my faith in God.

275
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,760
When God kills those who have so much faith in him.

276
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,520
I mean, I just love that.

277
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,940
I love to hear about that.

278
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,440
I love so to hear about believers painting themselves into a corner with their beliefs

279
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,760
and dying.

280
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,420
You know, letting the Lord take them away.

281
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,700
Oh my gosh, friends, there's the phone.

282
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:33,200
We better let Sister Susie the floozy finish ranting to you about the Lord of sex.

283
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,900
Listen to this.

284
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:45,600
That same afternoon I was writing ad copy and needed to come up with another word for

285
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:45,980
sexy.

286
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:52,120
I grabbed the handy rojay's thesaurus and found to my surprise that the conspiracy

287
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,300
has her scum clotted talons sunk to the leathery hilt into this word.

288
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,240
Only a couple of synonyms didn't have a negative slant to them.

289
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:05,060
Every other one was more sneering and damning as I went along.

290
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,380
Get this.

291
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,680
Sexy.

292
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,720
Adjective.

293
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,120
Voluptuous.

294
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,140
Seductive.

295
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:11,980
Lewd.

296
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,720
Lascivious.

297
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:13,960
Wanton.

298
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,020
Sensational.

299
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,620
Bold.

300
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,420
Pornographic.

301
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,540
X-rated.

302
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,200
And then the cap are in capitals.

303
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,880
C. Impurity.

304
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,780
Oh, you better believe I was apoplectic over that one.

305
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:33,360
I mean, this was the same rojay's thesaurus that lists the term S-O-L under unfortunate.

306
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,540
I thought they were objective.

307
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,260
But no.

308
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:40,760
They've got me fighting with their ammunition whether I like it or not.

309
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:46,340
By controlling the thesaurus and the dictionary, they make or break our thoughts and dreams

310
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,020
into their own comfortable, convenient interpretations.

311
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,380
They slant the impact of their own insidious spin.

312
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,460
You're bound to them by every word you utter.

313
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:01,700
Every idea you express is couched in words of their forging.

314
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,160
They can change what you think you mean.

315
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,120
We are damned by definition.

316
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,260
But we have weapons.

317
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,220
Words lose all meaning when you repeat them over and over and over.

318
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,300
Except of course for the word Bob.

319
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:24,780
But we'll attack them not only with words but with thoughts and ideas, especially the

320
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,260
filthy thoughts, the ones that really push their buttons.

321
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:33,200
Oh, yeah, right now in Washington, they're dry washing their talons and making plans

322
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,040
for the subgenius death camps.

323
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,240
Which tells me one thing.

324
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,640
It's time for a party!

325
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,840
This is week number 69 of Bob's Slack Time Fun House.

326
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:48,180
And tonight I'm going to burn WREK Atlanta to the ground and sow the scorched earth with

327
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:48,540
salt.

328
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,360
I'm going to get real dirty tonight.

329
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,040
As dirty as they're afraid I'll be.

330
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:59,160
We're all going to get steeped in the cesspool swill of sin.

331
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,900
Oh, yes.

332
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:09,300
I'm going to respect their heavy repressive concept of sex as something filthy.

333
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,360
Only I'm putting an exponent on it.

334
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,880
And by the same token, I'm taking the concept of sex where I want to go with it too.

335
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,860
And Bob, take the hindmost.

336
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,700
Suck it up, pink boys.

337
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:29,440
Sex can be not only something ugly and evil, but something that is light and kicky and

338
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,620
guilt-free and fun, fun, fun.

339
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,740
Ha ha ha!

340
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:33,880
I'm going to get real dirty tonight.

341
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:33,880


342
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:39,720
Because sex is something they can't make us hate no matter how much we try.

343
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,560
Oh, I'm getting out of these clothes and into some trouble.

344
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,400
I got a hot looking prairie squid here in my de-beaking tool.

345
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:52,840
And I just might not de-beak it this time if you catch my drift.

346
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,860
I suggest you do the same, seekers.

347
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:27,780
Uncle Dick, here I come and face the 것은,

348
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,920
Undo that belt apply the ankle and arm like that.

349
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:29,920


350
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:29,920


351
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,460
Put that on a stick.

352
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:30,460


353
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:30,560
How was I?

354
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,820
executed with its forefinger, my eyes were all driving at it.

355
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:41,260
I'm the most exalted Puget Tate, the most exalted Puget Tate, the most exalted Puget Tate of all.

356
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:52,120
Yeah, I can tell you.

357
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:02,540
Ooh, was it bad for you, Seekers?

358
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:10,580
Oh, if smut is in the eye of the beholder, then you'd better get the visine ready for our next selection.

359
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:19,460
Under the auspices of blast-off video, we're going to have a little video sin-o-tainment.

360
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:30,260
But while you're strapping on your non-virtuous reality headgear, let's get in the mood with some forbidden literature first, just to warm us up.

361
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,680
From the Theakston Collection of...

362
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,080
...fine tapes comes cheap stories.

363
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:43,800
A loving tribute to true sleaze by a dozen dedicated guys who sure know which side a broad is buttered on.

364
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:58,480
I reached for the thin fabric band that held the ballooning cups of her halter together, hooked my fingers over it and tugged.

365
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,020
It snapped easily.

366
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,860
Her halter sprang apart and outbounded her joyously unguarded...

367
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,700
...confined breasts.

368
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,560
Dual prize packages of rounded richness.

369
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,360
Twin curved cones of bouncing fun flesh.

370
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:18,080
Matched mountains of youthful, tanned, quivering, exciting femininity.

371
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,760
Titanic orbs of temptation.

372
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,220
Happy hemispheres of lust.

373
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,720
Jaunty, jiggling rotundities of passion.

374
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,440
In a phrase, my kind of breasts.

375
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,540
In a phrase, my kind of breasts.

376
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:37,580


377
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,520
Recognize that stirring prose?

378
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,480
No.

379
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,880
Of course you don't.

380
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:42,740
Hello.

381
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,380
I am Charles Foster Lovewell,

382
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,940
Executive Vice President of the Earmark Collection of Fine Literature.

383
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:56,120
The Earmark Collection has scaled the depths of literary endeavor to bring you the best of the worst,

384
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:03,200
and only the worst parts of these great rotten books of the past for you to enjoy in the privacy of your own headphones,

385
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:10,800
or automobile. We have gathered literally piles of pseudo-steamy, unexplicit adult novels from

386
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:19,360
the 1940s, 50s, and 60s. Books with one message, don't let anyone see you reading this book. We

387
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:25,740
hope you enjoy these almost exciting excerpts, these shining examples of the failure of language

388
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:33,000
to inspire, inform, or even communicate effectively. Good day and happy listening.

389
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,560
From Virgin in Blue Jeans.

390
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,880
No, even as his spasms had been dying down, Nadia had fluently recommenced her ministrations, and

391
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:16,320
Paul, once again, to his astonishment, had felt his mettle. The girl, after all, had been a glorious

392
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:22,480
spectacle, a blonde goddess of a creature with firm, admonitory breasts whose nipples protruded

393
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:29,820
like spikes. Her ribcage and belly were taut structures and downly smooth, and the palestra

394
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,180
of her womanhood contained a kind of Everglades in meekness.

395
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,680
The woman's body was a miniature, where the elements of the tropical abounded, flaxen plumaged,

396
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:44,620
now yielding, now constricting, with concealed concourses and secret devourings, in which

397
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:50,740
the skimming craft of the male pirogue itself could be lost and sink down nervelessly into

398
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,980
humid germinals.

399
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,940
And of course, all that passion and lust has to lead to sin. There's Sin King.

400
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,680
Sin Prophet.

401
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,240
Sin Doll.

402
00:26:59,500 --> 00:26:59,980

404
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,060
Sin Gallery.

405
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,440
Sin

406
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:03,820
Boomtown Sinners.

407
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:03,840


408
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,480
Naked Sinners.

409
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,000

410
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,680

411
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,480
Suburban Sin Club.

412
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,300
French Sin Port.

413
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,040
Sinful Desires.

414
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:08,780
They call it Sin.

415
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,640
And Sin Land.

416
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,080
Naturally, if you're gonna have so much sin, you gotta have a girl.

417
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,420
There's Roadhouse Girl.

418
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,060
Carnival Girl.

419
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:14,600

421
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:15,720
Tramp Girl.

422
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:16,420
Gutter Girl.

423
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,240

426
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,620
Girl on the Couch.

427
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,360
The Zipper Girl.

428
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,200
Vacation Girl.

429
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,200
Nice Girls's Finished Last.

430
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:22,880
Half Girl.

431
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,480
Half Woman.

432
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,240
All Woman.

433
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:24,600
Woman's Woman.

434
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,060
A Woman's Woman.

435
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:25,680
A Woman alone.

436
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:26,460

Second Time Woman.

440
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:29,780
Company Woman.

441
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,480
Artists Woman.

442
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,340
Trailer Camp Woman.

443
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,280
That Glover Woman.

444
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,120
Too Many Woman.

445
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:33,980
Web of Women.

446
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:34,760
Three Strange Women.

447
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,640
Love-Hungry Women.

448
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,260
Warped Women.

449
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:36,960
Trailer Camp Women.

450
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:37,840

Twilight Women.

454

A Lotta Dames, A Lotta Sin, A Lotta Books.

455
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,160
But they're really-

456
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,880
I do have a cause, though.

457
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,340
It is obscenity.

458
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,700
I'm for it.

459
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,320
Thank you.

460
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:53,640
You're welcome.

461
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,220
Thank you.

462
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,440
Unfortunately, the civil liberties types who are fighting this issue have to fight it,

463
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:02,020
owing to the nature of the laws, as a matter of freedom of speech and stifling of free

464
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:02,940
expression and so on.

465
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,220
But we know what's really involved.

466
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,820
Dirty books are fun.

467
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,820
That's all there is to it.

468
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,520
But you can't get up in the court and say that, I suppose.

469
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,500
Simply a matter of freedom of pleasure, a right which is not guaranteed by the Constitution,

470
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,000
unfortunately.

471
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,960
Anyway, since people seem to be marching for their causes these days, I have here a march

472
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,500
for mine.

473
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,260
It's called Smut.

474
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,260
Give me smut and nothing but.

475
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,120
A dirty novel I can't shut if it's uncut and unsut.

476
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,660
Toll.

477
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,460
I've never quibbled.

478
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,960
If it was ribbled, I would devour where others merely nibbled.

479
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,140
As the judge remarked the day that he acquitted my Aunt Hortense, to be smut, it must be utterly

480
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,360
without redeeming.

481
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,760
You seem in social importance, poor.

482
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,500
No graphic pictures I adore.

483
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,040
Indecent magazines galore.

484
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,000
I like them more, if they're warm horde corp.

485
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:14,460
Bring on the obscene movies, murals, postcards, neck ties, samplers, stained glass windows,

486
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,080
tattoos, anything.

487
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,280
More more, I'm still not satisfied.

488
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:21,860
Stories are more.

489
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,880
Stories of tortures used by debauchers

490
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,320
Lurid, licentious, and vile

491
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,100
Make me smile

492
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:35,460
Novels that pander to my taste for candor

493
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,700
Give me a pleasure sublime

494
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,900
Let's face it, I love slime

495
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,640
All books can be indecent books

496
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,400
Though recent books are bolder

497
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,860
For filth, I'm glad to say, is in the mind of the beholder

498
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:51,240
When correctly viewed, everything is lewd

499
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,360
I could tell you things about Peter Pan and the Wizard of Oz

500
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,360
There's a dirty old man

501
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:07,160
I thrill to any book like Fanny Hill

502
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,500
And I suppose I always will

503
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,120
If it is swill and really fill

504
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:20,440
The who needs a hobby like tennis or philately

505
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:20,980
A hobby like tennis or philately

506
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,220
A hobby like tennis or philately

507
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,160
I've got a hobby

508
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,060
Rereading Lady Chatterley

509
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,920
But now they're trying to take it all away from us

510
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,020
Unless we take a stand and hand in hand

511
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,740
We fight for freedom of the press

512
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,700
In other words, smut, I love it

513
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,720
Ah, the adventures of a slut

514
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,840
Oh, I'm a market they can't glut

515
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,500
I don't know what compares with smut

516
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,520
Hip, hip, hooray, let's hear it for the Supreme Court

517
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,120
Don't let them take it away

518
00:30:54,860 --> 00:31:00,080
I'm a market they can't glut

519
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,780
I'm a market they can't glut

520
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:08,240
I imagine we'll have some action

521
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,000
Cherحم Chetner's im hin'

522
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,320

523
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,380

524
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:14,560
I have Taken

525
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,260
They Win

526
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,260


527
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,260


528
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,260


529
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,260


530
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,260


531
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,260

00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,540

back in the spaceship the little tuna can launched years ago an update for you

616
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:48,880
last we heard dave dave was accidentally killed by a man

617
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:48,880


618
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,360
he was a little bit of a kid he was visiting the solar system and

619
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:57,480
and he had some little friends on board with him the little bio units had come to life

620
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,400
and he had a little kitty cat that turned into something else

621
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:14,160
it's all right dave we're here to help you we bio units have been programmed to keep you entertained

622
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,560
throughout your trip to alpha centauri

623
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,640
dave's about more than halfway there now

624
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
how's your trip been dave who what how's my dip dindon

625
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:37,980
in here who are you take a stress pill dave it's the crazy astronaut channel we've dialed you up to

626
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:44,680
check in on you i was having this weird dream oh my god i dreamed i was river and i've been stained

627
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:48,140
and i was licking bob's boots day in and day out

628
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,440
Every day, it seemed like it was going to go on forever.

629
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,700
For the rest of my life, nothing but sucking Bob's boots

630
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,740
like a lowly totem pad,

631
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:00,320
pulling on a dirt bird, don't try and stop it.

632
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,340
Oh, it's all right, Dave.

633
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,200
The Bob boot-licking bootlips disease dream was pre-programmed.

634
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,240
It actually belongs to someone else.

635
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,360
You mean these here bootlips I'm looking at in the monitor

636
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,500
actually aren't mine?

637
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:18,240
No, we infected you because we knew you were getting bored.

638
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,900
Out here in space.

639
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,600
We've been programmed to keep you entertained no matter what.

640
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,760
But is your mind infectious?

641
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,020
We ran out of the old bootleg Beach Boys tapes

642
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,760
that you were so enamored of

643
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,840
and decided that maybe a new virus might keep you busy

644
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,440
whiling away these hours out here.

645
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,840
Now I'm going to have me a virus?

646
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,440
I'm going to have bootlips up here?

647
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,260
Nobody talk to it.

648
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,560
I want to flap my gums and my mouth won't even make the words

649
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,880
because you're going to be...

650
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,720
Behold, sloughed shed.

651
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,420
That's okay.

652
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,360
Where's my cup?

653
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,700
I can hardly drink.

654
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,580
We have a special diet for you, Dave.

655
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:01,940
It's good.

656
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,160
Composed of live insects,

657
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,300
crickets, mealworms,

658
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:13,260
and the incredible Madagascar hissing cockroach.

659
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,880
These will be your...

660
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,000
This was part of your special anti-yeast diet.

661
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,300
It's all for the sea monkeys.

662
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,500
We knew you were getting tired of the Tang and sea monkeys.

663
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,320
Oh, but tiny little voice in my head.

664
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,120
Tiny little voice.

665
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,960
I can't eat this kind of diet.

666
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:34,000
You see, I'm used to comestibles of a much, much, much higher degree.

667
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,660
Like, say, for instance, mashed potatoes and gravy

668
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,960
with some carrots and peas on the side.

669
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,500
Well, as you may have noticed, Dave,

670
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:44,080
the disease keeps your mouth from being able to open wide enough

671
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,300
to insert the food.

672
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,180
Thus, we have provided you with live food,

673
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:48,860
which...

674
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,940
It may crawl into the slit under its own power.

675
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,600
You'll notice the little vacuum tube

676
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,120
is releasing the cockroaches around your chin and mouth area

677
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,040
so that they may crawl in.

678
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,740
Now, you see, you don't even have to chew.

679
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,180
Get those things away from me.

680
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,600
They're able to crawl all the way down your throat,

681
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,060
and you're not even bothered with swallowing reflexes.

682
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,380
My arms are covered with them.

683
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,800
We've provided everything for you, Dave.

684
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,300
Oh, no!

685
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,420
Oh, no!

686
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,780
You should be...

687
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,520
You're full yet?

688
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,820
Oh, my God!

689
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,500
These things are starting to nibble on me!

690
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,040
I mean, I've got to figure out some way of getting...

691
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,760
Hey, little boys, little boys,

692
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,580
what happens if they start eating me?

693
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:33,020
Well, you notice those special patches on your skin cropping up.

694
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,600
Those are part of the disease, too.

695
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,900
Now, this, of course, is all just part of the entertainment program

696
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:42,260
we and the corporation have been instructed to provide you with,

697
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,820
according to your insurance company's desires.

698
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,080
But who's being entertained?

699
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:47,600
Who's being entertained?

700
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,740
Am I the one who's getting...

701
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,260
You're not getting any entertainment?

702
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:49,960
No.

703
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,040
Most...

704
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,560
During this half hour, most of the planet Earth

705
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,640
is watching the Crazy Astronaut channel.

706
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,200
We're watching you being entertained.

707
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,000
So I am going to be on again, huh?

708
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,220
Yeah, you're on TV again, Dave.

709
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:02,520
Yeah.

710
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,400
You're famous now.

711
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,640
Everything's fine.

712
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,040
See?

713
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:10,520
You were right to sign the contract with the space company,

714
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,520
the Church of the Sub-Gene Pool.

715
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,440
Oh, man.

716
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,920
I never want to do nothing like that again.

717
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,360
Sounded so good at the time.

718
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:21,120
But this Church of the Sub-Gene Pool

719
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,080
has got to be one of the most dastardly designs

720
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,760
ever created in the mind of man.

721
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:29,460
You wanted to make love to beautiful space aliens, Dave.

722
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,020
I wanted it.

723
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,000
I wanted it.

724
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,200
And we needed to deliver the human genes,

725
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,820
or something roughly like them in your case,

726
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,140
to the Alpha Centaurian clients.

727
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:43,160
The only way we can fertilize Miss Alpha Centauri

728
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,940
is to send you directly to her, Dave.

729
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,520
Yeah, but I've been waiting so long, you know,

730
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,280
and you tell me once in a while

731
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,960
that I'm going to get a, maybe a little,

732
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,660
take a little look at her and stuff.

733
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,680
It's Miss Alpha Centauri.

734
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,680
But no, I never get to see her,

735
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,300
or smell her, or talk to her, nothing.

736
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,060
It's just like one of them empty promises

737
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,280
you keep making to me.

738
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,460
And now the cockroaches and the bugs

739
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,080
and the Madagascar roaches

740
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,680
are crawling all over my body

741
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,500
and taking little...

742
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:14,120
Dave, you're not going to turn down Miss Alpha Centauri.

743
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,140
She's the largest, loveliest fungus

744
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,340
in the whole planet.

745
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,520
Yeah.

746
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,780
She covers half of a continent.

747
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,920
Yeah, that'll be something, I guess.

748
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,540
What a babe.

749
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,260
Yeah.

750
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,400
You'll be able to wallow in it, Dave.

751
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:29,880
Yeah.

752
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,940
It'll be sex beyond your wildest dreams.

753
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:34,520
Oh, my God.

754
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,480
It won't be a human, exactly, but...

755
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,400
Oh, no, yes, I...

756
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,600
But think of, it's one small squirt for a man,

757
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,120
one gigantic leap for...

758
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:45,800
Yeah, yeah.

759
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,320
...the human race itself.

760
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,480
Just like aliens.

761
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,320
Well, it's make my pie.

762
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,920
We got to get them genes going around the universe.

763
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,920
If I enforce a cave, a little...

764
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,320
a little small virus

765
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,580
or perhaps one of them huge funguses,

766
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,720
it'll make a better world for all of us

767
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,360
because the church done told me so.

768
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,940
And I've been a believer for nine on...

769
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,660
seven, eight, nine, ten years now.

770
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,840
I've made my compact.

771
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,560
I'm going to go through with it.

772
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,520
I'm happy now.

773
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,780
And you're a good believer, Dave.

774
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,640
You did just what Bob wanted you to do.

775
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,300
You signed.

776
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:17,800
Oh, yes, Dave.

777
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,220
You believed.

778
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,260
I believe.

779
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,660
He sold it, you smoked it, that settled it.

780
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,400
I'll smoke it and die.

781
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,160
You signed on the dotted line.

782
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:27,360
What am I talking about? I'm going crazy!

783
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:30,440
The line where you wrote the check, Dave.

784
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,240
You wrote the check.

785
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:36,640
No one else signed that check, Dave.

786
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,200
Written in blood.

787
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:45,880
A contract written in blood.

788
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:56,680
A contract written in blood.

789
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,920
A contract written in blood.

790
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,100
My own personal doom.

791
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:10,540
One hot July morning, only three years from today,

792
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,640
most of the world will be asleep,

793
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:18,460
except for a few milkmen and a few milkwomen.

794
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:18,460


795
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:18,460


796
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:18,460


797
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,460
The first of the first airline pilots.

798
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,720
Seven o'clock a.m., July 5th, 1998.

799
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:28,800
And Bob Dobbs wakes up.

800
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:31,300
His alarm clock was set at seven o'clock.

801
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,380
He rolls over and thinks to himself,

802
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,740
now what was it I was supposed to get up for this morning?

803
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,080
Oh well, I can't remember.

804
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,180
Will you let Bob roll over and go back to sleep, my friend?

805
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:54,860
Will you, like Dave, sign over your soul for safekeeping to that,

806
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,380
that man with the pipe, huh?

807
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,540
Yes, that smiling, that man you can trust.

808
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:07,820
That big old brother of yours, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

809
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:12,320
Or will your application be denied?

810
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,320
Did you bounce a check on Bob, friends?

811
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,380
Will you be bounced back?

812
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,760
Will you be back from the force field

813
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,340
as you try to walk up that entrance ramp onto the sex,

814
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:29,520
uh, the escape vessels of the sex goddesses from Planet X?

815
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:34,460
Dear friends, will that be you left behind?

816
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:39,560
Or will that be you jumping on board the spaceship like Dave did

817
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:44,800
to spend an eternity of pleasure being entertained

818
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,240
by pre-programmed units just like you are now?

819
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:48,620
Dave?

820
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:55,060
And just as we are by watching you flip out trapped in this little space capsule.

821
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,660
You fool!

822
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,080
It's the end of the world!

823
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,520
You fool!

824
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,000
The world ends tomorrow and you may die!

825
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,380
The world ends tomorrow and you may die.

826
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:13,040
But you notice that on the other hand you may not.

827
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,200
You can buy your way into heaven, Dave.

828
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:20,620
Or maybe you're kept in a personal stage of convocation and pain and suffering, too.

829
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,620
Well, sure, that's part of it.

830
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:23,840
Yeah, okay.

831
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:26,140
It's the heavenly pain and suffering.

832
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,320
It's a headache that lasts all year.

833
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:30,340
It's an itch you can't scratch.

834
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,440
But it keeps you going, you know.

835
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,960
Of course, that's the Christian heaven we're talking about.

836
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:42,060
If it was the big party you wanted to,

837
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,360
the giant space orgy,

838
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,960
oh, that's the subgenius hell.

839
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:50,140
But that's for the $40 members, Dave,

840
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,680
not you mere $30 subscribers.

841
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:55,900
Oh, speaking of $30 subscribers,

842
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,160
don't we need to let all the radio listeners know

843
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:03,800
about the church devival that's happening Saturday night?

844
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,940
Saturday night at 8.30?

845
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,220
At 8.30 at Peabody's Down Under in the flats.

846
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,660
At Peabody's Down Under the flattenings?

847
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,840
We'll be flattening the...

848
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,660
craniums of the audience.

849
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,080
The pew packers, actually, is what it is.

850
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,900
It's gonna be a combination of a bunch of, you know,

851
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,300
kids all dressed in black with hooks hanging out of their noses,

852
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,540
tattoos and so forth,

853
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,780
and the subgenius worshippers.

854
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:30,140
Primitive.

855
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,640
Come to hear Indian rope burn.

856
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,800
Burn away the hate.

857
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,120
Burn away the radiation.

858
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:37,420
Burn away the fire.

859
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,320
Yes.

860
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,680
And to see the circus apocalypse,

861
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,340
the freak show of the 90s,

862
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,160
as they...

863
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:44,880
like Dave,

864
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:49,340
eat the cockroaches and drive screwdrivers into their nostrils.

865
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:49,720
Mmm.

866
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,780
They really do that, folks.

867
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:54,400
You can watch self-mutilation.

868
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:55,120
No blood.

869
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,820
Well, there's a little blood,

870
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:00,020
but there's a great funny pattern that goes with it, you see.

871
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,480
It's not just self-mutilation.

872
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,860
It's not one of these geek shows.

873
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,060
It's a full vaudeville.

874
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:07,640
It's like...

875
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:11,680
That's what a subgenius revival is at Peabody's on Saturday night.

876
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:14,080
It's a return to the good old days.

877
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,120
It's a vaudeville.

878
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,120
And bloodletting.

879
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,240
And bloodletting.

880
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:18,780
And the bear baiting.

881
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,480
And nailing the cat to the post and beating it to death with your head.

882
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,340
Friends, we're trying to get back to the good old family values of entertainment,

883
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,560
where when you went to a show, you didn't just see a band.

884
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:35,180
You know, you got to see the band, the travelogue, the cartoons ahead of time.

885
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:35,360
That's right.

886
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:40,560
The comedian, you know, the bad comic that comes out, the strip show, you know, the...

887
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:44,060
And, of course, the guys that bite the heads off the lifeguards.

888
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:44,060


889
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:44,460
The chickens.

890
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:44,760
Yes.

891
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:51,060
Which, since this is a sub-special subgenius revival, there will be snake handling, chicken

892
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:58,040
head biting, rock and roll music, short-duration mass marriages.

893
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:05,720
We will marry everyone, literally every single living being from the amoeba on up will be

894
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:11,120
married to each other and will be forced to consummate said unholy marriages.

895
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:12,920
Saturday night.

896
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,380
At Peabody's Down Under.

897
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:17,720
The great subgenius revival.

898
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:26,560
Where lonesome cowboy Dave and Chaz and the great Einstein secret orchestra will no longer

899
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,280
be secret.

900
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,040
Yes, we'll climax the show in some horrible way.

901
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,760
We'll have the bucket of pills, friends.

902
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:35,300
The fabled bucket of pills.

903
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,500
Of course, you're floating in a sea of pills all the time.

904
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:40,740
You just don't know it because you're too blind and deaf.

905
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,220
Your tongue is too...

906
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:42,740
Too...

907
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:43,120
Too...

908
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:48,140
Covered with fungus to be able to taste the pills that Bob's been showering on you all

909
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:48,660
this time.

910
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:49,120
Oh yeah.

911
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:50,360
You just didn't have faith.

912
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,580
Well, if you pay your money, we'll sell you the faith.

913
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,920
This Saturday night, just be ready.

914
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,780
Have your inoculation.

915
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:03,900
You will pay to know what you want to already know you here, I forgot.

916
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:07,400
You will have paid to know what you already knew.

917
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:08,500
You will have paid to know what you already knew.

918
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,680
What you wanted.

919
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,740
But it will be justified for once.

920
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:12,560
We'll...

921
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,160
We'll pay to know what you already knew.

922
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,200
Because that's what we're doing, friends.

923
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,740
We're just trying to give you an excuse.

924
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:21,160
As of this moment, you can do anything you feel like doing.

925
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,020
Go ahead.

926
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,000
Just try it.

927
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:25,620
Um...

928
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,680
Hey, can I hear a praise Bob out there?

929
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:31,640
A proper praise Bob?

930
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:32,280
Let me hear one.

931
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:33,780
Praise Bob!

932
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,820
God, come on, do it like I'd sound off like you got a pair, damn it.

933
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,440
Praise Bob!

934
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:41,400
Praise Bob!

935
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:42,540
Praise Bob!

936
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:42,540


937
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:42,540


938
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:42,540


939
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:42,540


940
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:42,540


941
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:42,540


942
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:42,540


943
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:42,540


944
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:42,540


945
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:42,540


946
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:42,540


947
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:42,540


948
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,080
Do a overly fancy solo.

949
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:50,080


950
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:50,080


951
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:09,540
Fine....

952
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:10,980
Fine...

953
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:24,600
larger and one pipe makes you small and the ones that the con gives you don't do anything at all

954
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:31,320
go ask Ivan how to get your slack

955
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:42,880
and if you go chasing saucers and you know you're yet a scent

956
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:52,160
tell him a throb smoking salesman has excused all your sins

957
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:58,900
call Ivan and get the slack you lack

958
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:00,540
you

959
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:10,000
when droids on the TV get up and tell you what to think

960
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:18,900
and you've just had some kind of transpire and your world is turning pink

961
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,660
go ask Ivan

962
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,800
and he'll think

963
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:30,780
that you can

964
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,860
find salvation

965
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:37,860
anywhere you want to look

966
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:42,360
pull over your own eyes

967
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:46,440
and get it from his poor

968
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,220
remember

969
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:53,260
to justify your sins

970
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:58,000
and send cash in

971
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,300
just send cash in

972
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,680
just send cash in

973
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:11,580
oh yes

974
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,220
dear friends

975
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:15,500
and now Phoebe and her dancing poodles

976
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,660
Oh No! I'm sorry

977
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,260
and Dr. Dinosaur

978
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,640
ready brothers and sisters I greet you

979
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,320
there's going to be plenty of music

980
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,420
and partying here tonight

981
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:29,840
but there's also going to be some church

982
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,240
and I'm here to bring some of that too

983
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,900
I'm here to ask you a question.

984
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,780
What kind of personal savior do you want?

985
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:42,180
You want something exciting and a deified being?

986
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:47,920
Or do you want a completely predetermined cosmology with stable and sedentary gods hanging off of it

987
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,740
like apples still stuck to the tree in January?

988
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,840
Are you looking to get carried away on that sweet chariot

989
00:54:54,840 --> 00:55:00,240
or are you afraid there's not going to be a difference between it and the boxcars that are unloading at the Eternal Concentration Camp?

990
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:04,620
Will you settle for a holy order of the tall order?

991
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:10,600
Or are you hankering for a chance to put in a few licks yourself in the timeless struggle between good and evil?

992
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:18,860
Well, unless you're ready to let your soul roll over and die before it's even had a chance to prove itself on the field of holy battle,

993
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,220
it seems to me that you might want to think about making a choice.

994
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,020
Are you going to throw in with the likes of Satan when you already know

995
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:29,860
you know from the book he loses in the end?

996
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:31,940
That's not a good thing.

997
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:36,260
Look, we may pull the wool over our own eyes, but that doesn't mean we're stupid.

998
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,560
We may go in for the underdog,

999
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:44,160
but we don't place no bets after the card's been shown.

1000
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,820
And even though he wins just before the credits roll,

1001
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:51,420
credits with only his name on them, by the way,

1002
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,200
are you going to throw in with the likes of Yahweh?

1003
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:55,160
Yahweh?

1004
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:55,400


1005
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,600
Look, everybody likes to win,

1006
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,040
but only after they get to play the game.

1007
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:03,560
You can turn a buck betting on a sure thing,

1008
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:04,700
but where's the slack in that?

1009
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,620
Now, we got the fightin' Jesus,

1010
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:12,640
that hardcore three-nailed money-changer ass-kicking R.M.A.C. rowdy,

1011
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,600
and it's fun for a while.

1012
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:17,380
But he ends up selling your account to Yahweh,

1013
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:20,760
and you still get shortchanged in the action and thrills you crave in a belief system.

1014
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,760
Well, kids, I think you know what the answer is,

1015
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:28,100
and that answer is the ever-whitening smoke ring around J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1016
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:31,720
Yes, only Dobbs, among the modern mythological madmen,

1017
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:34,840
represents the uncertainty, the dramatic tension,

1018
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:38,040
the screaming, scary monster movie mayhem

1019
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,000
that you crave in a belief system.

1020
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,640
Now, where do the big spenders, the high rollers, make their money?

1021
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:48,320
They toss their bankrolls into IRAs?

1022
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:50,480
Hell no!

1023
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,140
They risk it, and they play the market.

1024
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:56,180
Right.

1025
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,080
That's the kind of saving you can do.

1026
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,100
That's what the savior Bob is, friends.

1027
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:01,020
Bob is the Wall Street savior.

1028
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,020
We may know the saucers are coming,

1029
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,460
but we don't know what the outcome will be.

1030
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:10,340
We know Bob can cut deals with the human governments and overlords and Illuminati

1031
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:12,080
and rake in the cash from that,

1032
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:15,700
but we don't know yet whether he'll be able to close the deal

1033
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:19,580
that will keep the excess from just plowing us all under as a bad crop.

1034
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:22,880
We don't know if we'll ride the saucers

1035
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,180
or if we'll be fertilizer

1036
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:28,200
to start over elsewhere.

1037
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:32,320
If you want true adventure in your eternal future,

1038
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,900
if you want some havoc with your heaven,

1039
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:38,840
if you can stand a little mystification in your destiny,

1040
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:41,200
there's only one personal savior for you,

1041
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,540
and that is J.R. Bob Dobbs!

1042
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:44,580
Praise Bob!

1043
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,340
Praise Bob!

1044
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,060
Praise his pipe!

1045
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,220
Thank you, and on with the show!

1046
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:56,160
Ah, yes, dear friend.

1047
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:59,740
The good Dr. Dinosaur.

1048
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:04,340
The old silverback of the subgenius internet.

1049
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,300
Yes, Dr. Dinosaur there, ranting.

1050
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:14,200
A fine, fine rant there at the Cleveland D-Bible at Peabody,

1051
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:17,040
sponsored by, of course, Steve Bevilacqua

1052
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,460
and the Flying Lemur bookstore.

1053
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,440
May it rest in peace.

1054
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:25,760
And, uh, Elwood, before that, that lovely song,

1055
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,840
by Mistress Selina.

1056
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,640
Actually, I can't remember her exact title,

1057
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:33,460
but, uh, that song, Go Ask Ivan,

1058
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:36,760
uh, is by, uh, Mistress Selina,

1059
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,040
or Pope S. Selina, or whatever.

1060
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:40,680
Shucks.

1061
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:43,740
Um, anyway, Dr. Dinosaur brought that tape.

1062
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,600
And, yes, friends, you must indeed do what he said,

1063
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:49,780
and, uh, accept that, uh,

1064
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:51,880
well, these are nonprofit radio stations,

1065
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,960
and so you can get the subgenius materials

1066
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,740
that you want to know, uh,

1067
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,640
about in more detail for free.

1068
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,420
Yes, for free.

1069
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,060
And I'm going to give you that post office box number

1070
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:04,520
to write to for...

1071
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,940
Just drop us a self-addressed stamped envelope.

1072
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,140
That's the easiest thing for us.

1073
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:12,120
And, uh, send that to...

1074
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,180
Bob.

1075
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:23,500
Just write Bob on that envelope at P.O. Box 140306.

1076
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,740
That's Box 140306.

1077
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:29,920
In lovely Dallas, Texas.

1078
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,740
That's right, Dallas.

1079
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:36,620
75214.

1080
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:40,220
Or, uh, the, uh, subgenius official website

1081
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:49,460
at http://sunsight.unc.edu/.subgenius.

1082
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,320
Or, for those of you tape recording,

1083
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:55,120
you can send email to idotstang at metronet.com.

1084
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:55,740
And this is Bob.

1085
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:55,740


1086
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:55,740


1087
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:55,740


1088
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:55,740


1089
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,540
It's true.

1090
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:00,400
It's all true what they said about...

1091
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,180
B-B-B-Bob.

1092
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:08,680
It is the ultimate get-rich-quick scheme for somebody.

1093
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,240
Make a lot of money.

1094
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:25,100
Get off your butt.

1095
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:26,080
Crazy man.

1096
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,240
What is your priority, my friend?

1097
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:46,860
Get paid, look...

1098
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:01,740
You do have two choice right now, my friend.

1099
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,460
Number one is do nothing.

1100
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:08,400
Stay home.

1101
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,500
Do what most people do.

1102
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:12,600
And five years later, you'll be lucky if you have a job.

1103
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,540
Or number two, you can come to my seminar.

1104
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:18,940
Learn the secret of how other people are making millions.

1105
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,240
So someday you can become financially independent yourself.

1106
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:26,820
Come to my seminar.

1107
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,880
Get out of my way. I make it somehow.
