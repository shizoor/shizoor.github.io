There's something school you want here.
Welcome, dear friends, to the subgenius hour of slack.
All right, boys, we're sitting in the 나� эту and we'll make sure you enjoy Leggo Slug Talk byHerBuddhichilla!
We'll —
Loser's strays!
I'm gonna NPC stand up and start a war!



Uuhm....
Well, well, well.
I don't know if I should be preaching slack to you these days, my friend.
These short, short days.
Because, hell, I ain't had much slack.
I don't know if I'm a good example of a subgenius preacher.
That hammer ain't quit.
I've got two more hours to do three hours worth of radio show.
Busy, busy, busy we have been here, dear friends.
And, you know, that ain't right.
Ain't right at all.
I mean, this is a church dedicated to total wallowing in sheer slackdomness.
And it's just been wallowing in dumbness.
Or actually making up for the dumbness of the others.
Man.
Ain't just ain't no slack in this world.
That's what that old young coot used to say to me back in the day.
That's when I first heard the word slack.
Didn't know what it meant until Phyla Drummond told me about Bob.
That's Bob on the little flute in the background.
This is a very rare recording.
I don't know who's on the sitar.
Anyway.
But.
But.
I must say, when we get busy around here, we get a lot done.
You ought to see the subgenius web site.
Or you amateurs may call it a home page.
On the internet.
Of course, you're sitting there going, well, if I had a damn computer, I wouldn't be listening to the radio.
Or I'd be listening to the radio over the computer.
Which you can now do.
Not too many people have taken advantage of it yet.
Because most of them are not.
Well, most of them are pink.
This show, the hour of slack.
Well, some of you may be hearing it right now.
Coming out of a computer modem.
In fact, well, I'll give you that number.
Get your pencil ready and I'll give you the number.
The URL for that thing in a minute.
But, boy, you go look at the subgenius web site.
It's got not only 5,000 pages of everything that we've ever done.
We, including hundreds of new writers.
But now it's got...
It's got videos.
Yes, you can download videos that will play on your little PC or your Macintosh or whatever you have.
Video clips.
I'm not talking about just dirty pictures or just soundtracks.
These are little videos with sound.
You can run...
You can look at Suzy the floozy preaching.
Yes.
You can see her now, boys.
Girls, you can watch Sterno or me preaching.
You can look at those of you in between.
Man and woman can look at porno claymation of Martian peen worms having at it.
And, of course, the MTV subgenius commercial.
Yes, there actually was one.
And now there is one again.
And MTV likes to think they own it.
We just put it on the Internet where anybody in the world can own it now.
Hold on just a second.
See, it didn't take but a split nanosecond for you.
I don't know.
It took about ten seconds for me.
I ran to get the address, the Internet address,
where you can listen to old hour of slack shows, okay?
And you can do it any time of the day.
And if you don't like what you're hearing,
there's a little slider bar at the bottom where you can skip ahead.
Say you don't like that Reverend Stang,
we can skip ahead to the Swingin' Love Corpses or whatnot.
Anyway, I'm going to do this quick because I know most of you aren't that high tech.
But for those who are, whoa, where is this?
Friends, my music mixing, it's just I have trouble with it now.
It's the equipment around here.
Okay, anyway, here it is.
It's http://.
That's the way all website addresses start.
www.upx.net.
That's www.upx.net.
U-P-X-net.
Little periods in between.
Slash subgenradio.
S-U-B-G-E-N-R-A-D-I-O.
Subgenradio.
Slash subgen.htm.
I know that sounds like a bunch of ridiculous code.
That very last thing, again, was not subgenradio.
The very last thing was subgen.htm.
That may sound...
Some of y'all cave people like a bunch of gibberish,
but those of us who look at it would go,
oh, that's the UPX website, and it's their subgenius radio series,
and it uses a program called iWave to compress and spew out that sound in real time,
and it's not like those other ones, man.
This is more advanced than the ones you may have heard.
Sure, you can hear those pink stations over real audio.
It sounds like a bunch of guys gargling,
and the music doesn't sound like anything.
On what we're using...
It sounds great.
And the videos on the subgenius website
at sunsight.onk.edu slash subgenius
sound real good, too, and look real good.
So anyway, there's that.
And I'm going to get back...
We're going to get into some serious tapery in a minute here.
I must mention that by the time you hear this,
I'm going to be in the middle of the GWAR tour.
I'm touring.
I'm hoping...
Yes, your host, Reverend Ivan Stang,
will be running around with a bunch...
a bunch of guys in monster suits at nightclubs
night after night after night
from October 27th to November 5th,
and then later in November again.
The date's real quick here,
and you'll just have to watch your paper for where it is.
Opening for GWAR, Subgenius Devivals,
and wonderful GWAR show,
October 27th, Cleveland,
28th, Detroit,
30th, Milwaukee,
31st, Chicago, dear friends.
That ought to be a biggie.
November 1st, Cincinnati,
2nd, Columbus,
3rd, St. Louis,
4th, Lawrence, Kansas,
and November 5th, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Then later on, well, you'll hear about these later,
Lubbock, Tulsa, Dallas, those ones I'm going to be on.
GWAR's going to be all over the West Coast,
but that's a moot point because no one on the West Coast
listens to this show, plays this show,
except through computers.
You see?
Now, do you start to see why,
I mean, you can listen to this show now in Australia,
in Antarctica,
and all you need is a simple little old home PC,
nothing fancy,
and a modem, doesn't have to be a fancy modem.
Well, enough of that stuff.
You know,
you know, I've actually gotten letters from people going,
well, I'm not going to mess with that internet
because that's just more high-tech conspiracy techno boredom.
Well, that may be true, friend,
but there's only three people now
publishing all books, radio, movies, CDs,
and videotapes, and nobody controls the internet.
So guess where you're going to find
the church of the subgenius for the most part, dear friend.
So, anyway, and I'm, but,
yeah, let me just quit for a second here.
Oh, yes, right now we subgeniuses have to stick
to pretty mundane sex acts like snake.
It's not so bad if you pull the teeth.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, and then there's that other sex act
that involves the carcass of a pig
and the motorized half of a rotisserie.
But only men can do that one.
But it doesn't matter what sex you are.
You can always find something to do with that snake.
For you women folk,
you get that nice squirm.
And for the men folk,
oh, yeah, that snake will swallow you down to the...
Sure, they eventually suffocate and choke,
but their death twitch is just what really gets
you off.
Oh, yeah.
Now, there are a lot of people out in the audience tonight
who are probably saying, that's cruel.
That's really cruel.
Oh, how could they do something that mean to an animal?
This world is here to be exploited by subgeniuses.
Oh, no, the snakes after 1998 will have
a communal intelligence.
Oh, yes.
Yes, and they shall be gigantic snakes.
And you shall be the rat.
Oh, yes.
And there's not much time remaining either.
Not much time remaining.
There's almost...
There's less than three years until July 5th, 1998.
Two years and 11 months.
Today!
Today, on the anniversary of the atomic age.
Oh, yes.
Hiroshima in a spray can.
Time is running out, brothers.
Time is running out.
You hear it?
Well, it's ticking.
Time is ticking away.
Three years.
Three years left.
Two years, 11 months, a couple hours.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
But soon, with each tick, you are one tick closer to death.
One tick closer to July 5th, 1998 at 7 a.m.
Time is running out.
Time is running out.
Oh, yes, brothers and sisters.
However, eventually,
eventually,
eventually, time will just tick, tick, tick away.
And soon, when you least expect it,
when you're getting up to go to work,
you're going to walk outside your house.
There shall be naught but devastation.
But if you have your subgenius membership card,
well then, brothers and sisters,
if you've got that subgenius membership card,
you're going to be able to get out of the house.


And Dr. Legume then smashes,
takes a huge sledgehammer, an actual sledgehammer,
and smashes the living daylights out of that great big alarm clock he had on there.
And you know, the sad, sad thing is that time did run out for Dr. Legume.
Except, you know, I've been thinking about it.
I don't know if you heard the show last week.
Let me pull these little pots down just a bit.
So I can yell.
I have to mix these things myself, man.
I do all this stuff on the fly.
Sitting here all by myself in my room like that crazy militia radio guy.
Yeah, well, last week we announced that Dr. Katahdin Legume,
who you just heard in a horribly chopped up rant,
you know, and that's the sad thing about the conspiracy
trying to apply their rules to our radio shows.
I have to...
I have to destroy Dr. Legume's rants in order to play him because he cusses so much.
And the cussing is a big part of it.
I'm sorry.
That's just the way it goes.
But, you know, we got this letter after Legume died on the internet.
It said,
Hey, you crybabies, why don't you quit whining about Legume?
Y'all talk like he was Bob or something.
He wasn't all that hot of a preacher anyway.
Most of you are so namby-pamby that even a second-rate performing artist like Legume looks,
you know, like,
good to you.
You all should stop sending your money to his stupid family and go buy yourselves a life.
I'd rather see Reverend Stang anyway.
Now, there's a preacher.
He knows not to cross the line.
Well, I took that as an insult.
And to tell the truth, friends,
after giving it a certain amount of thought, I've changed my mind.
I'm glad Legume bought it.
He was nothing but bad news, really, to tell the truth.
I mean, the world...
The world's gonna be a much better place without him.
He was a basic.
Basically.
Evil man.
His heart was not really so much in slack, but in torture.
And he smelled bad.
He probably smells better now than he did while he was alive.
Did I ever mention his looks?
He's a great big ugly guy.
His face was like an infant's, blasphemously stuck onto this freakish mutated body.
And, well, his rants were kinda long.
I just about fell asleep during that last one.
You know, at first I thought he had some kind of potential.
You know, at first I thought he had some kind of potential.
As an idiot savant.
But I learned too late that he was faking even that.
You know, thank God I didn't send any money to his sister.
What I should do is send her one of those little plastic toy boxes that makes a laughing sound when you jostle it.
I mean, he was a jerk, friends.
He was a bully.
He was a big fat guy that could intimidate little skinny B-spectacle nerds.
And that's pretty much his claim to fame.
I'm ashamed of myself for my knee-jerk, sad reaction to his death.
If he was a true subject of the world, I would have been a little more upset.
If it was a true subject of the world, I would have been a little more upset.
If it were a true subject of the world, I would have been a little more upset.
I mean this whole deal is screwy.
I can't believe how he blubbered over this jerk who was just a slack vampire to begin with.
I, for one, have had enough of it!
If there is still a body, I'd say dig it up and abuse it!
But he's been rendered into an ash tray-like essence and that's kind of what he was in real life.
Snorting his ashes would be a good idea, except that I happen to know that he was carrying a stick instead.
and several diseases that would have killed him
and anyone who shared a prop stick with him within a year.
I promise.
You think I'm kidding?
You think this is just one of those silly bulldada statements
in deliberate bad taste?
I'm serious.
He was bad seed, my friends.
The very thought of his nasty gray matter
spread like jelly on I-95 in Pennsylvania
gives me a regular arousal.
I've touched myself to the mental picture
of his thick skull hitting the pavement hard enough
for even it to be squashed like an eggshell.
That's the fate of sinners.
I hope he wasn't killed instantly.
I hope he laid there on the asphalt
under some seamy streetlight
feeling pain and panic
as it finally sunk in that he had screwed up big time.
I hope, friends, that in the last few seconds
before his death,
the candle went out,
that he got to see that anonymous drunk driver
lurch over to him and spit on him.
I hope he laid there thinking,
oh God, oh God,
this is worse than being crippled for life.
I think I'm really gonna die.
I only wish that drunk driver
had had all of Legume's girlfriends there to have
right in front of his eyes
as the light left his shattered brain.
I would love to have seen the look on Legume's face
while he gazed through an almost distant,
disconnected eyeball at his own other eyeball
laying there in a pool of blood
in the forepart of his own brain.
I hope he felt the last threads of life
flitting irrevocably away
and knew just what it meant.
Okay?
Okay?
Well, I posted that little sentiment.
You may think I sound a little bit bitter.
That's not it at all.
I posted that sentiment,
out on the internet,
and people got real upset.
Pastor X here said,
isn't it a little too soon to be starting
with the sick joke stang?
I mean, I wouldn't expect you to have this kind of attitude
about Dr. Legume's death.
He's not even a cool vapor in the atmosphere yet,
and yet you're mocking him already.
I know that Dr. Legume spoke very highly of you.
He thought you were a fine preacher back in those days.
I'm sure you,
I'm sure you thought that.
I'm sure you thought you were.
He told me about your struggle with recurring syphilis,
it was herpes, friends,
and those nightmares from your days at Diebenwald.
He said you were the only Jew on earth worth a puddle,
and he would tolerate no bad talk of you.
You badmouth his memory,
but the life he lost on that cursed highway,
he would gladly have sacrificed to protect you.
Yeah, right.
He always had a soft spot for the small and sickly.
He told me about the Atlanta revival,
how he carried you to your hotel room
when you're gnarled,
polio-ridden legs gave out after 10 minutes of trying to preach.
Yeah, well, he goes,
I figured that losing as good a friend of the church that Legume was,
you'd be moping around humming that old Roy Acuff tune.
Okay.
I heard the crash on the highway,
but I didn't hear nobody pray.
There, how's that?
Yeah.
I'll tell you what, friends.
The final spasm,
the last spasm,
are the best.
You know, it's a good thing that some of you people aren't running this church.
One dead guy, a case of butt cancer,
and a missing radio show,
and you cave in.
Hey, Grockett dude,
if any subgenius ever displays even the slightest signs of abject horror,
depression, and overwork-induced stress,
it only means that that's what Bob required.
If Legume buys the big one,
it's because Dobbs said so.
If the subgenius foundation is shut down by the Attorney General of Texas,
well, that just indicates that Dobbs didn't care if anything bad happens.
It was within his slack.
So...
As Dr. Dinosaur said,
Jerry Garcia is dead.
Katahdin Legume is dead.
Therefore,
Jerry Garcia
is
Katahdin Legume.
Uh, yep, I'm dead too.
Some drunk hit me in a truck while I was driving home.
It slowed me down a bit, but I'm going to, you know, go out again.
I'll tell you what really happened.
Dr. Legume was sitting on the toilet, when all of a sudden, he slipped off.
He fell out the window, and dropped 36 stories down into a manhole.
He was found the next day in the sewer, with a rat in his mouth.
He apparently lost it.

suffered from rat poisoning.
Yep.
I'll tell you, we could sit around and mope about old Dr. Le Guin
being cold in the grave.
But we're not.
Actually, we're going to have a wake.
By the time you hear this, the wake will have already happened.
Yes, a wake.
Hear that?
A wake.
A wake.
A wake.
A wake.
A wake.
A wake.
A wake.
Yeah, we're going to summon them.
We're going to summon them up.
We're going to get you, man.
You think that Gwar stuff is scary.
You think that Bob stuff is scary.
You think a hundred legions of dead legume skeletons
all eight feet tall and smelling to high heaven is bad.
You don't know what bad is.
You don't know what bad is.
Well, you think the shit...
The show is bad.
Fine.
Fine.
This show has an off button, my friend.
There are things in this world, in this universe,
that have no off button.
And I hope you...
I wish you the best of luck finding it
when you find yourself in that show.
Yes, that show that will not die.
And they just about killed this show.
I just about killed this show.
From getting so dang distracted.
They've been hammering on me.
But...
And I really do have to whip a bunch of material out
in the next couple hours.
Because then I've got to leave.
Actually, I've got to leave right now.
Pick up my daughter.
Well, luckily, while I was being hammered on the last trip,
we recorded quite a bit of material
at Susie the Floozy and Dr. Nolan Void's
Bob Slack Talk.
And I'm going to be doing a full-time fun house radio show
in Atlanta, in this case,
with, yes, Dr. Legume,
but mostly Jane or Hyperclete
and Father Joe Mama.
We've got that radio stuff coming up.
And also, I sat in on a nice, long
Einstein Secret Orchestra radio syndrome
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chaz.
And because of that,
I hopefully can just whip out
a whole bunch of old tapes.
Thank you.
Hey, wait a minute.
You guys, listen.
Lanson has said he's creature.
Oh.
Oh, my goodness.
Just like the old man in the show.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
That's the old man in the mountain.
Too bad the listeners can't see
some of the more adult portions of tonight's show.
Yes, I was just trading my pet
brine shrimp sea monkeys this morning
to go leaping through hoops.
They keep me very happy.
Why, life was so plain
without my brine shrimp sea monkeys,
who love me.
They love to be watched.
I like to watch them with my x-ray specs.
They can be traded many stunts.
Mine know several different positions.
I do brine shrimp sea monkey porno movies.
I have several very good brine shrimp actors.
They look just like the ones in the comic books.
They have little human faces,
and they just walk along.
I have a brine shrimp sea monkey
that looks just like Seika.
I have a dad and a mom sea monkey
and a little boy sea monkey.
I feel kind of guilty because one of my friends,
my star porno brine shrimp,
was actually under 18 years of age.
That's the Tracy Lord's brine shrimp sea monkey.
So all the porno films that we did
featuring that brine shrimp sea monkey are illegal.
They must be destroyed.
Not just taken out of distribution,
but destroyed.
Well, they were destroyed,
but only because I...
All the relatives of that brine shrimp.
That's because the maid came in
and didn't know that they were my brine shrimp sea monkeys.
Oh, you're referring to the films.
No, all of the brine shrimp sea monkeys.
All who are related to the Tracy Lord's...
Well, they were destroyed,
but fortunately a new batch has been hatched.
The public must be protected.
Thank you, Pappy.
You know, it sounds like Reverend Legume
is still inhaling that church air
that we hear so much about.
The public must be protected from this filth.
This is destroying our great country.
This is going to drive America
into a sea of fetid bodily fluids.
I'm going to sue...
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!

















I'm going to sue Honor House.
...pervert subgeniuses.
Praise the fetidness.
I'm suing Honor House for the cancer of the eyes
from using the x-ray sunglasses too much
and getting the cardiacs and cataracts
and cadillacs on my eyeballs.
I know it's related.
...insane being able to see other people's thoughts.
Just close your eyes and it'll be okay.
I went to shake the hand of the president
and realized that he was a mass murderer.
I had to kill him for the good of the public.
It looks like the thought has been thrown down the stairs.
There are cuts and bruises all over her face.
It looks like there are cigarette burns
on her breasts and near her thighs.
It's a good thing I came along to help her.
I think you are laboring under misapprehension.
You sick bastard.
Do you have the letters of transit?
I'm searching her...
You poor delinquent.
...soul.
I'm seeking a certain blackbird.
I represent a certain moneyed interest
who would be very...
...is very interested in obtaining the blackbird.
How many people could have been helped
if you had only used your maniacal, sinister brilliance for good?
If only they had allowed me to finish my experiments in peace.
But they had to know what their prying minds...
They had to know just who I am.
And what I am.
Well, I'll show them.
I'll show them all.
They laughed at my face.
They did not realize that the information that I was ascertaining was actually worth
the forfeiture of few human lives.
But one is always considered to be mad when one is perfect at something that others cannot

Quip them.
Quip them.
To make them understand.
We must burn the intolerance out of them.
With them good.
One is always considered to be mad when one is perfect at something that others cannot
understand.
Fela Lugosi brought it from Montemarie, produced and written by Ed Wood Jr.
But they have to understand that the blackbird is a monster.




They laughed at me.
No.
Nice.
Nice.
Janeer.
Does it hurt?
Yes.
But not enough to kill.
Like Bob said, it is better to...
They laughed at my face.
But then I...
Thank you.
Thank you.
That is why I got this...
Thank you, Susie.
That is why I got this lead mask.
200 pound mask to hide my face from the world.
But they...
They laughed at my mask.
I had to...
They laughed at my mask.
The horrifying new film.
The spine tingling horror of They Laughed at My Mask.
With brilliant acting directing by Ed Wood Jr.
The Mask of Sanity.
Starring Criswell.
I predict in the year 1993 that human beings will be cannibals and half of the race will
eat the other half.
I predict in the year 1994 that humanity will be overpopulated.
It will drive itself into the sea.
I predict in the year 1995 that all of humanity will leave this planet on flying trotters.
I predict in the year 1996 that humanity will go back to its primitive ways and reenter
the caves.
I predict that in the year 1997 Dragon Con will force people to dress like Vulcans and
Romulans and that they will be invaded by sinister outside forces which will think they are beyond
their technological means because they will see that they have been infiltrated previously
by Vulcans and Romulans.
All your stupid, stupid minds.
I predict that in the year 1998 the men from Planet X will come down to rupture up the subgeniuses
and destroy the predicable boys forever.
But why do you want to contact the leaders of Earth?
Because of death, for extermination, you must make the decision to join the army.
All subgeniuses please report that it was more important to equip the white men than
the...
It would please me to see the slave girl and her tortures.
Torture, torture, it pleasures me.
Yes, we once laughed at the horseless carriage, the airplane, radio, television, and even vitamins.
Now today some people laugh at outer space.
My friends, can you prove it didn't happen?
Can you?
We challenge each and every listener within our listening range now to prove that it didn't happen.
It can't happen here.
It can't happen here.
Just go get a TV dinner and cook it up.
Cook it up.
No, and it won't happen here.
No, no, no, no, no.
And Bob said half of nothing is better than nothing at all.
And he was right.
And on the third day Bob said, slack.
It can be sold, but it cannot be bought.
Here's another Criswell rant.
Monsters to be pitied.
Monsters to be despised.
What's human?
Well, I can't put it all together.
What's human?
Now monster, they live in the twilight period.
Monsters to be pitied.
Monsters to be despised.
A night with the ghouls.
What is it?
Come here.
I'm coming, Aladdin.
I've got two of these.
I've got two of these.
One is yours.
You got one for me?
No, I got one for you.
Did you get the Bob GT train with the Gwanda Dark Eyes from the Raven's tank?
No?
This is an invisible space maker time.
Morph V coffee maker.
or dual massage vibrator with 75 attachments and all kinds of things that you don't know.
Oh, nanotech, it's for time control. The nanoseconds go backwards?
No!
No, forget it, man. You don't want this.
No, you don't want this.
No, I took my words on mail, command.
I'm bleeding!
I took a picture of the voodoo place and now I'm bleeding.
I smell sausage.
I smell Bob.
The rich fragrance of Bob Dove.
Merring Dove.
I think I've got you.
Brad!
Brad!
Paper!
What happens when you stay?
I'm asking boys in my head.
So many miles it takes.
What happens when we perish and pass on?
Do we go to Sogina's Hell?
Or do we go to Pink Heaven?
You go to Echo Hell.
Where everything sounds like you're on drugs.
Drugs.
Drugs.
Does the soul go on and on and on like a broken record?
And on and on and on.
Eternity is a big place, Brad.
You might as well get used to it.
Been lost in eternity?
And then once you die you're more lost-er?
Well, you already have been lost in eternity for a long time, Dave.
Well, why am I lost in eternity?
I'm lost in this flabby body of all them dog-wee-fees.
Well, that's the way it goes.
I wish you would stop going.
You start going backwards.
Well, you can spit in one hand and wish in the other and see which one gets full first.
But what about my short-term personal savior Bob Dove?
Bob won't help you now.
It's too late, Dave.
You backslid.
You showed a lack of faith for half a second.
Not just one second.
No, no, no.
Play the tapes.
Show Dave what he did over and over and over and over and over again and again and again.
Uh, gee, Bob, Tom's, uh, disappointed because he's been denied.
World saving isn't exactly, uh, a holy-gallon experience.
But Jesse's death was sales.
Or something.
I dreamed I was a suffragette queen one time.
One time.
Another time I dreamed of the green demons from the shadows.
Another time.
And then I dreamed I dreamed which never must be said more than once.
And time again.
Hey.
Hey.

I'm gonna, uh, spell the fun guy or something.
I still get used to it.
Don't talk about the fungus.
Don't talk about the fungus.
Don't talk about the fungus.
It will find you.
It will find you.
If you think about it, it will find you and seek you out.
You mean just simple, in-deterior knowledge of the fungus causes it to grow on you?
Well, then we're all cooked in hell anyway.
Is it me, or does it sound kind of weird in this radio station?
It's the demons, you see.
It's the demons
It first appeared as a nauseous...
...shape of the consequence.
Then three days later, men with Gulf War masks came and degauched the entire building.
It was about that time that Kaz...
...ירчт-






disappears. Sucked right
into his own head and bones.
When the demons come,
listen.
You do as they say.
You don't.
You do as they say.
Do as the demons
say. What choice
do you have? You did
sign the application.
You've been
standing in line all
this eternity. This is what you've been
waiting for, Dave.
Aren't you going to do what
the demon voices
tell you?
It's for your own
good, Dave.
It won't hurt them.
They won't know what
hit them.
Just do what Bob
told you to do.
You remember.
I think he's more than
ever now. Could Bob be one
of them demons? Of course
Bob would have been
demons. What do you think
this is all about from the beginning?
Oh, you thought you were going to get
something for nothing,
eh?
It's like a booning ritual.
You didn't think you were going to get all those
pills for free.
You basically stated
clearly in the contract which I don't sign
in blood that all of Bob's
pills would go into me absolutely
free to do as I will
on Foolberry Hill
if I don't want to kill
him.
Take another pill, Dave,
and do what the demons
tell you.
Don't worry. They're all
working for Bob. We're all
working for
Bob.
And you look
for Bob. Here, have another
frock stick, Dave, and just
don't worry about it.
You don't have to make
decisions anymore. That's the
whole point, isn't it?
Isn't that the whole point of joining
Bob's church?
No longer having to
make those painful
decisions. No more
responsibility.
That's what I'm doing.
No more choices.
No more responsibilities.
This is the life I've been
dreaming of for a long time.
You wanted slack, didn't
you, Dave?
Sweet, sweet, sweet
slack.
And you've got slack forever
and ever and ever
as long as you do
what we tell you.
We're not going to tell you what
to do. We're only going to
tell you what to think.
I don't know what's so good about you.
I don't think it's a good idea about that.
I don't think about what I bring to begin
with.
No, just think
good thoughts, Dave.
Okay. I'm in a beautiful
field of flowers right now.
The sun is shining, but
it ain't too hot.
Yeah. And I'm putting
my feet in a cool spring of water.
And I'm just going to lay there
and piddle in my pants and stare at the clouds
going by.
Ah, that
slack.
Isn't it, Dave? Yeah.
And that can all be yours as
soon as you finish
your assignment.
I gotta
remember, yeah, I gotta remember
I like
slack. Oh, yes.
You don't need to worry about the details
of the assignment. You don't have to
worry about any of that dirty work.
We'll take care of most of that.
I was doing something there.
You'll know what to do
as soon as you hear the trigger.
Trigger phrase.
Trigger phrase?
Lick my boots.
Lick my boots.
Now you know what to do.
Lick my boots.
Lick my boots.
Lick my boots.
Lick my boots.
Hey, you know,
I got a strange sensational urge
for a hamburger. It may be
surprise and don't urge.
It's never forgetting
someday, kid.
My mind is gone.
Did you say you wanted a hang-a-burger?
Oh, here's your hang-a-burger.
Oh, precious.
You did a wonderful job
on your assignment, Dave.
Oh, that's right. You probably don't remember
doing it. You probably only remember
lying by that stream,
wetting yourself and looking at clouds
and so forth. Slack.
Well, rest assured, you did a very good
job.
You did a very good job on that
government building while
you were out, so to speak.
I wonder why I got this
receipt for first.
Why is it in my pocket?
Just get in here.
My socks smell like a morning soul flame.
Well, don't worry about that. You've earned your reward.
I'm in deserving for something
for sure now. I know I done good
because the real voice is telling me.
You can always
trust the voices.
Especially the ones with
a little echo.
Turned up on them.
They're much more impressive that way,
don't you think?
Translator turned around here.
See if I can figure out a way of
creating some new tunes.
Shona, she left.
Shona, she left me one day.
But I need Slack.
I need Slack more than I need to say.
Slack.
Slack.
Slack.
Slack.
Oh, baby, I need Slack.
Slack.
Slack.
Oh, baby,
Bob gives Slack.
Slack.
Ha!
Bob gives good Slack jobs.
For a good time, call Bob Dove.
5-9-3-6-7-0-2.
It's written on every urinal wall.
I need Slack.
I need Slack.
It's written in a darn old tenement hall.
I need Slack.
Give me some Slack, baby.
The words of the prophet are written on the tenement walls
in urine.
Slack.
Slack.
Slack.
Slack.
Slack.
Oh, I'm working in the city, Bob!
So, you got any, any bitch, like, maybe.
Slack.
Slack.

You like me?
Slack.
What?
What do I do?
Slack.
You know, there just ain't enough Slack in this world.
Hey, Bob!
Hi.
Slack.
Slack.
Slack.
Slack.
You know, the problem is we pay the conspiracy to take our money away.
I mean, that's basically what we do.
do? We pay them to take our money away, friends. That's their job. It's what they're there for.
That's what Onan said. We pay them to take our money away. They take our money away,
and not only do we pay them, we pay them at 20% interest and are happy to do it.
What has this country come to?
And that slack is available here in Cleveland, August 5th, Saturday night at Peabody's Down
Under. An amazing, incredible subgenius revival. Yes, a subgenius beach party right on the
edge of the hideous Cuyahoga River, as it once again bursts into fervor.
The river, the mayor's hair, the stage, the preachers, and the bleeding head of Arnold
Palmer, all bursting into flame. Before your very eyes, you won't believe what you see,
dear friends. You will, your money back if you don't throw up when you see the man sewing
his lips shut with piano wire.
You really actually will see a man.
And sew his lips shut with piano wire Saturday night at the subgenius diva.
I'm not going to sew my lips together with piano wire. Bob handled that quite well with
the fungus.
You boot-licking, coke-flavid, demon boy.
But those fine lads, those Boy Scouts from Circus Apocalypse, will sew their lips shut
with piano wire for your edification.
And entertainment. You won't believe your eyes. You'll crawl on your belly like a reptile.
Step right up. Free slack right here. Only a dollar. Free slack. Only one dollar.
From Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.
Or free at Peabody's Down Under.
Slack.
August 5th.
Well, not free.
Slack.
Slack.
Free pills?
Sure, pills are free.
Slack.
Slack.
The slack is free.
Slack.
The only thing you'll have to pay for is to know what you really think.
Slack.
Slack.
And then...
It's like a comet.
It sounds like a star.
I said my children and dogs sound really good.
And I hope they never come back.
You gotta slow down.
You're moving too fast.
You gotta make the morning last.
Just kick around the cobblestone.
Look for fun and feel it moving.
Look at my bob.
My special bob keychain.
And my wallet ring.
And my hand in my first year.
Fetching my first year pocketbook.
And I have one of them decals.
And I put it in my guitar case.
With a smiley face.
And I also have my little booties.
With the turned up toes.
With the little bells on them.
Much like Bob's smoking slippers.
When he does smoke.
And my little smoking jacket.
That looks so much like Bob's smoking jacket.
And he's also a trade partner.
Corporate by the church of the subdues.
Oh just tripping down the cobblestone.
I'm not slacking off.
I'm feeling groovy.
Feeling groovy.
Cause I got my slack.
I got a nigga urinating in my pants.
And fumbling and faking.
And crying in class.
I got unfelting groovy.
Unfeeling groovy.
Got no decent dude.
No promises to keep.
I'm dappled and drowsy and slack.
I'm asleep where the morning sun drops.
Balls pedal on eight.
The wife I love you always groovy.
I'm always groovy.
Bang.
Oh, it's groovy, baby.
Oh, baby.
You look so groovy to me, baby.
I'm grooving out on it.
Oh, I'm getting real groovy now.
I'm grooving.
This is my happening, and it's freaking me out.
And it's in a groove, baby.
Baby, can you groove to this?
Yeah.
I'm dropping a groove go on this logo band.
And the audio is groovy.
Feeling groovy.
OK, now I'm going to ride this thing.
Feeling groovy.
Feeling groovy.
Feeling groovy.
Feeling groovy.

dave's freaking out it's a real happening
you can be like dave
can anyone really be like dave
shut up little voice shut up
oh pretty psychedelic huh friends
that was uh taped off of wcsb cleveland on thursday night at 9 a.m which is when you hear
the lonesome cowboy
boy dave and chas and einstein secret orchestra live just about my very favorite radio show
i i'm i really must say and you know i was listening back at bat and thinking to myself
you know now that i recall the whole reason that i called steve bevilacqua up and said
hey let's do another show in cleveland do you think we could you know make enough to
pay for the plane ticket what prompted me to do that was i was just i had a big hankering
to do more recordings as you know and when you know on youtube and you know i misjudged

with Dave and Chaz and the band,
the Secret Orchestra of Einstein,
because somehow it always works.
We don't even have to write a script,
and yet we descend into a veritable tormenting hell,
an audio hell.
And I don't know about you,
but I just kind of dig doing that, you know?
Yep.
So, friends, you know,
that's it.
Just before that on side one,
we were hearing some WREK recordings
at the weekend at yours truly
and Dr. Legume, the still-living Dr. Legume,
the Papa Joe Mama,
and the St. Jane or Hyperclades,
and Reverend Microphone,
and all those people were all in the studio at once
at WREK on Bob's Slight Time Funhouse.
And, of course, for more information
on the Church of the Subgenius,
from whence these terrible
and yet oh-so-homespun and lovely,
like an old sunset over West Texas,
a real old sunset,
you can get all that stuff from,
you got that pencil-ready, friends?
From J.R. Bob Dobbs.
But just address that to Bob.
You ought to be able to handle that.
At Post Office Box,
just at P.O. Box.
See, so far, we've got a pattern set up.
B.O.B.
P.O.B.
P.O. Box 140306.
140306 that number is.
Six numbers.
In Dallas, there's six more.
Texas.
Oh, whew, I thought we were about to have 666.
75214.
Another five for you Discordians out there.
You see, we're up on the numerology
of the 23s and the 5s and all that stuff.
All that corny stuff.
You know, well, actually, it's not that corny
when you run into somebody who really is afflicted
with the 23s.
But what's truly rare are the 273s.
Yes, 273.
The holy, sacred number of the Church of the Subgenius,
far less likely to come up than 23.
And yet, when it does, boy, is it a doozy.
Last time, it was how much the Subgenius Foundation
had to pay the government,
and it was how much Reverend Ivan Stang got back.
From the government, in his personal taxes.
That's Bob at Box 14306, Dallas, Texas 75214.
Email address is i.stang at metronet.com.
And for those of you with tape recorders,
the really happening Subgenius place to go
is alt.slack, News Group, or the World Wide Web,
http://sunsight.unk.edu.

Subgenius, thank you.
Let's go back just a minute now
to hear some more of the jolly shenanigans
and wacky whacking of St. Jane or Hyperclades
and Father Joe Mama on Susie's show.
And Leguim was there too, but it was mostly those guys.
And, oh man, I love those nights.
You know, it's worth it doing the flying,
doing all the packing of goods to sell,
all the panicky last-minute stuff,
which I...
Just like I am right now.
And going to...
And working all through the revival,
setting it up, schmoozing,
talking yourself hoarse,
being polite to total strangers,
and screaming and yelling at them.
You know, that's what they pay you for.
And then...
And that's a lot of work.
It really is.
But it's worth it when you get to cooking
there at the radio station
with a fine mixing music master,
like Chaz, and a spouting buddy,
like Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
Somebody you can really torture.
And the most wonderful backup musicians,
sound effects crews, and laughers,
and princesses, and, you know, it's just...
That guitar player, man, he's really good.
I can't remember his name.
Anyway, friends, thank y'all.
He's running out of dicketeen, Fred.
Here on WREK, you heard it here first,
the beginning of the end for Jaina Hyperclete,
the man who lives in a perpetual
stasis of nervous breakdowns.
It is only through this means that we can bring you
unabridged and unadulterated Jaina Hyperclete,
here on WREK.
I've only had one nervous breakdown.
Only one? No, when I said one, I meant this week.
Take your pills, Jaina.
Jaina, take your pills.
Jaina, swallow. Swallow.
Good.
Good Jaina.
Check his mouth.
Make sure he's taking them.
Check under his tongue.
Check in his ears.
Yeah, we might have.
We might have silenced him.
It might be a subgenius.
Silence?
Silence?
We're not gonna say anything else, okay?
Let's just have silence.
If anyone else said another thing, it could be the end of the universe.
It could destroy the whole world.
It's just silence, nothing but silence.
It's a subgenius silence period.
It's the period that is the most worrisome,
because when they are silent, they are doing mischief.
Okay, let's have the silence now.
Okay, are we ready?
Is it time for the silence?
Is this the silence?
Wait, can you hear me over the silence?
I just want to check, make sure you're having it now,
so I make sure not to disturb it.
I didn't want to interrupt the silence.
Is everything okay in there?
Here.
Here.
Here's the speeding of this speediest car.
That's why it's a subgenius silence, you know,
because everyone just starts screaming as loud as they can,
because it's a subgenius silence.
It's kind of paradoxical, I guess, because they can call it a silence,
but this one guy was sounding like a redneck,
and he just kept talking on and on louder and louder.
It's, you know, like a silence, subgenius silence.
Silence.
It's a silence approved by Dobbs.
It's a subgenius silence.
Dobbs approved.
Dobbs approved.
Dobbs approved.
Silence.
It would be idiotic if he just kept repeating the word silence
while all the time speaking, even speaking the very word silence,
was breaking what he was, was shattering the context.
The concept that it was silence would create an ongoing paradox.
Silence.
We are all carrying our subgenius concealed weapons permits
where our bleeding heads are loaded and ready for action.
Now Palmer and...
They are spitting forth the dreaded droplets of slack
which only the official Palmer heads can eject like machine guns.
They even have banana clips of these projectiles that you would certainly ears.
They alternate from one nostril to another.
If they took their head back in just such a way,
they could be sent forth in the nasal cavity as well.
Now Arnold Palmer and Lee Trevino, they are both golfers.
Well, the federal government is trying to outlaw the rapid fire bleeding heads.
They feel that these are improper, that they could only be used to kill.
You cannot hunt with these.
Now I think that's what's important about the whole thing,
and I think I want the kids out in the audience to understand this too,
that they are both golfers.
And Arnold Palmer is a golfer.
Well, see, Arnold Palmer was the good golfer,
whereas Lee Trevino is more like the Tonya Harding golfer.
But it's all just a plot to distract you from the one true liver of Mickey Mantle.
And it is working.
Even while we stand here, we can watch the true liver of Mickey Mantle dissolve before our eyes.
Could you go down and pick me up a couple Palmer heads?
You know, I can't understand that.
They say that this liver was destroyed by alcohol,
and yet they take it out.
And they stick it in a jar of alcohol.
Now that, that seems to me to just be a little messed up.
I mean, what is this?
It looks like, it looks like someone cut off your daughter's arms and legs.
It is a good thing I came along to, to help her.
I thought that maybe I would put them back and sew them together.
I did, I was in such a hurry, I did not realize I had them mixed up.
Now she's left-handed, where before she was right-footed.
Your daughter seems to have a hard time dressing herself.
It looks like her dress is pulled out.
It's pulled over her head.
If you can only get dresses that were made for males,
she will get used to the fact that the zipper is now on the other side.
You are laboring on a misapprehension again.
That time has passed.
There seems to, there seems to be a stain on her blouse.
I, I've been trying to rub it off for the past 45 minutes.
The blood will not leave my hands.
I keep looking at my hands, but they bleed more.
Perhaps it is the little razor blades that have been physically implanted in my hand.
I was only trying to help.
It's a very stubborn stain.
I would like to remind you, however, that this state is protected by a good Samaritan law,
which forbids you from being able to sue me for my malpractice.
After all, my experiments were done solely to protect your young daughter.
A nice, slimy vampire lawyer can prove this in court.
It looks like someone walled your daughter, ripped your daughter into the wall.
It's a good thing I came along.
I discovered this.
The body.
It is a good thing indeed.
Why, why it looks like she was so hungry that she tried to consume herself.
Why else would she have these bite marks all up and down her back?
It looks almost as if she were clawing the bite.
I think that she was trying to, to relieve herself of the itch from underneath her fingernails.
Why else would she claw so madly at the brakes, which she could not possibly have removed from the mortar,
which was surgically implanted on the outside with sledgehammers of my special design.
