1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,060
Ah, yes, there.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,500
You see that coin?

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,440
That is insured for $10,000.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:16,100
See how it seems to gather the light and draw the eye?

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,020
Yeah.

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:26,700
I get great repose from these things of age and beauty.

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,940
They soothe one and seem to induce sleep.

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,060
Sleep.

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,920
Close your eyes, my friend.

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,060
Sleep.

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,100
Sleep.

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,260
Sleep.

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,340
Hello, everybody.

14
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,700
Look out!

15
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,600
Shut up!

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,420
Shut up!

17
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:09,760
Come in.

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,440
Shut up!

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,220
$772,000.

20
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,920
Shut up!

21
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,200
$772,000.

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,500
Shut up!

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:15,920
$341,000.

24
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,440
Shut up!

25
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:17,900
$341,000.

26
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,800
Shut your face!

27
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,300
Is that correct?

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,320
Yes, it is.

29
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,240
$61,000.

30
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,020
Thank you.

31
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,640
Shut up!

32
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,900
That will be all for the present.

33
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,080
Very good.

34
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,980
The Subgenius Powerhouse.

35
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,200
Watch.

36
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:32,580
Excellent.

37
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,480
And at the top of the show, we've got a very interesting guest to be sure.

38
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,080
Reverend Ivan Stang.

39
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,000
He's the founder of the Church of the Subgenius and the book,

40
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,660
The Subgenius Cyclopedia of Slack, the Bobliagraphon.

41
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,280
That's right.

42
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,760
Stick around.

43
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,860
You're going to say, what?

44
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,480
Of course, the question is, who's Bob?

45
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,940
Well, Bob's an interesting guy.

46
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,100
He gets high on the real thing.

47
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,280
A full tank of gas and a clean windshield.

48
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,540
All righty then.

49
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,760
First off...

50
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,880
Worried about covering the lower half of your body?

51
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,360
Here's Bob One for A1 Slack.

52
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,080
Things go better with slacks and trousers.

53
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,620
Things go better with slacks.

54
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,000
Hi, this is Bob One.

55
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,980
And I wonder how many of our go-go-now-generation-action-man-on-compass realizes

56
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,360
how important it is to keep the lower half of your body covered

57
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,140
without disguising the fact that it is indeed the lower half of your body.

58
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,680
Well, there's nothing like a pair of trim-fitting A1 slacks.

59
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,660
They're better than skirts and a lot warmer, too.

60
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,060
Thank you, Bob.

61
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:31,500
You're welcome.

62
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,620
And now, back to our movie.

63
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,080
Looks like we're going to find more and we expect it.

64
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:42,900
Bob.

65
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:44,760
Bob.

66
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,460
Bob.

67
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:47,780
Bob.

68
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,380
Bob.

69
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:49,800
Bob.

70
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:51,920
Bob.

71
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,120
Bob.

72
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:52,620
Bob.

73
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,260
Bob.

74
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,720
Bob.

75
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,000
Bob.

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,320
Bob.

77
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:54,400
Bob.

78
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:54,600
Bob.

79
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:54,600


80
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:54,660
Bob.

81
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:54,960
Bob.

82
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:54,960


83
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,040
Bob.

84
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,260
Bob.

85
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,420
Bob.

86
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,560
Bob.

87
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,620
Bob.

88
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,340
Bob.

89
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,480
Bob.

90
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:05,480


91
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:05,480


92
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:05,480


93
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:05,480


94
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:05,840
Bob.

95
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,520
Bob.

96
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,080
Bob.

97
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,000
I know who he is.

98
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,000
Fred hissed.

99
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,660
So what?

100
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,320
Said Nobby.

101
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,000
He's a raving genius.

102
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,700
He is a loony.

103
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,540
Yeah.

104
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,520
Well, they say there's a thin line between genius and madness.

105
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,800
He's fallen off it then.

106
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,260
But Terry Pratchett went first.

107
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,800
Thanks to Lee Murr for the song and intro,

108
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,120
Reverend Zontar for the ancient fire sign theater actual radio ad,

109
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,560
and Frankenstein1970 from 1959.

110
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,540
Welcome to Hour of Slack number 1143,

111
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:54,960
a Bob Renewal reintroduction to that most important thing in the world,

112
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,220
for those who might have briefly forgotten.

113
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,460
The first in a series of shows using categorized bits of the recordings

114
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:07,580
from a dozen recent Lives of Genius outreach events,

115
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,860
hither and yon, which it has taken me many days to chop up.

116
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:18,400
Besides the collage work of Noor El-Pref, Lee Murr, and yours truly, Reverend Stang,

117
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,700
we'll also be hearing from the Winter Star Devival of March 1, 2008,

118
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,080
John Hell's show on Pirate Cat Radio from last December,

119
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,420
a puzzling evidence show from Berkeley on February 22,

120
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,720
and a radio synesthesia show from WCSB Cleveland on March 9,

121
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:49,000
and a Denver, Colorado talk show excerpted from Rick Barber's show on KOA Denver,

122
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,040
and also some real radio ads from the fire sign theater, more of those,

123
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,880
prompted by Zontar.

124
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:03,040
We're hearing Bonobo's Convergence in the background, recorded live last X-Day.

125
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,140
And I think that's all.

126
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,160
Oh, Bonobo's Convergence will be at next X-Day, Drew.

127
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,260
We've been on the road a lot, friends,

128
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,680
and I've just now chopped all this audio into millions of tiny bits.

129
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,940
And also tonight, I'm working in some audio swipe from a great movie called Slipstream,

130
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,160
directed by Anthony Hopkins,

131
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,660
which makes David Lynch look like Michael Bay.

132
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,220
And we even have some new songs.

133
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,140
And next week or two, it'll be all politics on the show, friends.

134
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,480
Yes, I'm afraid so.

135
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,880
So let's bask for now in pure, untainted bobbery, at least for this week,

136
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:52,740
starting with what the curious heard as they approached the giant subgenius circus tent

137
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,540
at Winter Star 2008.

138
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,900
Last March 1st.

139
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,240
Ladies and gentlemen, step right up.

140
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,240
Welcome to the subgenius medical curiosity show.

141
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,600
It's all real, all here, all alive.

142
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,340
And it's all on the inside.

143
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,360
See the smart boy who can't keep a job.

144
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,360
See the pretty girl who can't get a date.

145
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,700
Alive and on the inside.

146
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,940
We have diseases that are spread through sexual...

147
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,400
Congress.

148
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,280
We have debates settled by fisticuffs.

149
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,700
We have people famous for being famous.

150
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,000
And they're all inside.

151
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,900
Alive, alive, alive.

152
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:40,000
See grown men and women talk to an invisible monster that lives in the sky.

153
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,580
See your own body become ever more fragile before your very eyes.

154
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,900
Feel the horror as schools turn innocent children into innocent adults.

155
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,820
Listen to shock.

156
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,580
And listen to shocking tales wherein you pay to work.

157
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,240
They're all here on the inside.

158
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,100
We have pictures of a salesman who smokes a pipe.

159
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:12,380
What other religions charge all worldly goods for what we offer at a discounted and guaranteed low rate?

160
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,280
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.

161
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,440
Read words on a cathode ray tube.

162
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,140
And attend amateur religious satire performance art.

163
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,200
Get slack.

164
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,660
And feel alive.

165
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:24,940
And feel alive.

166
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,680
On the inside.

167
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,720
On the inside.

168
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,320
On the inside.

169
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:31,320


170
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:31,320


171
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:31,320


172
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:31,320


173
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:31,320


174
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,000
I wish I could say that I wrote that.

175
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:43,980
But actually that was recorded outside a freak show by Dr. Onan Kanabite.

176
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,400
I don't think they ought to live for that one.

177
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,180
Anyway, that's what happened on this date in history.

178
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,240
Well, we're going to talk about something that you may not know about.

179
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,840
And those of you who have heard of it, you might find this most interesting indeed.

180
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,120
The Church of the Subgenius, founded in 1953.

181
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:08,360
And although its current popularity is traced to the publication of Subgenius pamphlet number one in 1979,

182
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:13,240
it's found quite a bit of acceptance, especially in underground pop cult circles,

183
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,060
embraced on college campuses, in the underground music scene, on the Internet.

184
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:24,180
And because the tenets of discordianism, the Church of the Subgenius is often described as,

185
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,800
as a syncretic offshoot of the belief.

186
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,360
However, members state that the organization developed on its own with the publication of Subgenius pamphlet number one,

187
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:38,300
also known as The World Ends Tomorrow and You May Die by Reverend Ivan Stang, who is our guest.

188
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,500
And Reverend Stang, good morning.

189
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,540
Well, I praise Rick, praise Bob, and happy birthday, Dan Quayle.

190
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,980
Dan Quayle.

191
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:54,160
It's not true, but it's alleged that, of course, you know, he was head of the space program during Daddy Boy.

192
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,940
Bush's era.

193
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,660
And there was.

194
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,220
Appropriate.

195
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,540
Yeah.

196
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:08,540
And there was, there was, there was this, this kind of this, you know, almost underground, shall we say, legend,

197
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:15,060
that Dan thought it would be a good idea to send a mission to the sun, but because it was so hot, he thought we'd do it at night.

198
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,640
There you go.

199
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,900
See, and that's my kind of guy, you know.

200
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,100
All right, Dan.

201
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,140
We always considered him a sort of an honorary subgenius.

202
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:24,140


203
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,120
Well, you.

204
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,780
Even though he never officially joined up, he somehow, he definitely was, was not a genius.

205
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,700
He certainly not.

206
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,840
So we knew that he would qualify for our august organization.

207
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,660
Indeed.

208
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,280
Tell us something about the Church of the Subgenius, and by the way, who is Bob?

209
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:52,940
J.R. Bob Dobbs is our guru and the sort of, you might say, the god of the subgeniuses and of strippers, I'm told.

210
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,540
Cool.

211
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,180
Yeah.

212
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:07,840
Bob, some of your listeners may be familiar with his face, which you see tattooed on kids and spray painted on cars and so forth.

213
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:14,380
He looks like, he looks like the 1950s version of the all-around good guy dad on sitcoms.

214
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:14,980
That's right.

215
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:21,700
And if you look at any old magazine, it'll be full of ads of these square looking happy guys with pipes.

216
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,500
They're always smoking a pipe.

217
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:23,920
Right.

218
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,060
Laying in a hammock while somebody else mows the yard.

219
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:27,680
Right.

220
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:40,120
And we, my partner and I, Dr. Philodruman and I, had noticed that the same figure popped up in all these old magazines and in old movies.

221
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,180
We thought it must be the same guy.

222
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:53,080
And at that point, Bob revealed himself to us through weird coincidences and messages and things.

223
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,260
Not too many people have actually met Bob in person and survived.

224
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,340
In other words, you cannot look upon the face of Bob.

225
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:09,720
Well, he's so lucky, I think he manages to avoid most of his followers without even trying to.

226
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,280
I'm looking at the picture of the Kababala.

227
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,880
We owe a lot to other religions.

228
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,060
It's true that we, when we were, we were born in the United States.

229
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,740
We, trying to put the, the Church of the Subgenius structure together.

230
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:34,640
We, as Bob directed us, we studied all the great religions from Zoroastrianism all the way up to Scientology.

231
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,120
And we picked all the good parts, you know.

232
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:37,860
Yeah.

233
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:43,360
When you were a kid, you'd find your dad's secret stash of paperbacks and look for the good parts.

234
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:43,880
Uh-huh.

235
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,960
That's what we did with our dad's holy books.

236
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:47,720
Nice.

237
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,220
I was always looking for my own stash of Mad Magazine, which my father would hide.

238
00:11:52,740 --> 00:12:00,580
Well, you just mentioned one of our true holy books is Mad Magazine and their great publisher, William Gaines.

239
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,120
And the great Alfred E. Newman, who is a cousin to Bob.

240
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,120
I always thought, I always thought there was a kind of a connection there.

241
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,180
Yeah, he's, well, Bob's better looking.

242
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,580
But, yeah, they are related.

243
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,660
I think Alfred E. Newman was more like the country cousin.

244
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,000
And he's a little older than Bob in real life.

245
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,540
They both are ageless figures.

246
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:36,740
Now, the, the, and by the way, I'm looking at some of the names that involve high-profile names like Paul Rubens, Pee-wee Herman, who placed a picture of Bob in every episode of Pee-wee's Playhouse.

247
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:49,780
David Byrne, Mark Motherspaugh, Penn Jillette, Penn and Teller, Robert Wilson, Robert Anton Wilson, science fiction writers Rudy Rucker, John Shirley, actor Bruce Campbell.

248
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,980
Even Frank Zalman.

249
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:51,980


250
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,000
Yeah, so far, all of those are true.

251
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,740
I don't think any of those are lies or exaggerations.

252
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,000
Well, I'm almost certain it's probably true, especially in the Pee-wee Herman stuff.

253
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:07,680
Well, you could see, but he had Pee-wee in his title sequence every Saturday morning.

254
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:14,360
All the kids of America saw Bob leering over Pee-wee's shoulder during the titles.

255
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,740
Pee-wee never paid for his membership.

256
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,000
He left a phone message asking us to send him an ordainment.

257
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:21,980
Yeah.

258
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,260
He had a package so he could be a minister.

259
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,180
But he never, and he said, Bill me.

260
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,880
And we did, but he never paid up.

261
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,760
Which in our church really is a pretty major sin.

262
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:38,380
But I figure putting Bob on CBS for a year was worth at least $10.

263
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,980
Well, at least.

264
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:40,840
Yeah.

265
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,480
I mean, and afterward, you had to give the guy some slack.

266
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,040
Yeah.

267
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,140
Yeah.

268
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,740
Yeah, poor Pee-wee.

269
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,960
He really is.

270
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,020
It's a shame what happened to him.

271
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,340
Well, yeah, I always wondered, you know, all you got busted for doing what?

272
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,080
It's a big deal.

273
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,280
Try your 13-year-old kid.

274
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,960
Like the old t-shirt used to say, we're pulling for you, Pee-wee.

275
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,660
You betcha.

276
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,800
Bob, if he isn't done.

277
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,540
Bob, if he isn't done.

278
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,060
Bob?

279
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:06,660
Bob?

280
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,980
Yeah, I dig you, Bob.

281
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,520
Bob.

282
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,340
Oh, Bob.

283
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,340
How long will it be?

284
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,380
How long will it be?

285
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,680
Bob, I'm gonna miss you.

286
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,700
Bob's a bad influence on me.

287
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:15,960
What?

288
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,580
Oh, Bob, he's so charming and continental.

289
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:19,500
.

290
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,620
This is Bob.

291
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,220
I know Bob.

292
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:22,820
I know Bob.

293
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,220
Oh, Bob, I don't know when I've been so hungry and .

294
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,620
Bob, you really shouldn't have given me yours.

295
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,180
Oh, Bob, I don't think I can eat one.

296
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,680
I'm full of greens right up to here.

297
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,420
Fill me up.

298
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,280
.

299
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,720
I got pot.

300
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:37,960
.

301
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,080
You naughty, naughty boy.

302
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,340
Bob, would you like to buy some information?

303
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,580
I've got it, Bob.

304
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,280
Oh, Bob.

305
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,480
So, uh, tell me, Bob, you're a good boy.

306
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:49,480


307
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:49,480


308
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:49,480


309
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:49,480


310
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:49,480


311
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:49,480


312
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:49,480


313
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:49,480


314
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:49,480


315
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:49,860
You're a good boy.

316
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:49,960
.

317
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:49,960


318
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:49,960


319
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:49,960


320
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,600
You know, what is the church of the subgenius?

321
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,260
Good question.

322
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,180
We're still trying to figure that out ourselves.

323
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,480
Uh, you know, it's like, well, is this a joke or is it a real religion?

324
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,480
And our answer is, why not both?

325
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:09,180
Uh, we are probably one of the only serious religions that admits that it's, we're completely

326
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,340
full of crap.

327
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,460
And as such, possibly the only true and honest religion.

328
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,820
Doesn't that just figure?

329
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,340
.

330
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:24,340
You know, um, but we have the problem of, uh, uh, Bobbies.

331
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:30,380
They're, they're the ones that want to, they're so excited about it, they immediately want

332
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:35,500
to start telling all the inside jokes and they haven't even gotten the outside joke

333
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,020
yet.

334
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:36,720
.

335
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:44,640
And, uh, some of them, I mean, really need luck getting the, but basically, uh, back

336
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,100
in 1953.

337
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,320
.

338
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:47,320


339
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:56,160
This, uh, uh, the man, this, that man, J.R., Bob Dobbs, and by the way, the J.R. doesn't

340
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,680
spell for, stand for anything.

341
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,000
It's on his birth certificate with, even with quotes on the name Bob.

342
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,000
Bob was a mere salesman.

343
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,380
Well not a mere salesman.

344
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,500
He was actually the greatest salesman the world has ever known.

345
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,900
Uh, and he was pretty, he, but he was very young then and he was just starting out on

346
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,380
his, his road, his path.

347
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,360
Religion had nothing to do with it.

348
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,820
He was just interested in money like any sane person.

349
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:29,340
But he was tinkering with, uh, uh, uh, a T. He was trying to build his own TV set and

350
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:34,660
it was, he was in his basement standing in a puddle and suddenly he had this, he was

351
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,960
seized up in the spirit.

352
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:43,120
He had this, this, this epiphany, which we call the divine immaculation of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

353
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,740
.

354
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,060
.

355
00:16:44,060 --> 00:17:14,060


356
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,980
Hiding in his basement, hiding hisOPOs or any, hides UFOs and so forth.

357
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,740
None of that stuff.

358
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:23,540
And it was a conspiracy of plain and ordinary garden variety, normal human beings who didn't

359
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:27,900
even know they were part of a conspiracy, but just automatically, out of the fear of

360
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:35,160
anything different, had been keeping down and oppressing the slack of all the weirdos,

361
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:43,040
the abnormals, the different people, uh, the disbelievers, and most importantly, those

362
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,040
. . . . . . . . . who will be in danger.

363
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,040


364
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:51,720
believe anything. And that is when the Church of the Subgenius was formed. Not on a solid rock,

365
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:59,060
like some of our more prosperous competitors, but on a shifting sandy beach of pure hypocrisy.

366
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:06,180
Hypocrisy, friends, that is the beach our church is built on. We have a million rules,

367
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,280
which can all be read in our three books, but there's only one that really counts.

368
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:21,400
And since there's no one here but children, I'll say it in full vulgar English. The one

369
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,220
rule of the Church of the Subgenius is, fuck them if they can't take a joke.

370
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:32,160
So if you are feeling tender today, you should perhaps leave.

371
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:51,960
The Bob Show, brought to you by Bob.

372
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,340
Permanent, perfect, permanent, perfect. And here he is, Bob.

373
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:07,120
Smile, stop, smile, stop. You bet your life, you bet your life, there is heaven right here on Earth.

374
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,260
There is heaven right here on Earth.

375
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,860
Heaven right here on Earth.

376
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,220
Home of the dick jazz. So come on, guys and gals.

377
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:29,820
Won't you come along with me? Heaven on Earth.

378
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,980
No fussy, frizzy curls for this smart girl. She has a Bob. The perfect, permanent, permanent,

379
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,540
tight, kinky with a Bob. Because Bob is so easy, you can do it yourself.

380
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,020
Just regular pin curls and gentle Bob-otion. That's all you need. A Bob. A Bob-new body.

381
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,940
Make your next permanent a Bob. Bob-permanent. Permanent.

382
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:59,280
Give yourself a Bob. Give yourself a Bob. Give yourself a Bob. Give yourself a Bob.

383
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,200
You'll go Bob-Bob-Bobbing along with your Bob.

384
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,080
My Mommadant told me, my Mommadant told me.

385
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,080
My Mommadant me.

386
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,440
My mama done beat a worrisome thing, a worrisome thing.

387
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,040
Train it, train it, train it, train it.

388
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,660
My mama done, my mama done beat.

389
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,600
Woo!

390
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,020
Never before a stick so red, redder than a fire engine.

391
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,900
See what stick can do for you.

392
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,480
The comf, the comf, long-lasting.

393
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,180
You'll just love Bob.

394
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,860
Be sure to listen again next week

395
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,260
when Bob Perfect for Today again brings you

396
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,460
The Bob Show from Bobby Wood.

397
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,360
This girl knows that Bob is the essence of romance.

398
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,520
Who tonight?

399
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,400
BanditNorelPref.com is the essence of collagery,

400
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,020
as most of the subsequent collagers will continue to demonstrate.

401
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:03,140
And just as Fernanda Nande-Lemur is the killer of Bob.

402
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,980
You'll have to get rid of him somehow for good.

403
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,900
But how suddenly you found the answer?

404
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,720
It's as simple as kill Bob.

405
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:11,880
Kill Bob.

406
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,600
If he contacts you, don't try to help him.

407
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,260
He's dangerous.

408
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,380
Bob, Bob.

409
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,540
Hello?

410
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,420
Hello.

411
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,840
Did you hear the news on the radio?

412
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,460
They say I killed Bob.

413
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,620
Guess that's when I must have fallen asleep.

414
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,900
Bob's the only person I can kill.

415
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,280
I can kill Bob.

416
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,480
First thing I saw was Bob's body.

417
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,980
Then the gun beside me and I killed Bob.

418
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,320
Are you sure?

419
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,060
I'm afraid so, Bob.

420
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,640
I don't think the police will believe it.

421
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,700
But it's the truth.

422
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,420
I killed Bob.

423
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,620
Yes, Bob.

424
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,700
Yes, Bob.

425
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,740
You've got to answer it, Bob.

426
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,040
Hello?

427
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:47,940
Hello, Bob.

428
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,300
Oh, darling.

429
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,360
Listen to me, Bob.

430
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,840
She was in love with Bob.

431
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:53,720
Oh, no, Bob.

432
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,940
I was at the cock party.

433
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,800
I actually thought I could kill Bob.

434
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,380
Where did you go after the cock party last night?

435
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,380
Somebody set up a boot trap in your cabin.

436
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,860
It was a dark one, Bob.

437
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,460
And it did just that.

438
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,080
I said I could kill Bob.

439
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,600
She meant that boot trap for you.

440
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,200
Don't look away, Bob.

441
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,480
Perhaps I did kill Bob.

442
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,500
Doesn't that make sense?

443
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:15,960
Well, yes.

444
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,940
Yes, it makes sense.

445
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,880
Yes, Bob.

446
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:18,600
Bob.

447
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,120
Listen, Bob.

448
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,160
I'm sorry about Gavin, but he's a little stressed.

449
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,900
Okay, but hell, he doesn't have to jump down my throat.

450
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,040
Does he have a family or relatives?

451
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,060
Yeah, I have a wife and a child.

452
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:31,340


453
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,640
You know, the deceased, what's his name, Dobbs?

454
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,200
Does he have a family?

455
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,900
Yes, he does.

456
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,600
He has a family.

457
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,920
He has a wife and two young kids.

458
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,960
I think they're divorced.

459
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,340
His kids are divorced?

460
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,920
What the fuck is wrong with you?

461
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,500
Do you laugh at anything?

462
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,060
I mean, do you just laugh at anything?

463
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:48,880
A man has died.

464
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,660
She thinks this is funny.

465
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,180
No, no.

466
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,920
Are all you movie people like this?

467
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,280
Go, go.

468
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,700
Here's Bob One for A1 Slack.

469
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,260
Hi, this is Bob One.

470
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,920
Years ago, my grandfather Abner One, known for short because he was,

471
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,320
invented the A1 Slack.

472
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,880
However, today's go-go action now, gentlemen,

473
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,860
the generation man on campus and off, wants a little more out of life.

474
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,340
So, we added another leg to our super slim from fitting A1 Slack,

475
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,240
and came up with super slim from fitting A1 Slacks.

476
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:22,240
A1 Slacks, the two-legged action slacks for the two-legged action man.

477
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:22,960
Thank you, Bob.

478
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,400
You're welcome.

479
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,720
And now, back to our movie.

480
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,020
Looks like we're gonna find more and we expect it.

481
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:34,120
And we've, over the years, because of the churches,

482
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,560
we went public in 19...

483
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,600
Actually, July... January 1st, 1980,

484
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,920
we printed the first sacred subgenius pamphlet

485
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,300
and have been misunderstood from that day on.

486
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,600
But, you know, as they say,

487
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,800
those who know don't say and those who say don't know.

488
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,780
So, we should all just shut up.

489
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,460
And, but look here, we keep blabbering on and on.

490
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,360
Is it the drugs?

491
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,360
That's what the Cleveland Police Department might tell you.

492
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,440
In fact, a friend of ours sat in on a, uh,

493
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,940
a lecture to the Cleveland Police Department

494
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:16,080
by a cult expert who explained that Bob was a sign for Satan

495
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,360
and drugs and stuff.

496
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,520
But, obviously, friends, this is a religion.

497
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,720
Bob is here to replace the drugs!

498
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:30,640
Just looking at his face eats up more brain cells than most of your drugs.

499
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:34,260
If you're doing it right, like a real subgenius,

500
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,280
if you can meditate upon the dots,

501
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,120
every little dot...

502
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,140
So many of you have done this, I know.

503
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,700
You just, you just focus on that thing

504
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,900
and by, after a while, you feel so much slack.

505
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:52,360
It's like heroin combined with PCP

506
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,760
combined with DDT, LSD, and, uh,

507
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,020
marijuana, as my father puts it.

508
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:04,520
Um, but what, but what Bob's preaching is, is, uh,

509
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,680
the joy of drugs, but not necessarily with the drugs,

510
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,580
although those can certainly enhance everything for the first ten minutes.

511
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:18,940
Uh, so, uh, but we, what Bob preaches is slack, friends.

512
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:26,040
And slack is so simple that I can't explain it.

513
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,660
Because it's different for each person.

514
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,240
Everybody has their own form of slack.

515
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,340
Uh, some people,

516
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,200
uh, get their slack from,

517
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,340
uh, sitting on their ass watching TV and drinking beer.

518
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,160
There's nothing wrong with that.

519
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,100
The conspiracy of the normal people would love for that to be the only way

520
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,700
you feel you're getting slack.

521
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,840
We're here just as a pep talk, just a reminder

522
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,260
that, uh, slack is whatever makes you feel

523
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,260
like you're doing what you were supposed to be doing.

524
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,480
And that could be anything, you know, for, for,

525
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,200
uh, for our friend, uh, uh, Dennis Murphy here.

526
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,440
Uh, slack might be, um,

527
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,980
God, I can't even begin to imagine.

528
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,460
Maybe I should have picked a different, uh, you know,

529
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,480
some people like bird watching, right?

530
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,780
Some people like pornography.

531
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,620
Some people like, uh, movies, you know?

532
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,100
Some people like people.

533
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:30,480
And, and just, uh, hanging out and, and, uh, talking

534
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,680
can be your purest form of slack.

535
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,600
And you can steal that slack while on the job,

536
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,500
as you've learned around the coffee machine, uh, I'm sure.

537
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:45,460
As, as my, my good friend and, uh, and speechwriter,

538
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,480
you might say, Dr. Onan, can a bite put it,

539
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:53,760
slack is the oomph in un, in comfortable.

540
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,700
That's it.

541
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,220
See, he has, uh, he has some stage.

542
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,920
He has, he says, slack is the oomph in comfortable.

543
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,880
He says,

544
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,320
oomph is a co, is accompanied by a gesture of vigor

545
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,800
from the hips among adults or a pumped elbow on US TV.

546
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:18,740
So, it could actually be slack is the oomph in un, in comfortable.

547
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,180
Why do I keep wanting to say uncomfortable?

548
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,060
Uh, and as I said, slack can come when you throw good money after bad

549
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:32,460
and bad money after Bob, and that's why that sales table is out there.

550
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:38,520
This, oh, and we have a new book out, uh, Intelligent Design for Dummies.

551
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,100
Our, our new, uh, publication.

552
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,160
And for those, so, so be sure if you think you've already bought

553
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,280
all the accessories that go with Ken and Barbie,

554
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,740
there's some new accessories out there.

555
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,860
Um, so, uh.

556
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,960
So, you know, Bob has many death days.

557
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,660
What's his birthday?

558
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:00,720
Yeah.

559
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,420
Bob has had so many lives, so many past lives that, that by chance,

560
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:11,260
you know, one of almost every day of the year is the birthday of a Bob.

561
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,800
So, where is Bob now?

562
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,920
Is there, is there, is there somebody that we should be looking towards?

563
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,520
Where is Bob?

564
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:22,740
Is he mayhaps fishing, uh, on Lake Titicaca with G. Gordon Gordon?

565
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,960
Is he perhaps selling ice to an Eskimo somewhere in Alaska?

566
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,120
Yeah.

567
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,680
Is he perhaps selling hypocrisy to a subgenius in San Francisco?

568
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:40,000
But Bob is a traveling salesman and resides at no fixed address.

569
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:45,860
Unlike, uh, the god of the Mormons who is, uh, known to be, uh,

570
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:51,260
on a planet circling the star Koloff, having sex with his many spirit wives.

571
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,200
...star Bob, a guy named Smith on terrible pieces.

572
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,260
Although, uh, we don't know where Bob is now.

573
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,100
Joseph Smith?

574
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,500
We know that Bob is coming.

575
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,160
And when I say that, I don't mean...

576
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,440
It has been said.

577
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,360
It's not like when Jesus is coming.

578
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,840
That, that usually means Jesus is on his way, is due to arrive.

579
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,740
When we say Bob is coming...

580
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,540
Like Santa Claus.

581
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,020
Bob is literally, that is what Bob is.

582
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,460
...is always coming.

583
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:20,440
And it's true, I mean, but isn't he sometimes there, and then at other times not?

584
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:20,880
Yeah.

585
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,940
When you come tonight, you will see Bob.

586
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,800
Well, otherwise...

587
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,320
I'll be looking...

588
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:24,900
...with a big, close...

589
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,540
...about an hour and a half.

590
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,180
...self-defeating.

591
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,120
I will.

592
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,080
I don't want to see him.

593
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,160
No, no, I'll be, I'll be home by then.

594
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:31,700
And you can't move.

595
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,400
I know.

596
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:32,740
That's okay.

597
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,960
But I just don't want to see him during that, uh, thing, you know.

598
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,160
You can't move.

599
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,800
You don't want to be everywhere.

600
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,180
But I mean, don't you think you'd understand it all at that point?

601
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,460
Or maybe not.

602
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,480
I think that's when the shark bites you.

603
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,040
That's the part I thought about.

604
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:44,520
Because you're looking...

605
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,380
You're out there swimming around, and a shark bites you, and if you're...

606
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,200
Because you're being distracted.

607
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,540
Yeah, and if you're together enough to understand that last big organism, then, then you're pretty

608
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:52,980
well set.

609
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,760
Instead of, instead of, uh, the music stopping and you're just left out there...

610
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,840
Well, you shouldn't have...

611
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,480
Like some amateur show...

612
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,360
No, it's now that Bob's coming your way.

613
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:01,900
...in your field of biology.

614
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:02,780
He is?

615
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,060
Ah!

616
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,000
Oh!

617
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,220
Karunch.

618
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:06,720
Bob!

619
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,960
I mean, no, I said, oh, God.

620
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,440
I mean, oh, Bob, I did.

621
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,380
Well, there are no atheists in foxholes.

622
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:16,620
I'm sorry.

623
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:18,840
I'm sorry.

624
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,560
I'm sorry.

625
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,380
I'm sorry.

626
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,800
I'm sorry.

627
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,220
I'm sorry.

628
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:25,900
I'm sorry.

629
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,260
I'm sorry.

630
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:27,260


631
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:27,260


632
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:27,260


633
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:27,260


634
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:27,260


635
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:27,260


636
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:27,260


637
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:27,260


638
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:27,260


639
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:27,360
I'm sorry.

640
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:30,920
I'm sorry.

641
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:30,920


642
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:30,920


643
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,760
Stop it!

644
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:33,780
Don't!

645
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,080
You're right!

646
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,560
You killed Bob Mirror because now we're free.

647
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:38,560


648
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,160
Was that別夕 merge yours and mine together to cause this carnage.

649
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,840
That Пр tul.' bearing.

650
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:42,840


651
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,240
Ahhh...

652
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,720
Bład My Table Hot Yol Salad!

653
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:48,720


654
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:48,720


655
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,140
Just eliminating ships over on the surface, Mary?

656
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,440
partido mum!

657
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,100


658
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,100


659
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,660
We're really equallyattackable!

660
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:52,660


661
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,080
Hi, y'all.

662
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,760
Bollywood.

663
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,560
We are Et enabling for fin приех posts on YouTube!

664
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:54,560


665
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,980
Well, all I'm nosotros at this time because we need to hear one last story.

666
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,820
produce that. There's that Lithuanian

667
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,820
actor. Johnny Depp plays

668
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,880
the young Ivan Stang

669
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,960
and Jim Carrey

670
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,260
plays Violet Drummond.

671
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,840
I don't know who else has been

672
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,960
cast yet, but

673
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,900
Bob would be Andy

674
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,000
Serkis, the guy that played

675
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,180
Gollum and Kong.

676
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,620
That would be good.

677
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,060
He would basically be a performance

678
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,000
capture. And Mike Myers

679
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,180
is the voice of Cthulhu.

680
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,040
You can see we've been thinking about

681
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,700
that. Very true.

682
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,760
Any love interests in the film?

683
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,320
Yeah.

684
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,860
The hero would be Lonesome Cowboy

685
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,820
Dave and I think it would be

686
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,360
his...

687
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,960
He'd be courting

688
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,600
a popular

689
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,380
bullgirl Dave Vina.

690
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,160
Voiced by Lindsay Lohan.

691
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,140
In a bikini.

692
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,960
Just because. And they're all

693
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,760
penguins, right?

694
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,940
That's right. They're all CGI

695
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,720
penguins.

696
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,940
Thousands and thousands.

697
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,880
And then there's the Spielberg Saturday morning TV

698
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,840
show Lil' Subgenius.

699
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,040
Dear Subgenius!

700
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,060
I said Lil' Subgenius.

701
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,440
Lil' Subgenius.

702
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,160
With Pip and Squeak.

703
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,020
Well, we've been waiting for the remake.

704
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,760
That was the Sid and Marty

705
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,880
Croft production. What, the remake?

706
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,900
That was a great...

707
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,940
Original, Lil'?

708
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,540
Second big feature was another one of my favorites.

709
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,020
I never saw the remake. What is that about?

710
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,080
What is this thing?

711
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,360
It stinks.

712
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,900
That was a joke. That was a joke.

713
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,800
It stinks. What is this thing?

714
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,860
The second big feature was

715
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,280
a possible name

716
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,160
for a Subgenius feature movie.

717
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,380
What was the name?

718
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,600
Second big feature.

719
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,800
I thought they were like a real band.

720
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,240
Second big feature?

721
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,860
Yeah, but Philo disabused me of that notion tonight.

722
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,020
He said it was just negative land.

723
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,420
The Swingin' Love.

724
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,660
Wait, write that down. That's a good name for a band.

725
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,120
Yeah.

726
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,240
Negative man. Negative land.

727
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,360
Nobody expected what happened next.

728
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,560
Sensational career.

729
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,840
I'm Bob.

730
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:16,860
I'm Bob.

731
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,180
So why are so many people

732
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,440
flocking to

733
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,140
to to to to

734
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:22,340
Bob?

735
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,360
My message is that God is a

736
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:24,700
hope

737
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,080
that he'll take us places we've never dreamed of.

738
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:27,640
It's hard

739
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,100
to break a dick, to break a dick.

740
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,840
You may be misleading some people

741
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,620
so big

742
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,260
being gay.

743
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,440
Gay and generous.

744
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,820
Leading them to some

745
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,120
false god or something like that.

746
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,000
Deluding and dumbing down.

747
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:40,900
You know

748
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,700
Right up there with gardening.

749
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,220
Bam! There's a hit.

750
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,200
Great, great, great, great, great, great.

751
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,420
Wait, you're saying that...

752
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,140
Great, great, great, great, great, great, great.

753
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:53,660
Oh my god!

754
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,260
Nothing.

755
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,440
Make beautiful women fall all over you.

756
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,440
No doubt there.

757
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,260
Take steroids.

758
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,360
Slack, slack, slack.

759
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,360
Cut, cut. I'm weak.

760
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,980
Uh, now, now, a lot of people say that, uh,

761
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:16,300
some terms that are in the, in the, as you say, the Bobliographer on the, the, uh...

762
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:21,400
the, the cyclopedia, uh, it kind of uses, uh,

763
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:26,140
notions, uh, similar to, not the same as, but, but in the same area as Scientology

764
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:31,320
or kind of a New Age-y, but, but, but in a fashion that, that's almost Dada-esque.

765
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:39,380
Well, um, you know, any religion or priesthood is, uh, based on impenetrable jargon.

766
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,900
Lawyers, doctors, for instance.

767
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,720
And we get a lot of, of, uh, lawyers, doctors joining up because they appreciate...

768
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,240
that impenetrable obfuscation.

769
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,280
Uh, uh...

770
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,920
invented words and

771
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,060
words that have been

772
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:56,900
recombined.

773
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,940
So that when you're reading this stuff,

774
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,980
you feel like you're really part of a secret

775
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,060
army. And the great thing

776
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:04,920
is, you are.

777
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,600
It's not much of a...

778
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,000
I mean, it's still a secret, so it's not that much

779
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,320
of an army. Not much of an army, yeah.

780
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,940
But, you know, it's kind of like what they used

781
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,100
to say about Fight Club.

782
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,880
First rule, don't talk about it.

783
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,800
Don't talk about it, yeah. Of course, naturally, everybody

784
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,820
talks about it.

785
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,040
Well, and, you know, the Hell's Angels used to say

786
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,400
those who say don't know

787
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,480
and those who know don't say.

788
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:30,120
And we should probably just shut up.

789
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,920
Well, yeah, and that's a show

790
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,580
that would go right to hell.

791
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,060
I like one thing about it,

792
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,940
and I always say, you know, this has got to be

793
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,880
the best deal in

794
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,000
organized, shall we say,

795
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,780
religion or church,

796
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,920
and that is guaranteed

797
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,940
salvation or triple your

798
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,820
money back. That's right. Eternal

799
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,660
salvation or triple your money back.

800
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,700
That's an offer that no other

801
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,620
religion makes. Well, I, you know,

802
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,740
none of them do, and I'm thinking, you know,

803
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,660
now, there's one you can grasp.

804
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,920
That's the kind of church I can

805
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,060
get behind. Right. Or in front of.

806
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,940
It costs $30 to join,

807
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,600
and that means that if you,

808
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,120
at the end of time, find yourself

809
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,300
in the pit of hell,

810
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,280
we will

811
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,400
gladly refund your money.

812
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,360
Not only your $30, we'll give you

813
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,020
$90.

814
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,220
Now, there is a little book that you can,

815
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,180
that Bob sells down there called

816
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,860
Hell on Five Cents a Day,

817
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,080
which I think is

818
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,260
$89.95. Nowadays, yeah.

819
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,280
And a day lasts a long

820
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,160
time. In hell. Yeah,

821
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,240
in normal hell. Now, subgenius hell is

822
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,920
kind of like an endless party.

823
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,900
Well, that's my idea of a good idea.

824
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,400
Right. Yeah.

825
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,220
Now, we, I,

826
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,520
you know, this,

827
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,420
it's possible, some people think this subgenius

828
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,380
thing is just a joke.

829
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:49,720
And,

830
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,720
I mean, some people think. Well, compared to what, though?

831
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,600
Right, exactly. You know,

832
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,700
everybody's religion is going to be a joke to

833
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,360
somebody else. Yeah, I was going to say,

834
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,920
one of them has to be true. What if it was

835
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,840
this one? Who knows? Who knows?

836
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,420
Crazier things have happened.

837
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,060
Look at the

838
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,620
Inquisition. Look at the news.

839
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,200
See?

840
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,860
Yeah, you know,

841
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,740
I wouldn't be surprised

842
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,600
at anything

843
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,120
that would happen, although we're,

844
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,800
we are kind of behind Scientology,

845
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,920
we got started a little bit later.

846
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,720
That's all right. So did L. Ron Hubbard.

847
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,580
Hold on a second, if you will,

848
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,740
Reverend, we're going to take a quick break.

849
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,800
Reverend Ivan Stang, he is

850
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,780
the founder of the Church of the Subgenius,

851
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,660
and talking more about

852
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,060
the Church of the Subgenius, for those of you out there

853
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,980
who have never heard of it, well, here's a chance

854
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,800
to find a religion you can really get behind,

855
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,880
or next to, or in front of, or

856
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,840
you know, something.

857
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,360
Video now, video, if not, I'm going to see it for you.

858
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,560
Video now, video, if not, I'm going to see it for you.

859
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:25,540
Video now, video, if not, I'm going to see it for you.

860
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,800
Video now, video, if not, I'm going to see it for you.

861
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,840
Yeah, it's

862
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,240
definitely one of the world's fastest

863
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,260
growing religions.

864
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,320
But it's not a snack religion.

865
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,660
Well, it is a sack religion.

866
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,760
No, a snack.

867
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,120
Oh, you're sure?

868
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,220
It's a snack religion.

869
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:10,620
Okay.

870
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,020
We push Bob as a short-duration

871
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:14,980
personal savior.

872
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,760
We don't expect you to cling to it forever.

873
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,160
We don't want you to use

874
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,160
Bob as a crutch. Rather, we want

875
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,080
to let, you should

876
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,260
let Bob use

877
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,600
you as a crutch.

878
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,940
You are Bob's crutch.

879
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,240
I'm interested in your information.

880
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,900
I'd like to subscribe to the newsletter.

881
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,800
Wait, I already do.

882
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,920
You go to subgenius.com and

883
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,680
click on the news button.

884
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,980
It's actually all very logical.

885
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,020
There used to be a hard copy, that

886
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,780
famous publication,

887
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,720
The Stark Fist of Removal.

888
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,860
But in the cyber age,

889
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,700
it doesn't come out very often.

890
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,040
We allow special members to print out

891
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,300
the online version.

892
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,100
Well, you know, and Dobbs made

893
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,200
most of his important deals in strange

894
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,120
places when he first started out, like

895
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,460
a Waffle House in Haightville,

896
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,240
Georgia. I thought it was Ellicott City,

897
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,880
Maryland. It was the Stuckeys

898
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,740
in Texas.

899
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,500
Well, there were several.

900
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,840
He knows all this stuff. Right.

901
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,880
Where was it?

902
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,880
He fell asleep.

903
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,180
Stank.

904
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,080
Stank.

905
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,800
I think

906
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,880
Stank's done.

907
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,060
He's suffering the wounds of

908
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,560
cripes.

909
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,400
Hey, you know, I got a joke.

910
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,740
What's the difference between Jesus Christ

911
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,080
and a picture of Jesus Christ?

912
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,480
Are you guys talking about me?

913
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,220
We were saying we're

914
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,660
I was actually

915
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,560
in the process of flipping

916
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,580
a tape.

917
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,500
Are we supposed to be funny now?

918
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,600
No, I don't think so.

919
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,780
We wanted to know the connection between the Raelians

920
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,000
on the one hand,

921
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,540
Dr. Sinister's show, and

922
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,200
Bob's hardest sell.

923
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,300
Not anything you can do with primate arrest.

924
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,760
So what is what's the difference between

925
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,300
now? What's the difference between Jesus and a picture of him?

926
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:02,600
I don't know.

927
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,320
Oh, yeah, that was it.

928
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:03,760
Yeah.

929
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,660
What's the difference between Jesus Christ and a picture of Jesus Christ?

930
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,460
You only need one nail to hang up the picture.

931
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,660
Oh, hey, what's it?

932
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,980
What's the difference between Jesus Christ and a picture of Jesus Christ?

933
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,020
The picture is real.

934
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,660
Keep going.

935
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,920
Oh, but Bob is real.

936
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,040
Bob is real.

937
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,360
Bob is real.

938
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:24,640
He's real.

939
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:29,060
You know, you don't want to offend the Arabs saying Bob is real.

940
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,180
Bob is real.

941
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:33,760
And there was a waitress in in

942
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,400
April, Georgia, who I can't say this stuff on the air.

943
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,360
Sure, you can.

944
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,240
Well, I can't.

945
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,060
It is.

946
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,180
I get somebody found a dog's head in a pancake.

947
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,080
No, no, no, no, no.

948
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,900
It's much more complicated than that.

949
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,400
Well, I met her.

950
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:53,340
I was it was about three o'clock in the morning and she was

951
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,180
a Waffle House waitress, which, you know, is pretty normal.

952
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:03,480
And and she started telling me I had on a dog shirt and she said, I've seen him.

953
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,680
He was here with these weird guys.

954
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:11,020
And she tells me this long story and I can't really tell it on the air to not giving.

955
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,620
I don't want to give away too many secrets.

956
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,460
Well, like the guys weren't really guys.

957
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,400
They were like aliens.

958
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,060
You know what?

959
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:17,580
Yeah.

960
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,060
But she had met Bob just that she had met Bob.

961
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,620
Oh, she had served Bob a cup of coffee.

962
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,140
That's not unusual.

963
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:32,940
A Bob often has been where a subgenius arrives just before the subgenius got there.

964
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,360
You hear that all the time.

965
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,960
So actually, I've seen him arriving just as Bob has just has left.

966
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:43,980
I've seen him a couple of times, actually, a memory or a premonition because it's so fleeting.

967
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,620
And they're just aware of something having happened.

968
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:49,080
I've seen him driving away twice.

969
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:52,220
I've seen him getting Bob on the highway at least twice.

970
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,560
Actually, I saw him get thrown out of a car.

971
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:59,680
I saw him get thrown out of a car at a coffee shop, actually, because really, because he wouldn't put his pipe out, you know, and they threw him out.

972
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,280
And like that, exactly.

973
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:05,680
And then I but I figured I'd just leave it, you know, hands off, you know.

974
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:10,200
And I don't know what exactly it was, but the people in there got really upset about something.

975
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,720
They forcibly threw him out, like literally threw him out.

976
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:18,080
And right as soon as he threw him out, a big bus came by and hit him right as he threw him out there.

977
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,620
And then he was gone.

978
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,660
You see, that's unusual.

979
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,860
All I saw left behind was like.

980
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,420
There was like some.

981
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:28,740
Like a smoldering of the of like a broken pipe there.

982
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:31,260
But then again, you know, next week I saw Bob again.

983
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,620
You know, he was fine.

984
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,240
Yeah. Well, you know, it's funny.

985
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:40,560
The reason the waitress was asking about the shirt I had on is that Bob never paid his bill.

986
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,900
Oh, why is it always the rich ones?

987
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,360
You know, it really was Bob.

988
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:47,920
Why is it always the rich ones?

989
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,080
It was like the first night they were open at this particular location.

990
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,380
This had to have been back in like 58 or so.

991
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:54,400


992
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:54,400


993
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:54,400


994
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:54,400


995
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:54,400


996
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:54,400


997
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:54,400


998
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:54,400


999
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:54,400


1000
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:54,400


1001
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:54,400


1002
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:54,400


1003
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:54,400


1004
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:54,400


1005
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:54,400


1006
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:54,720
60.

1007
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,880
And she still remembered the guy because he stiffed her.

1008
00:43:58,620 --> 00:43:59,260
You know.

1009
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,580
Well, you always remember the person who stiffed you.

1010
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,280
Yeah.

1011
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,820
Especially if they look like that, you know, they're grinning while they do it.

1012
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,480
Your first night getting stiffed.

1013
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,100
Yeah, we always remember that.

1014
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:15,760
Has anybody delivered a peach to Bob and, you know, 13 cents tip, get the idea?

1015
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,940
Wow, a whole 13 cents?

1016
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,220
That's pretty good.

1017
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,180
Bob doesn't tip the drivers either.

1018
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,080
That's happened.

1019
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,020
I know a driver who delivered to him.

1020
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:24,400
And he was like, I'm going to pay you.

1021
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:24,400


1022
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,320
And Bob doesn't tip.

1023
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,520
Bob says, let me give you a tip.

1024
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,860
Don't get screwed or something really dumb and witty like that.

1025
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,400
Yeah, he grabs the clementine.

1026
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,860
It's the same thing to every pizza delivery guy.

1027
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,060
Yeah.

1028
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:39,800
Yeah.

1029
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,160
My dad does that too.

1030
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,940
Do you know how a leper leaves a tip for a hooker?

1031
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:44,940
Oh.

1032
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:45,840
Oh.

1033
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,000
We can stop there.

1034
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:51,300
Man.

1035
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,500
That was a quick one.

1036
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:53,900
It was good.

1037
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:54,700
That was quick.

1038
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,620
It's old.

1039
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:57,740
Yeah.

1040
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,040
Yeah.

1041
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,780
Old like me.

1042
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,880
You know, and when I get home, I'll chop up another three shows out of this one real

1043
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:14,300
fast and take off for Texas to Stang County where we go every December to help oversee

1044
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,860
construction on the compound.

1045
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,500
We're building a big cult compound in Stang County, Texas.

1046
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,900
You don't want to go down by Stang County, son.

1047
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,400
I don't want to go down by Stang County, son.

1048
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:24,400


1049
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,100
It's near Dead Branch Pass.

1050
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:34,420
Actually, Stang County has a nuclear power plant that serves Dallas.

1051
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:37,020
It has a really big tax base.

1052
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,200
We have a lot of tax money because of that.

1053
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:46,740
And my family is very involved in city politics, county politics, and so forth.

1054
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:52,400
So we've been able to go forward on construction of this underground bunker.

1055
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,380
It started as a mine.

1056
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:57,080
It's an abandoned missile silo bunker.

1057
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:57,900
Even better.

1058
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,400
There are a lot of those in Texas.

1059
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,660
They've done the digging for you.

1060
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,280
Yeah, that's right.

1061
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:05,360
I saw something a while back about people living in these, in the bunkers, owning them,

1062
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:05,640
right?

1063
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,220
Yeah.

1064
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:06,340
Yeah.

1065
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:10,420
We did that, and we also have extensive tunneling going on.

1066
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,300
To the mall.

1067
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,580
Luckily, there's uranium, raw uranium on the land of Stang County.

1068
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:17,940
Brilliant.

1069
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,880
And goats.

1070
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,260
Like every good cow.

1071
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:24,360
Why not?

1072
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,400
Well, goats, you may ask.

1073
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,000
Well, because there was a drought.

1074
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:27,920
Why a goat?

1075
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,980
And the cows, there wasn't enough grass for the cows or the zombies.

1076
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,160
Goats in Jehovah.

1077
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:34,800
Yeah.

1078
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:36,360
But the goats, the goats are happy.

1079
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,480
We actually have a cult compound in Texas.

1080
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,260
Told he was busted, too.

1081
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:41,460
With goats.

1082
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,480
Slightly radioactive goats.

1083
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:43,820
Yeah.

1084
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,460
Machine gun, you know, encampments.

1085
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:48,180
The horns glow.

1086
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,000
It's a terrible thing.

1087
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:54,340
So we, most of it is, you know, it's a very, very, very important thing.

1088
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:54,340


1089
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:54,340


1090
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:54,340


1091
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:54,340


1092
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:54,340


1093
00:46:54,340 --> 00:47:02,040
And then, most of the time, the other members of the Stang clan run the ranch.

1094
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,240
I just go down there every now and then to oversee this.

1095
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,080
The Stang stomping ground.

1096
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:07,820
The killing hounds.

1097
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:10,940
Stang likes to go down to supervise the killings.

1098
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:11,440
And the bodies.

1099
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,620
We're going to build a big TV studio there.

1100
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,180
And a crystal cathedral.

1101
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:19,360
And a drive-through crystal cathedral.

1102
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,020
And a creation.

1103
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:21,780
Drive-through.

1104
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:22,920
Drive by.

1105
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,320
And we're going to have a Grand Canyon on the Grand Canyon.

1106
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:24,320


1107
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:24,320


1108
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:24,320


1109
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:24,320


1110
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:24,320


1111
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,240
a special museum about the

1112
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,960
way evolution really worked.

1113
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,280
Where subgeniuses really

1114
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:30,940
came from.

1115
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,280
Audio animatronic yeti.

1116
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:36,060
The arrival of the exes, the

1117
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,240
creation of the humans by the yetis

1118
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,140
and so forth. That's actually my favorite part

1119
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,820
where they have the audio animatronic staying

1120
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:43,940
and throwing the guys and talking

1121
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,560
and their arms kind of move.

1122
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:47,440
Are you familiar with the creation of the

1123
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,640
humanoids movie?

1124
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:50,780
Yes, most certainly.

1125
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,720
That's a great film.

1126
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,640
A mandatory subgenius movie.

1127
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,360
Why doesn't he listen to you?

1128
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,180
What's his name? Gavin. Right, Garvin.

1129
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,380
I can never remember his name.

1130
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:03,480
So why doesn't he listen

1131
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,360
to you, huh? I tend to rattle

1132
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,000
his cage. He doesn't like it.

1133
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,420
Was it like this before the actor? What was his name?

1134
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,220
The one who died? Dobbs. Yeah, Hobbs.

1135
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,960
What was going on then, huh? Anarchy.

1136
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,400
Dobbs was rewriting the script.

1137
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:17,120
He'd call script conferences

1138
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,300
every morning before shooting and made everyone crazy.

1139
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:21,600
We already had a script. What was the problem, huh?

1140
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:23,080
An actor. What can I tell you?

1141
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,900
He wasn't even good at it, you know?

1142
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:27,300
He was the look-at-me-scratch-my-balls

1143
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,040
school of acting.

1144
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:30,920
Such assholes. I asked this guy, Dobbs.

1145
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:33,160
I asked him last week. I said, why are you doing this?

1146
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,880
What did he say? He said it was a generational thing.

1147
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:36,720
What's that mean, huh?

1148
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,000
Beats the hell out of me.

1149
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,300
Little puke.

1150
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,180
Come on! You couldn't do anything

1151
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,980
to stop it? What could I do?

1152
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,700
Gavin had no control.

1153
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:48,900
He was terrified.

1154
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,200
Couldn't make decisions about anything,

1155
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,100
even about breakfast.

1156
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:53,860
Could've helped me, you know.

1157
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,000
Works. Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs.

1158
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,500
Colt, Colt. Just out of time.

1159
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,320
Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs, Dobbs. Went off.

1160
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,460
The incredible last wrong.

1161
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,420
Committed. Committed.

1162
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,460
Now you do know,

1163
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:08,340
Colt.

1164
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:11,480
You know, with ADHD and, you know,

1165
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,300
just kind of, you know, you know,

1166
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,120
just kind of, you know, you know,

1167
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,660
you know, um...

1168
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:17,600
You know, uh...

1169
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,760
Put your arm around

1170
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,760
these young men.

1171
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,100
Watch it. Watch it.

1172
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:26,620
You know, but Colt, I...

1173
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:28,460
I... It's my Colt.

1174
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,640
I, uh, you know, you know,

1175
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,820
Secret Life on the Internet Colt.

1176
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,160
Uh, uh, uh, uh, well, doody-doody.

1177
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:35,800
Uh, uh.

1178
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,020
It doesn't make any sense, you know.

1179
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:38,660
Action.

1180
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,560
And so we were, you know, coming.

1181
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:43,180
You know, it's, you know, you know.

1182
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:44,180
Hmm, hmm.

1183
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,660
So we got off, you know.

1184
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,760
I'm really deeply involved in girls

1185
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,400
and boys and girls today.

1186
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,440
Mm-hmm.

1187
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,060
Cult. Perfect.

1188
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,000
Gone down the wrong road.

1189
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:56,920
Good. Beautiful.

1190
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,900
Crazy things get said.

1191
00:49:59,340 --> 00:49:59,820
Mm-hmm.

1192
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:00,280
Mm-hmm.

1193
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,580
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

1194
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:02,860
Back again.

1195
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:05,340
We're up right against the top of the hour

1196
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,560
and, of course, a news update.

1197
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:09,920
But I want to, uh, get some final details

1198
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,200
from our good guest, the Reverend Ivan Stang.

1199
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,660
He's, uh, the headmaster, I guess.

1200
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,860
No, my title is Sacred Scribe.

1201
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:22,580
Cool.

1202
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:23,100
All right.

1203
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:26,200
Sacred Scribe number 273.

1204
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:30,660
Bob Dobbs is the living avatar of Slack.

1205
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:31,520
Wow.

1206
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:33,300
That's his official title.

1207
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:34,940
Not to be confused with the other Dobbs

1208
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:35,780
down the road from us.

1209
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,680
Um, for those who wish to find out more

1210
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,320
and or get your books and your DVD

1211
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:46,400
and also, by the way, that hell on five cents a day

1212
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:46,920
kind of thing.

1213
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:49,440
Um, how does one do this?

1214
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,420
If you're on the Internet,

1215
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:57,000
the simplest thing would be to look at subgenius.com.

1216
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,840
And I'll, uh, subgenius does not have an O in it.

1217
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,220
I have to say that because there are a lot of subgeniuses out there.

1218
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:12,140
It's S-U-B-G-E-N-I-U-S.com.

1219
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:13,420
All right.

1220
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:13,960
Very good indeed.

1221
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,660
And Reverend Stang, I'm going to, by the way,

1222
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:16,320
I'm going to put you on hold.

1223
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,980
My producer, Steve, needs to speak with you,

1224
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,300
but, uh, I want to thank you so much.

1225
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:19,840
It's been a lot of fun.

1226
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,280
Thank you very much.

1227
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,640
I'm just, I'm a little concerned

1228
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,500
that I'm going to have those monkeys songs

1229
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,920
stuck in my head for the next three days.

1230
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,740
An ear bug is the worst, isn't it?

1231
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,420
Thank you very much.

1232
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:30,860
Indeed.

1233
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:31,940
And thank you very much.

1234
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:32,500
Okay.

1235
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:33,520
And please stay there, Reverend,

1236
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:34,580
but thanks very much indeed.

1237
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:35,380
Praise Rick.

1238
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,880
And praise Ivan.

1239
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,820
Anyway, we're going to take it up to the news.

1240
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,420
From PR News in Washington,

1241
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:44,620
I'm involved in a prostitution ring.

1242
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,440
President Bush says the U.S. will help Poland

1243
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,300
modernize its childhood obesity.

1244
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,180
Mr. Bush says health officials,

1245
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:51,840
are overweight.

1246
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,840
I'm optimistic that we'll be able to live

1247
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,600
in deprivation and fear.

1248
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,660
Health officials say children and teenagers

1249
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:01,020
are not immune from congressional subpoenas,

1250
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:02,600
as claimed by the Bush administration.

1251
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,700
The president also said today

1252
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,300
that this is PR News in Washington.

1253
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:10,460
A thanks to Leemur for that,

1254
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:13,020
and PR News and laughing.

1255
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,700
This has been Hour of Slight,

1256
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,080
number 1143,

1257
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,400
with Dr. Hal Pasling,

1258
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:17,820
Evidence,

1259
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:18,900
Philo Drummond,

1260
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:19,920
John Hell,

1261
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,060
Mongoloid,

1262
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,720
and K-Rob in San Francisco,

1263
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,920
Dr. Sinister and Princess Pisces,

1264
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,460
and Lonesome Cowboy Dave on WCSB Cleveland,

1265
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,060
and Governor Rocknar,

1266
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:29,900
and No Money Mark.

1267
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:33,220
The movie soundtrack that is so weird

1268
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,540
is from Slipstream,

1269
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,180
and the background music is

1270
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:39,080
Bonobo's Convergence from Last X Day

1271
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,140
and Next X Day.

1272
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,200
And now,

1273
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:44,560
from Norell,

1274
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:45,840
this message.

1275
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:49,120
For the safety of your smile,

1276
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,880
see your dentist twice a day,

1277
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:52,680
and you'll never be able to escape.

1278
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,120
The Bob Show,

1279
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,000
starring Bob,

1280
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,380
and his guest star,

1281
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:57,780
LeWin Thrill.

1282
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,020
How do you do, ladies and gentlemen?

1283
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:03,600
This is Bob.

1284
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,080
I was so glad to be back,

1285
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,080
I went down to the blood bank

1286
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:09,980
and gave a pint of blood.

1287
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,160
WC Fields was there, too.

1288
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,000
He donated a fifth.

1289
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:16,780
Trip the Light, fantastic.

1290
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:17,900
Have you tried

1291
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:20,080
going a little buggy

1292
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:20,980
with a girl?

1293
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:22,760
And a horse?

1294
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:23,920
With a horse,

1295
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,080
the horse wants to

1296
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:25,880
to go out

1297
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,680
for a little buggy.

1298
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,380
Get a horse,

1299
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:29,760
black or brown or gray.

1300
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:30,880
But a horse...

1301
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,320
Robert, quit putting it in your pipe.

1302
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:34,860
Jugs.

1303
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,420
I thought you used your nose for that.

1304
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:39,940
You talk like I was a freak.

1305
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I was a freak, freak, freak.

1306
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,060
Father, I'm down here

1307
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,380
with a nice young man.

1308
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,640
Get a horse...

1309
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:46,460
Hello.

1310
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:47,520
Wrong number.

1311
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:47,960
Uh-oh.

1312
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:48,580
Hello.

1313
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:49,260
Hello.

1314
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,580
Remove that film.

1315
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:52,300
Quickly, easily, safely.

1316
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,760
No one, no one.

1317
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,840
Get a tube, get a tube.

1318
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:55,620
Ladies and gentlemen,

1319
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:57,200
you really like the girls, don't you?

1320
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:58,700
Yes, Bob, I do.

1321
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,920
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

1322
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:03,580
I'd like to introduce

1323
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:04,620
one of the reals of genius.

1324
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:05,480
Thank you very much.

1325
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,340
I presume you're Bob.

1326
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:07,700
The genius.

1327
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:08,500
I'm becoming known

1328
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,880
as the Bob of this generation.

1329
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:11,940
Bob.

1330
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:12,800
Magic Bob.

1331
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:13,600
I know, Bob.

1332
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:14,580
Why do I stand here

1333
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:15,240
reading this stripe

1334
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,780
when I can get a good job at Lockheed?

1335
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:17,860
I'm Bob.

1336
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:18,780
Sit down, Bob.

1337
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,960
I'll read your future.

1338
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:20,880
I can tell you

1339
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,580
who's going to be

1340
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:22,320
in the White House.

1341
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:25,320
I do a lot of deep thinking.

1342
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:25,960
Get loaded.

1343
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:27,800
So, uh, someone died?

1344
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:30,540
Yeah, Dobbs.

1345
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,940
You wrote the part of Ray

1346
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,340
for an African-American, right?

1347
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:35,400
I did?

1348
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:36,600
Yeah, man.

1349
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,520
What's wrong with you?

1350
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,160
Are you on drugs?

1351
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:39,640
No, no, I'm not on drugs.

1352
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,200
Ray, the character

1353
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,140
that Dobbs was playing,

1354
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:42,740
was black.

1355
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,080
Dobbs wasn't a black actor, man.

1356
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,960
He was white, like her.

1357
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:49,580
Oh, my God.

1358
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:52,020
Why did you kill me off feelings?

1359
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:52,780
Barbara.

1360
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,220
I was just a script supervisor.

1361
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,280
That's all I was.

1362
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,260
It was Barbara.

1363
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,160
Now you have no continuity.

1364
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:03,700
Nothing makes sense anymore.

1365
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,660
It's so unfair.

1366
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,600
It's just so unfair.

1367
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,680
It's so unfair.

1368
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:16,880


1369
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:17,620
Go.

1370
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:19,920
Go.

1371
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:20,480
Go.

1372
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:23,100
Mommy.

1373
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:23,320
Mommy.

1374
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,560
In dealing with supernatural

1375
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,880
reanimated mummies

1376
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,000
that play the old age homes

1377
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,300
in that movie.

1378
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,860
Just like DJs at Firecat Radio,

1379
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:37,520
ladies and gentlemen.

1380
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,580
One day they are going to mummify us.

1381
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,680
And it will be an honor.

1382
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:44,060
Your encrusted sarcophagus,

1383
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:46,940
rich with jewels and hieroglyphs,

1384
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:48,820
will be lowered into your own

1385
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:49,560
personal home.

1386
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:52,180
While sealed by the sands of time.

1387
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:54,460
I want to be frozen in loose sight

1388
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:55,840
like Bob did.

1389
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Bob is...

1390
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,740
One of the Bobs is in loose sight.

1391
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:00,920
To be frozen in the ice

1392
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,380
like the Frankenstein in us,

1393
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,260
which we lost.

1394
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,580
Lost? Where did it go?

1395
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,800
Well, I mean, we lost ownership of it.

1396
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:10,000
But that's where Bob is?

1397
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:11,260
One of the Bobs?

1398
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,440
The one that puzzling evidence shot.

1399
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,040
Damn you.

1400
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,700
But he's like a...

1401
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,480
What's a real flesh and blood Bob?

1402
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:20,180
Bob, that Bob.

1403
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:20,960
Wow.

1404
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:22,580
The scary Bob.

1405
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:25,820
When I introduced people to that Bob,

1406
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:26,740
they would...

1407
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,140
I remember where I was that day.

1408
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,120
...do a great big double take.

1409
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,560
The last thing you expect

1410
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,700
is actually to be introduced to Bob.

1411
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,180
A small Bob.

1412
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,340
But then came that terrible day,

1413
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,960
the Victoria Theatre Show.

1414
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,940
The anniversary of the beheading

1415
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:48,580
of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette.

1416
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,500
The assassination of Bob.

1417
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:55,600
Yeah, we all remember where we were that day, don't we?

1418
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:56,680
I know where I was.

1419
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:59,380
And it's on videotape to prove it.

1420
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,520
So, we have one Bob buried in Dallas.

1421
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:07,800
Is that right?

1422
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,400
Well, you go back over the

1423
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,900
Hinckley Commission hearings,

1424
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:14,920
the entire official answer

1425
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:17,360
was sort of cobbled together

1426
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,340
out of variants.

1427
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,360
Strains of rumor and innuendo.

1428
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:24,340
Where's the director?

1429
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,760
Let's get on with it!

1430
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:33,340
Cut, cut, cut!

1431
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:36,260
Cut!

1432
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:36,900
Cut!

1433
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:37,020
Cut!

1434
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:39,520
Hey, Harvey!

1435
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:41,280
I didn't know you were...

1436
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,180
It's his money, isn't it?

1437
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,400
Well, I'm sorry, but you got it.

1438
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:43,780
You got it.

1439
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:44,180
Let's shot this.

1440
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:44,880
Hot shot!

1441
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:45,960
What are you talking about?

1442
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:49,660
What have you been doing?

1443
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:51,000
I've gotta get out.

1444
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,480
I've gotta get out of here.

1445
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:52,660
Stop.

1446
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:53,720
What are you doing?

1447
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:54,020
Doug!

1448
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:58,680
Oh, my God!

1449
00:57:59,200 --> 00:57:59,960
I've gotta get back.

1450
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:00,820
It's 4 o'clock.

1451
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:01,600
It's 4 o'clock.

1452
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,380
My time's up.

1453
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:03,640
My time's up.

1454
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:04,100
I've gotta go.

1455
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:04,820
Please, don't.

1456
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:05,420
Please.

1457
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,180
My time's up.

1458
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:06,540
It's over.

1459
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:07,720
I've gotta go.

1460
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:08,880
I've gotta get back!

1461
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:09,840
I've gotta get back!

1462
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:10,720
I'm almost home!

1463
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:11,420
I'm here to help!

1464
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:12,460
Please, don't hurt us!

1465
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:13,500
We're not gonna hurt them.

1466
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:14,500
What's wrong?

1467
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:15,780
You have some kind of medication?

1468
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:16,460
Peg!

1469
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:16,920
Wait, wait!

1470
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:17,780
Oh, my God!

1471
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:18,980
Oh, my God!

1472
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:19,180
Oh, my God!

1473
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:29,880
What's that, dear?

1474
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,340
Oh, yes, I heard.

1475
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,520
I heard.

1476
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:35,640
Poor old Felix.

1477
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:38,480
Cut!

1478
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,360
That's lunch, everyone!

1479
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:42,480
That's it.

1480
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,000
Good.

1481
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:54,200
Now I will count three.

1482
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:00,300
At the count of three, you will wake up and remember nothing.

1483
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:05,460
One, two, three.

1484
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,820
Ten thousand dollars.

1485
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,180
What do you know?

1486
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,180
Yes, beautiful, isn't it?

1487
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:16,160
Ah, this castle is filled with rare old treasures.

1488
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:18,340
Feel free to browse, my friend.

1489
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:19,940
Thank you very much.

1490
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,600
A pleasant good evening to you.
