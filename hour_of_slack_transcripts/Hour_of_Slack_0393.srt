00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,140
If I'm not getting it, then probably a lot of other people won't get it.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,000
No, you're...

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,800
This is gonna be your best birthday party ever, Bobby.

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,620
You still have a few more decorations to put up,

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,500
but your sister's finished her breakfast now, so it's time to go sit on the potty.

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,200
Okay.

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,220
Must we stand amidst the scum to get the idea across?

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,920
These days, perversion gets a bum rap because it's being given a bad name by all the amateurs.

9
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,600
If you want to get the highbrow lowdown on all the subterranean hijinks

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,500
going on in the so-called real world you have to live in every day,

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,580
turn to us, the experts, the unchained reverends of the subgenius hour of slack.

12
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,240
Wouldn't you like to teleport your debtors into limbo,

13
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,340
smooth out the wrinkles in your brain that contain all your childhood phobias,

14
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,040
and learn how to make your car run on sheer gall?

15
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,300
Well, sure you would.

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,980
And who, tell me who, is in a better position to do that?

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,920
Than the brighter than bright J.R. Bob Dobbs and his glow-in-the-dark henchman,

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,080
that most unspeakable Reverend Ivan Stang?

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,760
Why, no one but you, after you've been exposed to an industrial storage tank full of

20
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,100
the subgenius hour of slack.

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,460
Every Sunday night at 9 on that sizzling source of nifty neutrons,

22
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:21,880
K-N-O-N, 89.3 FM in that runaway reactor of the great Midwest, Dallas, Texas.

23
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,200
There's a huge chasm between blazing truth and outright lies,

24
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,300
and you can learn to breakdance on the rope that stretches between them

25
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,980
by listening to the subgenius hour of slack.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,640
You may have to get older, but you don't have to grow up.

27
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,600
Why, just look at what it's done for us.

28
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,960
Unimaginable wealth, girls, flying saucers, and the best hip replacements money can buy.

29
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,060
Swap your oxygen bottle for some nitrous oxide and praise Bob.

30
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,680
Nurse! Nurse!

How does a human begin to learn about the OD system?

00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:24,880

00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,440
I can't tell you?

00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,780
Do not waste time blocking your ears.

41
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,920
Do not waste time seeking a soundproof shelter.

42
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,040
Try to get as far away from the sonic source as possible.

43
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,900
Do not panic.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,780
I am the first person to make this fabulous journey.

45
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,940
Suspended in the timelessness of inner space

46
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,780
are the thought waves of my first impressions.

47
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,900
They will be our only source of contact

48
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,380
once you have passed beyond the limits of normal.

49
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,580
Magnification.

50
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,840
Magnification.

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,000


52
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,900
Astronomers can describe in elaborate detail

53
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,620
what happened in a billionth of a second after the Big Bang.

54
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,240
They cannot say at all what happened a billionth of a second before the Big Bang.

Something tiny exploded into

58
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:19,120
the reality of everything large that exists in the universe today.

59
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,000
Unreal.

64
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,780
The thing that we see today is a universe which is expanding.

65
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:48,680
The point is that 15 billion years ago, everything that is in the universe today was compressed into an extraordinarily small volume.

66
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:16,420
The universe is expanding.

67
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,360
Armenians are suspicious of unterstüt par�os like Athena who ascended to the heavens in specific times.

68
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:19,360


69
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,080
than simply a story ever told...

70
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:49,020
If it began from that tiny little unmeasurable point in a void,

71
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,160
where did the point come from?

72
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,580
The Big Bang theory now has a stature comparable to Darwin's theory of evolution,

73
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,180
which is not going to be refuted.

74
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,060
It's one of the fundamental facts of life.

75
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,960
I think we live in a Big Bang universe.

76
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,720
If it's right, and matter, it all began when matter was concentrated in the size of a point.

77
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,100
How did it get that way?

78
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,140
Was there another Big Bang long before that?

79
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,140
I don't know.

80
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,320
I don't know.

81
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,680
I don't know.

82
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,500
I don't know.

83
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,960
I don't know.

84
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,580
The thing that we see today is a universe which is expanding.

85
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,260
The point is that 15 billion years ago,

86
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,480
everything that is in the universe today was compressed into an extraordinarily small volume.

87
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:34,720
That whole mass, the universe itself, is super.

88
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,640
And an even this small number is ever dangerously slow toしゃ or possible,

89
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:43,640


90
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:43,660
Just think about it.

91
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:43,700
The ocean of living right now

92
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,340
four quarters of the different oceans rewrite both the blinking globe two tenths of it into one,

93
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:47,800
which is really light.

94
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,080
And another third of the larger circle's dilution which looks like a few all-se additional rays.

95
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:49,980
The biggest uh,

96
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:49,980


97
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:49,980


98
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,200
the largest celestial 2006 Sindh-USA cone,

99
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,640
The stories he has ever told.

100
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:19,840
It began from that tiny, little, unmeasurable point in a void.

101
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,860
Where did the point come from?

102
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,600
How did it get that way?

103
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,600
Was there another Big Bang long before that?

104
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,800
It's an amazing philosophical puzzle, isn't it?

105
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,840
Because you have to try to imagine what the universe was like before there was a universe.

106
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,560
A

107
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,320
Yes, friends.

108
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:13,320
A properly spacey and beautiful and cosmic piece called In Search Of by our good friend in Ohio,

109
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:20,820
Reverend Ray Sammartano, off of his album Peeling the Big Blue.

110
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:30,100
A properly philosophical pillow upon which to base the ironies to come.

111
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,560
Yes, we'll get a little bit more down to earth, I'm afraid.

112
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,640
It's party time!

113
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,440
I'm up here.

114
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,860
That little single.

115
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,160
Let's get that diaper off.

116
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:51,180


117
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:51,180


118
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:51,180


119
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:51,180


120
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:51,180


121
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,160
I use my potty when I have to pee.

122
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:05,400
I use my potty when I have to pee.

123
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,620
I use my potty when I have to pee.

124
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,460
Now I am learning how.

125
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,180
Gangster Computer Science.

126
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:21,180


127
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:21,180

The Master God Worldwide Secret Containment Policy.

129
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,280
Ha ha ha ha ha ha. See what I mean?

130
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,920
It gets worse and worse and worse.

131
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:41,440
Well, it's so much fun to, you know, here at the Subgenius Foundation, we've been working on a new book.

132
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:49,300
And for the last week, I've been piecing together the notes for my very favorite chapter.

133
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,160
The chapter of the book.

134
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,440
It's a chapter about the hate.

135
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,840
The hate, dear friends, of the conspiracy.

136
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:02,480
All out hate and paranoia directed at the normals.

137
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:10,700
This chapter will go into explaining the traits of the subgenie versus those of the pinks.

138
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:19,360
The various conspiracies, political fundamentalists, new age, PC, fashion, etc.

139
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:26,600
Generally, it's about the natural inferiority of the human.

140
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:32,980
An entire chapter, friends, devoted to the faults of the pink.

141
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:42,340
On what's wrong with them and why we're so much better than him.

142
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,160
The pink.

143
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,220
And we were thinking about, uh, title.

144
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,340
Uh, title.

145
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:49,900
Following the chapter.

146
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,100
The natural inferiority of the pink.

147
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,480
Or we might call it, Man and the Subgenius.

148
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:06,060
Or we may call it, Revenge of the Neanderthals.

149
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:13,260
But I think, friends, what we're probably gonna more likely call it is, The Difference.

150
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,240
Because that's what we are.

151
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,320
And that's, uh, what we can certainly, uh, call it.

152
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,620
The

153
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,880
hope to make.

154
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:29,320
Oh, uh, hopefully I'll, uh, do some sermons from this chapter in weeks coming up.

155
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,340
It covers the crimes of the conspiracy.

156
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:39,680
The types of pinks, such as the, the deep pink versus the shallow pink or the quote,

157
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,320
benign pink.

158
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,640
And the types of subgeniuses, yes.

159
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,140
And, most important of all, how to fight the conspiracy.

160
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:49,300
So, uh, I think, uh, I'm, I'm, I'm, uh, I'm not sure.

161
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:49,580
Anybody else?

162
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:49,580


163
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:55,440
Because you know, uh, friends, as, uh, Pope Michael Flores and a bunch of us actually

164
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:03,540
all said it once, one of the Lee Harvey Oswalds acted alone.

165
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:11,960
But, uh, moreover as Charles Baudelaire said, moreover, to become serious about a subject

166
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:19,280
that is as sad as it is laughable, is it not a really stupefying thing to see a neanderthal

167
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,280


168
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,280


169
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,280


170
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,280


171
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:27,760
nation, several nations, and presently all humanity, say to its wise men, its magicians,

172
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:34,940
I shall love you and I shall make you great if you convince me that we're all progressing

173
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:39,300
unconsciously, inevitably, while sleeping.

174
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,020
Rid us of responsibility.

175
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:47,460
Fail for us the humiliation of comparisons.

176
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:56,520
Turn history into sophistries and you will be able to call yourselves the wisest of the wise.

177
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:09,540
Or, as Charles Manson once said, a free mind creating thought may seem in raw form to be mad.

178
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,000
Or, in the words of Charles Manson,

179
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,100
In the words of our good compatriot, Jainer Hyperpleits,

180
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:30,280
People laughed at me as a prophet, but many of the people who laughed at me yesterday are not laughing quite so loudly today.

181
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:42,980
And many of the people who are still laughing at me today perhaps will not be laughing at me quite so loudly.

182
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,480
And many of the people who are still laughing at me today are not laughing quite so loudly tomorrow.

183
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:54,680
When I was the skinniest person in ninth grade, many people chose to laugh at me.

184
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:09,880
However, when I attended the funerals of these same men, I found that the air itself was burst with a yetinson chorale of mocking, braying, sneering laughter.

185
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,980
They used to push me.

186
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:12,980


187
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,240
They used to push me and shove me around.

188
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:22,000
But when Bob Dogs comes into power, I will push and shove them around in boxcars.

189
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,140
People used to smile at me in point.

190
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:33,220
And they're still smiling, for their flesh is rotting back, revealing the teeth of the skull.

191
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,100
There are no frowning corpses.

192
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,320
Oh yes, they're still smiling.

193
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,980
The only difference is that now, I, I am a human.

194
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:42,980


195
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:42,980


196
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,920
I am smiling with them.

197
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,060
I am smiling with them.

198
00:15:47,060 --> 00:16:00,340
Uh, yes, and friends, as I said, Bob's hierarchy will pervert the subgenius religion just as Jesus' Peter ruined Christianity.

199
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,900
And as our guru, J.R. Bob Dogs, said in 1954,

200
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,560
Forgive them first, and then,

201
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
you can kill them.

202
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:20,020
And as some dumb idiot jerk said,

203
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,720
I hate them sub-gum guys.

204
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,100
They said I was a dumb idiot jerk.

205
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,180
Or as my father,

206
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:34,020
uh, Captain H.M. Stang said,

207
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,460
It's the bizarre idiots that act smart.

208
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,440
And as Charles Fort once said,

209
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,880
I think, therefore, I'm going to have breakfast.

210
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,960
And as Reverend Boxholder, whoever he is, once said,

211
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,060
What do you throw a pink who's drowning in quicksand?

212
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,640
His wife and child.

213
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,440
And as an old man, I think, therefore, I'm going to have breakfast.

214
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,160
And as an unknown subgenius said,

215
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:17,620
Slavery under Dobbs is preferable to freedom under any government.

216
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:24,100
And as Reverend Mumbles, or Dennis Worden, I think, said,

217
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:29,560
Have a nice day, died for your sins.

218
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,260
And as bespoken by the nihilist team,

219
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,160
I am not.

220
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,800
Therefore, I don't think.

221
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:52,060
But as Bob Dobbs said in Bobco's, uh, B-grade movie, The Evilest Monk, 1959,

222
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,420
he was playing Rasputin.

223
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,660
He said,

224
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,840
If you have a pipe, I will give you one.

225
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,640
If you do not, I will take it away from you.

226
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,080
And as Master Control said,

227
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,180
Any idiot can find something wrong with anything.

228
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,400
That's what makes an idiot!

229
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,620
Because, friends, you know, there's two kinds of people in the world.

230
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:27,640
Number one, there's those who say that there's two kinds of people in the world.

231
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,860
Those who say there's two kinds of people in the world than the other kind.

232
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,760
But, friends,

233
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,140
The second type of person is the ones who say,

234
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,060
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise damn God, Bob!

235
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,880
Because you know how it is. You look around and you wonder,

236
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:52,720
Is everybody really that shallow, stupid, ignorant, and naive?

237
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,820
Or is it me?

238
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,480
Have I become something so different, so twisted,

239
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,640
and warped by my lengthy sojourns into my own interior landscape?

240
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,700
That I'm no longer to empathize or even communicate with most of the human race?

241
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,560
Have I become such a mental mutant that I alone feel this disgust,

242
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:20,280
even hatred for the pinks who run our lives, or try to,

243
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:27,840
and despair with those pink masses who seem determined to be eternally dupes of the Shark Boys?

244
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,760
Sometimes you think it gets lonely in here,

245
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,740
but then,

246
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:39,960
I hear my fellow subgeniuses agonizing over the same things,

247
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,400
and I realize, yes!

248
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,600
Yes, it is me! And yes, I am a mutant!

249
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,880
And yes, they are all doomed!

250
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,680
And most of all, I'm not alone in this way of thinking.

251
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,120
Other mutants exist.

252
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,980
And by God's dear friends, it's the truth.

253
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,020
Huh.

254
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,900
We're a shortcut in evolution. That's what we are.

255
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,480
Let me make two points.

256
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,660
Number one, the human race, or Homo sapiens Mediocratus,

257
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,880
has successfully halted its own evolution,

258
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,280
and is now working on its own extinction.

259
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,480
If not in body, then in mind, spirit, and so forth.

260
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,340
Point number three!

261
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,780
The evolution of the Semi-Yeti race,

262
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,620
that's us,

263
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,780
has been marred by ceaseless persecution and repression

264
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:43,080
by these mongrel quasi-human race anti-Semi-Yetites

265
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:53,060
with their lightweight butt-chicken-kissing code of normality, or CON.

266
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:54,340
Congratulations!

267
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,020
Congratulations, humans.

268
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,640
You've managed to halt your own evolution.

269
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,840
Ah, but what conspiracy are we talking about, friends?

270
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,640
Which conspiracy?

271
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,540
The conspiracy that we truly hate

272
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,740
is the overall conspiracy of the normals.

273
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,480
The conspiracy that doesn't even know it's a conspiracy.

274
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,420
The confederacy of dunces that is so vast and so broad,

275
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:28,640
that it's the cause of all the lesser conspiracies.

276
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,120
And we can love those lesser conspiracies,

277
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,320
because they're not quite big enough to be worthy of our

278
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,440
grandiose and all-powering hate.

279
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,020
The JFK conspiracy,

280
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,480
the UFO bases,

281
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,820
Alternative 3,

282
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,580
fluoride in the water,

283
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,420
Iran-Contra,

284
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,340
the Republican conspiracy,

285
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,640
the Democrat conspiracy,

286
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,360
those we can love in our hate,

287
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
because we can get them out of our minds.

288
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,600
We can get our hands on those.

289
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,800
They're apart from us.

290
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,960
They're not as constantly breathing down our necks

291
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,200
as the normworms and the mere humes at large.

292
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,660
And then there's the liberal media conspiracy,

293
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,320
which is every bit as liberal as Westinghouse and GE,

294
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,540
which owns media.

295
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,480
So many, so many conspiracies of fanatics, my friends,

296
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,380
with their false explanations for the truth.

297
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:24,580
And they're not a reality.

298
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,280
False because they have explanations, period,

299
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,560
that they expect others to adhere to.

300
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,340
But, you know, whoever you are,

301
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,020
there's a conspiracy for you.

302
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,240
What about those who killed Jimmy,

303
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,540
Janice, and Jim,

304
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,420
and John,

305
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,540
and Malcolm,

306
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,160
and Martin,

307
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,860
and Jack,

308
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,480
and Uncle Sam?

309
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,740
And that's all just another tie-in

310
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,480
to the basic CIA conspiracy.

311
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,360
But then all the conspiracies are still there.

312
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,460
They're so interlocked that when you talk about one,

313
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,720
you inevitably end up drifting into another one.

314
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,360
There should be a conspiracy for everybody

315
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,500
to sink their teeth into.

316
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,560
And the church provides this all-pervasive umbrella,

317
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,700
which will allow all of you misfits

318
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,440
to get together and compare notes.

319
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,580
There's still plenty of conspiracies to go around.

320
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,740
We've started hundreds of them ourselves.

321
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,220
The important thing is,

322
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,200
don't keep this information to yourselves, friends.

323
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,040
Spread it around,

324
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,360
because human politics

325
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,420
and the squabbling of nations

326
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:37,260
is only part of what the conspiracy manipulates.

327
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,440
It has no face.

328
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,600
We know it only by its desires.

329
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,360
The thousands of little conspiracies

330
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,360
within the big conspiracy are real enough,

331
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,540
but they themselves don't even know

332
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,740
who they're really working for.

333
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,740
Many of them even mean well.

334
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,940
But they're all just ravening mouths

335
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,060
for a vast hunger with no body,

336
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:10,760
with which the Elder Gods have infected the Earth.

337
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,680
Now, of course,

338
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,060
this sounds like the product of a diseased mind,

339
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,140
but wouldn't it,

340
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,060
if what we're saying is even remotely true?

341
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,580
And the conspiracy is also a great mirror

342
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,240
of disfigurement, friends,

343
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,600
reflecting what's wrong with all of us.

344
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,420
It's much bigger than Republicans and the Democrats

345
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,740
or presidents and interlocking corporate directorates.

346
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,100
It's everything from the school bully

347
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,780
to the wimp principal,

348
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,640
from zombie moms and embittered dads

349
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,840
to the Nazis who censor school textbooks

350
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,660
and to the subgenius.

351
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,620
It's the geniuses who try to make this church

352
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,420
like all the others.

353
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,900
What you must remember, though,

354
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,740
is that more than anything else,

355
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,540
the conspiracy is an attitude,

356
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,580
a fear,

357
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,540
an irrational distrust of anything unfamiliar.

358
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,640
This fear pervades our society,

359
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,520
and it's what lets the conspiracy

360
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,980
get away with real murder

361
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,780
on a massive scale.

362
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,100
Oh, Americans love new things,

363
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,220
like Michael Jackson is new compared to The Beatles.

364
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:38,220
But if, say, a real Jesus were to show up,

365
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,020
why, it'd look just a bit too new

366
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,400
to be allowed to run loose for long.

367
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,960
Gangster computer gods

368
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,200

especially life-long constant-threshold brain-wash radio.

373
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,620
Quiet and motionless,

374
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,300
I can slightly hear it.

375
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,760
Repeatedly, this has saved my life on the streets.

376
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,160

Even unbelievable, impossible plastic surgery operations.

400
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,500
All impossible, even for dozens of vicious kosher-bosher doctors

401

The ComputerGod sealed robot-armed operating cabinet

404

Even dwarfing you over a foot, or increasing your height by two feet.

405
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,280
This is possible because ComputerGod robot operating cabinet

406
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,100
imitates your microminiature electrical current intelligence system in your body.

407
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,880
It even duplicates the microminiature electric currents

408
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,740
that soften your broken bones to create mending of them,

409
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,360
and then creates stress either compressing the bones, thereby shortening them,

410
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,600
or stress to make the bones grow longer.

00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,360
I am learning how.

428
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,320
It's okay if you don't need to go right now, Katie.

429
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,280
Just let me know when you do need to go to the party.

430
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,320
Okay.

431
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,000
Okay.

432
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,740
You're doing so good.

433
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,340
On the floor.

434
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,120
Put it on the floor.

435
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,180
Gently.

436
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,860
Now, just what could have happened to get such a piece of trice?

437
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,260
You have no idea what happened.

438
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:31,340


439
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:31,340


440
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:31,340


441
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:31,340


442
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:31,340


443
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:31,340


444
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:31,340


445
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:31,340


446
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:31,340


447
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:31,340


448
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:31,340


449
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:31,340


450
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:31,340


451
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,800
I've gone through the last three months.

452
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,840
And your conscious mind just doesn't see it.

453
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:41,420
Well, when they came out in 1956 with the subliminals, there were two different people,

454
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:47,060
or types of people, that went to Dr. Hal Becker right away and wanted to use this subliminal.

455
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,020
And you can probably guess who they were.

456
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,480
They were preachers and they were politicians.

457
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:59,000
Because the preachers would love to get converts, and the politicians would just love to get votes.

458
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,600
And a lot of politicians we would never vote for if we had any choice about it.

459
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:09,460
But they found if they used subliminals, they could get votes from people who would never support them normally.

460
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,440
And the same thing with people teaching false religions.

461
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,340
That whole game, that whole game is somewhere.

462
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,660
And the movies, the movies ain't doing but program your thing.

463
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,340
They say, put them all on dope.

464
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,760
And all the movies started glamorizing drugs.

465
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,420
Yeah, that's what Hollywood is about.

466
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,200
Hollywood ain't about a trick.

467
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,180
Glamorize drugs.

468
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,960
The French connection, Academy Award winning.

469
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,860
Then how many of y'all saw a movie called Midnight Express?

470
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,680
About a white boy over there and a turkey smuggling drugs.

471
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:49,080
And they caught him and the movie made the white drug smuggler the hero.

472
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,440
And the Turks who caught him made them the pigs.

473
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,060
Look at that.

474
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,300
Later in the day.

475
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,460
Hey, whoa!

476
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,420
Black souls incorporated.

477
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,480
Bobby Wobby sat on the wall.

478
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,300
Bobby Wobby had a great fall.

479
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:28,980
All those genius horses and men couldn't put Bobby Wobby back together.

480
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,540
together again.

481
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:41,500
Even hairy body and furry body, mustached bearded women, even wipe-on synthetic hormones

482
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,600
causing cancerous growth, bloating, swelling, deformed big pickle nose, bulldog hanging

483
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:51,700
cheeks and jowls, from teenage gradual wipe-on, yellowing, browning and blackening of teeth,

484
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,860
and instant grinding and acids leaving hollow brown stumps, so vocal cords are made raspy,

485
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:02,340
aged, creating a wrinkled, ugly, gargoylic, clown booze face worldwide population by age

486
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:08,800
70, deformed, crippled, weak and brain damaged, new, senile, lingering for inevitability of

487
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,900
gradualness, extermination.

488
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,340
For your only hope for a future, do you know one word of pray for me, Francis E. Deck?

489
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:21,280
Computer God computerized brain thinking sealed robot operating arm surgery cabinet machine

490
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:26,780
removal of most of the frontal command lobe of the brain gradually during lifetime and

491
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:32,080
overnight in all insane asylums after computer god kosher bosher one month probation period

492
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:36,720
creating helpless, hopeless, computer god, frankenstein, earphone, radio, parroting puppet,

493
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:41,400
brainless slaves resulting in millions of hopeless, helpless, homeless derelicts in

494
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,940
all Jerusalem, USA, cities and Soviet slave work camps.

495
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:51,320
Something is implanted, an instinct, a blind compulsion to act for them.

496
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,160
But Quatermass, if you're right, what's going to happen?

497
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,320
What's the ultimate object?

498
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,840
I hesitate to guess and speculate.

499
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:56,840


500
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,160
Except for one aspect, doctor.

501
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:02,920
First, a few of these things came here at random, scattered, and then expended themselves

502
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,940
to a purpose.

503
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:08,020
A year ago, phase number two, the concentrated attack.

504
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,320
Let's do that!

505
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:17,280
TheTechSubgenius is that the Church of the subgenius will help you pull the wool over

506
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,800
your own eyes.

507
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,820
That's right, children, pull the wool.

508
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,900
What do we mean by this, children?

509
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,460
While every since you were a little bitty baby, every since you were a little girl and

510
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,840
a little boy, you've been so much.

511
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:32,440
your families' wool, your churches' wool, your schools' wool, your governors' wool.

512
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:44,400
This is our land, a land of peace and of plenty, a land of harmony and hope.

513
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:50,220
This is our land, Oceania.

514
00:34:52,600 --> 00:35:00,160
These are our people, the workers, the strivers, the builders.

515
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:12,300
These are our people, the builders of our world, struggling, fighting.

516
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,820
That's us, friends.

517
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,200
Struggling and fighting.

518
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:47,480
Struggling and fighting.

519
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,740
St. Joe Riley here in Dallas.

520
00:35:53,940 --> 00:36:01,320
A wonderful little potty time tape contributed by St. Jay Condom.

521
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:07,940
Oddly enough, ironically enough, the author of P-Dog, among other great works.

522
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:17,040
And, of course, Francis E. Deck, the great, great ranter.

523
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,140
Perhaps one of the most intense ranters.

524
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,480
One of the most intense ranters who has ever existed.

525
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,580
Just short of this one.

526
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,160
Papa Joe Mama.

527
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,100
Hello, friends, and welcome.

528
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:35,120
The sermon tonight is entitled, The Last Chance.

529
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:43,480
Yes, friends, 1998 is fast approaching, and a lot of people out there have come to expect the church to start singing a different tune about the Judgment Day.

530
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,720
They say, hey, did you hear the news?

531
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,520
The Berlin Wall has fallen.

532
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,540
Things are getting better.

533
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,580
We say, is that so?

534
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:52,000
They say, hey, did you read the paper?

535
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,020
The Russians are now our friends.

536
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,360
Things are getting better.

537
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,600
We say, is that so?

538
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,320
They say, hey, did you see it on CNN?

539
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,060
We won the war.

540
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,360
Things are getting better.

541
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,780
Is that so?

542
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:08,760
And now they come a-running and a-cheerin', saying, roll out the barrel.

543
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,400
We now have a new president.

544
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,060
The Republicans are out.

545
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,560
The recession is over.

546
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,080
It's the year of the woman.

547
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,260
Everybody get naked.

548
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,360
You poor, pitiful little.

549
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:19,980
Pinks!

550
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:24,680
Do you really think an eternity of sin can be erased so easily?

551
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:30,480
Are we now supposed to embrace the conspiracy and call off the excess invasion?

552
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:38,300
Do you actually believe you can defuse an entire revolution with a few scraps of conspiracy compromise?

553
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,740
Never!

554
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:46,740
These petty little sidelines of having nice day news don't defer to our attention from the real issue, not for a second.

555
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,300
Dateline, Washington.

556
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,300
New conspiracy.

557
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,080
Conspiracy president sworn into office.

558
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:57,660
Promises new conspiracy health care plan to keep worker drones healthy and make more capable of serving the state.

559
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,760
More to follow.

560
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,140
Dateline, New York.

561
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:06,540
U.N. meets for conspiracy roll call vote of conspiracy agenda for global conspiracy world domination.

562
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:11,580
Renegade nations refusing to conform to new world order will be penalized.

563
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,500
More to follow.

564
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,160
Dateline, planet Earth.

565
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,600
Conspiracy in last ditch effort to avert bloody overthrow.

566
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:27,560
Attempts to utilize all arms of conspiracy propaganda machine to convince subgenius rebel rousers world is now A-OK.

567
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:32,540
Member for conspiracy high command states, quote, conspiracy no longer hostile.

568
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,120
Conspiracy now friend of little guy, end quote.

569
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,120
Well, well, well, the world is getting better.

570
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,960
We should just call off the invasion before it's too late.

571
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:42,820
Wrong!

572
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:46,060
You can fool some of the subgenies some of the time.

573
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,460
But you can't fool any of the overmen.

574
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,420
Any of the time.

575
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,840
They're much too in tune to the wily ways of the wicked one.

576
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,920
I'm talking about you, Mr. Pink Boy.

577
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:55,780
Yes, you.

578
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,820
The one with the firm handshake and the easy smile.

579
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:04,460
You're not tricking anyone with your bold new vision or JFK idealism.

580
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,980
We in the church go by one credo.

581
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:12,720
Ask not what the conspiracy can do to you, but what you can do to the conspiracy.

582
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,660
And come July 5th, 1998, we're going to put that motto into simultaneous.

583
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:24,380
We're tear down delicious or

584
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:35,180
This otheresting olive oil , when the money of college laterторы

585
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:39,700
indication ago early, what the麦

586
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,420
Water there's no monster out there.

587
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:48,440


588
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:54,580
society before being brought to justice. Add to that the criminal's emotional last words, his pleas

589
00:39:54,580 --> 00:40:00,220
for mercy, his insistence of his own innocence, and his reciting of all the good deeds he ever

590
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:06,180
accomplished. Then imagine the prisoner's family stepping forth, begging for his life, and witnesses

591
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:12,920
filing forward to testify to the innocence of this great man so wrongly accused. It should be no

592
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:18,800
surprise that even an intelligent but uninformed person would find themselves feeling sorry for the

593
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:25,380
poor soul and wishing him a pardon. If respected newspapers were produced and showed article after

594
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:29,800
article supporting the accused, even the most skeptical in the crowd would likely become

595
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:36,300
sympathetic. Why? Because they would see in that individual before them not a criminal guilty of

596
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:42,680
crimes against humanity, but themselves falsely accused and condemned to death for crimes they

597
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:42,900
never committed.

598
00:40:42,920 --> 00:41:12,900
By now, the executioner should be more worried about their lives than the prisoner should his. The crowd might well demand clemency, and if refused, storm the guards and free the prisoner by force. If you were part of this intervention, you would probably feel proud for the good deed you performed and the terrible injustice you averted. But if a few weeks later, you learn that the prisoner you saved was an insane serial killer, you would probably feel proud for the good deed you performed and the terrible injustice you averted.

599
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:40,620
By now, the executioner should be more worried about their lives than the prisoner you saved. If respected newspapers were produced and showed article supporting the accused, even the most skeptical in the crowd would likely become sympathetic. If respected newspapers were produced and showed article supporting the accused, you would probably feel proud for the good deed you performed and the terrible injustice you averted. But if a few weeks later, you learn that the prisoner you saved was an insane serial killer, you would probably feel proud for the good deed you performed and the terrible injustice you averted.

600
00:41:42,920 --> 00:42:00,420
You'd probably start to feel anger. Anger at yourself for being fooled. Anger at the actors who tricked you and the newspapers that lied to you. And anger at all the mental dweebs still running around out there claiming the bastard is really reformed and just misunderstood.

601
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:11,620
This is how we at the church feel about the conspiracy. Each and every one of us at one time or another believed the conspiracy.

602
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:25,860
Each and every one of us in one way or another served the conspiracy. And every single one of us in no uncertain terms knows that the conspiracy is out to get us.

603
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:41,420
Every day it tries to capture us, torture us, and enslave our kind. And every single time we get close to destroying the monster, some well-meaning but ignorant bystander starts whining that we're being too severe.

604
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:55,300
Too extreme. They say that the conspiracy is actually innocent. They say they know because they read all about it in the conspiracy newspapers or saw it all explained to them on conspiracy TV.

605
00:42:55,540 --> 00:43:10,560
They insist that our allegations are exaggerated, that the conspiracy is getting better, and that we should just mellow out. They try to tell us that we ought to give the conspiracy slack.

606
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:25,020
Dear, dear friends, these poor misguided morons may be in the dark now just as we were before. And we may have acted back then just as stupid as they're acting now.

607
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:33,300
But that doesn't mean we don't have the right, nay the duty, to destroy the conspiracy while we have the chance.

608
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:41,600
Do not be taken in by any last-minute media blitz that tries to convince you that the conspiracy is true.

609
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:51,500
The conspiracy has suddenly turned over a new leaf, because it hasn't. The noose is around its neck. What do you expect the conspiracy to say? We deserve to die? Kill us?

610
00:43:51,720 --> 00:44:05,420
No. The conspiracy will look and act nicer now than it ever has before. So don't be fooled. If you hesitate, even for a second, you give the conspiracy a chance to win the crowd over.

611
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:11,600
And if that happens, you may find yourself on trial with no more X's around to pull your facet.

612
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:26,760
Except from the firing squad. There's only one X day, dear friends. Don't blow it. July 5th, 1998. Kill the conspiracy. Cut off its head and launch it through the cosmos.

613
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,880
Here into the wood of our praise, Bob. Amen.

614
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:39,360
The builders of our world. Struggling. Fighting. Bleeding. Dying.

615
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:48,020
On our cities. And on the far-flung battlefields. Fighting against the mutilation of our hopes and dreams.

616
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:53,140
I've accidentally raised the powers of darkness. Please come.

617
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:57,980
Oh, that's all right. Here, hold on, hold on. We'll get to you. We'll get to you.

618
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:04,560
I'm sorry it is against my religion to operate the heat and the stress as they do.

619
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:11,500
Oh, dear, it's that other boring caller. But because we believe in the sanctity of all the human being, we will let him go.

620
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:11,600
I've cut my beard and I'm going to the bathroom.

621
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,420
It wasn't a coke bottle. It was a can and it really happened.

622
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,380
It did not. Fatty Arbuckle was absolutely innocent.

623
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,220
No, it wasn't.

624
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:28,460
Eventual brain lobotomization of the entire world population for the worldwide deadly gangster communist computer god overall plan.

625
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,180
So, politics is a dead issue and let me explain to you why.

626
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:32,980
Why?

627
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:40,100
You can go to Poland and vote, children, if you want to vote. You can go to Chile and vote if you want to vote, children.

628
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,580
And the people that live there can't vote.

629
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:41,580


630
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,740
They don't even know what they're voting for.

631
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:47,380
And you know what they see as democratic freedom, children?

632
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,460
I'll tell you. You know what they want in Russia, children?

633
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:51,280
What do they want?

634
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:55,240
They want Led Zeppelin albums and 501 Blues, children.

635
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,200
Led Zeppelin! Led Zeppelin!

636
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:03,720
The products of a free society are now mistaken for the society which had the freedom to produce them.

637
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:08,940
So nobody around the country, around the world, is looking for politics, children.

638
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,580
They want ghetto blasters as big as they can get.

639
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:11,800
They want the Colorado.

640
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:12,880
Big!

641
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,000
Big!

642
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:16,000
More slack!

643
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:26,260
When you invest in pop culture, which is what you've been given as a substitute for politics, children, you get bored in a hurry.

644
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,500
And you get bored in a hurry so that you'll go out and buy more pop culture.

645
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:32,300
More!

646
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:40,360
And you're so convinced that your taste in rock and roll or art or movies is what defines you, children,

647
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:44,160
that you buy and buy and buy to shore up that definition.

648
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,400
And you're playing right into the conspiracy's hands, children.

649
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,180
Right! Right!

650
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:54,740
But as it turns out, children, you're also playing into our hands, children, because Bob is a savior designed for a consuming society.

651
00:46:54,980 --> 00:47:00,220
Bob is a short duration personal savior.

652
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:01,400
That's right, children.

653
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:08,640
Bob wants you to take him into your heart, to take him into your mind, to take him into your what?

654
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,000
What?

655
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:09,000


656
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,700
And then cast him out, children, and make your own church.

657
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:21,740
And children, when you look around at the shambles that the modern world has become, children, don't blame Bob.

658
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,580
He doesn't make history.

659
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,260
He just exploits it.

660
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:34,860
And if children, if you look at these subgeniuses and you see how deep their devotion is and how truly they believe and how much Bob means to them,

661
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:35,800
and you say,

662
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,800
a joke is all that's left, children,

663
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:45,640
yes, that's true, children, but it's a joke you can believe in.

664
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:52,220
And you say this was the eve of destruction.

665
00:47:55,860 --> 00:48:00,360
Surely, my friend, you must have been bled.

666
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:05,780
I can see all the pain.

667
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,660
Yes, so can I.

668
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:27,840
It's a joke.

669
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:28,880
I think you should stay silent a saint will be bled.

670
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:28,880


671
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,280
Well, you have to be.

672
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:35,760
And then you're carry on this joke that rename your life.

673
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:35,760


674
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:56,640
We are here tonight to talk about, to preach a word of hatred for normalcy, children.

675
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:10,280
Unlike the Naomi Pamby Christians and the New Agers, the subgenius is a religion of hate.

676
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:15,160
Now we're not talking about just any old ordinary hate.

677
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:18,860
You can't just talk about some mealy-mouthed, wimpy little,

678
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:23,260
Oh, I just hate President Reagan so much.

679
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:25,980
You know, I just...

680
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,160
hate this society.

681
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,120
Or even worse,

682
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,000
you know, I just hate myself.

683
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:40,400
What we're talking about when we say hate is an all-encompassing,

684
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,520
an all-interesting,

685
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,460
an infinite hate!

686
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,280
Hate! Hate! Hate!

687
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:53,200
I'm too busy hating!

688
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,980
Hate! Hate! Hate!

689
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:56,900
Hate! Hate! Hate!

690
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:04,100
Because it is our hate of the pink boys, the normals, that gives us our unruly psychic powers.

691
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:07,120
Yes, in the Church of the Subgenius you can learn psychic powers.

692
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,760
Learn to actually read your own mind!

693
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:10,840
Oh!

694
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:11,320


695
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,220
Predict the past and present!

696
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,220
Oh!

697
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,100
Become master of the universe!

698
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:19,660
While losing weight!

699
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:20,700
Oh!

700
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:21,320
Oh!

701
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,660
Dominate yourself!

702
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,900
Revenge on yourself!

703
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:33,940
Incorrect answers to questions you never would have thought of to ask anyway!

704
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,860
The infinity series collects them all!

705
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,880
But you might ask, who's this hate-directed at, children?

706
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:55,960
There are some men whose level of hideousness, protest, repugnance, reaches such levels that they are not worthy of being called up for.

707
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:55,960


708
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:59,620
We have coined a special phrase for these men.

709
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,300
We call them idols of hate!

710
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:06,840
Kill me!

711
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:07,820
Kill me somebody!

712
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:08,640
Can I get a witness?

713
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,440
Can I get a witness?

714
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,340
Can I get a hate?

715
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,340
Can I get a hate?

716
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,400
Can I get a kill me?

717
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,960
Kill me somebody! Kill me somebody!

718
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,400
Pull the lever down and go, she ain't got no legs!

719
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,760
My legs are on fire now!

720
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,180
Now who are some of these idols of hate?

721
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,220
Well!

722
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,780
I think you know who we're talking about.

723
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:35,120
Mr. Dishonest TV Evangelist, sir.

724
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,620
Mr. Top 40 Radio Programmer, sir.

725
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:43,400
Mr. Sleazebag Corporate Executive, sir.

726
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,800
Oh, you don't even know what I'm talking about.

727
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,240
You're just living through the channels.

728
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:50,480
But by God, you don't hear me now!

729
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:52,060
Sir!

730
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:52,860
Woo!

731
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:53,980
Yes!

732
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:59,840
Now what is another example of what we call an idol of hate?

733
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,440
Mr. Top 40 Radio Programmer, sir.

734
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:09,260
Another example of an idol of hate is the guy we call Mr. Just His Way.

735
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,420
Oh, I'm sure you've met Mr. Just His Way.

736
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,460
Is he totally cruel and obnoxious?

737
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:15,780
Well, that's just his way.

738
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,640
Did he pound your face in with two concrete blocks?

739
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,160
Well, that's just his way.

740
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,960
Mr. Top 40 Radio Programmer, sir.

741
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:30,500
Did he try to exterminate an entire race and enslave the entire Earth?

742
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,400
Well, that's just the beer talking.

743
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,460
He's alright.

744
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:41,320
And I can get into that. I think it's valid.

745
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,700
But this is just my way.

746
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:52,060
I'm just into making laugh shades from the flesh of Mr. Just His Way.

747
00:52:55,560 --> 00:53:01,800
I'm just... I'm just into painting my kitchen with the blood of Mr. Just His Way.

748
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,820
Oh, I do like your kitchen. Do you really?

749
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:10,580
Well, it's Central Arkansas redneck. Do you think it's really me?

750
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,980
It's just the way I am, I guess.

751
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,060
Now they've got themselves a colony.

752
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,040
And all this went on for a year and nobody said anything.

753
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:25,600
But who knows how many infected people they've got in high places.

754
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,680
And what about here? Can you be sure of all your stuff?

755
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:30,020
I think so. I'll step up security in the morning.

756
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:31,880
The next move is halls.

757
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:36,140
We've got to break this conspiracy of silence and secret orders.

758
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:41,480
Your human heart follows your teachings

759
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:49,320
Now they know how long you've done

760
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:58,880
And they've heard all your two-sided preachings

761
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:05,000
Now we know just what must be won

762
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,780
In the sweet wild life

763
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:15,020
Close, freely and clearly

764
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:18,520
Come and break the now

765
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,600
While you can

766
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:26,800
And form a great circle

767
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,120
That shall not be broken

768
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:36,160
But claim the freedom of man

769
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,480
And the freedom of man

770
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,580
Now you listen to me.

771
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,060
I'll only say once.

772
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:04,800
We are not sick men.

773
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:06,920
Oh.

774
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:08,100
Oh.

775
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:08,880
Oh.

776
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:09,280
Oh.

777
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:09,500


778
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:09,560


779
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:09,560


780
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,340
Oh.

781
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:10,460
Oh.

782
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:11,000
Oh.

783
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,320
Oh.

784
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:12,900


785
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:13,040


786
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:13,040


787
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:13,220
Oh, my God.

788
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:13,220


789
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:15,720
We are not sick men.

790
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:16,220
Thank you.

791
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,620
And, yeah, some marvelous subgenius preaching there

792
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:23,160
from some of the greats.

793
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,320
The real greats.

794
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,580
Pope David N. Meyer.

795
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,040
Pope of the Great Pacific Northwest.

796
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:31,400
Idaho and New York.

797
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:36,580
Preaching on the conspiracy of democracy products.

798
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,520
And followed by Saint Jane or Hypercliff

799
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:43,020
with the classic hate speech.

800
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:43,020


801
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:49,620
Mr. Just His Way from, I believe, the Boston Babylon of preaching and friends.

802
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:56,000
You know, you can learn more about that hate and where to pump your hate up

803
00:55:57,060 --> 00:56:01,080
by writing for free information from the Church of the Subgenius.

804
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:06,400
And what happens when you do that is you get a little catalog.

805
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:10,340
Basically, it tells you how much money you could spend later on.

806
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,580
On books, tapes, and so forth and so on.

807
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:19,940
And friends, just write for that free information from Bob.

808
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:22,740
You can just address it to Bob.

809
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:24,560
You got that pencil ready?

810
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:36,800
That's old Bobby at Post Office Box 140306.

811
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:39,020
That's Box 140306.

812
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,040
In.

813
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:40,680
Mighty.

814
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,020
Dallas, Texas.

815
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,020
Dallas, Texas, dear friends.

816
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:49,860
75214.

817
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:55,640
And we'll be looking forward to hearing from you so, so soon.

818
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:56,660
Bye.

819
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,520
That was fun.

820
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:13,560
Bye.

821
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:25,880
What you are about to see, you may find hard to believe.

822
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:36,800
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P.

823
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:39,920
Lizzie, before we leave for Bobby's party,

824
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,080
you need to go to the party.

825
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,400
Okay, Daddy.

826
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:43,660
You need any help?

827
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:44,640
No, thanks.

828
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:45,740
I can do it myself.

829
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,760
That's my girl.

830
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,900
First I put my book away.

831
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:53,260
Then we'll go to the party.

832
00:57:53,600 --> 00:58:01,620
When I use the party, Dad's so proud of me.

833
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:03,660
.

834
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:03,660


835
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:03,660


836
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:04,120
.

837
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:04,240
.

838
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:04,460
.

839
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:04,820
.

840
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:04,860
.

841
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:04,940
.

842
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:05,420
.

843
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:05,420


844
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:05,440
.

845
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:05,440


846
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,080
.

847
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:06,080


848
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:06,080


849
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:06,500
.

850
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:07,860
.

851
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:09,900
.

852
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:09,900


853
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:09,900


854
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:09,900


855
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:09,900


856
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:09,900


857
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:09,900


858
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:09,900


859
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:09,900


860
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:09,900


861
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:10,780
.

862
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:13,140
.

863
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:13,140


864
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:13,140


865
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:13,140


866
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:13,140


867
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:13,140


868
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:13,140


869
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:13,140


870
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:13,140


871
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:13,140


872
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:13,140


873
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:13,140


874
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:13,140


875
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:13,140


876
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:13,140


877
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:15,580
We really get at this, don't we, Daddy?

878
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:16,620
.

879
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:25,480
On top of your party, you're selling to poop.

880
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:36,240
Oh, life is much better when your diapers don't droop.

881
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:39,900
But you have to buy a new one.

882
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:39,900


883
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:39,900


884
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:39,900


885
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:39,900


886
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:39,900


887
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:39,900


888
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:39,900


889
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:39,900


890
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:39,900


891
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:39,900


892
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:39,900


893
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:39,900


894
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:39,900


895
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:39,900


896
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:39,900


897
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:39,900


898
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:39,900


899
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:39,900


900
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:39,900


901
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:39,900


902
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:39,900


903
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:39,900


904
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:42,320
You have to be patient.

905
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,500
Just sit there and smile.

906
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,240
But instead of waiting,

907
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:57,380
why not read for a while?

908
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,300
I'm done, Daddy.

909
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:08,960
Okay. Don't forget to wipe, flush, and wash your hands.

910
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:26,960
How often do you engage in unorthodox sexual practices?

911
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,720
Good work, joining our pageant.

914
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:01,460
Coming to例えば

01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:01,620
liner

916
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:03,740
Oh,

917
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:05,180
so gentle.

918
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:09,700
Come on now, break the silence

It's a sex party

923
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,640
Walking through revolving doors

924
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,460
The system stays intact

925
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:48,400
Climbing walls, your ass is me

926
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,680
Fingernails claw at my back

927
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:56,320
Pagan forces cling to us

928
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:59,400
As we slide in and out of time

929
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:03,880
It's a sex party

930
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,280
It's a sex party

931
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:05,280


932
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:08,100
It's an emotional breakdown

933
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,680
It's a sex party

934
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:43,460
Come on now, break the silence

Come on now, break the silence

Now, now, I'm wild

937
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:29,860
It's a sex party

938
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:34,020
It's an emotional breakdown

939
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:35,280
It's a sex party
