1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
There's no place quite like home, is there?

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,060
Are you going home?

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,980
I'm going to the city, Talkin' Ham.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,440
I don't know nobody in Talkin' Ham.

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,660
I'm gonna do some things there.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,240
I know George Sparks in Talkin' Ham.

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,460
I'm gonna do some things I ain't never done before.

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,580
I reckon you think you've been redeemed.

9
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,840
Shane, look out!

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,720
The subgenius powerhouse.

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:55,380
So here at subgenius X day number 12.

12
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,340
Number 12?

13
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,400
What happened to number 11?

14
00:00:59,480 --> 00:00:59,980
I don't remember.

15
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,760
I don't remember it at all.

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, that was the 11th hour.

17
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:08,840
The stroke before the final stroke of midnight.

18
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,420
For I think there can no longer be any doubt

19
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,680
that we are nearby to achieving a kind of culmination.

20
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,920
Here is one proof.

21
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,220
Everyone who had to get here

22
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,000
had to struggle against strange forces

23
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,960
trying to draw back and keep us from getting there.

24
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:29,960


25
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:29,960


26
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:29,960


27
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:29,960


28
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:29,960


29
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:29,960


30
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:29,960


31
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:29,960


32
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,120
Getting to the Brushwood campground.

33
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,960
These were the imps of sedition,

34
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,020
and treason,

35
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,580
tugging at us,

36
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,680
and pulling at us,

37
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,480
the ones who produce a million excuses

38
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,080
why we should not go forth

39
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,340
from our habitations

40
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,120
and gather together as is our immemorial practice.

41
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,800
But as a magnet grows stronger,

42
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,300
as it approaches another magnet

43
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,960
as the familiar contours of venus,

44
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:09,640
of brushwood began to appear, we are now sure in our course and directly drawn to this,

45
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:17,140
the pinpoint upon which we will dance in the culmination of our destiny.

46
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,580
All we need now is the little box of batteries, which I shall now fetch.

47
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,720
Yes, we have to have the right number of batteries, the cable connectors and the

48
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:37,220
adapters of course, the special adapters for the adapters and the extra cables and

49
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:46,100
cable connector extenders, which will extend this past the last unforgivable moment.

50
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:57,920
Swirling in a maelstrom to suck us all beneath the surface, to draw us inexorably deeper

51
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,700
into the inner thing.

52
00:02:59,700 --> 00:02:59,700


53
00:02:59,700 --> 00:02:59,700


54
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:10,340
things, the deeper things of Bob. Like an undersea landscape, sometimes these things

55
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:20,660
are only dimly glimpsed, fluttering and flashing at the periphery of our vision, nowhere cleanly

56
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:30,820
seen, but soon the contours become all too obvious, and what we are looking at disgracefully

57
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:39,560
concrete and unavoidably real and present. Ah, nobody ever said it would be easy to quit

58
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:48,700
this life. It might be like the snapping of ice at a spring thaw, the twanging of a string

59
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,240
of an instrument.

Van Athel gas oh oh I know what gas they say huff here I'm sorry I even mentioned

67
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:10,440
it yes in some ways our countrified cousins are definitely stumbling behind

68
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:17,040
the curve but on the other hand one goes out to the open spaces to experience the

69
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,620
natural beauty of God's universe and then finds a bear huffing jingle and

70
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,320
then finds what did you say a bear humping a tree no a bear huffing jingle

71
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,900
Oh a bear huffing jenka oh yes all right that too it is possible it is possible

72
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:38,720
you know the olfactory senses of those creatures are far more highly developed

73
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,380
and those of the foolish humans there's a lot of highly I don't know about

74
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,380
developed well it's a

75
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:56,100
olfactory sensorium unrivaled in the animal kingdom I need to develop a

76
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:01,400
highly well what you need is to develop respiratory turbinates or a turbinals

77
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:08,280
which will increase your human sinus if you have no turbinals turbinals may be

78
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:15,060
provided for you by a procedure and certain fissions to a droid to be called

79
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,820
surgery

80
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,020
and this is the animal kingdom

81
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,420
just for you?

82
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:17,420


83
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,320
this we also call opening your third

84
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:27,420
nostril a common surgical procedure in the upper echelons of the church many who

85
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:35,120
dreaded it and shrank back from it now point to their sub nasal scar with a

86
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,560
wink and a smile of fellowship and recognition

87
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,580
you know that's what happened. Michael Jackson he opened his third

88
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,020
nostril but then he kept going. He opened it took too wide. In the sixth and the seventh and ninth nostril.

89
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,600
and the eighth and the ninth, and by the time he got to opening that 13th nostril,

90
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,680
then he looked like the ghastly figure he was right before his death.

91
00:07:53,860 --> 00:08:00,540
The replacement appliance was finally introduced with a sigh of relief by the recipient.

92
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,840
After so many failed operations, and believe me, I know a little bit about this,

93
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:10,780
because my own assistant had so many plastic surgery operations,

94
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,800
he finally decided to give up and embrace his monster nature.

95
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,500
And it was the right decision. Everybody loves him. He's a beloved figure.

96
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,020
So did he get the plastic surgery to become the monster?

97
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:31,540
He got the plastic surgery just to become quasi-human, but it hurt,

98
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,680
and he was tired of these endless operations, so he just said,

99
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,840
I'll just be as I am, and so he is.

100
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,600
As you were?

101
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:43,800
Yes. And it's great. Nobody else looks like him.

102
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,560
But anyway, it shouldn't be.

103
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,320
I'm not yacking about him, because we're here now.

104
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,680
And it's time to hang Bob.

105
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,260
Or at least you had an assistant to get the plastic surgery.

106
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,260
I had to do all the assisting and get the plastic surgery myself.

107
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,500
Well, I didn't arrange it that way.

108
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,940
As you know, Dr. Stang, this fell out.

109
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,940
It was an evolutionary process.

110
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,040
And since it occurred as it did,

111
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,840
it occurred as it should.

112
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,880
Stands to reason.

113
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,640
Does it fall off like a belly button, where some people get innies and some people get outies?

114
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,240
Well, they might, indeed.

115
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:32,420
It all depends on how peaceable was their parting from the nurturing stalk.

116
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,160
Hmm.

117
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:42,040
You know, if you are snapped like a rubber band, you'll be different than if you were gently squeezed off and lovingly tied.

118
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,980
I was snapped like a broken ruler.

119
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,780
Well, I'm sure it's not.

120
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:45,780


121
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,820
But it did no harm in the long run.

122
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,800
Not in the long run.

123
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,220
Brothers and sisters!

124
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,400
Hey!

125
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,460
Y'all having a good time here at XD?

126
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,660
Yeah!

127
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,900
The rain's over, guys.

128
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,580
It's gonna be nothing but beautiful weather all weekend.

129
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,540
But if it's not, don't blame me.

130
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,160
I just lie.

131
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,640
I don't make the weather.

132
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,660
Yeah!

133
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,960
We got something special for you tonight.

134
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,780
First time here at XD.

135
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,900
From deep in the jungles of Pittsburgh.

136
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,640
The musical stylings of Fat Man D.

137
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,240
Ladies and gentlemen and everybody in between, thank you so much for coming out to the end of the world.

138
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,960
It is my pleasure to sing you Into the Apocalypse.

139
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,780
Ba bless, ba bless.

140
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,860
I got a brand new two-tone tattoo

141
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,600
And I got it just for you

142
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,140
Good lord he knows what I can do

143
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,860
With my brand new two-tone tattoo

144
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,060
I certainly hope the hairs do not hide away

145
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,120
Do you, my two-tone tattoo?

146
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,980
I got a tattoo to display

147
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,660
But if they do I'll show it to you anyway

148
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,800
My brand new two-tone tattoo

149
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,800
Ba ra ra ra

150
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,560
Me-a-ba-ba-do-do-do-do-da-la-bra

151

153
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,720
Me-a-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

154
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:41,720


155
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:42,880
Romans!

156
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,840
Countrymen, thank you so much for coming out this evening.

157
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,500
It is a beautiful, damp, damp day at Brushwood.

158
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,200
And I'm looking forward to it getting a whole lot wetter before the evening is out.

159
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,360
And in.

160
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,080
And out.

161
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,780
And in.

162
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:11,900
I was born to this planet in this form and in this formation the year 1975.

163
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:12,860
I was born to this planet in this form and in this formation the year 1975.

164
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:22,060
Ladies and gentlemen, the day that the gospel was revealed, yea, verily unto the incredibly irreverent Ivan Stang.

165
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,960
And to him I say, j'ai un grand blanc tatou.

166
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,920
J'aimerais ce respect clairement pour vous.

167
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:38,120
Le bon Dieu sait qu'est-ce que je voudrais avec mes grands blancs tatous.

168
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,180
J'espère les yeux ne peuvent pas hide away.

169
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,500
Les humains grands tatous ne disent pas le vrai.

170
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:46,720
Le humain grand tatou ne dit pas le vrai.

171
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,840
But if they do, I'll show it to you anyway.

172
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,740
My grand tatou, mon grand tatou.

173
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,680
My grand tatou, mon grand tatou, mon grand tatou.

174
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:11,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

175
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,580
Thank you so much.

176
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,540
Thank you so much.

177
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,700
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments about mine ears

178
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,620
and sometimes voices.

179
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,420
What's this?

180
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,020
A piece of a sandwich?

181
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,720
Well, how thoughtful.

182
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,380
Yes, every need is provided here.

183
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,800
Actually, it's a good piece of cheese.

184
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,580
The wonder of cheese has never been satisfactorily explained.

185
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,300
But according to historical theory,

186
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:57,960
a primitive herder carrying a noonday meal of milk

187
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,440
in a sheep's stomach, however improbable this may sound,

188
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,740
discovered rennet, that animal residuum

189
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,360
which is the kind of food that is used to make milk.

190
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,780
It's a catalyst which produces the phenomenon known as cheese.

191
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,600
So a guy who hurt people walked around with the stomach of a sheep.

192
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,140
Now why do you say he hurt people?

193
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,980
He might not have hurt anyone.

194
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,660
He might have been a solitary sheep herder.

195
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,740
So he hurt sheep?

196
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:25,960
Heard.

197
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:32,620
Do you herd sheep, my grandma sighed?

198
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,060
My grandpa leapt in fright.

199
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,580
That grammar's wrong to me, he cried.

200
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,680
Have you heard sheep is right?

201
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,840
That's better, better, much better.

202
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,280
And we have potato chips or crisps or something like that,

203
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,740
peanuts, enough to sustain life while we keep going and going.

204
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,920
And where are we going?

205
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,940
We're going to begin Hour of Slack.

206
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,460
No.

207
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:14,760
Number 1200 and something as of this moment.

208
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,480
Welcome to X Day 12.

209
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,700
Surely this will be the real thing.

210
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,880
And may you be so fused with Slack.

211
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,120
And I know this because the sandwich that I'm eating tastes too good.

212
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,860
So you went to the sandwich right away.

213
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,180
That's not a very optimistic behavior.

214
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,900
I think X Day is too big to fail.

215
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:37,780
Well, it's not.

216
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,100
It's not jinx everything.

217
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,740
I think we should apply for a bailout.

218
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,860
We're obviously too big to fail.

219
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,380
Look at this crowd.

220
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:51,340
As my eyes gaze out upon this vast sea of subgeniuses.

221
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,160
This seething mass of revolutionary subgeniuses needs to be

222
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,480
mollified and pacified by constant reiteration of the familiar doctrine.

223
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,980
Or they're really seething then.

224
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,060
.

225
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,180
.

226
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:04,660
.

227
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,660
.

228
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:05,960
.

229
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:05,960


230
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:05,960


231
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,120
.

232
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,360
.

233
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,400
.

234
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:06,420
.

235
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:06,860
.

236
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,720
.

237
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:07,720


238
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:07,720


239
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:07,720


240
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:07,720


241
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:07,720


242
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:07,720


243
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:07,720


244
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:11,440
Welcome to the stupid age.

245
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,680
That's right, welcome to the stupid age.

246
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,920
The 21st century.

247
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:32,980
A hundred years ago, Mark Twain, one of the great American writers of the 19th and 20th century,

248
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,280
declared what would later be called the Gilded Age.

249
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,860
He called it the Gilded Age as opposed to the Golden Age,

250
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,320
because in the Golden Age, everything was made of gold,

251
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:49,740
but in the Gilded Age, everything was just kind of coated with just enough patina,

252
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,140
just enough gold to make it look good.

253
00:16:53,640 --> 00:17:01,240
Just enough decoration to mask the fact that they were dealing with the exact same thing

254
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,280
they'd be dealing with.

255
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:07,060
For eons, for millennia, for thousands of years before,

256
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,780
but we had this thing called industry,

257
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:16,100
and so we had taken on this new role, this new advance to civilization,

258
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,440
but when you got right down to it, everything that everybody had in 1901

259
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,100
was the same as what everybody had in 1801.

260
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,380
It just had a better shell.

261
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,600
And so Mark Twain called this the Gilded Age.

262
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,260
It looked really good on the outside,

263
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,700
but I'm telling you, welcome to the stupid age,

264
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,140
and let me tell you something, it's stupid all the way down.

265
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,940
This isn't just a patina of stupid.

266
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:51,240
This isn't just a thin veneer of dumb.

267
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,320
This isn't just the trappings of idiocy.

268
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,440
This is the real thing.

269
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,400
This is the motherlode.

270
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,040
This is the fucking stupid.

271
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,080
This is the stupid all the way down.

272
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,060
This is the stupid age.

273
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:12,920
Welcome.

274
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:23,040
So, the thing is, as you all know, or I hope you all know,

275
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:28,980
time extends infinitely in every direction from where we are right now.

276
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,200
And when I say this is the stupid age,

277
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:39,780
I mean we're dealing with levels of stupidity on a planet-wide level that are unprecedented.

278
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:47,220
Human beings have never been able to muster this much ass-hattery,

279
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,560
this much stupidity, this much bull-headedness,

280
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:56,000
this much lack of vision heretofore,

281
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,840
unknown quantities of dumb

282
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,260
arrayed in the world.

283
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:02,260


284
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,420
And yet, upon the surface of the planet,

285
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,240
like armies marching forth,

286
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:12,020
there are phalanxes of stupid on every continent of this planet,

287
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,500
even unto Antarctica itself.

288
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,640
There is dumb everywhere.

289
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,400
We all know,

290
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,100
we all know,

291
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,000
it's bad.

292
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,220
There's stupid everywhere.

293
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,240
This is what we're dealing with.

294
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,460
This is what we've been fighting our whole lives.

295
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,460
Sometimes we fight for it.

296
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,480
Sometimes we fight against it.

297
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:43,820
But regardless, stupid is what is at...

298
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,680
Stupid is what is at play.

299
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,000
Stupid is what is at stake.

300
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,660
Stupid is nigh.

301
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,880
But this is the thing.

302
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,900
Stupid is not a concept or an entity

303
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,160
that is contained by three-dimensional space.

304
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:15,280
Stupid, like time, extends in every direction,

305
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,680
in every fucking possibility that time-space entails.

306
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,400
Stupid is there.

307
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,520
But there's a lot of it right now.

308
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:32,060
Quantities so large that it is radiating forwards and backwards

309
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:32,840
in time.

310
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:38,100
We are polluting the time-space continuum with stupid.

311
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,260
Stupid.

312
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,640
Stupid knows no master.

313
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:55,480
Stupid prevails in dark times and in bright times.

314
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,540
But here is the thing.

315
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,520
There are anchors.

316
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,020
Time is like a vibrating guitar string.

317
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,600
And when you change the length of the vibration,

318
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,400
you change the frequency of the vibration.

319
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,820
So, as things stand, there are anchor points.

320
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,260
And between those anchor points, whatever happens is irrelevant.

321
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,040
These vibrations, these temporal disruptions,

322
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,520
these vibrations are just like a chain of events.

323
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:27,520


324
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,660
The fluctuations of the temporal space-time arc,

325
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,880
it curves, and it curves towards stupidity.

326
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,460
This is tragic.

327
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,140
But it is also a triumph.

328
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,220
Because there is our stupid,

329
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,020
and there is their stupid.

330
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,360
And these are very, very different kinds of stupid.

331
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:03,860
There is the stupid that makes you quit the job

332
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,960
before you have the job.

333
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,560
And there is the stupid that makes you quit the job

334
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,720
before you have the job.

335
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,960
The stupid, the stupid is joyful,

336
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,100
but the stupid is also despondent.

337
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,620
And the stupid, as I said,

338
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,340
pervades in all directions.

339
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,960
And we are polluting the past and the future with our stupid.

340
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:39,820
I'm going to diverge slightly and talk about this time-space flow of stupid.

341
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:44,460
There's the anchor point somewhere in the distant future or the near future.

342
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,960
This is the point we call X-Day.

343
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:50,160
This is the point we call July 5th, 1998.

344
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,720
This is the moment.

345
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,480
This is the anchor point.

346
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,460
This is the cusp.

347
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,760
This is the turning point.

348
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:06,620
Many, many past eons or years or decades or millennia or ages or earths,

349
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,000
whatever term you want to use, there's another anchor point.

350
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:14,180
What happens between these anchor points doesn't affect the location of the anchor points.

351
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:18,520
What happens between these anchor points is determined by the anchor points.

352
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,720
And this is the thing, because our past and our future,

353
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,840
they are controlled by forces beyond our ken.

354
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:33,520
The conspiracy, the conspiracy of normals, the C-O-N, the con,

355
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,980
the conspiracy is waging war against us and against our kind.

356
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,980
But there are other forces arrayed against us,

357
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,580
other forces that are striking against us every moment,

358
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,140
trying to wear you down.

359
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:53,700
And these forces, they know where the points of anchor are.

360
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,180
And they do all these things in between,

361
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,740
not because they want to change those anchor points,

362
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,680
but because they can get away with it.

363
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,540
When they killed John F. Kennedy, they didn't do it to change time.

364
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,900
They do it because it wouldn't make a difference.

365
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,500
When they killed Martin Luther King,

366
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,100
they didn't do it because it would change a goddamn thing.

367
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,000
They did it because they knew it wouldn't change a thing.

368
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,000
When they killed Jesus Christ,

369
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,160
they didn't do it because it would change the world.

370
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,700
They did it because they knew it wouldn't.

371
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,000
They didn't do it because it wouldn't make a goddamn bit of difference.

372
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,180
When they killed Krishna,

373
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,180
when they killed Gandhi,

374
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,640
when they killed Mohammed,

375
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,920
when they killed every single prophet,

376
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,160
they didn't do it because it was going to change a thing.

377
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,800
They did it because they knew it wouldn't change a thing.

378
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,360
Because between these two points,

379
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,540
the anchor point in the past,

380
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,280
and the anchor point in the present,

381
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,660
and the anchor point in the future,

382
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,900
nothing will change.

383
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,260
Nothing that they do will change a thing.

384
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,040
And that's why they strike down heroes,

385
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,560
and that's why they strike down gods,

386
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,220
and that's why they strike down those

387
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,220
that should be looked upon with favor.

388
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,080
But when you get right down to it,

389
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,880
there's only one thing that you can do

390
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,260
that will change the course of time,

391
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,820
the misery, and the stupidity,

392
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,580
and the cycle of assassination.

393
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,380
The only thing you can change,

394
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,460
the only person that you can kill,

395
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,740
that will change the anchor points in the past,

396
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,700
and the anchor points in the future,

397
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,980
there's only one man.

398
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,360
Who is it that we must kill?

399
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,760
We must kill Bob Dobbs!

400
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,940
J.R. Bob Dobbs must die

401
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,220
if we are to have a future!

402
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,180
Catch the reflection.

403
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,880
Kill Bob Dobbs!

404
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,960
Catch the reflection.

405
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,260
Kill Bob Dobbs!

406
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,000
Proceed.

407
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,760
Don't go out of your mind.

408
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,040
Alright, alright.

409
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,460
I think that's a little harsh.

410
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,140
Uh...

411
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,960
Carter LeBlanc there, friends.

412
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:58,700
That was great.

413
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,240
Carter, be glad you don't have to

414
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,940
videotape and record everything.

415
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,720
You ain't no friend of hers, are you?

416
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,640
I never saw her before.

417
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,860
She don't usually have no preacher for company.

418
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,160
I ain't a preacher.

419
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,980
I only seen her name in a toilet.

420
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,740
Well, you look like a preacher.

421
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,220
Your hat looks like a preacher's hat.

422
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,360
It ain't.

423
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,420
It's just a hat.

424
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,260
Well, it ain't only the hat.

425
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,180
It's the look on your face somewhere.

426
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,980
Looky here, I ain't no preacher.

427
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,940
Now, I understand it ain't anybody perfect

428
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,200
on this green earth.

429
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,620
Not preachers, not nobody.

430
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,420
And you can tell folks better how terrible sin is

431
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,020
if you know from your own experience.

432
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,160
Listen, get this.

433
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,720
There ain't but one thing that I want to know.

434
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,500
I want you to understand, and that's that I don't believe in anything.

435
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,500
Nothing at all?

436
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:56,700
Nothing.

437
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,280
Well, that's the problem with you preachers.

438
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,580
You've all got too damn good to believe in anything.

439
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,300
There are subgeniuses who have no shame.

440
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,860
They don't even know the feeling.

441
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,280
Those are the ones I tend to try to avoid.

442
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,480
But some of them are coming in this way.

443
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,360
I like the ones who can feel shame.

444
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,760
I like to shame them sometimes.

445
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,440
I'm ashamed myself just looking at that image there.

446
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,980
I'm ashamed of your shame.

447
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,720
There you go.

448
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,200
We've come full circle.

449
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,960
One of the shameless subgeniuses here,

450
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,100
Princess Pisces,

451
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,400
she serves as an example of one who doesn't care

452
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,520
who sees her doing what.

453
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:44,540
And I am an example of a self-conscious fool.

454
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,960
Has no problem recording me doing whatever.

455
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,640
Questioning every single thing he does,

456
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,240
including this very sentence.

457
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,780
And to no avail.

458
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,800
To what avail?

459
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:54,540
Why?

460
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,040
And why do I do it, friends?

461
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,020
Because I am an emergentile.

462
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,720
Well, this is a somewhat uncomfortable revelation.

463
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,820
It's a sad, it's a rough day for some.

464
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:12,860
On the other hand, at least we only take one out of ten Rewardians.

465
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,280
That's true.

466
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,360
Most of you are Rewardians.

467
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:21,040
And one out of ten of you will not leave the campground

468
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:26,520
because the emergentiles must have their lusts sated

469
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,980
and their hungers satisfied.

470
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,260
Just part of nature's plan.

471
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,280
Yeah, but somebody has to clean it up.

472
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,220
And last year, that's a, I swear.

473
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,220
Such punishments indeed are due to nature's dearest stained with sin.

474
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:50,920
For I, in tempesting anew the unfathomable hell within,

475
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:57,080
the horror of those deeds to view, to know and loathe, yet wish and do.

476
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,900
I was recently informed that I have the horror.

477
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,600
The horror.

478
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,180
I think we've all been told we have the horror.

479
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,720
I've got mine, it's on my head.

480
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,420
So all of us here are Others, aren't we?

481
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,140
We're the Others.

482
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,760
The nicht-ish.

483
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,480
We're the not-you.

484
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,140
And I believe we all have the horror.

485
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:17,940
I know, let's see, let's look out into the mass.

486
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,140
Modemak definitely has the horror.

487
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,020
But not the horrors.

488
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,720
He doesn't have the twitches.

489
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,760
No, no, no. There's a difference.

490
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:32,520
He's able to send those work gangs his off to perform specialized labors.

491
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,440
But I found out, now that I recognize that I have the horror,

492
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,160
things are so much easier.

493
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,000
Did you find that?

494
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,820
The horror's cool.

495
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,160
Oh, God, yeah.

496
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:40,780
I love the horror.

497
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,660
It was like all the tension went away.

498
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,380
I just accepted having the horror.

499
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,920
You can kind of embrace.

500
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:53,040
For those who haven't been reading alt.slack for the last several months,

501
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,460
one of our most beloved kooks,

502
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:03,320
the mentally ill person known as PM, or Preacher Mike,

503
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,860
informed us all that we didn't belong in this cult,

504
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,060
that we were the Others,

505
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,740
and there were only a few who were not the Others.

506
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,600
And he said that we,

507
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,960
we who can spell correctly and have, you know,

508
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,300
can occasionally use grammar right,

509
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,820
are pinks and the Others.

510
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,600
The horror apparently causes us to

511
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:34,840
not be stupid enough for some subgenius' tastes.

512
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:40,420
We've actually been made fun of for not being dumb enough.

513
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:43,500
I don't think that's how the particular kook meant it.

514
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,980
But, you know, friends,

515
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,180
why do you think they call it subgenius?

516
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,100
The guy does have a point.

517
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,060
There are some people,

518
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,640
Dr. Howell here probably wouldn't qualify for the church

519
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,320
if we hadn't,

520
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:00,980
if he hadn't had the operations and the accidents.

521
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,940
The horror,

522
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,240
I hear the horror creeping up in the background.

523
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,180
The horror.

524
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,240
Yes, one of those mornings,

525
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,980
Bob comes a-creepin' in the room.

526
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,600
Isn't that a gospel?

527
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,660
So many people go,

528
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,420
Oh, I can't wait to meet Bob.

529
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,040
I'm gonna go to the next day and meet Bob.

530
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,820
You know, you might meet Bob.

531
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,960
You might wake up in the morning,

532
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,640
with no memory of the night before.

533
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:34,700
Every orifice aching, stretched, abused.

534
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,240
Fallen arches, bad breath, bunions, corns,

535
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,420
chillblains, sty.

536
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:47,300
And a cloying smell of cherry blend pipe tobacco.

537
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,200
Bob's been a creepin' in the room.

538
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,720
You feel like a human ashtray after Bob's used you.

539
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,600
And that's no pig Latin.

540
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,280
The worst part is it makes you clean it out.

541
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,240
Of course it counts as psychosis also.

542
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,200
Failure to distinguish the apperceptive mass.

543
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,960
Progressive hallucinations and ultimate death.

544
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,260
But if they're hallucinations,

545
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,600
why do they leave marks?

546
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,980
Well, that's the thing.

547
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,320
When you put on your glasses,

548
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:17,160
these so-called hallucinations spring sharply into focus.

549
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,240
Heh, heh, heh, heh.

550
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,360
Yes, they're really there.

551
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:26,480
It's all too terrible for most people to take on their plate.

552
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:31,420
But yes, all true, all proven,

553
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,600
all no longer necessary to conceal.

554
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:39,180
As the sacred moment creeps stealthily upon us.

555
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,120
On its giant soft paws.

556
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,340
X-Day will soon play with us

557
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:48,940
as the sportive cat tortures a quivering mouse.

558
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,860
I'm gettin' turned on by the way you're talkin', Dr. Hal.

559
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,340
That gets me kind of excited.

560
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:58,700
Well, there's going to be plenty of excitement for everybody

561
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,220
when those giant saucers come down blazing and bangity-bang shooting

562
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:09,060
for kids from six to sixty and oldersters ninety years young.

563
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:13,680
It'll be anti-fun for the whole family.

564
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:19,460
Mom, Dad, Buzz, Sis, Rover, and Kitty

565
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,640
go running for their very lives,

566
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,760
screaming and caterwauling

567
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,780
as they trail this figuring radioactive fire

568
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:33,020
and the tell-tale green lines of Cherenkov radiation.

569
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,900
But the subgeniuses will be watching from above

570
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,840
in comfort, safe, and warm.

571
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:42,060
While the pinks scurry in labyrinthine

572
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,480
mazes of their own doom.

573
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,040
Doom! Doom!

574
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,220
Yeah, uh, yeah, uh, and uh,

575
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,300
some people think that, um,

576
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,180
if you fail to gather at the assembly point,

577
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,120
the saucers will come and get ya.

578
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,100
Well, they may try.

579
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,140
They may come to where you were.

580
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,180
But you might not be there no more.

581
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,440
Because the Earth is constantly moving.

582
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,600
Well, there is that also.

583
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,560
But we have a thing called relativity, you know.

584
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,060
The exits are up on that.

585
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,220
The Earth will be moving in other ways, though,

586
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:21,220
like the top of a boiling kettle of oatmeal,

587
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:26,080
heaving and casting large chunks of its surface up

588
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,940
as it shrieks in torment like a wounded thing.

589
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,160
Is that like a pressure cooker?

590
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,880
Because I got a lot of tomatoes this year,

591
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,060
and I do need a big enough pressure cooker to fill it up.

592
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,100
Well, there's a lot of pressure.

593
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,360
And it's building up the fountains of the deep,

594
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,660
which were opened before by Jehovah One

595
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,440
to help create the Noachian Flood.

596
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,620
But of course, we also know from the Christian Bible

597
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,960
that the flood will not come again.

598
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,000
And to certify this,

599
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:56,500
God put the rainbow in the sky

600
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:01,400
to demonstrate his covenant between man and God.

601
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,340
No, next time there will be no flood

602
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:08,180
Instead, it is promised there will be fire!

603
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,840
A super volcano!

604
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:14,400
A huge, blazing, blistering, burning ball of fire

605
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,260
will scour the bejesus out of each and every one of you.

606
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,920
What used to be Yosemite National Park,

607
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,760
beautiful place for sightseers, will...

608
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,640
It's about to blow, ladies and gentlemen.

609
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,440
Muy fuego.

610
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,940
They don't tell you about that every day on the news.

611
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,340
No kidding. Yosemite, soon a giant lava bubbling...

612
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,400
aperture in the Earth's crust.

613
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,440
And even if you're not nearby,

614
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,180
within a matter of months you'll starve to death

615
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:46,980
because all the life in the ocean will die out very soon

616
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,140
as clouds cover the sun everywhere.

617
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,160
The water is actually becoming...

618
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,460
The acid will...

619
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,060
Carbonated like soda pop.

620
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,440
And first the creatures with the shells die

621
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,500
because they can't be formed anymore.

622
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,340
But soon the only remaining life

623
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,620
in the ocean will be bacteria and jellyfish.

624
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,620
Mmm, that smells great.

625
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,520
Mmm, jellyfish.

626
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,340
With bacteria.

627
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,520
Now with more bacteria.

628
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,300
Grape jellyfish?

629
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,200
The whole ocean will be just like the Cuyahoga River, friends.

630
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:28,080
All the oceans of the world will become flammable.

631
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,040
A bacterial sump or stew.

632
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,000
Perfect for...

633
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,400
Creating the next generation of life

634
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,260
that we don't get to see.

635
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,280
Because we'll be on our way to the Port Authority building

636
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,400
where we disembark from the pleasure saucers

637
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,840
after an infinity of pleasure.

638
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,320
Do we have to go to the Port Authority?

639
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,620
The one in Jersey?

640
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,280
No, the one...

641
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,480
Well, where is that located anyway, Stang?

642
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,360
The Port Authority building is where now?

643
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,020
The which?

644
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,860
The Port Authority building.

645
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,600
When the saucers land...

646
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,080
Oh, oh, oh.

647
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,460
After they pick us up.

648
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,500
It's up at the top of the hill next to the showers.

649
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,480
The big house?

650
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,800
Yeah, I know, it doesn't seem that impressive,

651
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,160
but there aren't that many of the same subgeniuses.

652
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,120
So, uh...

653
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,960
Many are called, but few are chosen.

654
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:24,740
Many could take showers, but don't.

655
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,040
Yes, as the hot tubs testify.

656
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,520
Many have taken ship at the pale beaches,

657
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,380
but few return to the sunlit land.

658
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:35,980
Nope.

659
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,200
The only place left is this damn hotel.

660
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:15,200


661
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:15,200


662
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,540
I said there were some obscure jobs there.

663
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:16,540


664
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:16,540


665
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,120
Ain't nobody else for you.

666
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,860
Your wife is a littleunduka,

667
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,120
yeah, I knew that!

668
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:21,120


669
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:21,560
Who's that?

670
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,080
Who's he?

671
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,540
Yeah?

672
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,020
The woman in the schoolUn Wu,

673
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:31,500


674
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:31,500

John Deere Tractor Beam, a hangers-on of the amino acids,

685
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,140
covered the amino acid song, Fear the Future.

686
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:23,660
You can insult John Deere Tractor Beam at myspace.com

687
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:26,140
slash John Deere Tractor Beam.

688
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,040
And in that one word, they spell deer.

689
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,160
D-E-E-R.

690
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,320
D-E-E-R.

691
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:35,300
This hour of slack number 1214

692
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:40,960
is obviously all derived from our live recordings from X Day 12.

693
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:46,060
Fat Man D, who had that great song near the beginning,

694
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,680
is at fatmand.com.

695
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,560
But Fat Man D is spelled thusly.

696

P-H-A-T-M-A-N-D-E-E-R.

P-H-A-T-M-A-N-D-E-E-R.

700
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,860
Any movie clips you hear are from John Houston's Wise Blood.

701
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,220
More music and head-launching's coming up.

702
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,720
Stay tuned to learn everything.

703
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,560
Everything is in the swag shack, by the way.

704
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,040
Waiting.

705
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:20,300
And if there's a lock on it, I have the key.

706
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,060
Waiting for the life to come.

707
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,280
I am the key master.

708
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,960
You are the gatekeeper.

709
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,080
And a few drops of 3-in-1 oil in there.

710
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:29,300
Here's the key.

711
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,160
Here's the key.

712

It's a marriage made in heaven.

716
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,520
Which heaven?

717
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,700
The lowest of the seven heavens.

718
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,440
Oh, okay, good.

719
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,400
Have you been to the top one?

720
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,320
Well, I mean, come on.

721
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,520
It's lame.

722
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,220
Up from Earth's center through the seventh gate,

723
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:48,760
I rose, and on the throne of Saturn's saint.

724
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,860
And many a knot unraveled by the road,

725
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:55,780
but not the master knot of human fate.

726
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:59,260
There was the door for which I found no key,

727
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,120
there was the veil through which I could not see.

728
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,140
Some little talk-a-while of me and thee there was,

729
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,980
and then no more of thee and me.

730
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,560
Or this and that.

731
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:14,960
Yeah, well.

732
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,900
And you've got to do the speech, friends.

733
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:23,620
This is the Gaddafi head football of legend.

734
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:28,280
I have spoken of this thing and bragged of it for years

735
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,140
without knowing where in my house I was.

736
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:34,960
Paul Mavridis, also known as Lies, gave me this

737
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,700
twenty-some-odd years ago.

738
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:43,800
And only this X-Day, while I was digging up crap

739
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:49,360
to bring here, did I finally unearth the prophesied

740
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,940
bleeding head of Muammar Gaddafi.

741
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,980
The Middle Eastern historian among us,

742
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,060
Reverend Carter,

743
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:04,160
I think that we should tonight, for the first time,

744
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,180
give him complete cut block.

745
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:23,960
This is the head, the foot head,

746
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,920
the foot head of,

747
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,720
they just called him leader.

748
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:30,120
He doesn't,

749
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,880
he doesn't have an official title in this country.

750
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,200
They just called him leader.

751
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,740
Where is the leader?

752
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:35,740
He is our leader.

753
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,360
Muammar Gaddafi, this is one of the champions,

754
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,180
one of the, one of the rare souls in the,

755
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,100
in our war against the conspiracy.

756
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,480
This is a man who has made himself an icon of.

757
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,280
He is a football.

758
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,580
He is, he's a football.

759
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,100
He's a head of the league.

760
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,580
What that next to him?

761
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:11,580
Well, he's born in Gold Shhosee.

762
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:11,700
I'm doing a series looking at the cosas.

763
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:11,700


764
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:11,700


765
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:11,700


766
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:11,780
Hey you come over here.

767
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:11,780


768
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:22,380
We heard about Rைз ska.

769
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:23,160
We can smell it.

770
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:24,820
We are gonna walk around the grounds there.

771
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:25,860
I like your uneven blood.

772
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,140
Let's have some watches.

773
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,120
Why are you clean.

774
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:30,120


775
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:30,120


776
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,260
He's a man that needs healing.

777
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:33,860
He's a man who's bleeding.

778
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,220
He wants to move beyond.

779
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:40,900
He wants to be launched.

780
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,460
Face him as he is launched.

781
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,420
For he is launched to you.

782
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,680
We promised you a head launching and we thought we were lying.

783
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,160
But, please, Bob, we were.

784
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,720
By accident, there was a true head launching.

785
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,180
And if the head could be returned to its sacred level,

786
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,880
I'd vote for anyone who's injured by the radiation.

787
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,100
Deadly radiation.

788
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,100
Deadly radiation on the head.

789
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,880
You can return that sacred object.

790
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,520
Friends, meanwhile, we will turn down the microphone

791
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,900
and end the music of the two beings

792
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,000
and this mighty mixed mastership.

793
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,880
And mixed mastership.

794
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:45,900
Vastahood.

795
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,000
It's a beautiful name.

796
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:48,660
Right, Bob?

797
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

798
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,080
Go ahead.

799
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:05,800
Well, that's all very well to joke about these things,

800
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,940
but, of course, we have a very clear spiritual purpose here.

801
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,020
Yeah, I mean, a joke is necessary.

802
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,540
The belly laugh in the dark.

803
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:21,180
The guffaw in the disproving face of the church.

804
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,380
It's not all doom and worshiping.

805
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,280
There's no piety, actually.

806
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,080
I take that back.

807
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,020
There's no point in falling.

808
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,240
I'm falling into a semantic trap of thinking

809
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,820
that if something is serious, i.e., of importance,

810
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:37,800
it must be serious.

811
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,920
That is to say, lacking in mirth and humor.

812
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,500
That is simply a convergence.

813
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,820
This church is not serious business.

814
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,980
of the meaning of serious, but that's not our meaning.

815
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:50,480
You can't have cheeseburger, though.

816
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:54,480
Whoa.

817
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,040
Speaking of which, that reminds me of one of the jobs

818
00:47:59,040 --> 00:47:59,760
of the sacred.

819
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,720
I'm not sure if you can describe which this little button

820
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,120
on my hat says I am.

821
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:03,840
Yes.

822
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,240
But that job, that important task.

823
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:07,400
It also says black catcher.

824
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,100
Is the task, friends, of making coffee.

825
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,460
That's right.

826
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:16,420
I am going to now leave you two here blathering while I go

827
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:20,340
down there to make the coffee that will allow us to continue.

828
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:23,600
Make up a couple demijohns staying.

829
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,580
Make up a couple of huge burbling flagons of coffee.

830
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,100
That leaves an open mic here, so if somebody wants to come up.

831
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:30,100


832
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:30,100


833
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,120
And do we have the white lard?

834
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,000
You're welcome to come up here and take my place.

835
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,980
Do we have the lard that goes in there?

836
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,660
The white stuff, the powder.

837
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:40,700
Yeah, I brought the lard.

838
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:41,380
Oh, thank God.

839
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,400
I have the lard and the price of lard.

840
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,840
Is this the bacon-flavored coffee?

841
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,180
Lard love a duck.

842
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:50,220
Yes, this coffee creamer, as they call it,

843
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,280
is the icing on the caffeinated cake.

844
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:57,840
We need coffee to accomplish our duty.

845
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,340
And take us forward.

846
00:48:59,340 --> 00:48:59,720
Caffeine.

847
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,700
And take us forward to our destination.

848
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,160
Our destination is the end of the show.

849
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,320
This show, Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius,

850
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:11,340
can be seen in its entirety at subgenius.com.

851
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:16,380
In my E-Pops 12X day are many bands, my friends.

852
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,840
And one of the bands that has played

853
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,940
at almost every major subgenius revival in recent years

854
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:24,160
is Fat Free from Brooklyn.

855
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,700
The song you are about to hear, Rocket Sauce

856
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:32,420
by Fat Free, was the very last show of their set.

857
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,180
It had to be because it was getting late

858
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,940
and we had a date with a big fire.

859
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,280
So we just got the finger.

860
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,760
We just got the finger.

861
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:42,720
What more?

862
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:44,860
Clap, chop, or rocket sauce?

863
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:45,660
Which one do you want?

864
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,520
Yeah, what do you guys want?

865
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,760
Clap, chop, or rocket sauce?

866
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:48,780
Rocket sauce.

867
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,200
Rocket sauce it is.

868
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,140
Rocket sauce it is.

869
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,180
First come, first serve.

870
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,140
Here's rocket sauce.

871
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,920
First serve, first come.

872
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59,360
Rocket sauce.

873
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:01,120
That's right.

874
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:01,920
Rocket sauce.

875
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:01,920


876
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,240
Woo!

877
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,160
Woo!

878
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:04,600
Ha ha ha.

879
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:05,460
.

880
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:58,700


881
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:28,700


882
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:58,700


883
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:28,700


884
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:58,700


885
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,160
Oops, I'm almost out of it.

886
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:18,780
那麼 젊 resur SAT IT existen,

887
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:25,980
Of course.

888
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:27,700
Mmhmmhmm.

889
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:32,260
aminoacids.com. We shall close now with a rant and then a song. The rant is really more of a

890
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:37,320
confession. Later at X Day, I did a proper full-fledged rant, but for this one, I was having

891
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:49,760
trouble mustering my hate. You know, the thing is, in the last few years, I actually got slack,

892
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:59,320
and I have to fake my hate now. I have to fail. No, of course, there's some things I hate, you

893
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:07,260
know. I mean, but there was, I was an angry young man. Why else do you think I'd go to work for J.R.

894
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:13,080
Bob Dobbs for free and work my ass off? And then that, which made me even angrier. But

895
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,740
then Princess We Are Doe, the queen of all the UFOs, came out.

896
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:28,600
And then suddenly, I had, my anger dissipated for some reason. It was like, if you ever saw that

897
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:34,100
movie King Kong, there's some similarities there. I was about to rip her arms off, and she gave me

898
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:41,880
that pretty smile. And so I went, God, I don't hate everybody for a second. And so yeah, yeah,

899
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:48,720
it's, you know, pity me, friends. I have to fake my damn hate. I actually, there was, I used to

900
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:49,300
preach slack.

901
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:56,960
And I was the most slackless motherfucker you ever saw in your life. Why do you think I worked so hard at it?

902
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:03,960
Then I finally realized, oh, that was the mistake there, was the working at the slack. Now, if you're an

903
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:12,080
emergentile, working does provide slack, but it kind of does it when you're not expecting it to. It's funny how

904
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:19,640
that happens. Anyway, that, I just wanted to say that so that everybody would feel sorry for me, because

905
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:29,860
I'm so happy and lucky nowadays, and not generally not worried about the future. That I'm just a sorry

906
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:33,060
excuse for a sub-genius at this point, hey.

907
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:42,300
However, it does prove that eventually, there is the slack. Praise Bob. And it 5, and it was JR Bob Benedoof,

908
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:48,900
it was not some work. It was not just princess we are dough. It was not on my health elements going

909
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:49,620
away. Where does every intrigued. I should cry in these? Oh yes, I'm trying. And I'm always willing to give. Maybe I do. And I gave that thatوں that I gave the man whenever I did the vàoallas, because campaign, that I did and that sore throat. If they're not guys did they'm gonna impertinent plane, whoever is a-

910
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:54,720
me slack it was not making enough money to put a roof over my head finally that gave me sight no

911
00:55:54,720 --> 00:56:08,240
it was that face alone just fat face that's all you don't have to dress it up with oh the excess

912
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:14,900
and slack and the end of the world and conspiracy and pink boys and this jargon and that jargon all

913
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:24,960
you need is that face the face of Bob not just any face that face because it is the face of

914
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:34,120
J.R. Bob Dobbs yes it's a piece of clip art but it's clip art of J.R. Bob Dobbs period

915
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:41,800
Bob sold it I smoked it that settles it people ask me they say Reverend Stanger come on what

916
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,860

917
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:50,620

918
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:08,100
but Susie would you like to come up here and take my place after I change this would be a

919
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:13,360
good time to change CDs I change oh yes I'm going to don't say anything funny

920
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:14,420
you

921
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:19,940
just sit down for about two minutes spouting some genius material

922
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:25,520
now we can do that

923
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:33,580
one of those mornings Bob comes a-creepin' in the room

924
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:44,120
one of those mornings old man Bob comes a-creepin' in the room

925
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:56,420
I say one of those mornings Bob comes a-creepin' in the room

926
00:57:56,420 --> 00:58:05,580
oh my lord my sweet old Bob what shall I do

927
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:08,520
what shall I do

928
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:13,540
you can call on your president

929
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:18,600
but your president won't do you no good

930
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:23,780
you can call on your president

931
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:28,860
but your president won't do you no good

932
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,460
yes you can call on your president

933
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,200
but your president won't do you no good

934
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,180
oh my lord

935
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:44,400
Oh my lord

936
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:50,140
My sweet Lord, what shall I do?

937
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:53,600
What shall I do?

938
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:55,760
That was a good intermission.

939
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:58,980
We need to do that more often to split up the CDs.

940
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:01,620
Hal's like the master of the microphone. I overblow everything.

941
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:04,480
So if you want to test overblowing, that would be, I would be the first.

942
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,860
Yeah, just if you bend your cleavage over the mic.

943
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:10,020
It seemed to form this perfect rule.

944
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:15,940
So yeah, last time what was causing the feedback is this.

945
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,580
Is that I get down like this and start talking.

946
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:24,060
And then every time I'd lean over and my tits would get close to the microphone, it would get feedback.

947
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:33,100
Were you here the year that Sister Dackovitz did a concert, a theremin concert using tits as the theremin?

948
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:34,180
I heard you say megaphone.

949
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:35,100
That's awesome.

950
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,560
No, I said tits.

951
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:39,500
Yeah, she had, it was like, weee, weee.

952
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,000
I didn't know that.

953
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:41,220
Tits, megaphone.

954
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,160
But it had a unique sound.

955
