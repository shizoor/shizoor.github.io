1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
Let's hear about that radio show.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:02,960
Amazing, isn't it?

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:03,940
Listen.

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,780
I'm wondering about that voice we heard on the radio.

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,800
I think, hmm.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,100
The color of these hot butter rum martinis.

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,660
I'd like to talk about...

8
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,740
And here's the only person listening to the show tonight.

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,280
Yeah, I'm coming.

10
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,440
Okay, good.

11
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,460
Look at this surface seething and bumping.

12
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,400
There's enormous bubbles.

13
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,400
See, the rest of our listeners are machines like this.

14
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,320
Let's go up to the top.

15
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,960
They made so much money in their regular day jobs

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,140
that they were able to fend off these legal problems for years.

17
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,420
Rely on your intelligence and on your memory.

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,320
And think about the case as it was.

19
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,160
You have to say the underlying word correctly.

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,660
But how many of you are really genuinely intelligent?

21
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,080
So there.

22
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,280
Bang.

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,860
Put a dual display on.

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,200
Uh, uh, over to you.

25
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:55,420
Uh.

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:56,860
Puzzling.

27
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,580
Kill me.

28
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,200
Huh?

29
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,300
Kill me.

30
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,540
Kill me.

31
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,060
I don't know what you're saying.

32
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,260
Kill me!

33
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,480
Okay!

34
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,540
Why not?

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,720
Good luck.

36
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:19,040
Oh, uh, no, in fact, I'm not ready at all.

37
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,720
Uh, uh, I am, uh, and I, uh, I, uh,

38
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,740
uh, I am, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, oh, goodness me.

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,860
Uh, I have no idea how I, uh, I came by this number.

40
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:39,840
I've, I am at present having a numbers, um, uh, uh, Dr. Howe's, I mean, uh, I don't sound

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,540
like him at all.

42
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:40,860
No.

43
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,900
I'm presently having, um, phone numbers dialed at random by this, uh, scumbag person who

44
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,200
I'm allowing to, uh, use my phone at the present time.

45
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,440
And he is, uh, taking over everything and dialing up people.

46
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,700
And it appears to be dialing up doctors.

47
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:55,700


48
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:55,700


49
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,720
doctors of the air for some strange reason.

50
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,660
I guess him being his own person, he can do that.

51
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,720
It's too bad I couldn't talk to you under the better context

52
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,840
because I am in fact a great fan of the subgenius church.

53
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,400
But my friend, when I mentioned that,

54
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,280
began dialing these numbers and putting me on the phone

55
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,060
and then running away.

56
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,260
And I am extremely annoyed by all this.

57
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,640
However, he is no friend of mine.

58
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,740
And I hope sincerely you will do your best

59
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,260
to erase your memory of all this

60
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,180
and can merely continue to make the shows as bad as you can

61
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,460
and abuse the callers and listen for Guy the caller

62
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,060
because he will be waiting to be abused more than the rest.

63
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,700
So we go universe somewhere,

64
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,820
somewhere out there where there's a show.

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,900
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

66
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,580
which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius.

67
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,380
What?

68
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,140
Including you.

69
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,840
Welcome potential initiates

70
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,780
and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

71
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,260
...to infinite numbers of segundae and wiegandes

72
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:08,760
and every week of Monday until ,

73
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,020
«ously get your breath heave away

74
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,020


75
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,560
And the great Asher back of Evolution 3-4,

76
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:24,240
この司 titled

77
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,720
There he is.

78
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,220
Okay, now Philo's gone crazy in Production Studio 1.

79
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,560
Looks like they're isolating the area, pulling the doctors out of there.

80
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,260
Well, they don't have long to live here on KPFA.

81
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,000
I can tell you that.

82
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:44,400
Or here on 848-9374.

83
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,240
We'll be right back.

84
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:51,340
We'll be right back.

85
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,860
My brain was blasted.

86
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,540
My head feeling thick.

87
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,300
My eyeballs protruded, but I didn't get sick.

88
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,720
We packed up my piss, but we kept seeing dots.

89
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,760
Then we found that the peak had gotten all the best spots.

90
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,940
So we got high, so high.

91
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,960
Dark, dark mountains.

92
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,140
Yeah, we got high, so high.

93
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,140
Dark, dark mountains.

94
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,880
Yeah, we got high, so high.

95
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,180
The people were happy.

96
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,060
They were all having fun.

97
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,180
While Dr. Sir Bob was farming skulls in the sun.

98
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,260
The corpses were swinging.

99
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,220
Their love did abound.

100
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,320
The average corpse floated a foot off the ground.

101
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,400
The band that cared not was speaking his name.

102
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,520
While the doctors on the clamshell were claiming their fame.

103
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,140
Spark dog explosion and combo game.

104
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,560
A youngどもibo explored himself煮 vida.

105
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:03,560


106
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:03,660
continué внимание anew of life and the hopes of survival.

107
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:03,660


108
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:03,660


109
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,200


110
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,840
Realizing the actual power of feeling was limited.

111
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:10,840


112
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,180
while Dr. Sir Bob was following him.

113
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:23,860
The people were thinking about g � spoilage to the rest during the time and that on the maintainingался

114
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,960
Ah, yes, dear friends, the swinging love corpses.

115
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,440
I'm gonna go back and I'll even meet the Pope.

116
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,380
Better make it to Dark Stock or just give up hope.

117
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,300
The dead will be walking, maybe Bob will appear.

118
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,480
The sound of chainsaws will be all that you hear.

119
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,560
Now I'm gonna go back and I won't be stopped.

120
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,540
I'm gonna go back to smoke the ultimate fraud.

121
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,900
You just can't imagine what it's like to go when reality's on hold.

122
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,980
And Dark Stock says go!

123
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,160
We got high!

124
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:39,960
High!

125
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,500
Dark Stock now says.

126
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,640
We got high!

127
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,580
High!

128
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,160
High!

129
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,400
High!

130
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,080
Dark Stock!

131
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,720
We got high!

132
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:53,720


133
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:53,720


134
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,460
Oh, yeah.

135
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,100
I went way up high on Dark Stock Mountain.

136
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,560
I climbed down.

137
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,920
I climbed up all the way to the top.

138
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,520
I took everything you could think of.

139
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,900
I shot beer.

140
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,400
I smoked heroin.

141
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,460
I started marijuana.

142
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,020
I stuck, I stuck, uh,

143
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,980
I stuck glue.

144
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:29,340
I put, uh, um, barbiturate suppositories in my rectal cavity.

145
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,300
Uh, yes, dear friends and Dr. Drummond can't tell you everything else that he did because

146
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,220
you just don't even wanna know.

147
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,540
The Swingin' Love Corpses is there live somewhere from the album Soak Your Butt.

148
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:49,820
And well, we're, at last, we've been defending the church and subgenius so much lately we're

149
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,440
just gonna tear it to pieces tonight.

150
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,040
And you know that means it's one of those old-fashioned doctor shows.

151
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:02,360
Oh, you hear, be hearing from all those mighty nasty characters, particularly Puzzling Evidence,

152
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,360
Dr. Howell.

153
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,940
The show opened, by the way, with a nice little new edit by Puzzling Evidence.

154
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,680
There's a lot more of that coming up.

155
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,240
Um, uh, yeah.

156
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,240
Oh, okay.

157
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,760
So, I don't know, they better do something fast.

158
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,440
And what happens to it's gonna happen to you?

159
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,320
All the people I meet and talk to, all the places I go, no one's ever walked up to me

160
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,660
and say, hey, you wanna buy some cigarettes?

161
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
Acuérdeme, Rubén, al ratito.

162
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
De qué me donde el fo?

163
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,760
De meterlo al toilet.

164
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,720
Walking in the sun.

165
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:49,800
Walking in the sun.

166
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:49,800


167
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,080
Sunshine, sing a little sunshine song.

168
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,700
Can't sit and negotiate.

169
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,820
You don't do the wrong, you feel terrible, like you, like you're gonna die.

170
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,240
And I know all the reasons for it.

171
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,480
I know every single reason for it.

172
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,440
Then you have the basic honk.

173
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,860
And the goose honk.

174
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,880
I'll be giving to every adult in the service.

175
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,800
I'll be giving to every adult in the service.

176
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:19,800


177
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:19,920
Ooh.

178
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll be giving to every adult in the service.

179
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,280
They read myagens and they love me.

180
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,280


181
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,280


182
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,280
Where'd I have gone out thatilate?

183
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,380
Man 1 Hello?

184
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,640
Man 3 Seems like last morning when he said something else.

185
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:29,640


186
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:29,640


187
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,300
No, just when you acknowledge.

188
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,800
He was able to pick it up in a hurry because I'm ill.

189
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,820
And Hugh peppers some oyuniana.

190
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:37,940
No.

191
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:37,940


192
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,320
Because everyday becoming much more practical for my inspiration.

193
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,460
But I'm fascinated to know that.

194
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,540
You got too happyStopsm kara yome.

195
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,220
Oh, I never get kingdoms!

196
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:48,960
Stuff is more.

197
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:48,960


198
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:49,800
My car is done.

199
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,980
When you are stealing that extra ball

200
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,100
Bob, what a relief. How are you doing tonight?

201
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,180
His name is Bob. Bob is not the illegitimate son of Michael Jackson.

202
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,160
Take it from me.

203
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,600
Billy Dee is not Mr. Bob.

204
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,580
Come on, how many? Come on, Bob.

205
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,700
How many posts do you think is for Michael, Bob?

206
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,360
Come on, Bob. Come on.

207
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,860
Will seven be enough, Bob?

208
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,720
They call him Bob Doves.

209
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,360
Yeah, I call him Bobo.

210
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:26,200
He was the leather man at a time when leather was nothing but wingtip shoes.

211
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,200
He led the way, brothers.

212
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,580
He was a lonely pioneer in those days.

213
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:31,940
I remember.

214
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,340
At first, a fricose, sore-footed shoe salesman.

215
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,960
One day he was a tinkering with a television set of his own design

216
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,920
when he messed around with the back and got himself a huge shock through the coil

217
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,140
that we call the divine immaculation.

218
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,640
But...

219
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,480
You know, his very name rings with magic.

220
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,020
Half human, half sprite, he saw the future

221
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,280
and could transform himself into any form

222
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,500
merely by conjuring up the image in his mind.

223
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,480
The great Dobs used his mystical powers to aid the forces of righteousness,

224
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,020
honor and virtue of Gesundheit

225
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,900
and to shape the splendid visions of his noble king, Stan.

226
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,200
But when the tragic end of Dobstown drew near,

227
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,440
many say that the heart-sick Dobs sought refuge

228
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,800
with a tiny, tiddling poodle.

229
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,260
She gave him comfort

230
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,900
and sheltered him in a tree

231
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:30,520
to rest safely until needed by the show once more.

232
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,100
What's going on here?

233
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,100
Yeah, why don't we...

234
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,360
It's later than you think.

235
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,040
Aye, the terrible, spittin' vengeance of Bob's mighty staff

236
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,880
shall scour clean this planet

237
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,420
and the all-pervading radio system.

238
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:46,420


239
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,320
The radioactive pastiche of his boundless supernatural love.

240
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,640
Wake up, open your heart, drop your pants,

241
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,220
close your mind and bend over

242
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,040
because he'll be kicking and taking names,

243
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,780
dear brothers and sisters.

244
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,840
He'll be struggling and gasping,

245
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,860
his face will turn blue,

246
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,500
then Bob will pitch over on the floor

247
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,740
in the grip of a massive coronary thrombosis.

248
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,800
And we will be there to see that event

249
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,700
and to record it for you.

250
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,680
As it was at the beginning of time.

251
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,740
So a man with a pop and a grin

252
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,500
hauled in the new morning light

253
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,120
grinnin'

254
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,220
Come on, sing along now.

255
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,480
Grinnin' with me like a mad man

256
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,940
and he made me uptight

257
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,940
I told him don't bother me anymore

258
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,160
but he kept on just the same

259
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,440
till I was totally brainwashed

260
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,200
Bob is his name

261
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,960
He's great.

262
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,940
Bob is my story

263
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,140
Bob is my song

264
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,120
Bob's my amphetamine

265
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,940
all the day long

266
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,380
I won't tear my poster of Bob's down

267
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,160
I'll feel no sadness or shame

268
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,460
till I behold him in Bob's town

269
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,280
Bob is his name

270
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,420
He has no lack of humor

271
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,660
He's patented slack

272
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,580
for those of his following fold

273
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,720
He is the friend of whoever will send

274
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,340
greenbacks a go

275
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,640
He's growing stronger and stronger

276
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,820
He'll get all the credit and blame

277
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,740
I'll be a big boy no longer

278
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,740
Bob is his name

279
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,480
This is a sad affair

280
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,400
Bob is his name

281
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,360
My Bob's bigger than yours

282
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,760
My Bob's bigger than yours

283
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,840
My Bob's bigger than yours

284
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,240
My Bob's bigger than yours

285
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,260
Watch out!

286
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:55,920
The Bob!

287
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,500
It's loose!

288
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,600
It's coming this way!

289
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,220
Back!

290
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,660
Back!

291
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,540
I created you!

292
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,040
Back!

293
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,620
Back!

294
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,060
Back!

295
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:02,480
Back!

296
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:02,480


297
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,160
So, uh, so is Daniel, does he like what you do?

298
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,200
I don't think he cares for it much, but

299
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,960
Blast him, huh?

300
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,340
He sounds very unhappy on this recent hour of slack, I'll tell ya.

301
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,780
I'd love to hear that.

302
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,400
I know that he says that.

303
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:16,400


304
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:16,400


305
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,920
He says in his book, you know, working for Bob is hell, so

306
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,760
even though he's not directly working for me, he certainly was influenced by me, and, uh,

307
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,980
We entertain them and provide content for their shows, and they think it's free.

308
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,280
They think the electric environment is free.

309
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,580
Now, I make the point it is free, but you gotta deal with the, uh, old industrial heritage,

310
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,840
the visual environment of money.

311
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,180
So, I don't wanna have idiots calling me up and wanna talk to me who don't even, uh,

312
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,760
read the liner notes, don't read my book, they have no interest in my knowledge,

313
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,300
they just sort of are interested in the subgenius connection, the staying connection.

314
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,220
And, uh, I'm more interested in talking about what I'm about, and what, what my, uh,

315
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,580
tetrad management is, and what I'm trying to explain to people.

316
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,160
And so, if you're really interested, pay for it.

317
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,400
How do the people of Saturn feel about you being the head of the solar system?

318
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,580
Under, um, popular government, the figures for certain grounds.

319
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:11,560
So, when the ground is the solar secret government, 1945, the front being the United Nations,

320
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,800
the popular government front is national government all over the world.

321
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,180
Now, friends, you can't accuse us of not giving this...

322
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:20,900
This is the counterfeit Bob, this is the counterfeit Bob in Canada, Bob Dean,

323
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,100
who says he's Bob Dobbs, says that we based everything on him.

324
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,920
Don't say we never gave him a chance to speak.

325
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,360
...with the solar stage at the front.

326
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,960
Then in 1977, you have mass man as the secret government, it's the ground,

327
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,160
and the figures for that are the solar popular government and the universe as stage.

328
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:44,040
So, by 77, Sat, Saturn is absorbed in the solar figure.

329
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,020
Because you have universe stage.

330
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,440
And then the fourth level, second coming, which is today,

331
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,580
but this was put together in 85, so today is every, any point since 85,

332
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,620
you have the popular government is universal, and that includes the extraterrestrial contact.

333
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,920
And the front is the mythic stage.

334
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,000
The mythic stage is the hidden thing for the universal government.

335
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,060
So the universal government is absorbed by now.

336
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:15,020
After all, we are depending from J.R. Bob Dobbs,

337
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,540
the secret government, is the salvation that in 57,

338
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,760
aratos, indeed, is the secrets to human power.

339
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,880
Two satellites Probst, Joe De secondary.

340
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:45,720
The avaient of neutron Pret clarification with steels.

341
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:45,860
And that was a part of the mission.

342
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,000
We end this book here and all about.

343
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,940
operating properly. Normally, it would return a system of standard operating...

344
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,300
Oh, you're giving away church secrets. This is nuts, man.

345
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,300
...the visual amplifier. Don't listen to him. He's giving away church secrets.

346
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,320
Don't listen, don't listen, don't listen.

347
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,500
...designed to...

348
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,900
Oh, wait a minute. Does Alice figure in

349
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,420
any of this? Alice?

350
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,020
Alice? I don't know Alice.

351
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,160
...visual transmitter associated 22kV...

352
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,980
Ah, you're fading out. You can't triangulate on your signal.

353
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,400
Speak into the rectifier.

354
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,800
Unfortunately, the visual and aural power supplies are identical in appearance...

355
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,880
I don't know how long this static storm is going to continue.

356
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,820
...high voltage contactor stuck in the opposition...

357
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,340
I'm out of contact. He's out of control.

358
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,460
...high voltage. He's got a mind of his own.

359
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,980
...main target.

360
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:34,720
...

361
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,300
...

362
00:18:42,160 --> 00:19:12,160


363
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:42,160


364
00:19:42,160 --> 00:20:12,160


365
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:13,880
...

366
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,340
...

367
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:26,340


368
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:26,340


369
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:26,340


370
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:26,340


371
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:26,340


372
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,000
Oh no you don't, oh no you don't, Rudy!

373
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,260
Rudy Swartz Project, dear friends!

374
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,880
Whooping away in the background there.

375
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:51,720
Joe Newman, our beloved friend Joe Newman, whooping that out on his Rudy Schwartz Project album.

376
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,020
The Rudy Schwartz Project, Don't Get Charred, Get Puffy, and...

377
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,320
Oh, I'm going to switch that off.

378
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,940
Yeah, tell you what's been going on.

379
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,900
Since the last time I talked, I ran an edit of just some, well, radio shorts, you might call them.

380
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,640
Radio shorts by Radio Shorts, or Brain Rock West.

381
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:26,620
Our new friends out there in San Francisco, cutting some wild radio stuff.

382
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:36,520
And then some more KPFA, Dr. Howl, Howling Away in the Airwaves, from the edits by Phineas Narco, if you ever encounter.

383
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:36,920
You'll hear him.

384
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:36,920


385
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:41,320
You'll notice that one in your Subgenius catalog, a reference to that tape.

386
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:52,200
A little slip there of Bob Dean, the counterfeit Bob, the thief in Toronto, who's decided that he really invented the church of the subgenius.

387
00:21:52,640 --> 00:22:02,560
And what we're hearing in the background right now, and what I think I'm going to let carry us over to side two of show.

388
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,720
So I can get to the basic Bobby Hayton rant here.

389
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,040
This is Joe Newman in the background on Zug's Riffs album.

390
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:18,280
Actually, it's the Zug's band on a new Zug's Riffs album, which we'll be playing a lot of.

391
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,380
It's called Villagers.

392
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,680
This is an instrumental song called Villagers.

393
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,880
Yes, the title song.

394
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,560
I'm going to shut up and just let them go.

395
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:36,060
Let them go.

396
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,700
Let them go.

397
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,080
Let them go.

398
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:43,300
Let them go.

399
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,560
Let them go.

400
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:50,560
Yes, and all the bibble babble we like to burble at the center of the universe.

401
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,860
So shines it with deep.

402
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,560
He's Bob.

403
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,180
He don't ever change.

404
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,160
He's Bob.

405
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,100
He always stays the same.

406
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,540
He's got the lightning and the thunder.

407
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,840
And he's got the neutron bomb.

408
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,500
Bob is your sister and your brother.

409
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,560
Bob's your dad and mom.

410
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,580
Bob.

411
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,700
He's Bob.

412
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,580
Bob don't ever change.

413
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,720
He's Bob.

414
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,880
Always will be Bob.

415
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,320
He's Bob.

416
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,720
He's Bob.

417
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,420
He's Bob.

418
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,060
He's Bob.

419
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,820
He's Bob.

420
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:34,820


421
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:34,820


422
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:34,820


423
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:34,820


424
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:34,820


425
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,980
Oh, it's obvious of course.

426
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,120
The world in general is an idiot's delight.

427
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:54,960
A contrived mediocrity designed to keep morons occupied.

428
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,240
Just look at the notorious conspiracy media.

429
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,300
Not the decoy reputable media.

430
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,520
That's just a distraction.

431
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,120
and window dressing to make things look good.

432
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:12,840
I mean the stuff people really read and really believe whether they admit it or not.

433
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:19,680
Look at the tabloids, the true crime magazines, the TV murder shows,

434
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:25,700
the two-inch thick metallic embossed covered hack sci-fi novels and romances,

435
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,500
lame movie thrillers, manufactured music personalities.

436
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:35,540
It's bread and circuses with politicians as the clowns.

437
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,360
Except the more fun you want to have, the more you have to pay.

438
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,920
Don't act like you haven't thought about how bad all that stuff sucks.

439
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,440
You talk about it all the time.

440
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,360
The question is, what are you going to do about it?

441
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,060
They, the conspiracy, want you to buy all their crap,

442
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,120
work hard all day at a mindless slave task

443
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,480
to make to pay for more machines.

444
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,520
To play their indoctrination programs on.

445
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:09,140
To fill your home with pseudo collectibles in a limited number edition of a godzillion.

446
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,680
You know all that!

447
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,520
We've told you and told you all that and if you don't believe it by now,

448
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,660
there's no hope for you at all.

449
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:23,080
And you might as well climb back over the fence and roll in the mud with the rest of the slavish porkers, right?

450
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:27,980
And so you say to yourself, okay, I know what the conspiracy wants from me.

451
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,240
I know how they work and what they do and I'm not

452
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,120
buying it.

453
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,080
By gabs, I'm not going to do what they tell me.

454
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,760
I'm throwing away my TV, smashing my porcelain thimble collection,

455
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:44,860
frisbee-ing my CDs off Lover's Leap and joining the radical anti-government party to learn how to make bombs.

456
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,620
I'm shaving my head and burning my house down and the more they tell me not to,

457
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:54,920
the more I'll laugh in their faces and echo the noble sentiments of whoever it was that said,

458
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,660
free at last, free at last, thank blob almighty, I'm free at last.

459
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,000
Right?

460
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,480
Sucker.

461
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,460
You think they didn't plan for that?

462
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:10,880
You think they'll be surprised huddling around their long mahogany table,

463
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:17,200
appalled that one tenth of one percent of the population has quote caught on unquote

464
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,880
and won't go up the slaughterhouse ramp like good little lambies?

465
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,880
Well, hardy har har.

466
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,920
Listen, they know they can't dupe everyone with the same bird brain programming system.

467
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,220
They know they're going to be a few.

468
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,780
You who are just sharp enough to shake themselves awake and look around to see the green pastures

469
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:45,880
and still waters they were lying down by are actually a clanking conveyor belt carrying them relentlessly toward the whirling blaze.

470
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,880
They had that worked out a long time ago.

471
00:27:50,160 --> 00:28:00,120
They love it when the ones who see the horror of the conspiracy system go public with their ghastly revelations or join radical anarchist,

472
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,400
or otherwise render themselves entirely unbelievable.

473
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:13,400
Who do you think invented hippies, punk rock, anarchism, youth gangs, graffiti art, rock and roll, hallucinogenic drugs,

474
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,120
the new age movement, Christianity, cult films, alternative what have you?

475
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:24,940
Sure, it was some lone radical disillusioned soul at first, for about six months.

476
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,400
But by the time we heard about it,

477
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,220
it was already a pre-packaged,

478
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:30,220


479
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,940
official conspiracy product.

480
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,900
Oh, but the church of the subgenius is different, right?

481
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,340
It's neither a conspiracy mediocrity brainwashing program,

482
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,660
nor a dead end escapee trap.

483
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,060
Bob isn't just a cheap product,

484
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,160
or just a mind-numbing neurotic whip,

485
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,280
or a gaily painted prison cell of one sort or another

486
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,460
to confine drooling vidiots,

487
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,200
or raving reactionaries,

488
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:00,620
right?

489
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,160
Right?

490
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:01,520
Right?

491
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:01,800
Right?

492
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:02,820
Huh!

493
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,740
Wrong again.

494
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,440
Look, why don't you just give up trying to think it all,

495
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,280
little Miz and Mr. Einstein Jr.,

496
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,020
and pay attention!

497
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,380
The con has got all the bases covered.

498
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,960
It owns the ball and the ballpark.

499
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,700
Everything you can or will think or decide,

500
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:27,380
it has already got classified by numerical designation

501
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,200
on big spinning spools of half-inch.

502
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,300
Magnetic tape.

503
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,160
You sitting here listening to this right now,

504
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,060
thinking what you're thinking,

505
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,080
wearing those clothes in that environment,

506
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,640
tasting that particular taste in your mouth,

507
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,540
and hearing that particular tinny whine in your ear,

508
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,840
the one you don't always notice but which is always there,

509
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,540
they got a number for it.

510
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,920
Believe me, they got it all,

511
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,660
figured, dissected, classified,

512
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,220
and stuck in little boxes.

513
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,540
So what do I do, you may ask?

514
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,640
You can't win.

515
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,180
You can't outsmart them.

516
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,800
You can't think or do anything that they haven't already decided

517
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,520
you'll probably think or do.

518
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,660
You can't find a chink in their armor,

519
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,600
not even Bob,

520
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:18,100
because he is just another part of it all.

521
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,100
So it's time to pack it in.

522
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,840
Just give up and shoot yourself in the head

523
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,620
like you've been threatening to do

524
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,900
just to get attention and sympathy.

525
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,180
But this time, you really want to win.

526
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:30,660
And we'll do it.

527
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,640
And that, too, is just what they want you to do.

528
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,400
There really is no way out.

529
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,320
All that smash-the-conspiracy stuff is fun and amusing,

530
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:46,120
but putting your head under the machine's enormous clattering treads

531
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,360
isn't gonna slow it one tiny bit.

532
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:54,180
It's utterly, utterly hopeless.

533
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,680
Just stop fighting it.

534
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,300
Give up.

535
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,560
You're only making things harder for everyone.

536
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,320
All that kicking and screaming is only disturbing

537
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,260
the peaceful slumbers of the rest of us.

538
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,820
Oh, I'm not saying you should simply get in line

539
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,600
and walk under the hammer,

540
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,360
but if you can't do anything else,

541
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,860
you might as well try to see something positive about it.

542
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,540
Sure, the conspiracy program is cruel and demeaning.

543
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,500
The cage is cramped and ugly and smells bad,

544
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,640
but you can't get out.

545
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,820
And if you did get out, you'd just want right back in again,

546
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,640
because the thing that is making the situation intolerable

547
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,540
isn't in the situation.

548
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,280
It's in your head.

549
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,940
The scariest part of the conspiracy's lulling lies

550
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,860
is that they're all true.

551
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,920
Oh, not the ones about the products and how bad you need them.

552
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,420
I mean the ones about how life can be beautiful.

553
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,400
It's easier to go with the flow.

554
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,000
Things are better than they've ever been.

555
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,920
They know how true those are.

556
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:02,480
So they do anything they can to make those true truths

557
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,680
look stupid and childish.

558
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,360
They make Don't Worry, Be Happy into an insulting song,

559
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:13,080
ugly t-shirts, plastic hats, moronic coffee mugs,

560
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,600
so when somebody says it to you,

561
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,040
it makes you want to smash them in the face,

562
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:17,660
but you can't.

563
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:21,700
So you go buy a $3 shot of bar of gin instead

564
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,260
and worry miserably.

565
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:29,000
Oh, they make you want to kill Have a Nice Day

566
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,220
and then sell you the t-shirt with a shot and bleeding smiley face on it.

567
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,260
They'll make you hate love and love hate,

568
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,220
mock sincerity and honesty,

569
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,400
and sneer at genuine emotion.

570
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,460
Then they sell you $200 leather jackets

571
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,820
so you can prove you aren't a conspiracy zombie

572
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,780
like all those poor schmucks

573
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,240
who don't have skulls on their heads.

574
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:59,000
Or if you can't identify with either extreme of the haircut spectrum,

575
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,440
if they can't get you any other way,

576
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,820
if you're just a little too smart to be dumb

577
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,880
and a little too dumb to be smart,

578
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,920
and you're just about to fall through the cracks,

579
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
along comes Bob.

580
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,260
And then you read all about those real weirdos

581
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,880
who, even if they do wear uniforms and spout mottos,

582
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,100
wear intentionally self-mocking uniforms,

583
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:28,420
and spout irrelevant, confusing, and meaningless mottos.

584
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:28,880
Ma'am!

585
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,860
At last, you can think to yourself

586
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,520
or tell your uncomprehending friend,

587
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,380
at last there's a tiny spot in this big cold world

588
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,040
where I can feel at home.

589
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,680
At last, I've found a philosophy

590
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,000
that agrees to a certain degree

591
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,760
with the one I never really knew I had.

592
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:52,200
At last, I can just be honest with myself

593
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,840
and be who I really am.

594
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,220
Publicly and unafraid.

595
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,680
So you send lots of money to Bob

596
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:04,120
and buy t-shirts and buttons and tapes

597
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,580
and put on a divival,

598
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,160
have a radio show,

599
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,340
get a boy or girlfriend at last,

600
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,960
have the time of your life,

601
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,400
and never feel it

602
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:19,720
when the hammer finally does come down on your head.

603
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,140
Where'd it go?

604
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,040
Where'd it go?

605
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,840
So I'm through, so I'm through,

606
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,120
so I'm through, who's this guy?

607
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,600
Who's this guy?

608
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,480
Who's this guy?

609
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,660
I don't wanna hang around with him,

610
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,080
I want to sleep alone,

611
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,040
so my room will be mine,

612
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,080
without him no gr frost.

613
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,780
So we keep on turning here

614
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,140
until last night returns.

615
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,120
G piel hôn vivo nel rung

616

617
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,640
so I'm through

618
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:49,700
so I restnot夠

619
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:49,700

00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,720
The ocean was found when a dog, approved by dog,

621
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,420
approved protection of dogs, approved by dog,

00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,400
amputation of dogs, approved by dog.

00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,340
The movement of those members, the Видal molecule,

00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,660
You'll basically resemble a dab-dob, doc approved

628
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:26,340
Banning from the English or any other language the term dob, doc approved

629
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:31,840
Banning from the English language the term approved, doc approved

630
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:36,980
Banning of the linking of the word approved with the word doc, doc approved

631
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:48,000
You'll be assaulted with logic about the cord or evererve

632
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,720
Unattached is는 a person unloved until you move down in graduate school

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,720
Thank you.

642
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,060
Thank you.

643
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,160
Thank you.

644
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,820
Thank you.

Thank you.

646
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,820
Thank you.

647
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,260
Thank you.

648
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,380
Thank you.

649
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:20,380


650
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:20,380


651
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:20,380


652
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:20,380


653
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:31,320
I am important because

654
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:31,320


655
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,660
I am special because

656
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,960
when a evil thing

The Church of the New Faith.

The Church of the New Faith.

661
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:35,900
The Church of the New Faith.

662
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:11,460
Well, I think I'll let a girl group called the Starrills from California say it for me.

663
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,780
I'm on the rag!

664
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,400
Get me a Kotex!

665
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,300
How about a pamperin'?

666
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,520
I hate men!

667
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:35,160
I'm on the rag!

668
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,140
I'm on the rag!

669
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,480
I'm swollen like a pig!

670
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:47,360
Get me a pamperin'!

671
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,620
My boobs hurt!

I'm on the rag!

673
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,040
I'm on the rag!

674
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,880
Get me a Kotex!

675
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,720
I'm on the rag!

676
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,520
I hate you!

677
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,820
I hate me!

00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,560
So I'm on the rag!

I hate me!

00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,940
So I'm on the rag!

00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:34,980
Get me a Kotex!

687
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:34,980


688
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:35,480
I'm on the rag!

689
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,780
I hate men.

690
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:43,560
Don't even think of it tonight.

691
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,260
Of course I'd be wearing white.

692
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,560
I want a rag.

693
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,700
I want a rag.

694
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,040
Get me a go-tick.

695
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:03,740
I want a rag.

696
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,460
I hate you.

697
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:07,960
I hate me.

698
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:09,720
I want a rag.

699
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,860
I want a rag.

700
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:15,760
I want a rag.

701
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,280
Get me a bathroom.

702
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,480
I want a rag.

703
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,120
I hate you.

704
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,380
I hate me.

705
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,340
I want a rag.

706
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:31,140
Get me a go-tick.

707
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,460
Get me a rag.

708
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,700
I'm on the rise, I'm on the rise

709
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:42,900
I hate you, I hate me

710
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:50,680
I'm on the rise, I'm on the rise

711
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:53,180
Get me a touch of

712
00:47:54,280 --> 00:48:00,280
I'm on the rise, I hate you, I hate me

713
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,040
I'm on the rise

714
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:08,580
And I can go horseback riding and swimming

715
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:10,580
And even put it in my sock

716
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,940
Wow, I bet you couldn't tell that was a girl group that did that one, huh?

717
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,240
It wasn't L7 either

718
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,680
I heard that about three years ago

719
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,920
We were in L.A.

720
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,720
We'd come up from the San Diego Comic Convention to hang out

721
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,960
On Hollywood Freeway, coming into town

722
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,000
A station that was kind of a pirate station

723
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,460
In the 90s

724
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,520
21X out of Baja, California, Mexico

725
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:39,880
Played that

726
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,900
And somehow I learned the words real fast

727
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,740
I was driving the rental car, my head sticking out the window

728
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:48,200
And intoning those sacred words

729
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,020
But I'm sure Connie feels the same way

730
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:57,540
And looking around the vast amount of media influences

731
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,380
That we have here in the church

732
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:01,920
You can find all sorts of evidence of Connie

733
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,160
One of my favorite

734
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:05,460
Connys

735
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,620
And one of my favorite Connie incarnations

736
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:09,660
Is Tour of Satana and Faster Pussycat Kill

737
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:10,740
Kill the Immortal

738
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:11,380
Mortal

739
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:14,740
Oh, I'm wearing a Freudian slip, too

740
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:18,940
The Immortal Russ Meyer movie from 1966

741
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,700
And the Boss Tweeds

742
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,140
Did the theme song

743
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:23,460
You may

744
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,740
The Cramps

745
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:25,500
Not the

746
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,180
Not the Cramps that the Stirls have

747
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,800
But the group, the Cramps

748
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,440
You may remember

749
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,100
They did a cover of it

750
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,800
So let's hear the theme from Faster Pussycat

751
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,460
Kill Kill

752
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,540
kill by the boss.

753
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,440
Say uptown.

754
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:39,280
Say downtown.

755
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,940
Little nation of Serbia.

756
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,660
A singer.

757
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:02,640
A singer.

758
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:09,240
This sound is what caused your alacrity, your great humor and wit.

759
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,120
You're the fountainhead of your sputum.

760
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,520
Every morning is Halloween.

761
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:17,720
Every morning I get up and I put on that mask and I start scaring little kids.

762
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,660
And you go out there to life and you either get tricked or you get treated.

763
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,200
Yep, that's it.

764
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,860
It's one or the other, baby.

765
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,220
You trick and treat until you finally end up.

766
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,780
You won't be pretending to be a scary dead guy.

767
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,040
You really will be a scary dead guy.

768
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,500
I put a little blister in between.

769
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,160
My legs and the fries and the cheese.

770
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,260
There's two types of people in the world.

771
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,980
Those like to get tricked, those like to get treated, and those that can't count.

772
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:39,380
Oh, and the dead people.

773
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:40,220
Yeah.

774
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,260
So that's four.

775
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,200
Yeah, that's four.

776
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,180
What about the living dead people?

777
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,660
Oh, I knew you were going to come up with that.

778
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:49,400
The ones with the demons that speak from their navels.

779
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,280
Oh, hey, hey, it's patriotic time.

780
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:51,880
Yeah.

781
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,120
Okay, stand erect.

782
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,820
One nation, under-informed.

783
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:57,100
Get those shimmy knuckles off the floor, Sergeant.

784
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:57,840
I mean, private.

785
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,700
It's the pledge.

786
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:00,380
The pledge.

787
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,340
I pledge allegiance to the pyramid scheme.

788
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,900
And to the illusion for which it stands.

789
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,840
Private parts, put your hands back where they don't belong.

790
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:07,600
One nation in denial.

791
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,660
With error and access by all.

792
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:10,700
Oh, boy.

793
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:11,940
Oh, boy.

794
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,180
Oh, boy.

795
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,400
Oh, boy.

796
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:14,480
Oh, boy.

797
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:15,180
Oh, boy.

798
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:15,420
Oh, boy.

799
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,440
Bend over.

800
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:20,160
You know, I'm glad to hear...

801
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,300
Can you tell your radio audience to do that?

802
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:21,860
Yeah.

803
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:23,380
I pluck my lesions.

804
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:23,820
We can.

805
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,840
In the fog.

806
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:25,760
In the fog.

807
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:28,520
To a merry snake named America.

808
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,800
And to the res pubix on which it stands.

809
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,380
Berry and gold.

810
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,660
One nation.

811
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,300
Bright and shining like a stick.

812
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:40,020
Wow.

813
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,520
I'll run that up.

814
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,140
My flagpole.

815
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:43,980
Okay, Stan.

816
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:44,620
It's your turn now.

817
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:45,700
What a flagpole.

818
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:46,620
Yeah.

819
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,080
Hey, yeah.

820
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:47,460
Huh?

821
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,380
Impressive, huh?

822
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,100
Come on.

823
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:49,760
The music's speeding up.

824
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:50,180
Your pledge.

825
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:50,540
Your pledge.

826
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:50,700
Please.

827
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:53,120
This is my church.

828
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,280
There are others like it.

829
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,680
But this one is mine.

830
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,360
I will sleep with this church.

831
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,440
I will rape with this church.

832
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,620
I will live with this church.

833
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:02,620


834
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:02,620


835
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,680
I will lock and load this church.

836
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:05,700
Praise God.

837
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:07,540
Hail Saint Stupid.

838
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:10,000
Ay, ay, ay, ay.

839
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,460
I know, I know, but you know you never know.

840
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,120
I know, I know, but you know you never know.

841
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:15,580
I know, I know, but you know you never know.

842
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,000
I know, I know, but you never know.

843
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,780
If captured, I will reveal nothing but my underwear.

844
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:25,440
I shall show my lesions privately, and give only my name, rank, and serious numbers.

845
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,160
And then I shall be quiet again.

846
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,120
You got the rant part right.

847
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,080
I don't know.

848
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:34,020
I don't know if that's going to carry there on the heartland.

849
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:35,880
No, we've got to shave.

850
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:36,600
We've got to shave.

851
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:37,200
We've got to shave.

852
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:39,480
We've got to make it smooth around the edges for it to carry in the heartland.

853
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,460
It's got to have a lot of heart.

854
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,100
There's got to be cows.

855
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:42,100
There's got to be oxen.

856
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,180
There's got to be, like, women dressed like milkmaids.

857
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,240
There's got to be them farmer guys.

858
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,960
There's got to be a lot of guys with their muscles rolled up and their sleeves down.

859
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:50,160
We've got to, you know, the steel.

860
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:50,740
The steel.

861
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:51,200
The rust.

862
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,400
Where's the sizzle?

863
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,720
Show me the sizzle.

864
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:59,240
There it is.

865
00:52:59,240 --> 00:52:59,320
There it is.

866
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,100
Oh, my God, there it was.

867
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,600
It came right out.

868
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,920
The face sizzled.

869
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:04,380
The sizzle.

870
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,640
And it's still flowing out from your chakras.

871
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,040
Relax now.

872
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,540
Close your eye.

873
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:13,540
That's right.

874
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:20,840
The San Francisco sound.

875
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:22,280
Yeah.

876
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:23,240
Oh, yeah.

877
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,540
Yeah, it's just catching on out here in Ohio.

878
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,560
Yeah, it's about sucking.

879
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,140
Oh, you can't say that on the radio.

880
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,420
No, yeah, you can.

881
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,080
It's hell time.

882
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,400
Remember the songs by people with young and cold.

883
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:36,480
Come on, people.

884
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,100
Let's bomb together.

885
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:42,020
Let's all get together and bomb together.

886
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:43,420
We have to have a bomb circle.

887
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,580
Come on, let's hold our knuckles.

888
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:45,920
Let's have a bomb circle, yeah.

889
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,520
I'm bombing with you.

890
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,880
Let's turn to the north.

891
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:54,720
Praise the bombers from the north.

892
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,320
Praise the bombers from the north.

893
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,040
Praise the bombers from the south.

894
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:58,680
Praise the east.

895
00:53:58,820 --> 00:53:59,100
The west.

896
00:53:59,240 --> 00:53:59,460
Yes.

897
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:01,200
The four corners.

898
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:04,240
The bombers from the south are the napalmers.

899
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:07,420
The napalm bombers are the southern ones.

900
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,020
Let us salute the flak hackers of the west.

901
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:12,820
Shall we salute?

902
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,640
Where can you get those opium bombs?

903
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:17,820
Those would go over really good at a party, you know.

904
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:18,980
Actually, that's not opium.

905
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:23,540
It's this synthetic stuff that's 100 billion times more powerful than ours.

906
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:26,180
Used exclusively by the Russian defense forces.

907
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,140
And it's catching on in the rain.

908
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:29,560
They've seen.

909
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,040
I think they had some at Burning.

910
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:34,620
Very popular in Chechnya now.

911
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,700
Oh, yeah, yeah.

912
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:39,000
They just set off a bomb and people wandered through the clouds.

913
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,960
Take a few hostages and sit down for a nap.

914
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:46,580
That's what the flower children of 2002 are doing.

915
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:49,060
How many times were we buzz-bombed by the black helicopters

916
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:53,020
and yet could not conceal our pineal glands as they popped from our foreheads?

917
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:58,900
Detective Holmes, you just got back from Obscuristan, did you not?

918
00:54:59,240 --> 00:54:59,840
I did.

919
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,680
I was on special assignment in Obscuristan, yes.

920
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,640
Can you tell us anything about that?

921
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,420
Because all we've heard is the mainstream, you know, media about those people.

922
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:12,240
Well, it's a very poor, one of those poor ex-Soviet republics.

923
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,580
It's so poor that a big wind came along and blew all the cops off

924
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:17,080
and now they've got to import sand.

925
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,820
They're the only desert nation that can import sand now.

926
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:22,060
And so we're trying to help them out.

927
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:24,120
And so we're having a sand drive.

928
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:25,060
A sand drive.

929
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:28,240
And so if you could go out into your neighborhoods and go to the sandboxes

930
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,360
and kitty litter boxes around the neighborhood

931
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,540
and then collect that and then send it in.

932
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:37,700
And here's the address, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

933
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,300
Wait a minute, what are you telling people to send?

934
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,320
Sand.

935
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,280
This is to help the poor people in Obscuristan.

936
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,600
They've lost their sand.

937
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:47,380
Oh.

938
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:51,280
And, you know, we promised them $9 billion worth of sand

939
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,500
and they still have not collected a single drop of sand.

940
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:57,380
Well, you know, 100,000 people marched on Washington last weekend

941
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:58,220
and you can't even imagine.

942
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:58,220


943
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:58,220


944
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:58,220


945
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:58,220


946
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:58,220


947
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:58,220


948
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:58,220


949
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:58,220


950
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:58,220


951
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,440
We hardly heard anything about it and nobody really...

952
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,980
Nobody told me about it, dude.

953
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,500
100,000 people.

954
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:09,160
I heard somebody pulled Trent Locke's pubic goatee at the Eastwood funeral.

955
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:12,340
I mean, at the funeral for Senator Locke.

956
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:13,020
I mean...

957
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:15,380
See www.subgenius.com

958
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:19,200
In church, well, not too many shave, but certainly many.

959
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:24,800
In fact, most women in Protestant churches do not wear hats.

960
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,080
And for several weeks thereafter,

961
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,260
they were touchinged by random ugly ladies with R THAT's.

962
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:36,260


963
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:38,440
and was a good friend of mine and I do nothing.

964
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,820
Even when I let in rural gratties,

965
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:46,820


966
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:55,340
and r that there was, of course,

967
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:56,240
some kickback in the RAMSAY's case,

968
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:57,460
which is также for you,

969
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,220
at least there was...

970
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:01,200
these programs have been saved or have been modified.

971
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,200
Did you hear that?

972
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:02,640
Yeah.

973
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:06,120
Bob is your sister and your brother.

974
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,200
Bob's your dad and mom.

975
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:09,200
Bob.

976
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,320
He's Bob.

977
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,340
Bob don't ever change.

978
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,100
He's Bob.

979
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,480
Always will be Bob.

980
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:22,460
Bob had a woman named Connie.

981
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:25,200
She was the best he found.

982
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:31,320
You'll think when she stand in the doorway, the sun was on the ground.

983
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,200
He's Bob.

984
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,280
Bob don't ever change.

985
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,440
He's Bob.

986
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,920
Always will be Bob.

987
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,880
This has been a test.

988
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:48,500
If Bob had actually died, you would have heard this sound.

989
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,960
If Bob dies, we will...

990
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:55,540
That was awesome.

991
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,500
Bob died.

992
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:57,700
Good job, Bob.

993
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,340
That guy scared me.

994
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:12,840
I'd like to put out a request for the caller that thinks that Fylo is the greatest showperson that's ever been on the show.

995
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:15,280
Well, perhaps that caller is lure him to contact us.

996
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,360
Let's find out here.

997
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,060
He moved.

998
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,660
I think he moved.

999
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:20,680
Hello? You're on the air?

1000
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,860
Yes, I've been looking, looking for Simon.

1001
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,180
Well, what about Dolly?

1002
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:25,180


1003
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:27,180
Dr. Philodrumon, did you have a question for him?

1004
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,200
Oh, no, I didn't.

1005
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,640
All right, ditch this loser.

1006
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:34,040
There's a band hanging from the side of their face.

1007
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:38,420
Well, so much for the callers at 848-4425.

1008
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:42,760
Now one wildly insulted person is jumping up and down in front of the station with a shotgun,

1009
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:46,920
ready to be off the famous subgenius radio personality.

1010
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,140
They'll never take me alive.

1011
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,380
You'll never get me.

1012
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:50,480
You'll have to...

1013
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,920
You'll have to pry the show out of your cold pink hands.

1014
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,420
Sinbad had his prostate examined.

1015
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,660
See men poke sticks at monsters.

1016
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:00,860
See them battle the million skeletons.

1017
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:03,100
All old, all dead before.

1018
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,460
And don't miss appalling co-hit, The Big Monster.

1019
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:11,580
Nothing could stop it, except dynamite.

1020
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:17,400
And with our new virtual unreality imaging system, you too can have sex with Bart Simpson.

1021
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,560
Play some Hypergeeks records. I want to hear Jane or Hypergeeks.

1022
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:21,520
I want to hear The World of Fail.

1023
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:22,620
I want to hear the number of...

1024
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:23,900
I want to hear...

1025
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:24,660
I want to hear...

1026
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:24,820
I want to hear...

1027
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:25,620
I want to hear...

1028
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,560
I was talking to John Holmes the other day, and I said,

1029
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,260
is that your penis or a post-old digger?

1030
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,180
But seriously, no.

1031
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,300
You know when they...

1032
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:35,860
That was dedicated to Doug Smith on his show.

1033
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:38,960
Poor Willa Dobbs got nailed for saying that very thing.

1034
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,220
Yeah, you know, I was talking...

1035
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:44,760
I don't know how to top that, except by saying you're listening to Radio Station...

1036
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,920
90 to 90, the voice of the people.
