1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,240
Warhands on deck!

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,720
Warhands on deck!

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,240
It's a killer!

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:17,340
And yes, here we are back at your lounge chair. Please sit down and strap yourself in. You're about ready for another ride.

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,580
And remember, when they come by, please just don't be alarmed. They may be offering you something.

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,040
Oh, I paid extra for that part, buddy.

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,440
Well, sometimes it's...

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,520
Bring him on! Come on, baby!

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,900
Hour of Slack, sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:40,020
The Subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station and only in the city of...

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:54,520
Well, yes, dear friends, and this Hour of Slack number 928 is actually a rerun of Hour of Slack number 758.

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,520
The search for Dave's brain on the high seas.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,520
Of Hell. From our 75th season.

14
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,060
About three and a half, four years ago.

15
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:08,880
Praise Paul.

16
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,520
I don't wanna look at the TV today.

17
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,320
Cause it brings me down.

18
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,400
And I don't wanna hear what the papers they say.

19
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,000
They go round and round.

20
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,400
Well, we'll see, Bob.

21
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,120
You will indeed, Steve.

22
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,260
You come tonight, you will see, Bob.

23
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:41,080
This is a rock and roll party church. This is a church that is for sin.

24
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,180
Don't come expecting no performance art satire, dear God, please.

25
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,260
This is not gonna be moral majority takeoffs, my friend. This is not a joke!

26
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,620
This is the one true church. The last church.

27
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,740
After relaxing on the lake, Bob's ready to have a great time.

28
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,100
Entertaining his friends. Right, Bob?

29
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,880
Bob?

30
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,800
Bob?

31
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:59,740


32
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:29,740


33
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:59,740


34
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:29,740


35
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:59,740


36
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:29,740


37
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:59,740


38
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:29,740


39
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:59,740


40
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:29,740


41
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:59,740


42
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:29,740


43
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,720
Enjoy life like Bob.

44
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,240
Frankly, you know, the church of the subgenius is nonsense.

45
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:39,640
I mean, it's triviality. It has no significance for anything that anybody's gonna care about for any length of time.

46
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,680
You know, it may be lots of fun, and I don't mean to belittle it as such,

47
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:48,060
but when you're faced with a serious situation, you got a world that's on the verge of nuclear holocaust,

48
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:53,700
and the all-democratic institutions in this country that haven't already vanished are under severe attack,

49
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,320
and when all that comes to mind is the church of the subgenius, I gotta think that's one of the reasons we're in the trouble we're in.

50
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,080
Well, just to try and put the church of the subgenius to rest,

51
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,620
those of you who are not familiar with it, the church of the subgenius is essentially a group that,

52
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,420
and I'm sure that people will argue with me with this, but it's essentially a sort of a comedy routine.

53
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,640
I mean, they may have a philosophical point, but it's based on humor.

54
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,460
There are articles about it in John Rubenstein's, John Carroll's column in the Chronicle and things of that nature.

55
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,960
It's more or less a sort of a comedy affiliate.

56
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:25,520
It's about as politically weighty, or less politically weighty than, you know, Saturday morning kids' TV show.

57
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,280
There's nothing to it.

58
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,520
Okay.

59
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,700
I see.

60
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,780
Yeah.

61
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,760
Okay.

62
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,140
Here comes the funny part.

63
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:51,140


64
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,300
Let's play this one.

65
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,300


66
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,300


67
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,300


68
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,300


69
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,300


70
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,300


71
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,300


72
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,300


73
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,300


74
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,300


75
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,300


76
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,300


77
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,300


78
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,300


79
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,300


80
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,300


81
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,300


82
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,300


83
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,300


84
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,300


85
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,300


86
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,300


87
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,300


88
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,180
I'm using it.

89
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,620
Well, anyway, I'm choosing.

90
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,620
I never wanna lose it.

91
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,020
And I'm not gonna fight.

92
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,480
Got no need to be right.

93
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,400
I'm okay when I play in my room.

94
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,660
What about the other part?

95
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,520
I mean, I'm illuminating.

96
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,260
It's the themopods which have taken over.

97
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:29,740
Themopods?

98
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,240
They scared me in the elevator last week,

99
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,780
but I'm trying to find out about our side now.

100
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,420
It's the foundation, the undergarment of the false messiah,

101
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,620
the falsy messiah which has been prophesied

102
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,840
by the book of Romans in the book of Psalms.

103
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,540
But which side was the false messiah on?

104
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,820
Was he a themopod or an us-opod?

105
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,500
It was a themopod at the beginning,

106
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,560
but then, yea and lo, it became an if-opod.

107
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,480
Yea, he cometh in, he turneth on with the right hand,

108
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,280
and yea, he turneth off with the left hand.

109
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,460
Yeah, now it may sound ludicrous.

110
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,440
It may sound ridiculous,

111
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,240
to many unbelievers out there.

112
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:14,460
Satan is real, working in spirit.

113
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:21,380
You can see him and hear him in this world every day.

114
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,500
Satan is real, working in spirit.

115
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,240
He can bring you down with power.

116
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:33,680
He can tempt you and lead you astray.

117
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,940
I attended service at a little church in the country not long ago.

118
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,400
A prayer was led by an old country preacher

119
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,840
who then raised his hands as everyone stood and sang,

120
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,620
My God is real.

121
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,760
A warm breeze through the open windows

122
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,240
brought in the smell of new-mown hay in a nearby field,

123
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,500
and the singing of the hymn,

124
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,040
and the singing of birds could be heard in the moment of silence

125
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,860
as the preacher opened his Bible to read.

126
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,460
And then a little old man stood up,

127
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,560
bent with age, his hair thin and white,

128
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:10,740
and said,

129
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,380
Preacher, tell them that Satan is real too.

130
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,840
You can hear him in songs that give praise to idols and sinful things of this world.

131
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,560
You can see him in the destruction of homes torn apart.

132
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,480
You can see him in the destruction of homes torn apart.

133
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,000
I know that Satan is real, for once I had a happy home.

134
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,280
I was loved and respected by my family.

135
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,880
I was looked upon as a leader in my community.

136
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,860
And then Satan came into my life.

137
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,160
I grew selfish and unneighborly.

138
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,680
My friends turned against me.

139
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,800
And finally, my home was broken apart.

140
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,040
My children took their paths into a world of sin.

141
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:01,040
Yes, preacher, it's sweet to know that God is real,

142
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,880
and to know that in him all things are possible.

143
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,240
And we know that heaven is a real place where joys shall never end.

144
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,180
But sinner friend, if you're here today,

145
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,020
Satan is real too.

146
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,080
And hell is a real place,

147
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,520
a place of everlasting punishment.

148
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,400
Please allow me to introduce myself.

149
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,240
I'm a man of wealth and taste.

150
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,100
I've been around for long, long years.

151
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,600
Stole many a man's soul and faith.

152
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:55,360
I was around when Jesus Christ had his moment.

153
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,600
No doubt in faith.

154
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,680
Made them sure of that pilot.

155
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,820
Washed his hands and sealed his fate.

156
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,600
Pleased to meet you.

157
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,760
Hope you guessed my name.

158
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,040
Cause what's hustling you

159
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,360
is the

160
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,720
Nature of my game.

161
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:43,120
And is your soul clean when the devil comes by your door?

162
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,580
Are you ready to meet the devil at the crossroads, my friend?

163
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,060
All hands on deck.

164
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,960
Are you going to have what he demands in the way of my seatbelt?

165
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,520
Dick.

166
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,000
Dick?

167
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,800
That's far too many.

168
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,060
We'll have to call you the Centipede Man.

169
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,420
Now sit down here.

170
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,800
You're not the first experiment to fail.

171
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,780
I was waiting to be hanged in the morning.

172
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,280
But I didn't care about that.

173
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,540
I opened the door.

174
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,620
And there was the captain and his first mate.

175
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,440
I swung the hatchet, splitting the captain's head wide open.

176
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,760
I turned and nearly chopped off the first mate.

177
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,840
I saw his head at the neck.

178
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,820
There was blood and gore everywhere.

179
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,060
And I was glad for what I'd done.

180
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,920
Cor, Captain, look what he's done.

181
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,300
He's dead.

182
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,260
Stand to, men.

183
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,420
Men, this swab is there.

184
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,060
Stand to.

185
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:42,980
Oh, yes, sir.

186
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,720
Murder on the high seas is no more or less a damn...

187
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,360
It's a law act.

188
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:48,580
...miss.

189
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,020
I have to start again.

190
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,780
Lieutenant Smith, could you start the...

191
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,640
Off with his head.

192
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:53,940
I'm going to the toilet.

193
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:53,940


194
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,660
And scoop it out and put a candle in it.

195
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:03,540
And on with his new face, thanks to Luxorant and the beautiful skin treatment you can wear like a hat.

196
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,740
I see she's a virgin.

197
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,760
Are you, uh, too?

198
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,740
She looks like a used virgin, Sash.

199
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,440
Quite used.

200
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:16,320
In fact, you can smell her a mile and a half off, three fathoms away.

201
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,140
She's as used as a dog in heat.

202
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,500
You could smell her three fathoms under.

203
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:33,740
Yes, you are of a mind to smell things in Poseidon's locker if you wanted to go to where the frozen food locker is.

204
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:41,740
And his body hung from the yardarm at the neck, and he dangled in the wind for the rest

205
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,220
of the trip to the Americas.

206
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,320
Is that an albatross, sir?

207
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,760
No, Paunch, it's not an albatross.

208
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,920
Have we seen an albatross?

209
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:53,920


210
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:53,920


211
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:53,920


212
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,160
Albatrosses would be viewed as a gnomon of good fortune.

213
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:05,960
I personally believe that this is the fetidest bird native to Central America.

214
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,280
It wouldn't be far off from the Cami Isle.

215
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:20,080
And, uh, friends, we'll be right back to the hellish trip to deep inside Dave's brain.

216
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,620
Here on the Hour of Slack.

217
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,740
Slack for everyone but.

218
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,840
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

219
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,240
Oh, testiculoids and lactators.

220
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,820
It's an ESO radio subgenius night, or timeless day.

221
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:40,460
For inside Dave's water-filled head there is no time and less money.

222
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:51,420
Chaz Smith, friends, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, and we will continue with the devil on the high seas of Dave's brain.

223
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,740
But first, credits, friends.

224
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:58,440
That Sympathy for the Devil version was by Tiamat, and you will be hearing the rest of that.

225
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:05,340
Satan Is Real was by the Lauvin Brothers, posted to Alt Binary Slack by Magma3.

226
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:12,360
Usopods and Themopods is by, and the Bub Dubs radio, old radio.

227
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:19,340
Ancient KPFA Berkeley sub-show of Howl Robbins, Puzzling Evidence, Gary Gabrokeframe, and Bob Nelson.

228
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,720
Let Me Play My Music is Frank Marino's.

229
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,960
And Mahogany Rush.

230
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:32,920
You also heard Pope Meyer, Pope David N. Meyer, the Pope of All New York, and myself, Reverend Ivan Stang, on Media Barrage 10 remix, subgenius CD.

231
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,640
And Ghost Riders in the Sky was by Dick Dale, my friends.

232
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:51,160
The ESO show, which is most of what follows, is broadcast from WCSB Cleveland State University, friends, every Thursday at midnight on the net at WCSB.org.

233
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,700
With host Chad Hogan.

234
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:52,880
And Chad Smith.

235
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,900
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

236
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,920
And now, this beefy message.

237
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,180
You like beef?

238
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,860
Mommy, I'm scared of the clowns.

239
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,340
Beef or my hood?

240
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,420
Beef by the pound, by the ton, and by the honey bun.

241
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,040
We got beef for you at Tim and Terry's Slaughterhouse.

242
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:19,020
Stop in and we'll smack them down and deliver it fresh and piping hot, or creamy smooth, the way it's supposed to have been.

243
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,700
Mommy, the clowns.

244
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,540
The clown scares me.

245
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,680
That's all right, son.

246
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,600
They're supposed to scare you.

247
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,000
The clown makes us laugh.

248
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,940
Yes, the clown takes away our fear.

249
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,900
Because it reminds us of our own absurdity.

250
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,660
Our own mortality.

251
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,800
The clown makes us laugh.

252
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,120
But the tightrope walker.

253
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,160
Death inspires us.

254
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,120
Yes, the tightrope walker makes us fear death.

255
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,000
Makes us fear death.

256
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,200
Shining in their silver suit in the spotlight.

257
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,540
Like high above.

258
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,740
We can't all be tightrope walkers.

259
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,120
And the Santa reigns.

260
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,140
Most of us have to be clowns.

261
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,620
Popeye, Ticklefish, and his amazing dangling unit.

262
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,700
There's more clowns than acrobats.

263
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:14,520
Even before more stunts and isoobs dump you in the buff than you've ever seen available or possible to any human-born woman.

264
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,300
You won't believe that something this hideous could survive.

265
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,880
But it's real.

266
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,840
It's here.

267
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,100
It's only 50 cents.

268
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,960
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

269
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,040
See him.

270
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,140
Hear him.

271
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,400
Smell him.

272
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,580
It's alive.

273
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,680
It's real.

274
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,500
It's Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

275
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,960
See the freak.

276
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,300
See the hideous abortion of God's nature.

277
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,300
Step behind the curtain and see the freak.

278
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,300
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

279
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,420
I'm afraid of fire, man.

280
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,900
Stop flicking that lighter at me.

281
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:49,860
Hey, man.

282
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,220
Look at the freak.

283
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:52,580
Yeah.

284
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,160
Well, if I looked like you did, then I wouldn't be pointed.

285
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:55,760
Yeah.

286
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,380
Where'd you get that rouge, you old bitch?

287
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,020
Yeah.

288
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,200
Hey.

289
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,220
Oh, man.

290
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:00,860
Come on, man.

291
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,140
I don't know no size, you old freak.

292
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
I'm just here to show you.

293
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,260
Look at the freak.

294
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,120
Look at the freak.

295
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,820
Kind of funny.

296
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,600
Look at the freak.

297
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,560
Freak.

298
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,280
Freak.

299
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:08,960
Freak.

300
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:09,260


301
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:09,460
Freak.

302
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:09,780
Freak.

303
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:10,320
Freak.

304
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:10,600
Freak.

305
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,280
Freak.

306
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:11,540
Freak.

307
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,420
Freak.

308
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,020
Freak.

309
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,280
Freak.

310
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:15,300


311
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:15,300


312
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:15,300


313
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,460
Dave, how could things have gone so terribly wrong?

314
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,820
How did you end up here?

315
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:25,900
Once you were a strapping young lad with a peachy dark complexion and miles and miles

316
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,200
of good humor and look at you now.

317
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:29,640
Crawling.

318
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,620
Testicles are dragging on the ground.

319
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,140
Crawling in your own piss.

320
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:33,340
You were a good humor man, too.

321
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,860
It was a lot of fun back then, wasn't it?

322
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,560
You're wearing like eye mascara.

323
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,720
You made a lot of money in New York City.

324
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,580
Yeah, man.

325
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,400
Those were the days.

326
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,180
Now, what do you think you're going to do?

327
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,900
You're a good humor man, too.

328
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,000
You're wearing like eye mascara.

329
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,000


330
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,000


331
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,000


332
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,740
Now you have a schlong the size of an elephant's trunk.

333
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:49,900
Freak!

334
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,300
Those were the days, man.

335
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,080
I was hung like a horse.

336
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,920
Fly.

337
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,540
Oh, man.

338
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,680
Am I ever going to get out of here?

339
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,500
It's not cool.

340
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:07,420
And so Dave curled up inside the dumpster behind the jack-in-the-box.

341
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,880
A hated cold rain.

342
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:19,320
For the rain pouring down on his shivering bones as he waited for Bob to come and deliver.

343
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,340
He waited.

344
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,680
And he waited.

345
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,000
Taking the abuse of passerbys.

346
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,820
Oh, man, I can't live like this anymore.

347
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,720
Oh, my God, dude.

348
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:38,740
Hey, lady.

349
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,120
What are you doing over here?

350
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,520
Just passing by.

351
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,680
Don't talk to that freak, honey.

352
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,360
Come on.

353
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:47,840
Hey, lady.

354
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,620
Wait, don't go.

355
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,660
Let's do this, Nick.

356
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,520
Back here.

357
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,280
Dave.

358
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,740
Back here behind the curtain.

359
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,060
Come on.

360
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,940
Take a good look at him.

361
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,040
But his passage.

362
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,280
Take this envelope.

363
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,680
Go down to the pier.

364
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,440
This is a passage to America.

365
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,920
Just shut up and go now.

366
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,400
What's in the envelope, man?

367
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,460
Just shut up and go.

368
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,640
Give it to the man on the boat.

369
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,980
So Dave was able to escape London and made his way to America.

370
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:09,720
Where?

371
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:20,820
Where he was adopted by a tribe of Iroquois who took him into the sacred cave of the bear droppings.

372
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:29,160
And they showed him there the paintings which predicted that someday a cowboy would come alone.

373
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:30,880
Him here.

374
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,880
Him here.

375
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,300
And no way.

376
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,100
White cowboy arrived finally.

377
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,960
Prophecy come true.

378
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,980
Better known as...

379
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,000
...the Pops of the Pops.

380
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,040
Moms and dads.

381
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,620
And made their way through Wolf Pass.

382
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,180
And we had a nice and tight.

383
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,440
There's your grandpa there.

384
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,520
Oh, he was quite a figure.

385
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,180
A little danger.

386
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,100
Knock him down.

387
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,780
Bring out the women that they might receive the seed of the Dave mask.

388
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,460
He was brave.

389
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,720
I can't go all the way back.

390
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,260
No, no.

391
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,380
I'm going far enough.

392
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,940
No, no, no.

393
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,320
Come on, come on.

394
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,880
You gotta see the rest of the exhibit, Dave.

395
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,340
Just, just hunker down.

396
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:06,980
Come on.

397
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,640
That's not a matter of moments.

398
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,660
Come on, now.

399
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,520
And hence when the first wood teachers came to our land,

400
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,500
and here's about four or five of us attacking about 300 of them.

401
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,640
No way!

402
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,620
La hay!

403
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,500
No way!

404
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,060
Cowardly day!

405
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,540
No dumb!

406
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,500
No, no, no!

407
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:26,540
No, no, no!

408
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,540
...took them in as his... as a god.

409
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,580
They worshiped him tied to their totem pole.

410
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,380
Bring out the burning pot!

411
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,440
Okay, you guys.

412
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:45,040
They decided to feed him to himself as an act of sacrifice.

413
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,560
Okay, now, once you get the Papa-Namanskins ready...

414
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,700
And they danced around the pot.

415
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,320
...and the papayas...

416
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,660
...as the lonesome Dave ate his own self.

417
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,500
And you guys can all join in, too.

418
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,340
Once I get down to below my navel, I don't know if I'm gonna stop.

419
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,340
And here came the ballerinas.

420
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,960
...popping like a little pork.

421
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,360
...like a little pork.

422
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:13,160
Hundreds and hundreds of ballerinas in pink foofoos.

423
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,900
Oh, my God, I've never seen such a display of Hursuit masculinity.

424
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,440
The lady in the farthest corner...

425
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:21,640
...of your left eye...

426
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,660
They're all g-males!

427
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,680
...appears to be wearing a, uh, wolfhandsuit...

428
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,220
Oh, my God! They have no underwear!

429
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,000
...of some sign of a walnut-cocked-up Halloween day...

430
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,160
These were supposed to be okay Indian!

431
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,660
...Hursuits.

432
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:38,120
And as we can see from bottom undertop, the off-camera shot shows her...

433
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,600
with Pappy in the bar room beforehand,

434
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:44,860
and isn't it wonderful how she can move the lower thing there?

435
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:50,100
But slowly the drug began to wear off,

436
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:55,500
and Lonesome slowly awoke from his peyote-induced trance

437
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,780
of wonderful ballerinas,

438
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:03,620
and looked around him to see an altogether different reality.

439
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,620
I'm doing a power wedge.

440
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:08,380
And, uh, I, oh, man.

441
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,080
Oh, my God, I'm back in that thing again.

442
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,080
Oh, shh, shh, shh.

443
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,000
Oh, my God.

444
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,800
This is a freak.

445
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,340
Look at the freak.

446
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,980
He's a beautiful ballerina.

447
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,980
Thrimble his arms.

448
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,140
Remain calm.

449
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,520
Thrimble his arms.

450
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,160
Then remove his legs.

451
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,100
And reattach them.

452
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,080
Now your elbows.

453
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,740
I think the process is about to be...

454
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,880
Now he will remove his head and reattach it.

455
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,040
Notice how we are able to keep his head alive,

456
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:50,400
all by itself, hooked up to these pumps and bellows.

457
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,060
That's quite a sandwich right there.

458
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,260
It comes with a side of slow and fright,

459
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,680
and if you'll check closely, Dave's ears are actually paranormal.

460
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,620
That's what they used to call them in the old country.

461
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,560
He can actually hear sights and sounds below his own vision.

462
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,440
That is, if he's looking at anything,

463
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:04,760
he'll see something that's not even a sight.

464
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,620
Oh, look at that errand stare.

465
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,380
Let's scoop it out and put a candle in it.

466
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,260
Look at the freak.

467
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,840
Please evacuate me, Harriet.

468
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,320
Look, he'll eat a live chicken or veggie.

469
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:17,780
Please.

470
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,640
Look at that.

471
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,720
Hey, Dave.

472
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,360
Hey, Dave, come on over here.

473
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,800
Get a little closer to the window.

474
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,180
Can you hear me?

475
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,600
I can hear you.

476
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:34,600


477
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,540
You're just fine, man.

478
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,080
I got a little proposition for you.

479
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,940
See these things I got in my hand?

480
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,120
They glow in the dark.

481
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

482
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,120
See, there are three of these things.

483
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,420
You hold them together like this, and you can do anything.

484
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,280
You could be out of here in a matter of minutes, see, Dave?

485
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,160
My eyes are so heavy.

486
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,920
We have brought you here to pass on the sacred orb.

487
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,960
Oh, my God.

488
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:06,840
Dave, listen.

489
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,420
I'm trying to make it go away.

490
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,320
You have passed all the tests.

491
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,700
No, I can't look at you.

492
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,100
I won't pay attention.

493
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,220
He has even passed the sacred stone on his kidney.

494
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,080
No, no.

495
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,540
No, I have not.

496
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,000
I have.

497
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,700
I've passed the sacred stone.

498
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,380
Oh, my God, a bloody wad of my own existence.

499
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,480
Now prepare to receive the orb.

500
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,260
This is what I was made to use.

501
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,700
This is what I was born for.

502
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,660
Bend over, human.

503
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,300
I can't even re-cross with my own legs.

504
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,560
Bend over, human.

505
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,480
Mm-hmm.

506
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:34,600
I'm going to have to get out of here.

507
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:34,600


508
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:34,600


509
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,300
.

510
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,580
No, no, no, no.

511
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:40,300
I am the colonel of the summer people.

512
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,260
Oh, thank your function and the daunts.

513
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:51,860
The protuberance appears to have been clipped off in one of the frost addresses.

514
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:57,600
We can see here the colon area is nice and shiny and clean.

515
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,860
Nurse, sutures.

516
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,160
They contain a few remnants of the toxic materials.

517
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:03,960
Scalpel.

518
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,260
Scalpel.

519
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:04,580
Scalpel.

520
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,160
Just scoop it out like this.

521
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,240
You have the vacuum cleaner.

522
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:08,900
Vacuum.

523
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,680
Vacuum cleaner.

524
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,440
Vacuum nurse.

525
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,320
Vacuum cleaner.

526
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,300
I'm sorry.

527
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,320
I didn't mean to interrupt you.

528
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,100
You were playing golf while I was...

529
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,840
I was scooping out the patient's brain.

530
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,780
I was on the clamp.

531
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,300
Hold.

532
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,280
Nurse, clamp.

533
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,560
Hold it for me.

534
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,040
Where is that candle?

535
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:23,740
Suction.

536
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,380
Suction.

537
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:25,920
Right here.

538
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,460
Five slaps.

539
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:27,820
Clamp.

540
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,760
And a little bit of cappuccino for the whole group.

541
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,400
Well, it looks like he isn't going to make it.

542
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,500
I don't think so.

543
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,540
I'm glad to say that we've wasted our time.

544
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:42,120
Let's go ahead and drink the cappuccino before it gets cold.

545
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,300
What about the next patient?

546
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,960
Do we have any of the same ones?

547
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,300
Let's move this one out before he gets cold.

548
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,200
He's going to start stinking, I think, in a while.

549
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,600
He was already cold when we were.

550
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,240
Yeah, yeah.

551
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,360
What was his name?

552
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,420
Jave?

553
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,140
Lonesome.

554
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,480
A so-called lonesome cowboy.

555
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,160
They called him Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

556
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,100
He lived...

557
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,960
Thousands of years ago.

558
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,360
He was a playboy of the streets.

559
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,140
A man with only one good rancid eye that did the work of many.

560
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,840
Lonesome bovine boy.

561
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,240
His legend lives today.

562
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,140
Across the great plains of Ohio.

563
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:27,120
Scrawled upon bathroom walls across America.

564
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,960
Rest areas across the highways.

565
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,040
And a plastic cathedral of hair somewhere in Oval and Ohio.

566
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:38,640
Truckers still fill the citizens' banderades with his name.

567
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,940
Late into the night, he's prepared to end his own life.

568
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,420
To fervor his bioparkal purportions.

569
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,680
Yes, Dave finally achieved fame.

570
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,980
But at what price?

571
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,440
At what?

572
00:30:59,100 --> 00:30:59,480
At what?

573
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,560
Price.

574
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,660
Well, we'll be back on Larry King Live, talking about what price?

575
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,800
Fame and fortune.

576
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,680
You're on the air with Larry King Live.

577
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,000
Human.

578
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,080
Shut up.

579
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:15,560
Shh!

580
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,140
Humans.

581
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:16,600
Shh!

582
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,500
A quick check into the background.

583
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:37,000
This man reveals that not only is he probably a remnant of the Pleistocene era or some bygone era like that.

584
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,760
But he's also well, well underdeveloped to intake.

585
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:47,760
And in comparison with other Pleistocene man's, or woman's of his same peer group and function.

586
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,580
Look here.

587
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:57,220
We see his liver and spleen are filled with tiny pieces of roots and drawings by inarticulate women.

588
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,480
And some men are like, oh, she's got a baby.

589
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:07,180
And sometimes when the moon is right, blue, blue artifacts emerge from the top of his skull.

590
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,620
All hands on deck.

591
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,700
All hands on deck.

592
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,320
All hands off my dick.

593
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:22,520
Have you seen the white whale in the trousers of the Dave men?

594
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,340
Eh?

595
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,240
You snobs!

596
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,540
Ha ha ha!

597
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,820
Have you seen the white whale?

598
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:30,720
Never!

599
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,160
Captain, you're getting a hernia.

600
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:35,760
Sit down.

601
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,240
You're going to disturb the metallic haircut.

602
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,120
Spit off the right test liquid.

603
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,620
Oh, hang on, lad.

604
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,820
We'll see the whale.

605
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:46,880
I'll never rest till I see the whale turn belly up in the sea.

606
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:54,000
Captain, I'd like to remind you that we are sailing on a kind of a psychoplasmic sea, if you will.

607
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,220
And the whale is bound to eat you alive.

608
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,340
I've no way around it because he's got control of your mind.

609
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,560
Oh, I'm well aware, mate, that the whale is but a metaphor for me.

610
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,120
Oh, I go, I'm a metaphor.

611
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,360
I'm a metaphor.

612
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,960
But I'll, I'll, hand me that harpoon and I'll go for it.

613
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:20,720
Well, Captain, I'm afraid I'm going to have to hand you the metaphoric harpoon, if you will, because the real harpoon resembles a large, large packing paper tube.

614
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,220
However, on the other hand, it is as fine a silver sterling.

615
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:30,040
A sterling steel harpoon capable of taking down any metaphoric whale.

616
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,380
Bend over, human.

617
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:43,060
Friends, bend over for Lord God, Lord God, for God.

618
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,720
Bend over, human.

619
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,320
God is coming.

620
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,720
Bend over, human.

621
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,100
This is a great sign for a change.

622
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:03,060
I killed the Tsar and its ministers.

623
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,320
Anastasia's green evade.

624
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,880
I'll hold a tank at the General's rank.

625
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:20,300
When the Blitzkrieg rage and the body's dead.

626
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,920
I'm pleased to meet you

627
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,960
Hope you guessed my name

628
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,340
Cause what's possible in you

629
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:49,640
Is the nature of my game

630
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,300
I watched with glee while your kings and queens

631
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:04,960
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made

632
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,020
I shouted out who killed the canadians

633
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:16,400
When after all it was you and me

634
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,620
Let me please you

635
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,460
Please introduce myself

636
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,800
I'm a man of wealth and taste

637
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,820
I lay traps for troubadours

638
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:38,080
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

639
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,380
Pleased to meet you

640
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,060
Hope you guessed my name

641
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,660
Cause what's possible in you

642
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:57,180
Is the nature of my game

643
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,460
Pleased to meet you

644
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,540
Hope you guessed my name

645
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,860
Cause what's possible in you

646
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:19,160
Is the nature of my game

647
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,160
Pleased to meet you

648
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,700
East, West, North

649
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,340
East, West, North

650
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,980
East, West, North

651
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,920
West, West, North

652
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,000
East, West, North

653
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:52,240
It's you, it's me

654
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,240
I can't wait

655
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,340
It's you

656
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,040
It's you

657
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,660
It's you

658
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,300
It's you

659
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,240
Satan is real too

660
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,200
And hell is a real place

661
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,720
A place of everlasting punishment

662
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,900
Satan is real

663
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,320
Working in spirit

664
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,800
You can see him

665
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,660
And hear him

666
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,560
In this world every day

667
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,280
Satan is real

668
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,860
Working with power

669
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,020
He can tell you

670
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,440
And lead you astray

671
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,800
It's what you need

672
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,320
It's time for your bath now, Stan

673
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,180
Don't be afraid of those tepid

674
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,640
I'm glad those tepid

675
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,360
Giant robot automatic

676
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,720
Butt-raping machine

677
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,880
Finally was shut down

678
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,000
Yes, it is

680
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,000

00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:55,660
um i guess i must have messed up real bad i guess if southern baptist was ronnie cox

697
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:55,660

00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,420
after all. Don't leave a mess

699
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,800
where you go.

700
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,240
Leave a mess where you've been.

701
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,260
What good is this $90 gonna

702
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,340
do me here?

703
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,460
Money means nothing.

704
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:09,440
The soul means nothing.

705
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:11,480
It took

706
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,560
Salmaister to triple your money back.

707
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,420
I thought hell was a big joke.

708
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,700
I thought it was a big joke.

709
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,420
Hell is an illusion.

710
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,920
All my friends are gonna be there,

711
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,100
I used to say.

712
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,760
Hey, all my friends

713
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,440
are Dave,

714
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,620
Chaz, Princess Wee.

715
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,340
What are you guys doing

716
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,000
here in Cleveland, Wisconsin

717
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,680
for eternity?

718
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,300
We're not really here, we're just kind of like

719
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,600
a figment of your imagination.

720
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,520
It's part of

721
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,300
the Dave brain.

722
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:43,980
Oh,

723
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,800
what do you mean it's not real?

724
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,320
It's like

725
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,300
matrix to the tenth power.

726
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:54,200
Just part of the Dave...

727
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:54,440
No,

728
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:54,720
you,

729
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,600
you mean me,

730
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,800
my whole life,

731
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,500
all of reality was all,

732
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,020
all along,

733
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,340
it was just part of Dave's imagination,

734
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,620
not my own?

735
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:07,380
You mean Dave was the one who was holding it all together all along,

736
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,400
but now he's waking up?

737
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,240
That's right, Sting, baby,

738
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,680
he's waking up and he's got a problem.

739
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,040
He's grown 400 pounds in the last half an hour.

740
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:21,700
His hypothalamus is the size of a large tubular object.

741
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,960
You might call that bowling alley down there by your shoe.

742
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,440
And he's ready to sting like a bee and smoke like a smoke thing.

743
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,840
If you're not ready when he's ready, there's the door.

744
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,400
It's smocked.

745
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,460
Will the Dave ever wake up from the dream?

746
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:41,560
No, and void.

747
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:46,940
Or will the dream wake up from Dave?

748
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,660
Wow, man.

749
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,680
Well, I...

750
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,860
It was 1942, I think it was.

751
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:01,120
Dave, inside of Dave's brain, it's beautiful.

752
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,960
It's like a journey to the center of the earth.

753
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:07,280
Inside the brain is a whole other world.

754
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,500
It's sparkling.

755
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:13,900
Those waterfalls, those mushrooms, those sunsets.

756
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,160
I think it was.

757
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,060
Yeah, it was in Oca-hocca.

758
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,780
Those galaxies, those signals.

759
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,600
Those eggs and stars.

760
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,260
Look, those mountains.

761
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,320
Those palm trees.

762
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,640
I forget what the hell it was.

763
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:34,720
It's like a black light poster, only it's alive.

764
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,260
Those time-lapse clouds and roses opening.

765
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:39,960
She's still the same.

766
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:45,420
Well, I'd love to, but I'm not really a human being.

767
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,020
I'm not really human.

768
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:48,340
Wow.

769
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,880
Dave's brain is beautiful after all.

770
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,280
Oh, I...

771
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,520
It's nothing like the hell that I imagined it to be.

772
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,460
Oh, it's so shiny.

773
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,560
It's like the planet Xeron.

774
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,460
It's...

775
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,420
It feels like home.

776
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,280
Oh, my God.

777
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,440
Look at the little cherubim dancing.

778
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,520
Look off in the distance, scampering naked women.

779
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,220
He's drooling, but it's beautiful.

780
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,900
It's like a fountain of cherry candy drops.

781
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:16,540
Little magicians and sorcerers running around.

782
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:19,640
They're trying to put a little pointed hat on his head right now, but...

783
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,740
No, they're putting it on.

784
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:21,880
Shines from the land.

785
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,820
The plants and brownies resting under the mushrooms.

786
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,060
The most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

787
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,060
Uh-oh.

788
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,320
I'm in trouble now.

789
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:31,980
Who unplugged me?

790
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:32,740
Shit, man.

791
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,360
Man, somebody trip on the cord.

792
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,100
Man.

793
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:35,860
What the hell's...

794
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:36,040
What's...

795
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:36,600
Oh, my God.

796
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,500
Oh, I'm sorry, you guys.

797
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:42,620
I think I...

798
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:43,620
Who are you?

799
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,760
I think I...

800
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:46,760
Pulled the plug on Dave.

801
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,120
Here I am.

802
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,800
Who are you?

803
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:51,860
Oh, could be someone.

804
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:51,860


805
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:51,860


806
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:51,860


807
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:51,860


808
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:51,860


809
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:51,860


810
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:52,660
I don't even remember, man.

811
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:53,900
There he come.

812
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,020
Who am I?

813
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:04,280
I was just walking in like...

814
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:14,260
A, but anyway, what was his name?

815
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:14,720
Well, I don't wanna, you know.

816
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,260
I don't wanna give up yet?

817
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:16,260


818
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,880
Hell, he's moving like a beast.

819
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:20,880


820
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:20,880


821
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:20,880


822
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,620
Making my head hurt.

823
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:21,840


824
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:21,840


825
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:21,840


826
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:21,840


827
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:21,840


828
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:21,840


829
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,740
the Dave brain.

830
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,940
Dave, Dave, come back to us.

831
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:27,460
It's

832
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,560
been 43 years,

833
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,960
Dave. We missed you.

834
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,160
These beautiful dreams.

835
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,040
I don't ever want to go swimming

836
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:35,520
again.

837
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,160
I know he'll come back.

838
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,940
Look at him laying there like a

839
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:41,820
seven-year-old.

840
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,140
Dancing to weird techno beat music and bothering me.

841
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:46,360
Call me

842
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,260
Davey.

843
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,960
I know he'll come back to me.

844
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,960
I think he's in Al DeMarco's in my closet

845
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,820
arguing with him.

846
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,440
Oh my God.

847
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,020
He's the weird toothless old mountain

848
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:58,380
guy.

849
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,140
He's only got one eye and he's pointing it right

850
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:02,620
at me.

851
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,300
It's okay, Dave.

852
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:08,220
You've clicked

853
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,460
your heels three times.

854
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,540
We're going home.

855
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,740
You've done your part.

856
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:14,940
It's over, Dave.

857
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,180
You're starting to smell a little bit, but it's okay.

858
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:18,820
You can stop.

859
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,180
It's okay.

860
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,300
No, really.

861
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,400
There is no more.

862
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:23,860
No more rapid eye movement.

863
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:24,320
No arms.

864
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:24,840
No arms.

865
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:25,240
No arms.

866
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:25,580
No arms.

867
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:26,160
Wake up now.

868
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:26,960
Peace

869
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:29,020
is yours

870
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,480
finally, Dave.

871
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,400
Your rest has come.

872
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,760
On fronds.

873
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,820
They'll make a religion around you.

874
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:36,080
Your peace.

875
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,940
That will last for thousands of years.

876
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,480
They'll think that you died

877
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:42,140
back there

878
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,200
on that yard arm.

879
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:46,900
But it won't be true.

880
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,140
You get to go home now.

881
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:55,520
It's part of the protection program offered by

882
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,140
the powers that be.

883
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,360
If you believe in Dave.

884
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,760
If you believe in Dave out there.

885
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,700
Pick your nose.

886
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,640
Pick your nose for Dave.

887
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,320
Everyone who can hear me now.

888
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:12,020
You can do it.

889
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:14,080
Everyone within the sound of our voices.

890
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,340
Pick our nose.

891
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,880
Reach down there and stick your nose.

892
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:16,880


893
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:17,940
Stick your finger up there.

894
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,720
And then just twist it around.

895
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,660
And Dave will come back.

896
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,000
Just twist it.

897
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:23,300
It's working.

898
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:23,780
It's working.

899
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:24,820
Take the mucus out of your nose.

900
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:25,940
He's coming back.

901
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:26,680
He's working.

902
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,180
He's coming too.

903
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:27,740
He's coming back.

904
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:28,800
He's picking kids.

905
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:29,320
I can see it.

906
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:29,960
It's

907
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:30,780
Is the eyes are quivering?

908
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:30,800
It's

909
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,040
Is the eyes are quivering?

910
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:31,740
It's

911
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:32,080
It's

912
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,080
It's

913
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:34,160
It's

914
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:34,620
It's

915
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:34,680
It's

916
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,380
It's

917
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:35,380


918
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:35,700
It's

919
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:35,720
It's

920
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:35,760
It's

921
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:36,700
It's

922
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:37,060
It's

923
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:37,180
It's

924
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:37,180


925
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:37,180


926
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:37,300
It's

927
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,640
It's dead again.

928
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:41,500
Oh well.

929
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:42,740
Huh.

930
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,200
Figures.

931
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:50,120
Well how long can we go on reanimating the guy who died five times in the last half an hour?

932
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:53,800
It's like when a cat plays with a little lizard it finds down in Arizona.

933
00:47:54,380 --> 00:48:00,640
And everything seems fun and then suddenly the lizard just sort of starts twitching.

934
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,920
And the cat tries to keep playing with it like it's okay.

935
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:05,840
Yes.

936
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,440
You can tell there's something very wrong.

937
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,140
Very, very wrong.

938
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:17,380
Maybe not.

939
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,020
Maybe everything is wrong.

940
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:32,540
At least there's no missing seems to me.

941
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:32,540


942
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:32,540


943
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:32,540


944
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:33,680
I mean the thing is we have to如果你 powder ton that piece every day the luck of math

945
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,440
And I takes it out just enough.

946
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:34,540
Throw him here as a״

947
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:34,540


948
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:34,540


949
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:34,540


950
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:35,640
This mountain..

951
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:35,640


952
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:35,640


953
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:35,640


954
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:35,700
A while ago.

955
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:39,820
Yeah.

956
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:42,440
I've forgotten for a while now we were told to play stones.

957
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:42,840
Did it meet though?

958
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,180
Well yeah.

959
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,200
Thank you.

960
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:31,000
Thank you.

961
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,900
Thank you.

962
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,900
Thank you.

963
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:40,220
Thank you.

964
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,720
Thank you.

965
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,060
Thank you.

966
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,220
Thank you.

967
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,200
Thank you.

968
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:10,640
Thank you.

969
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:11,920
Thank you.

970
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:13,100
Thank you.

971
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:14,120
Thank you.

972
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:15,340
Thank you.

973
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:16,860
Thank you.

974
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:19,460
Oh.

975
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:23,060
Damn, that hurts.

976
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:27,780
I know that's really slavery.

977
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,720
ESO Beach Party.

978
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:32,600
ESO Beach

979
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,020
Party.

980
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:38,440
Yeah, well, it's

981
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,460
like that time in China.

982
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:45,440
And each and every one Sunday, Yanny Bunny and Nett Funchichello is down with everything else he's done.

983
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:49,600
It's a first and annual beach party, Bunker John.

984
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:52,240
Yours truly, the rest of the grade.

985
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,140
I'll bring the beach balls if you bring the cornstarch.

986
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:57,880
I'll bring the...

987
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:02,160
I'll bring the Saturn boosters if you bring the ocean.

988
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,540
I'll bring the sodium nitride pellets.

989
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,940
I'll bring the Apollo space capsule if you bring the sand.

990
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:10,960
And I'll bring Crashback if I get old again and die.

991
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,340
Can you please loan me it?

992
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:19,500
I'll bring Lonesome Cowboy Dave if you'll just get out of my hair, shut up, and go die.

993
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,300
And I'll bring your hair back.

994
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,320
Time to get out of here.

995
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:26,540
One wave, one magic wand.

996
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:29,120
We gotta leave the Dave brand for another week.

997
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,000
Thank God.

998
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,560
But it'll be there.

999
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,820
Oh, I'm afraid it will.

1000
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:36,940
Pulsing like a diamond.

1001
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:40,660
You don't think it's not there.

1002
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,820
I heard that Dave died on your show, man.

1003
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,260
That guy is out there.

1004
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,900
That guy is totally out there.

1005
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:46,560
That guy is so...

1006
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,320
Man, where does he get that stuff?

1007
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,480
Where do you...

1008
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,480
Man, what is that dude on?

1009
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,880
Where do you find that thing?

1010
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,640
Yeah, where'd you find that Dave thing?

1011
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,580
How'd you get that all the way up there?

1012
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,800
How you gonna get that out of there?

1013
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:05,760
Yeah, well, I just can't believe you got the whole thing in.

1014
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:07,460
That's it.

1015
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:08,520
Oh, is that a foot?

1016
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,920
What's hanging out of the bottom?

1017
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:10,860
That's gross.

1018
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,880
Did you sit on somebody's whole body?

1019
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,580
Pull that Dave thing out.

1020
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:15,240
That's an animal.

1021
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:16,720
I thought it was a human foot.

1022
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:18,540
It's as big as a human foot.

1023
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:19,020
It's a vomit.

1024
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:20,840
That's not what that is.

1025
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,260
Oh, look, it's growing again.

1026
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,720
Yelly, yelly, yelly, yelly, yelly, yelly.

1027
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:27,660
Yelly, yelly, yelly.

1028
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,040
Yelly, yelly, yelly, yelly, yelly.

1029
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:34,520
Till next week.

1030
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:35,940
Keep your hat on tight.

1031
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:37,180
You're back to the wind in here.

1032
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:37,680
Sacking.

1033
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:38,540
Saddle there.

1034
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,500
There's always tomorrow for dreams to come true.

1035
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:42,980
Give me that sack.

1036
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,440
Believe in your dreams.

1037
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:47,820
Come what may.

1038
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:49,000
I know that's right.

1039
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,140
Come what may.

1040
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,840
There's always tomorrow for dreams to come true.

1041
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,540
Come what may.

1042
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:57,080
There's so much to do.

1043
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,420
We have no eyes.

1044
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:02,580
You'll see with our eyes.

1045
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:05,820
We have no good night.

1046
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,660
We all pretend.

1047
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:11,360
The rainbow has an end.

1048
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,760
We all pretend the rainbow has an end.

1049
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:17,920
And you'll be there, my friend, someday.

1050
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,340
I don't know.

1051
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:25,080
There's always tomorrow for dreams to come true.

1052
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:30,320
Tomorrow is not far away.

1053
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,160
Thanks, kid.

1054
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,640
It's been a wonderful time.

1055
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,200
Thanks.

1056
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,520
Thanks for pulling my chest.

1057
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,440
See you, Uncle Dave.

1058
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,840
See you next week.

1059
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:38,980
Thanks, Nick.

1060
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:40,640
Everybody wave bye-bye.

1061
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,560
Thanks for the chocolates.

1062
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:46,100
And hey, we'll see you all.

1063
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:46,920
Bye.

1064
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:48,660
Bye.

1065

Bye.

1080

Bye.

1081

Bye.

1082

Bye.

1094
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:20,480
Bah.

1095
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:37,920


1096
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:37,920

Here's our address.

1102
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:39,420
Got that pencil ready?

P.O. Box 807 Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

Friends.

1108
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:13,120
Like everything else that I've been through, it opened up my eyes.

1109
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,600
And now I'm one toe over the line, sweet Jesus.

1110
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,640
One toe over the line.

1111
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:22,200
Sitting down down in a railway station.

1112
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,260
One toe over the line.

1113
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,020
Waiting for the train to go home.

1114
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,380
Waiting for the train to go home.

1115
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,860
Waiting that the train is at the train of your time.

1116
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,680
Sitting down down in a railway station.

1117
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:35,760
One toe over the line.

1118
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:52,300
Waiting for the train to go home.

1119
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,560
One toe over the line.

00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:36,400

1123
