1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:11,700
I'm afraid I'm so sorry but I'm afraid your pretty music is over and done with

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:19,480
now dear friends. Oh did that hurt you as much as it hurt me? Well it's only going

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:25,400
to get worse and worse and worse but don't you love it?

4
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:42,960
Oh dear friends be ready for salvation. Are you ready? Hey what's going on here? The subgenius

5
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:51,880
hour of slack. Well it's another Sunday night and there you are sweeping out the lobby of

6
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:57,300
eternity on the subgenius hour of slack. Now when are you going to get a real job kid?

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,400
Oh.

8
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,180
Welcome to the end times boys and girls. We're going to shock off the house with your brain

9
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,860
and the world. Bob is getting down with you here tonight. Bob is getting down to help

10
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,000
your plight. Bob is coming here to ease your strife. Come on suckers let Bob into your

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,380
life.

12
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,200
Big fan Bob.

13
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,180
Do not call it a sin but yet it was a sin.

14
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:28,460
Oh.

15
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,880
He's a comrade.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,200
It's a sham. It's a facade.

17
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:38,220
In the heart of darkness a flower blossoms enriching the shadows with its promise of hope.

18
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:44,640
In the fields of light a viper coils and the radiant tranquility is lit safer by a sinister presence.

19
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:52,100
I know you'll find this hard to believe God honey but Hud and I converted this garage into an apartment for about five bucks.

20
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,940
Now that we've found you God sweetie no more bar hopping. This will be our little blue heaven.

21
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,980
A blue movie in black.

22
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,460
Black and white.

23
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,320
You shall know them by their fruits.

24
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,700
Do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles.

25
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,440
Even so every good fruit every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.

26
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,340
Good tree he said cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

27
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,380
Every tree that bringeth forth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.

28
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,080
Wherefore by their fruits you'll know them.

29
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:32,920
I love fire.

30
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,260
Chief if I was surrounded by six or eight of these things would I stand a chance with them?

31
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:46,100
Well there's no problem if you had a gun shoot them in the head that's a sure way to kill them.

32
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,260
If you don't get yourself a club or a torch beat them or burn them they go up pretty easy.

33
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,200
Are they slow moving chief?

34
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,420
Yeah they're dead they're all messed up.

35
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,360
Alarm Santa Fe parents met again with Alarms.

36
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,960
Elementary school officials last night to discuss the growing presence of Bob in the schools.

37
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,940
Bob the deity of the Dallas based church of the subgenius is a comic book character who communicates with aliens and worships money.

38
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:20,300
Parents and teachers complain that the Bob stickers and pamphlets which have turned up in school laboratories with increasing frequency encourage troublemakers and weird behavior.

39
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,280
It's not healthy for the children I'm convinced of this.

40
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,760
There has been a pamphlet going around a Bob pamphlet.

41
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,160
It's a pamphlet that I have looked at and it's the least well adjusted children really who pick up on it.

42
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:42,440
It tells them that if they are uncomfortable with their classmates it is because they are better than their classmates.

43
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,080
Can you imagine this? Better. Not smarter mind you but better.

44
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:52,460
Wow look at her tip. They are enormous. How can they?

45
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,600
Hello? Hello?

46
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,320
Oh...

47
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,380
Sir, I'm the subgenius.

48
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,740
If you plan to get saved, you'd better do it now.

49
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:21,600
There will be a day not in the too far distant future in which antichrist will be revealed and the mark of the beast will be introduced.

50
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,920
Thanks for watching.

51
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,720
Subscribe for more.

52
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:25,800


53
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,280
Oh, no, I mean really different.

54
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,520
Little realized even by leading scientists, there are really two races, actually two distinct

55
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,680
species of so-called human beings.

56
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,360
If you gaze upon any given street, normally you might never suspect that only some of

57
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,340
these people are true humans.

58
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,420
Outside appearances offer no clue that among this ordinary looking crowd on an ordinary

59
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:23,260
day, a certain number of these people are actually human beings.

60
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,640
They are actually subgeniuses.

61
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:31,080
We would have to creep inside their heads to know whether this person or that carries

62
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,200
the rare subgenius gene.

63
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:42,240
But once inside those heads, we would discover a vast new universe, a new dimension, coexisting

64
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,320
not always in harmony alongside the mundane workaday world of the common human.

65
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,900
Another world that until now has been forced into hiding.

66
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,240
Now at this very moment, we are in the middle of a world that is not just a world of human

67
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,240


68
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,240


69
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,320
beings.

70
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,320
And in this very moment, the veils of secrecy can be torn aside.

71
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:03,380
We, the persecuted, may now dare to raise our heads high and declare, behold us, for

72
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,780
we are the subgeniuses.

73
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,640
.

74
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:39,100
Like, and they laugh, you know, and they laugh harder, and they're behind you, and they're kicking me in the stomachs, and it's like I'm...

75
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,520
Bob.

76
00:06:46,560 --> 00:07:02,800
From reading some of your literature, which you so helpfully brought up, you know, a wheelbarrow full this evening into the studio, by the church, by your belief, slack is something that when you join the church, you can do anything you want because it's within your slack.

77
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,740
Well, when you...

78
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:12,140
And if anybody inhibits you, they are hampering your religion and violating your constitutional rights.

79
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,260
That's exactly right.

80
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:13,760
That's right.

81
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,460
We're hoping somebody will take this to court.

82
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,640
Sooner or later for us.

83
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,500
Mockery of everything that's decent and wholesome.

84
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:35,980
And I challenge you to point out national talk shows that do not belittle sexual fidelity, purity, that they do not belittle the marriage union and the family lifestyle, that they don't literally flaunt illicit lifestyles.

85
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,640
I mean, I challenge you to show me a talk show that doesn't make light of God.

86
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,220
The Subgenius Foundation, the Reverend Ivan Stang and Dr.

87
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,200
Philo Drummond.

88
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,880
And they are, as we mentioned before, the dual heads of the Subgenius Foundation.

89
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,980
Make fun of godly morals.

90
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,540
Agreed.

91
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,480
They laugh at us.

92
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,980
They make a mockery of us.

93
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,240
Now, we don't have to watch it.

94
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:57,920
We can turn it off.

95
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,020
Don't destroy everything now because of a hideous face and grotesque body that aren't yours.

96
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,320
Still, you can't forget that you're alone, an outsider.

97
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:15,260
How can they, we, differ so much from the humans whose nonsensical laws and customs?

98
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,700
We have been forced to obey.

99
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,000
Why have so many of us been kept in ignorance of our true heritage?

100
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,240
A heritage that dates back farther than man is thought to have existed.

101
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,060
For in the days of Atlantis, we helped to design the humans.

102
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,900
Certainly, in retrospect, this now seems to have been our greatest mistake.

103
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,500
And that's just the way things are.

104
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,100
The church is not at home in the world.

105
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,100
No, no, don't touch me.

106
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,500
Get that filthy animal out of here!

107
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:44,580
Out!

108
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,060
Out!

109
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:45,540
Out!

110
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:45,820
Out!

111
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,000
Are you crazy?

112
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,880
Letting that animal in the house!

113
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,980
These things are his comfort.

114
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,720
Just for comparison, let's go native.

115
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,680
Back to the animal instinct.

116
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:02,200
There, in the lesser civilized part of the world, it's the male who adorns himself with

117
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,100
a fancy object such as paints, frills, and masks.

118
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,520
The true instinct.

119
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,580
The animal instinct.

120
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,280
Bird and animal life.

121
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,800
Is it not so that it's the male who is the fancy one?

122
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,120
Could it be that the male was meant to attract the attention of the female?

123
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,600
What's so wrong about that?

124
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:27,680
Oh, snips and snails and puppy dog tails.

125
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,360
He cried all day long.

126
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,800
You don't have to take care of him.

127
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,120
Please.

128
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,600
I take care of him.

129
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,340
If you made more money, if you made a decent living, he should have his own room.

130
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,660
He should have a nurse.

131
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,140
We should have a maid.

132
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,620
Said there's so much depression.

133
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,640
Can't keep track of it no more.

134
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,640
Sons becoming husbands, different mothers.

135
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,880
Old men turning young daughters into whores.

136
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,740
It's the human condition.

137
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,960
It's things falling apart.

138
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,840
It's fat ladies in double knit jumpsuits beating their kids in Kroger's.

139
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,600
He thinks it is natural.

140
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,840
Perhaps we should pity them, but face it, most people are venal jerks.

141
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:23,520
Half-witted cattle racing each other to be first to the slaughterhouse and stampeding you along with them.

142
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,940
Breaks my heart.

143
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,980
It breaks my heart.

144
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,960
And it's happening.

145
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:27,960
It is happening.

146
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,680
It's a sick world.

147
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,400
It's more than that.

148
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,540
It's a sinful world.

149
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,040
We have turned our back on God.

150
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,120
Janet takes her clothes off in succession.

151
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,560
While her husband rides a bumper in the president's procession.

152
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,180
Sees him on the screen as she wakes up from giving head.

153
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,360
Well, has had enough of that.

154
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,320
Her lover throws her on the bed.

155
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,480
To her future, she's alive and so is his death.

156
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,800
Now, this is a crooked and perverse nation.

157
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,440
We have millions and multiplied millions of crooked politicians.

158
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,360
God put a death penalty upon adultery.

159
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:19,020
When we see millions and multiplied millions of people spending hours and hours before the television.

160
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,800
Learn how to crack safes, rob banks, kill policemen and get divorces and break up homes.

161
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,320
All these soap operas, hour after hour, warps people's minds.

162
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,420
Pull ahead. All decks condition red.

163
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,840
Wednesday is ladies night.

164
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,380
Underscored ladies admitted free.

165
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,100
Their drinks, 25 cents and 50 cents.

166
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:41,180
A shy little girl leaving all that she knew behind her.

167
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,960
That shows that they're stupid.

168
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,500
That shows they got warped minds.

169
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,260
That's what people's minds runs on.

170
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,540
And that the morals are breaking down.

171
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,480
And that's what it did in the Roman Empire right before the Roman Empire fell.

172
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,640
Their morals broken down.

173
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,420
Spats on your shoulder.

174
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,380
Spats on your back and on your hand.

175
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,020
Spats on your shoulder.

176
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,260
Straps on your back and on your hand.

177
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,340
So it's pissing your side.

178
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,860
Blood and water flowing through the land.

179
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,400
Randy's body.

180
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,820
A cage for an animal.

181
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,620
A cage for an animal.

182
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,420
Golly, I'm so impressed.

183
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,200
Yeah, me too, honey.

184
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,780
Ah, yes, dear friends.

185
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,760
Well, we've got a short talk tonight.

186
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,760
Short talk about an ugly, ugly subject.

187
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,400
Yeah.

188
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,900
I was asked to write an introduction to a book.

189
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,160
Actually, a comic book type book.

190
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,440
Graphic novel, they say these days.

191
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:17,280
This one is called, it's probably come out in about two months, called, get this, Homo Patrol.

192
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,140
Yes, Homo Patrol.

193
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,320
It's actually a real good comic book.

194
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,720
It's not really about homosexuality, but homophobia.

195
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:34,900
But in the course of having to do that introduction,

196
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,360
well, I ran out of time to write anything else for this show.

197
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,540
So I might as well just read a little bit of that.

198
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,960
And you know what I say, friends?

199
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:59,660
Homophobia, quote unquote, has of late become rather an overused, dirty word among some of you groovy sophisticates.

200
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,020
It's like the ultimate put down.

201
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:08,960
And you know, you don't even have to harbor an actual fear of gayness to be accused of homophobia either.

202
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:19,580
Because some people will brand you a homophobic caveman if you're anything less than a militant supporter of not just gay rights,

203
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,320
but the whole gay lifestyle itself.

204
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,400
You know, whatever that is.

205
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,240
So, call me homophobic.

206
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,720
But I don't consider homosexuality normal, dear friends.

207
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,540
This is me, Ivan Stang speaking, not the station itself.

208
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,340
The station itself probably does.

209
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,760
These opinions are entirely my own.

210
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:53,520
I don't consider homosexuality normal, nay, nor do I consider evangelical fundamentalist Christianity normal.

211
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,860
For that matter, I don't even consider the possession of good old fashioned common sense normal.

212
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:04,360
I don't consider homosexuality natural either, but then neither is skydiving.

213
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:13,160
I do lots of unnatural things myself, such as occasionally urinating in a toilet when the backyard would suffice,

214
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:23,720
or, say, wearing clothes in the summertime while all the other animals on my block, except for the stupid human minority, are sensibly stark naked.

215
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,280
So, I mean, in fact, you know, I'm going to come out of the closet, friends.

216
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,100
I'm coming out of the closet.

217
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,080
I'm going to admit it.

218
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:45,060
I'm so perverted that I'm strictly into, as Saint Russ Meyer put it, good old straight all-American bobbing.

219
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,900
And just with one girl at a time, actually, and it's just been her for 16 years.

220
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:57,620
And, well, now, maybe, maybe, now and then, if I'm in the mood, I might step out with a certain species of squid.

221
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,340
But that's it, baby.

222
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,780
I mean, as the old joke says, well, at least it was a female squid.

223
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,720
Nothing queer about old Stang.

224
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:16,980
And for that matter, you know, really, I could no more stomach sticking my toxic Avenger into a woman's dump chute, much less than a man's.

225
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,820
Not when there's perfectly serviceable other orifices available anyway.

226
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:27,380
Any more than I can guess why anyone would want to dictate where anyone else should stick theirs.

227
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,420
That's how weirdly conservative I am.

228
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:38,960
But, but, and as we say in radio, it's a big but, homosexuality has always been here and it always will be.

229
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:47,800
And probably a tenth of all the male humans have been gay since Lucy of the Olduvai Gorge.

230
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,060
And yet the world's still here, so you can't exactly call it a crime against nature.

231
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,500
Oil spills, yeah, you can call those a crime against nature.

232
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,620
Is homosexuality a biblical abomination?

233
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,100
Sure.

234
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:11,440
If you think the Bible's anything more than a best-selling fairy tale, or at the very best, disinformation from mischievous space aliens.

235
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:17,420
You know, if AIDS is God's judgment against homosexuals, then what do you call war?

236
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,620
God's judgment against children, patriots, and the landscape?

237
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:22,760
Eh?

238
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,480
Eh, it may be a crime in the eyes of the Lord.

239
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,880
It may be a law, but so are most of our beloved heterosexual acts.

240
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,920
Or is it just plain...

241
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,020
Sissy?

242
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:40,560
Well, as Lenny Bruce, the great Saint Lenny Bruce said, put a guy in jail and he'll stuff anything.

243
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,260
Mud!

244
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:50,140
Bob, his hand now covered with germs, picked up from that doorknob, transfers them to a book.

245
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,920
Golly, I'm so impressed.

246
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,480
Bob Ginny.

247
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,260
Does that make her really popular?

248
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,540
Do the boys and girls like her?

249
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,020
Is she welcome to join this group?

250
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,900
This is fun, isn't it?

251
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,300
Yeah.

252
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,940
You sure you like to do things like this?

253
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,420
Sure.

254
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,860
My face.

255
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,560
My face.

256
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,800
War has its ultimate, and I'm that.

257
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,740
Here they're, here they're, going to destroy us.

258
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,960
We'll kill everyone, we've got to stop them!

259
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,260
Easy, Doug, easy.

260
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,460
I'm not going to let you kill me.

261
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:26,460


262
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:26,460


263
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:26,460


264
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:26,460


265
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:26,460


266
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:26,460


267
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:26,460


268
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:26,460


269
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:26,460


270
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,940
Pleasant, unemotional conversation helps digestion.

271
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,480
Pleasant, unemotional conversation helps digestion.

272
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,200
Pleasant, unemotional conversation helps digestion.

273
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,120
I'm so impressed.

274
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,200
But that's not my Bob.

275
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,500
But that's not my Bob.

276
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,860
But that's not my Bob.

277
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,960
War has its ultimate, and I'm that.

278
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,440
We've got to stop them.

279
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,420
They stay zipped up, so to speak, but...

280
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,460
There's letting it all hang out, and then there's public indecency.

281
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,860
Oh, and how would you define indecency, dear sister?

282
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,300
Would you care to define some right now?

283
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,020
Oh, yes, dear friends.

284
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,500
Well, this is a family show, so...

285
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,140
We better stop.

286
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,760
Or else educate them.

287
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,340
Is your family listening?

288
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,300
That's the most important part.

289
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,120
Actually, we've got a copy, we've got copies here tonight

290
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,420
of both the, uh, the comma books.

291
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:26,980
The Kama Sutra.

292
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,260
Oh, yes, the Kama Sutra.

293
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,480
I remember reading it to the goat woman after the state fair.

294
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,880
It worked wonders.

295
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,840
Um, but, you know, Bob called sex the divine battle,

296
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,360
but is there an unbridgeable, undestroyable barrier

297
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,620
between men and women that will keep them forever warring

298
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,600
against each other?

299
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:48,960
Eh?

300
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,640
I mean, uh, you know, we believe that the...

301
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,420
Although the war between the states like this, uh, is a war,

302
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,480
lasted only a few years,

303
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,240
the war between men and women is an ongoing process

304
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,580
that shall never end.

305
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,460
But, friends, you better, you better praise Bob for that.

306
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,780
So don't succumb to humanists' thinking.

307
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,020
Get out there and fight to the death.

308
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,080
The, the heavy combat of love, dear friends.

309
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,180
Huh.

310
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,040
Well, love doesn't always enter into it.

311
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,600
Remember that.

312
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,180
It takes a freak.

313
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,120
They said last time.

314
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,180
That's what the sign around their neck said.

315
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,220
White girls, they're pretty funny.

316
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,500
Sometimes they drive you mad.

317
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,700
Black girls just want to give...

318
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,320
Bob?

319
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,240
...tall nines.

320
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,160
Just don't have that much chance.

321
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:40,780
Oh, yeah.

322
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,300
Help me with some of this.

323
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,560
Chinese girls are so gentle.

324
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,280
A little sexy, too.

325
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,680
You never know how powerful

326
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,400
the feeling inside those silky sleeves.

327
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,700
But, this pacing Sh babies

328
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,360
Ware's

329
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:06,360


330
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,220
All, but it's just metosis Jetzt nur ihr

331
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:14,760
welt dann erreicht und sei

332
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:21,320
Call the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack, dear friends.

333
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:26,000
Why don't you just reach for that phone and whoop it out?

334
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,300
Call 823-7494.

335
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:36,640
If you have any questions as to why we're broadcasting this rather, you know, controversial, possibly,

336
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:48,200
sexually, sexually oriented show, if that's really what it is.

337
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,820
How is this part of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate?

338
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,380
Me too.

339
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,600
Our television programs laugh at homosexuality.

340
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,420
Hey, they laugh at immorality.

341
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,440
They laugh at ungodliness.

342
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,480
They make a mockery of the holy word of God.

343
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,540
And God says, would you change my truth into a lie?

344
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,660
I'll give you up to vile affections.

345
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:10,980
Yes.

346
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,300
Your mind is no longer your own.

347
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,300
I have no mind.

348
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,560
I have no mind.

349
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,680
My mind is not my mind.

350
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:28,420
Cast off the imperial brains of normalcy.

351
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,880
Because you want to.

352
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,100
I do what I do because I'm so busy.

353
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,400
You do what you do because you want to.

354
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:40,800
I do what I do because Bob told me to.

355
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,200
You do what you do because you want to.

356
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,580
I do what I do because Bob told me to.

357
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:58,740
I do what I do because Bob told me to.

358
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,180
No, I don't believe the charges of brainwashing.

359
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,120
I do what I do because Bob told me to.

360
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,080
You do what you do because you want to.

361
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,720
But we don't use such techniques as brainwashing.

362
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,720
Bob told me to.

363
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,120


364
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,640
You do what you do because you want to.

365
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,280
Brain surgery in order to assure loyalty.

366
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,200
Nay.

367
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,140
Nay.

368
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,260
I must not be working.

369
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,480
I must, yet I cannot.

370
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,700
I must have slack.

371
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:34,220
And slack at this moment is to talk to the great Reverend Saint Dr.

372
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,140
Cleve Duncan.

373
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:36,620
Cleve Duncan.

374
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:36,620


375
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:36,620


376
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:36,620


377
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:44,160
a mean son of a bitch a crib fisherman if ever there was one yeah you heard me right a crib

379
00:23:52,640 --> 00:24:00,680
adam cleave farm over 80 skulls out there on the 840 he was killing them and farming them down

380
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:06,860
spreading that he'd squirt that seed all over the damn pasture i don't know how he did it

381
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:12,740
he must have a damn seed bag the size of a watermelon or something he was just

382
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:19,920
well you know he'd break for a damn beer every now and then suck down one of them damn

383
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:27,140
malt things shaking that damn hair he is all over the place and he'd go back to farming them skulls

384
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,600
he'd pull his pants down you see then he'd

385
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:36,420
he'd uh he'd jump down into one of them furrows they'd plow this field first he never ran the

386
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:43,640
plow somebody else did he'd jump down into this furrow and then he'd start this the dirt you know

387
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,620
just a row of dirt and it'd be stretching out in front of him oh maybe like uh 300 yards you know

388
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:55,420
big old big old uh about an acre field he'd be humping on it and just you know he'd be getting

389
00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:00,560
all muddy and filthy man you'd see them damn first and he'd be scooting along you know it

390
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:00,660

391
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:00,660


392
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:05,880
take him only about like uh oh five minutes to get all the way down in one of them first he'd be

393
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,200
getting the end of that fur he'd drink him a damn beer and he'd get back on that other fur next to

394
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,380
it going the other way back the same way he'd behind him you'd see this fur would be filled

395
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:21,300
up with the damn seed and then out of that they'd grow the children of the hydra's teeth you know

396
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:25,240
and then they'd be skull farmers come popping up their damn little hats on and

397
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:30,380
their piece of straw hanging off their grinning teeth yeah how about that

398
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,840
he'll cleave he was a skull farmer my friends i don't care i don't care what you say

399
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:42,060
uh you can call i know we had people been calling in saying oh sir cleave was never a skull farmer

400
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:46,640
i knew cleave brother cleve duncan he was not a skull farmer nor a crib fisherman

401
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:51,860
but uh let me just say you maybe you didn't go to the same parties with old cleave that i did

402
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,720
and i should know because i'm a preacher and preachers know more than normal people

403
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,600
except for maybe doctors

404
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:08,160
i'm a doctor too and my pappy is a lawyer will is there anything we need to tell the people any

405
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:14,100
phone calls of great importance that have come here nothing nothing nothing good

406
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:21,320
where you don't want to be buried uh yeah oh i i won't forget to tell them where i don't want to

407
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:27,020
be buried but i'm gonna do that down at the end i think because right now well there's something we

408
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,500
absolutely have to do wait a minute get those

409
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,480
bees out of here

410
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:41,440
oh there's three of you waiting to talk to willa dobbs he's pounding on the phones with a sledgehammer

411
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,780
trying to get it going you can hear it in the background the screams of the tiny collars

412
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:51,580
trying to make it out of the collar hole but no the gravity sucks them back in and there's nothing

413
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:57,480
nothing we can do about it except to give you our address for where to write for information

414
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,640
about the church of the spirit

415
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,480
subgenius at the end of the broadcast.

416
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,060
Thank you.

417
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,640
Ah, yes, the harvest.

418
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,620
And when such a man hath a bout with a woman,

419
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,000
he does not do his business with vigor

420
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,820
and in a manner to give her enjoyment.

421
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,980
He lays himself down upon her without previous toying.

422
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,420
He does not kiss her nor twine himself around her.

423
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,680
He does not bite her nor suck her lips nor tickle her.

424
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,400
That beast.

425
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,600
And these are the pinks, my friends.

426
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,080
This is the pink style of physical love.

427
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,780
And I don't mean pink like, you know, in Penthouse.

428
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,560
No.

429
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,260
Hustler.

430
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,040
I'm talking about pink, not like a baby's shiny behind, dear friends,

431
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:47,400
but an evil, ooh, an evil kind of pinkness.

432
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,700
The pinkness of a McDonald's advertisement.

433
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,820
The pinkness of that person driving the Porsche that you know doesn't deserve it.

434
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:56,620
Amen.

435
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,260
And a woman.

436
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,420
And a child.

437
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,020
Oh, bless the little children.

438
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,520
They do, don't they?

439
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,240
That's another good thing about families.

440
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:10,060
Yeah, well, but you know, when you have kids, then they get your slack.

441
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,460
Boy, they sure do.

442
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,140
Especially when they wander into the bedroom at those inopportune times.

443
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,760
Or when they find your electrical devices.

444
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,900
Or when they find your Japanese manuals upon you.

445
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,540
Well, I bet you and I have many funny little tips.

446
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,460
We could tell.

447
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,240
I could tell.

448
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,340
Bokfy embarrassing stories.

449
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,100
Yes.

450
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,560
From a woman who's lived better electrically, I'd rather not share any of them on the air.

451
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,120
Ooh, praise Bob.

452
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,560
Yes, the solo fight of love.

453
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,420
But, as she said the other night...

454
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,020
Oh!

455
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,420
Hello, darling.

456
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,540
Hello, darling.

457
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,660
Hello, darling.

458
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,780
Hello, darling.

459
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,980
Hello, darling.

460
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,100
Hello, darling.

461
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,000
Hello, darling.

462
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,920
Let me feel your liver.

463
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:52,940
Let me feel your liver.

464
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,040
Let me feel your liver.

465
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:54,820
Let me feel your liver.

466
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,320
Let me feel your liver.

467
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,380
Let me feel your liver.

468
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:56,620


469
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,080
Let me feel your liver.

470
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,320
Let me feel your liver.

471
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:57,380


472
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,500
I'm searching for a dream out of your love.

473
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,880
I'm searching for a dream out of your love.

474
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,100
I'm searching here and there to be on your underwear.

475
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,200
I'm searching for a dream out of your love.

476
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:19,360
As the miracle of reproduction begins, our lone hero is still a mere tube of psychoplasm.

477
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:25,880
But soon, a frenzy of chemical activity called the amphetophase seizes the microbe,

478
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:31,180
and by the mysterious process called osmiotic blooming, it starts to clot.

479
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:41,820
It grows a rudimentary megastamen and antherite,

480
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:47,960
and swiftly matures into the spore of sex A, the gameteoroid.

481
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,700
Unscientifically, it might be called the male.

482
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:05,800
He discovers his own nasophallosian tube and performs hermaphroditic autofusion

483
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,860
until he spills the secretion of preposterous.

484
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:25,320
This triggers the morphase to begin, and up sprouts sex B, the so-called female,

485
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,100
or nymph load.

486
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:45,700
Her thorax produces the Jovian nods, and she even has a feeble nucleic eyeball,

487
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,240
nearly as powerful as that of the male.

488
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,560
A surprisingly complex courting ritual is initiated.

489
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,860
She produces special corticosteroids, and she's able to do this with her own hands.

490
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,460
She uses chemical chemicals called mojo bodies, which excite her partner.

491
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:06,380
She places her stigmat on his cloacal apparatus and performs parthenodulation.

492
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,340
He achieves cytospasm and germiates.

493
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:19,080
And in nature's timeless tragedy, the helpless male falls victim to the eternal whys of the female,

494
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,920
leaving naught but a pool of albuminal spum.

495
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:31,300
Using her Ovoiduct as an aural groove, she saps every last trace of her former lover,

496
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,140
as the layman would call him.

497
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,680
Spermatogenocide is committed, and it's almost as if she's smiling.

498
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,040
Now fertilized, she was dropped in the urethra.

499
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,080
She's so hot, she's so hot, so hot, so hot.

500
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,900
She's so hot, she's so hot, so hot, so hot.

501
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,140
You talk about homosexuals come out of the closet.

502
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,520
Did you ever dream the day would come in American history

503
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,700
when grown men would stand up and possess to be making physical love to each other

504
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,240
on national television and flex their muscles

505
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,580
and say, don't tell me that I'm a sissy, I'm a he-man,

506
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,200
but I'm in love with that man right there, and I'm married.

507
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,740
I've been reading about where a lot of churches,

508
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:25,240
even in Pentecost, have accepted homosexuality.

509
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,940
Ain't that the truth?

510
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,700
And claiming to have the Holy Ghost.

511
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,500
Well, that's deception.

512
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,220
Ain't a bigger abomination in the world

513
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:36,860
than women wearing men's clothes and men wearing women's clothes

514
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,260
and people being perverts.

515
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,780
That's two of the greatest sins in the world

516
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:44,920
is idolatry, witchcraft, homosexuality,

517
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:51,060
and men and women wearing the clothes of the opposite sex.

518
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,840
It's abomination.

519
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,460
And whosoever do it is abomination.

520
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,180
And there's more people today, their minds are perverted,

521
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,880
their life is perverted, and they've been given over to a reprobate mind.

522
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,100
So many people today, even people that aren't homosexual,

523
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,700
their minds are perverted.

524
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:13,140
It's filled with filth, and it's filled with all the ungodliness and wickedness

525
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,520
that comes from the pit of hell.

526
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:17,940
And you see it on television, you see it in the movie houses,

527
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,440
and you see it on the market stands.

528
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,800
Hey, and how about pornography?

529
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,280
Shucks, all you have to do is look around you.

530
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,020
Female body parts are available just about anywhere.

531
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,960
Or pick up some picture books with a free orifice included.

532
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,820
Miracles of Engineering, yours for the plucking.

533
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,440
If you don't mind the smell of vinyl.

534
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:38,940
Shucks!

535
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,620
Now, Mama's on the bottom.

536
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,760
And Papa's on the top.

537
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,300
Baby's in the crib a-pa callin' poor little her pop shop.

538
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,640
Hey Bubba rebob, hey Bubba rebob

539
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,920
Hey Bubba rebob, hey Bubba rebob

540
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,620
Yes, Ma Baaby! No.

541
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,220
Now sea is sea and land is land.

542
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,740
Can't get my boogie I can get it by hand shop.

543
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,040
Hey, Bubba rebob, hey Bubba rebob

544
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,260
Hey, Bubba rebob, hey, Bubba rebob

545
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,520
Hey, Bubba rebob, hey Bubba rebob

546
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,920
yes, Ma Baaby, no.

547
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,300
Now a boogie's in the kitchen,

548
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,380
and a boogie's in the hall.

549
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:24,080
Boogied in my hand, then I slung it on the wall, shoutin',

550
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,140
Hey, Baba Rebob! Hey, Baba Rebob!

551
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:32,180
Yes, my baby knows.

552
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,700
Now a nickel for some butter, nickel for some lard,

553
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,100
Put it on my boogie till my boogie got hard chopped.

554
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:41,540
Hey, Baba Rebob! Hey, Baba Rebob!

555
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:46,280
Hey, Baba Rebob! Yes, my baby knows.

556
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,700
Says the little red rooster to the big red hen,

557
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,240
And ruffle up your feathers, let's hop, flip it in, chop

558
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,400
Hey, Bob-a-ree-bob

559
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,480
Yes, my baby knows

560
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,940
Out in the crap earth, sitting so bold

561
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,460
Gonna get me some of the old, not whole, chop

562
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,600
Hey, Bob-a-ree-bob

563
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,620
Yes, my baby knows

564
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,060
Out in the crap earth, sitting on the lot

565
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,580
The green flies are buzzing and I'm getting damn hot, chop

566
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,780
Hey, Bob-a-ree-bob

567
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:28,820
Yes, my baby knows

568
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,320
Now roses are red, ready for plucking

569
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,520
I got a gal, I know you ain't

570
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:34,740
Chop

571
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,920
Hey, Bob-a-ree-bob

572
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,760
Yes, my baby knows

573
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,160
Now belly to belly and skin to skin

574
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,980
Got two little things working out

575
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,820
Keep countin' the inch, chop

576
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,920
Hey, Bob-a-ree-bob

577
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,940
Yes, my baby knows

578
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,220
Hey, Bob-a-ree-bob

579
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:56,900
Yes, my baby knows

580
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,360
Now my papa is a nun, my mama is a slut

581
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,780
Second brother's got my sister knocked up, chop

582
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,040
Hey, Bob-a-ree-bob

583
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,040
Yes, my baby knows

584
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,020
Now the cattle's in the pasture and the hog's in the corn

585
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,500
Granny's in the crapper blowing grandpa's horn, chop

586
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,520
Hey, Bobbery Bob.

587
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,680
Hey, Bobbery Bob.

588
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,900
Hey, Bobbery Bob.

589
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,660
Yes, my baby knows.

590
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:31,220
Got a brand new Chevy with a tank full of gas, a mouth full of tea, and a hand full of ass.

591
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,580
Hey, Bobbery Bob.

592
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,800
Hey, Bobbery Bob.

593
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,920
Hey, Bobbery Bob.

594
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,680
Yes, my baby knows.

595
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,840
Oh, yes.

596
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,820
Hey, Bobbery Bob.

597
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:50,300
And friends, I just thought I'd break in and explain what you've been listening to tonight.

598
00:36:52,320 --> 00:37:01,140
Partly, about half of the pieces, little pieces I've been playing, come off of the old time, the old sad stuff,

599
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:10,720
the old subgenius media barrage tape number two, Sex, Sickness, and Slack, I think we ended up calling it.

600
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,200
I don't delve into our old tapes.

601
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,120
All that often because there's so much new stuff coming in.

602
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,260
And some of you listeners may already have some of this.

603
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:30,060
But I imagine there's at least a dozen of those and probably a dozen others just plain listening now.

604
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:40,040
So, interspersed with that, other pieces coming in from Reverend Nancy Regalia and what else have I been playing?

605
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:43,520
God, I didn't even keep track.

606
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,180
It's all those tiny tapes.

607
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,640
Tiny little cuts, man.

608
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,740
The computer doesn't tell me nothing anymore.

609
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,360
We're the sickest people I know.

610
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:58,660
Now, pull your wallet out of your pants and pray, Bob, pray, Bob.

611
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,540
The feminist dupes of the conspiracy charge that not enough members are women.

612
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,500
Bob would agree to that.

613
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:09,260
Indeed, he would say, there will never be enough women.

614
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,280
But at least the ones we have are all women.

615
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,920
And Bob?

616
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,980
Bob is all man.

617
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,740
The James Bond of Zen masters.

618
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,620
The most dashing religious leader of his time.

619
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,340
You mean to say that Bob has actually had one of those horrible diseases?

620
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,240
That isn't true, doctor.

621
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,240
Is that true, Bob?

622
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,260
Just a minute, Sally.

623
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,660
One scandal at a time.

624
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,480
Yes, Bob Dobbs is a sex god.

625
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,460
Come on,千-joon's the sex god.

626
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:47,680
I'm justوي.

627
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:50,980
Hold on.

628
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,060
I killed my

629
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:51,700
ING jonz, honey.

630
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,000
All right, fun.

631
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,740
Let's delve into Vant-s viktor.

632
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,240
Being a pacifist and love, what's appropriate in death?

633
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:00,720
This lady is a lady that wipes out 마드,

634
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,400
and lately has lost the ability to find the end in Christ.

635
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,160
And she says that's probably what ma's takes the most time out of this family.

636
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,220
That doesn't help her.

637
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:07,140
Maybe it's cost yani she's heavily in prison,

638
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,540
if she doesn't inserted at the army and lives alone.

639
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,060
At least we have enough people to talk about.

640
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,720
I mean it's too bad.

641
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:13,720


642
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:13,720


643
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,180
Hope thar have all achieved success at home.

644
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:27,320
The sad weekly self-denial preached by the New Age movement is pure conspiracy pablum.

645
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:33,660
The true son or daughter of Bob knows that our universe is no laid-back, home-chanting cosmos,

646
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:40,620
but an active, tumultuous, squirting universe bent on rampant reproduction and easy grins.

647
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:47,300
The false cults may try to teach personal transformation, psychic development, human potential.

648
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:55,360
But Bob goes straight for the glands and seeks to amplify the self to bloat the abnormality potential of his pupils.

649
00:39:56,100 --> 00:40:01,020
Only through excess can one contact the lower self where the real decisions are made.

650
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,680
Don't just eat a hamburger, eat the hell out of it.

651
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,020
Oh, what the hell was that?

652
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,600
Take your queen heart out of it.

653
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:13,420
And hand in hand exploring.

654
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,960
Walk on God's own grassy floors.

655
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,040
I vow you'll both adore it.

656
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:25,280
No matter just what you have in mind.

657
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,740
It's bound to be better.

658
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,560
You will find.

659
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:34,380
If you try it.

660
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,520
I'll die.

661
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:38,720
Joy.

662
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:41,600
I'll die.

663
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,540
I'll die.

664
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,040
I'll die.

665
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,780
Quiet down, you pipe-down!

666
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,600
It doesn't look as if there's anybody else there, Doctor.

667
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,360
The last seems to have taken care of itself.

668
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,680
I'm being as quiet as I can!

669
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,380
Yes, you're so quiet.

670
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,300
What's that?

671
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,740
It looks like an overload.

672
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,440
A nine-pound spider!

673
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,220
Get that thing away from me!

674
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,700
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

675
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:10,240
It looks like the three boys on the show might have reached the top.

676
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:10,600
It's a nine-pound spider!

677
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:10,960
Lady.

678
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:11,780
Other zone.

679
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:17,380
According to the widely accepted theory, about fifteen billion years ago, a titanic explosion

680
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,460
called the Big Bang spawned the entire universe.

681
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:27,320
In the first second after the explosion, mysterious entities called X-particles decayed into quarks,

682
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:31,980
the building blocks of protons, neutrons, and nucleons.

683
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:37,420
At the end of the first second, the blasts gilded other subatomic particles such as electrons

684
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,380
and neutrinos.

685
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,580
How come nobody's interrupting me?

686
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,040
I'm doing this boring stuff.

687
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,660
Then the protons and neutrons merged into a comic book.

688
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,760
Just like the old show.

689
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:53,120
Is that how come when I see a girl in the springtime, a good-looking girl, I sort of

690
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:53,640
get horny?

691
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:54,560
Uh-oh.

692
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,700
Yo, bring on the baby.

693
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,340
Bring on the girl.

694
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,080
Bring him on.

695
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:57,400
Bring him on.

696
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:57,920
Bring him on the baby.

697
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,560
Come on.

698
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:58,780
Come on.

699
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,000
Come on.

700
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,240
Come on.

701
00:41:59,240 --> 00:41:59,520
Bring on the girl.

702
00:41:59,520 --> 00:41:59,980
Take it off.

703
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,880
Take it off.

704
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:01,700
Take it off.

705
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,820
Well, just put it back on.

706
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,240
Is this supposed to be some kind of takeoff?

707
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,540
Is this supposed to be funny?

708
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,140
Go ahead and take it off again.

709
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,000
No, it's one thought.

710
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,820
Put it back on.

711
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,560
No, it's one thought.

712
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,620
This is all just a joke, right?

713
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,140
I mean, you guys don't really mean it.

714
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,760
Is this like part of the satire?

715
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,960
I mean, is this part of the joke for three guys to talk at the same time and it doesn't

716
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,500
make any sense?

717
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,060
Is that...

718
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,700
I don't get it.

719
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,940
You get up on stage and launch a Covino here.

720
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,340
I don't understand that.

721
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,280
I'm not sure.

722
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,100
I don't understand what you're trying to say.

723
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,920
But it's approved by the blue girlfriend.

724
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,180
Oh, come on.

725
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:31,200
I'll let you know.

726
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,800
And at the 17 committee hearing, it's been disapproved by a community...

727
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,020
Come on.

728
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:36,880
Are we still on the air?

729
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,340
Yeah.

730
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:39,760
Oh.

731
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,200
Oh.

732
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:40,380
Oh.

733
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:40,540
Oh.

734
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:40,540


735
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:40,540


736
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:40,540


737
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:40,540


738
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:47,180
Yeah, we're still on the air, friends, and you can invade our airspace, not here at the

739
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:54,380
station, but at the subgenius headquarters building, by writing to the post office box

740
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,700
number I'm about to give you.

741
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:06,480
Dear friends, write Bob for free information at P.O.

742
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,300
Box 14030.

743
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,220
Okay.

744
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,100
Box 140306.

745
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,580
I'll say that number again.

746
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:19,560
Post office box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

747
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:29,380
75214.

748
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,000
Yes, go ahead.

749
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,460
Write us.

750
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:39,280
Just say, Bob, I'd like to know what the heck you're talking about.

751
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,520
What about this church of yours, Bob?

752
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:50,740
Are you really a holy man, or are you just the Charlie Manson of the early 2000s?

753
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,380
Box 140306, Dallas, Texas.

754
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:57,880
75214.

755
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:58,520
Thank you.

756
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,320
Thank you.

757
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:01,580
Thank you.

758
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:03,920
Thank you.

759
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:04,940
Thank you.

760
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:05,840
Thank you.

761
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:09,260


762
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:09,260


763
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:09,260


764
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:09,260


765
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,040
Thank you.

766
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,860
See all that banging around?

767
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,120
We got the phones working again.

768
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:15,800
What?

769
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:16,660
What?

770
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,460
What what?

771
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,540
Now, this little tape coming up here.

772
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:26,240
My kids listened to this in the car, and they thought there was something nasty about it.

773
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:30,400
And I want you to listen real close, and see just how nasty it is, okay?

774
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:34,100
Would you like to know how to...

775
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:38,700
...fall around with a franky and score?

776
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,240
..talk whenever you feel like it.

777
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:39,240


778
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:39,240


779
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:39,240


780
00:44:39,260 --> 00:45:08,620
My name is Angel. We are the Android Sisters. We are a game men like to play. It is easy to turn me on.

781
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:28,300
We are easy. We are the Android Sisters. Now, here is the way to play fool around with a Frankie. And score. Now, the proper sequence.

782
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:38,320
Place your lips here. Place your lips here.

783
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:54,440
Bite me gently. Here. Bite me gently. Here.

784
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:06,120
Now, take your hand and move it. Here.

785
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:15,620
Now, take your hand and move it. Here.

786
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:33,420
Now, lower. Yes. Lower. Not too fast, not too slow.

787
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:35,620
Yes.

788
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,540
Oh. Oh.

789
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:55,600
Do you see how easy it is? We could drive you crazy. In an instant. Shame on you.

790
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:07,220
Did it really happen? Did it really take place? And if so, where? It happened in your mind.

791
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,780
Shame on you.

792
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:14,360
Do you see how easy it is? To control your mind?

793
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:15,360
We.

794
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:19,460
And we are only androids.

795
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,360
What do we know?

796
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:23,460
We can do that to you.

797
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,340
Think of what they do to you.

798
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:29,280
All of the time.

799
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,080
Shame on you.

800
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,100
Shame on you.

801
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,140
Shame on you, dear friends.

802
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,680
Shame on you.

803
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,340
Shame on you.

804
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,780
Shame on you.

805
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:49,440
Shame. Shame.

806
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,080
The guilt.

807
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,920
Where is the guilt, friends?

808
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,100
Have you not been getting enough guilt?

809
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:58,100
Well, here's a little bit of it for you.

810
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:04,580
And now, live from the Carlet Municipal Auditorium in Carlet, North Carolina.

811
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:08,120
PCP Productions brings you the Reverend Ernest Dangerfield.

812
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,740
of its miracle-healing crusade.

813
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:17,100
Reverend, come here.

814
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,300
The check came back.

815
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:20,620
The check came back.

816
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,480
What do you mean the check came back?

817
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,760
What do you mean the check came back?

818
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:25,680
Who sent that check?

819
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,040
Find out who sent that check

820
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,460
and I will hang him from the genitalia.

821
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:28,740
You're on.

822
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,500
From high atop the Great Cathedral

823
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,360
in the Acre in Ohio.

824
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:32,980
Who sent that check?

825
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:34,380
You're on, Reverend.

826
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:34,880
When people send me money

827
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,860
because I need money

828
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:37,200
and I expect money to be good

829
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,020
that is sent to me,

830
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:39,960
who sent that check?

831
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:40,880
Find out.

832
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:41,380
You're on.

833
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:41,860
Friends,

834
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,160
if you need to be healed,

835
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,860
I can heal you, friends.

836
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,260
Come up on stage

837
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:57,300
and feel his hand

838
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:58,920
on you.

839
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,620
And you can be healed.

840
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:03,360
Friends,

841
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:05,240
I don't get no respect,

842
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:06,480
no respect at all.

843
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,820
I was brought up in a church

844
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,600
that was so rough.

845
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,640
How rough was it?

846
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,140
They used to play strip bingo

847
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:13,020
on Wednesday nights.

848
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,240
Friends, the pastor was so mean,

849
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,840
he gave us prune juice for communion.

850
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,500
But I'm not like that, friends.

851
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,920
As long as you have money,

852
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,240
then he can touch you

853
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,560
and heal you through me.

854
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,460
And as long as the IRS

855
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:35,300
doesn't come bitching to me,

856
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:36,360
I don't care.

857
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,440
I don't care.

858
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,500
Because I got what I want.

859
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,980
And you can have what you want too, friends,

860
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,080
if you'll just come up here

861
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,760
and let me touch you and heal you.

862
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:49,900
Friends,

863
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,420
what's wrong with you, friends?

864
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,840
He has demons, friends.

865
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,080
He has demons all in this poor man.

866
00:49:59,200 --> 00:49:59,640
Demons.

867
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,740
I'm going to take those demon spirits

868
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:04,700
from his body.

869
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,180
I'm going to take them from him.

870
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:07,440
I'm going to take my...

871
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,000
Don't throw up, son.

872
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:09,760
The sex is rented.

873
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:11,900
I'm going to stick my fingers up his nose

874
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,280
and to pull those demon spirits out.

875
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,660
Out, out, demon spirits.

876
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:17,080
Out, out.

877
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,280
The demon spirits have been removed.

878
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:21,760
Can you have a clean ex, please?

879
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,200
Get this man out of here.

880
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:26,160
Yes, friend.

881
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:29,660
Another one healed.

882
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,740
You, sir.

883
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:32,800
What is your problem?

884
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:33,860
Why is that man in this way?

885
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,520
No, friend, you have demons.

886
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:36,880
No, I don't.

887
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:38,100
You have demons, friends.

888
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,140
Look, friends, this poor man has demons.

889
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,000
No, I feel fine.

890
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:42,020
You have demons.

891
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,180
You have demons.

892
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,320
You have demons.

893
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,220
You hear me?

894
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:46,880
You have demons.

895
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,060
You have demons, friends.

896
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,540
I told you this poor man has demons.

897
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,180
Get him out of here.

898
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:54,940
I don't want to fool with him.

899
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,440
What's your name, little girl?

900
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,120
What's your name?

901
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:04,220
No.

902
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,800
That's mine, but that's a funny name.

903
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:07,760
You're a little girl.

904
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,420
I'm not a little girl.

905
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,200
And why are you dressed like that, friend?

906
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,680
I shall watch out for this one.

907
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:16,960
No.

908
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,320
It's good.

909
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,100
You have problems, friend?

910
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:24,760
Do you smoke?

911
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,900
Do you have cigarettes with you?

912
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,160
Well, give them to me.

913
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,060
Do you drink, friend?

914
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,080
Yes.

915
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,600
Do you have liquor with you now?

916
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:36,220
Yes.

917
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,140
In the house of the Lord you bring liquor?

918
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:39,320
Well, give it to me.

919
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:46,780
Do you have sex with virgins, friend?

920
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:47,940
Yes.

921
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,220
Well, give them to me.

922
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,640
Do you have sex with other men, friend?

923
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:55,540
No.

924
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,040
Yes.

925
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:57,880
Well, give them to me.

926
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,900
Do you have sex with beasts, friend?

927
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:00,740
No.

928
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,680
Well, give them to me.

929
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,880
Do you do dangerous drugs, friend?

930
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:05,900
Yes.

931
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,460
Well, give them to me.

932
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,520
Yes.

933
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,840
Do you feel better now, friend?

934
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:11,760
No.

935
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:13,300
Well, praise God!

936
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,320
Do you wanna friend?

937
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:15,320
I feel better!

938
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,820
Yes, friend, I feel better!

939
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,000
Somebody say amen.

940
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,400
Thank God.

941
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,320
I feel better.

942
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:23,400
Praise God.

943
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:24,720
Say amen, losers.

944
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,180
Praise Cancer.

945
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:33,480
Yes, friends, I feel good, too.

946
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,100
Because those demons,

947
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:44,140
those pills, those evil women were all sent to Bob at Box 1403-06, Dallas, Texas, 75214,

948
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:50,940
and to KNON, Box 710909, Dallas, Texas, 75371.

949
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:56,260
Now, before we move out of here, I just want to play this one song.

950
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:06,520
And let me just, well, it's by the Ramones, but I sort of like to consider this part an important,

951
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,700
probably the most important part of my last will and testament.

952
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,920
I want all of you to remember this and just make sure that you uphold my wishes

953
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:19,240
as expressed by this ancient band of the punk era.

954
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:19,840
Thank you.

955
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:40,420
Thank you.

956
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,160
Thank you.

957
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Thank you.

958
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,900
Thank you.

959
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,200
Thank you.

960
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:12,120
Thank you.

961
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:37,440
Thank you.

962
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,300
Thank you.

963
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:56,980
Thank you.

964
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:31,660
Thank you.

965
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,040
Thank you.

966
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:44,820
Thank you.

967
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:45,800
Thank you.

968
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:46,380
Thank you.

969
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,320
Thank you.

970
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:49,000
Thank you.

971
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:52,800
Thank you.

972
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:54,180
Thank you.

973
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:57,020
Pet Cemetery.

974
00:56:58,580 --> 00:56:59,080
It couldn't be?

975
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:00,900
Oh, you think so, do you?

976
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:05,600
I'm sorry.

977
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:07,280
I guess it couldn't be worse.

978
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:08,820
The ground is sour.

979
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:11,400
Stonier than a man's heart.

980
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,840
Sometimes dead is better.

981
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:15,700
Sometimes.

982
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:18,240
Anyway, let's tell you this.

983
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:20,120
It's a little after 10 o'clock.

984
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:23,440
Sometimes slack is a lot better.

985
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,040
On 89.3 FM,

986
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,760
voice of slackheads across Texas.

987
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:30,880
And I hope you're having fun.

988
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:31,600
It's Sunday night.

989
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,400
Did you turn your clock back?

990
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:35,720
I didn't.

991
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,580
Hey, everybody say hi to Doug Wellman.

992
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,640
Hi, Doug Wellman.

993
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:39,380
Thanks.

994
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:44,840
And they should have heard you.

995
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,320
So, let's see.

996
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:50,860
I guess we're going to turn the clock back tonight.

997
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:54,740
And we're going to do two hours of music.

998
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,560
So, we're going to start with a piece from Dwayne Allman.

999
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,560
Because on this day, about 18 years ago,

1000
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,120
he crapped out on us, unfortunately.

1001
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:04,840
But he was a great guitar player and a wonderful human being.

1002
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,200
And so we're going to be featuring a bunch of different stuff.

1003
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:12,280
And I'll start it off with a piece from Hourglass called Been Gone Too Long.

1004
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:15,340
Been Gone Too Long

1005
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:15,340


1006
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:15,680
Been Gone Too Long

1007
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:15,680


1008
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:15,680


1009
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:15,700
Been Gone Too Long

1010
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,680
Been Gone Too Long

1011
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:16,940
Been Gone Too Long

1012
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:17,360
Been Gone Too Long

1013
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:17,820
Been Gone Too Long

1014
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,880
Been Gone Too Long

1015
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,580
Been Gone Too Long

1016
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:27,040
Been Gone Too Long

1017
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:33,760
Been Gone Too Long

1018
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,040
Been Gone Too Long

1019
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:37,040


1020
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:37,040


1021
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:37,040


1022
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:37,120
Been Gone Too Long

1023
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:37,120


1024
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:37,120


1025
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:37,120


1026
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:37,120


1027
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:37,120


1028
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:37,120


1029
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:37,240
Been Gone Too Long

1030
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:37,300
Been Gone Too Long

1031
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:37,300


1032
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:37,300


1033
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:37,300


1034
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:37,300


1035
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:37,900
Been Gone Too Long

1036
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:38,120
Been Gone Too Long

1037
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:38,160
Been Gone Too Long

1038
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:38,160


1039
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:38,160


1040
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:38,160


1041
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:38,160


1042
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:38,160


1043
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:38,160


1044
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:38,160


1045
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:38,160


1046
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:38,160


1047
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:38,160


1048
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:38,160


1049
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:38,220
Been Gone too Long

1050
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:38,220
