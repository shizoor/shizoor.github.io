1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
However, in order for you to feel, you'll need more than just knowledge.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,980
So we're going to add real experiences to your database.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,340
We want power! We want power! We want power!

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,200
We'll be alright!

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,200
No, no, no.

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:28,640
No, no, no.

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,420
Ladies and gentlemen, please leave your such suggested.

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:40,480
We're having operating difficulties, which has necessitated a delay in the beginning of our Sunday movie.

9
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,600
It's a wonderful life.

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,500
No trouble.

11
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,980
Just get set and get going.

12
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,220
Recording.

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,520
Everything's going fine.

14
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,400
No problem.

15
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,640
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

16
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,560
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,500
Bob?

18
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:04,900
Bob?

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,560
Ray!

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,280
Bob?

21
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,800
You can read along with me in your book.

22
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:17,380
You will notice time to turn the page when you hear R2-D2 beep like this.

23
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,720
Let's begin now.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,620
It was a dark time for the rebellion.

25
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:41,080
After the loss of the Death Star, the evil Galactic Empire intensified its efforts to crush the Rebel Alliance.

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,820
Prepare yourself.

27
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:54,920
You are about to be remade into a new being through forbidden knowledge previously kept secret for centuries by the jealous priesthoods of many religions.

28
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,960
Caution.

29
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,980
Improper viewing techniques may lead in some persons to depression.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:09,500
Dependency, seizures, cranial fits, priapic conditions, micturition, sternutation, subtle glandular mutations, and in some territories, legal arrest.

31
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:23,980
However, if the viewer follows instructions and trusts completely in Bob, this tape can produce an unsurpassable beatific experience that can last for hours, days, weeks, possibly even centuries.

32
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,260
This videotape bears a patented Dobbsdrome PowerShell timecode.

33
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:29,980
Which makes it easy to use.

34
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


35
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


36
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,520
cause some home video decks to react unpredictably.

37
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,220
Although only a small percentage of playback systems or their owners have suffered permanent

38
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:46,720
damage from this signal, the subgenius foundation incorporated is not responsible for injuries

39
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,380
or damages inflicted by paranormal events during tape play mode.

40
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:59,300
The tape also contains a subliminal hypnopediatrics trance inducement tone operating beyond the

41
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,580
range of human perception.

42
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,620
However, pets in the viewing room may exhibit unusual behavior as may small children and

43
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,180
certain less evolved adults.

44
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:15,160
If such behavior anomalies last more than two days after viewing, consult a physician.

45
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,140
However, this brainwave enfolding signal is generally harmless.

46
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,420
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

47
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:46,340
Every time you say, see, hear, or think, that's your key phrase.

48
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:51,600
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

49
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,100
We are controlling transmission.

50
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,620
However, this brainwave enfolding signal is generally harmless.

51
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,720
It is a very powerful signal, and should actually enhance your learning abilities during

52
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,540
the program.

53
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:10,600
Special interactive holosonic stereo effects produced on the Ultomate Cerebral Sync Lock

54
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:17,060
Interocitor are designed to trigger stem cleavage or brain division between the forebrain and

55
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,760
hindbrain.

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,440
Using newly discovered break-thinking principles, the viewer's brainwaves are locked into synchronization

57
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,840
with the tape's underlying suggestions by means of neuroelectric pulses.

58
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,260
Plant growth and gas mileage of nearby automobiles may be affected.

59
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:41,480
For the unworthy, this tape may be a one-way ticket down a bottomless mental pit from which

60
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,060
there can be no escape.

61
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:49,560
In unreceptive viewers, there is a danger of synaptic backfire in the brain pan caused

62
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,640
by overheating of the attention gland.

63
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,600
This dense packing of brain cells without proper organic coolants, such as FROP, has

64
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,640
been blamed for three recent cases of spontaneous human combustion.

65
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,980
Do not over-medicate.

66
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:11,140
High dosages have so sensitized the third nostril receptors of some viewers that they were unable

67
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,140
to stop seeing the tape even after it had been turned off.

68
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,180
This tape is to be used only by the person to whom it is prescribed.

69
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,020
Do not operate a motor vehicle following viewing.

70
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,340
Do not operate heavy farm machinery at speeds over 70 miles an hour.

71
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,860
The demons you may see during the initial hallucination sequence are not real.

72
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,220
If you do not panic, this phase will end after a few minutes.

73
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,100
Always resurface from the hypnosis slowly.

74
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:51,160
Coming out of the tape has been likened to a total rebirth process, if managed successfully.

75
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:57,860
If you have trouble re-entering the earth plane, focus on Bob and chant his name until

76
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,500
you remember your own.

77
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,160
And what exactly does this do for them?

78
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:09,120
It causes them to forget everything they've learned and prepares their mind for the slate-like

79
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,660
impression, the imprinting of the true subgenius.

80
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,720
For the next hour, sit quietly and we will control all that you see and hear.

81
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,960
We are conscious of our responsibility and obligation to provide programs which will

82
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,840
be enjoyable, entertaining, and tasteful.

83
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,420
There is absolutely no doubt.

84
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:27,840
There is absolutely no doubt.

85
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,940
There is absolutely no other possibility.

Copyright 1986 by the Subgenius Foundation and the participants.

87
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,840
And now you are ready for the final 200,000 mile void.

88
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,480
Do not attempt to flip the tape when you reach the end of side one.

89
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,720
No matter what you are told by later instructions on the tape, there is no side two.

90
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,720
However, if you do discover one, don't look at it.

91
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:07,860
If you follow these instructions, you will experience a profound cathartic reaction to

92
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,760
the flow of archetypal images and racial memories.

93
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:17,720
You may find yourself laughing and crying convulsively and even astrally projecting.

94
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,360
These are normal.

95
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,200
Enjoy them.

96
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,360
.

97
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,580
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

98
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:37,900
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

99
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,620
The Soap Genius Hour of Swat!

100
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,460
Welcome to the Soap Genius Hour of Swat!

101
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,920
I will be with you for the next 30 minutes.

102
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:08,100
Welcome, dear friends, to the Soap Genius Hour of Swat!

103
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,180
Swat! Swat! Swat!

104
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:10,680
Swat!

105
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,240
Swat!

106
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,160
Ah, yes, dear friends.

107
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:22,900
So good.

108
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,060
So good to be back.

109
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,500
What happened to the turntable one over here?

110
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,760
Well, friends, yes, I was on a mission for Bob last week.

111
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,320
It's true.

112
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:34,740
Frightening.

113
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,180
Particularly frightening mission for Bob.

114
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,020
Oh, there we go.

115
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,140
There we go.

116
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,900
This is a, believe it or not, this is a record by a band called Slack.

117
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,440
And the record is called Slack.

118
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,320
And the song is called Slack Attack.

119
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,880
It's not that.

120
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,360
It's not that.

121
00:08:59,580 --> 00:08:59,640
It's not that.

122
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,580
It's not that.

123
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:00,840
It's not that.

124
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:00,840


125
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:00,840


126
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:00,840


127
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:06,460
Oh, I had a great weekend, folks, at the, uh, Fantasy Fair, which is over with now.

128
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,740
We had a devival down there, believe it or not.

129
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,040
Couldn't announce it last week because I was out of town and forgot about it the week before.

130
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:21,840
But, uh, I'm not gonna play any excerpts from that devival because, frankly, friends, I just wasn't in top form.

131
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,140
Um.

132
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:24,760
Uh.

133
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,580
Uh.

134
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,400
Uh.

135
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:26,620


136
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:26,880
Uh.

137
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:26,920


138
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,700
Uh.

139
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:27,700


140
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:27,700


141
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,480
Not during the revival. Afterwards, I had a great time, dear friends.

142
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,560
I'm mighty. I got slack. I got slack, dear friends.

143
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,580
Oh, yes.

144
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:44,860
But during the revival, I had just read the news about the KNON's licensing problems.

145
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,580
And I was just too depressed to rant properly.

146
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,740
I mean, I never hated the conspiracy more.

147
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:59,620
For those of you who didn't know, well, the judge decided against KNON.

148
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,100
For now. For now.

149
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:07,460
But you know how that makes me feel about religions I didn't used to hate?

150
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:15,180
I had a whole rant prepared about that, and I'm not going to get into it because, well, we have to be real careful about slanting.

151
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,280
But in the meantime, I've got a little bit of...

152
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,620
These are excerpts, roughly.

153
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:28,940
These are cuts from the soundtrack of the Subgenius video, which is what I was working on last week in San Francisco

154
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:36,540
with the mighty Dr. Hal Robbins from the San Francisco radio show doing the narration.

155
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,540
So, I did have a good time.

156
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,220
Yeah.

157
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,960
Yeah.

158
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:48,480


159
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,240
Slack.

160
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:51,940
Slack.

161
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:04,580
Little realized, even by leading scientists, there are really only two races,

162
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,360
actually two distinct species of so-called human beings.

163
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:18,220
If you gaze upon any given street, normally you might never suspect that only some of these people are true humans.

164
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,720
Outside appearances offer no clue that among them there are real humans.

165
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:32,820
But among this ordinary-looking crowd, on an ordinary day, a certain number of these people are actually subgeniuses.

166
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:41,060
We would have to creep inside their heads to know whether this person or that carries the rare subgenius gene.

167
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:48,240
But once inside those heads, we would discover a vast new universe, a new dimension,

168
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,520
coexisting not always in harmony alongside.

169
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,140
The mundane, workaday world of the common human.

170
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,700
Another world that until now has been forced into hiding.

171
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,160
Now, at this very moment, the veils of secrecy can be torn aside.

172
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,080
We, the persecuted, may now dare to raise our heads high and declare,

173
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:14,440
Behold us, for we are the subgeniuses.

174
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,920
But what is a subgenius?

175
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,160
How can they, we,

176
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:28,280
differ so much from the humans, whose nonsensical laws and customs we have been forced to obey?

177
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,240
Why have so many of us been kept in ignorance of our true heritage?

178
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,100
I...

179
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,060
Examine this seemingly docile crowd,

180
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,100
and know that in some few,

181
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,580
simmering beneath a placid surface,

182
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,760
there broils a veritable cauldron of repressed subgenius awareness,

183
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,700
ready at any moment to be destroyed.

184
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,600
And at any moment to explode outward,

185
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,820
often with catastrophic results.

186
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,480
Look at the word subgenius.

187
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,260
It doesn't simply mean just below a genius.

188
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:11,180
The intelligence level of subgeniuses can range far, far below genius.

189
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:17,140
It's not the so-called intelligence that really matters after all, but how it is used.

190
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,380
The subgenius does not pretend to super-knowledge,

191
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:21,680
but is a subgenius.

192
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,180
But to sub-knowledge.

193
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,860
Knowledge of the under-things.

194
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:32,340
The hollow earth from whose darkness issue the Nazi hell-creatures and other demons of the abyss.

195
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,320
It is in contemplation of these under-things,

196
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,700
the underwear lurking just below the clothing of existence,

197
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,420
that the subgenii display what genius they have.

198
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,960
The study of this substratum, the foundation garment underlying reality,

199
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,600
is the subgenius' strength.

200
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,540
For it is from this source that he or she

201
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:02,940
taps the infinite resources of a force that is completely incomprehensible to humans.

202
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,680
The force of Slack.

203
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,300
The conspiracy media, unable to ignore the church,

204
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:16,540
has attempted to discredit it as a mere joke, a pathetic satire.

205
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,620
The reason?

206
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,240
Slack is simply beyond their emotional grasp.

207
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,420
Slack.

208
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,180
What is it?

209
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:30,020
Well, if you have to ask, you'll probably never know.

210
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,520
You were born with original Slack, an infinite supply of it.

211
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,760
But the conspiracy has most of it now.

212
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,080
They don't even know what it is, but that hasn't stopped them from stealing it away.

213
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,600
How do you think you ended up a slave to their so-called world?

214
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,140
Work.

215
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,900
True Slack is, by definition, indefinable.

216
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:58,280
It is a kind of direct perception, unfettered by common sense.

217
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,020
It is not merely laziness.

218
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,000
It is rather a kind of active sloth.

219
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,600
Slack in its pure form makes happiness seem like agony by comparison.

220
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,500
Next to Slack, the nirvana known to mystics and saints

221
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,560
is like endless toil.

222
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,140
It is like a

223
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:20,140


224
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:20,320
a

225
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:20,620
sly

226
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:20,620


227
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,240
sly

228
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,240


229
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,260
sly

230
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:21,400
a

231
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,840
sly

232
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,880
a

233
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,740
sly

234
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:38,980
ly

235
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,220

236
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:39,560

00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:39,560


238
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:39,800
sly

239
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,300
tried to make it something which we've been led to believe we must work to buy.

240
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,720
It is this yearning for slack that separates us from them.

241
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:56,100
The human may live out his entire life in a grinding cycle of slacklessness,

242
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:02,320
his hours consumed by meaningless toil, interspersed with meaningless leisure.

243
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,420
Yet he never feels cheated. He thinks it's natural.

244
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:13,760
Perhaps we should pity them, but face it, most people are venal jerks,

245
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:18,920
half-witted cattle racing each other to be first to the slaughterhouse,

246
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,400
and stampeding you along with them.

247
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:48,940
Moses went up to the mountain high to find out from God why did you make us. Why?

248
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:53,700
Secret words in a secret room. He said,

249
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,300
Wop, bop, a-loo, bop, a-lop, bam, boom.

250
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:04,280
I did not put you here to suffer. I did not put you here to whine.

251
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,400
I put you here to die. I put you here to die.

252
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,280
She here to love one another.

253
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:13,740
And the Jiddas have a good time now, now, now.

254
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,060
Let my people go, go, go. You gotta let my people go, go, go.

255
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:28,240
Let my people go, go, go. You gotta let my people go.

256
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,760
Joshua picked a battle in Jericho.

257
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,580
He tell the boys with the horns, get down and blow.

258
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,480
They rear back, aim their bells at the stars.

259
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,680
He said, Feed me, big daddy. Hey, to the bar.

260
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:58,600
I did not put you here to suffer. I did not put you here to whine.

261
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,680
I put you here to love one another.

262
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:08,140
And the kid I play I have a good time now, now, now

263
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,680
Let my people go, go, go

264
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,760
You gotta let my people go, go, go

265
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,460
Let my people go, go, go

266
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,740
You gotta let my people go

267
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,680
What I say

268
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:50,180
Now, Jesus went out for a walk with his mother

269
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:54,320
The scribes and the Pharisees, plot and hugger-mugger

270
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,140
They locked him up and they threw away the key

271
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,120
He said, why is everybody always picking on me?

272
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,260
I did not put you here to suffer

273
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:09,180
No, I did not put you here to whine

274
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,040
I put you here to love one another

275
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:18,700
And the kid I play I have a good time now, now, now

276
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,940
Let my people go, go, go

277
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,040
You gotta let my people go, go, go

278
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,080
Let my people go, go, go

279
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,660
You gotta let my people go, go, go

280
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,540
You gotta let my people go, go, go

281
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,660
You gotta let my people go, go, go

282
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,640
You gotta let my people go, go, go

283
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,140
You gotta let my people go

284
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:49,880
Oh

285
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:49,880


286
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,940
Hey

287
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,500
All right

288
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,760
Yeah

289
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,080
Yeah

290
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,700
Yeah

291
00:19:59,700 --> 00:19:59,980
Yeah

292
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,000
Yeah

293
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,040
Yeah

294
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,580
Yeah

295
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,040
Yeah

296
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,420
We interrupt this program for a special promotional announcement.

297
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,640
Yes, dear friends.

298
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,780
Well, and I think this says something for just how much freedom this station has.

299
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,680
But Jeff, the station manager, just came in and said,

300
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:28,480
Why you going read my rant, my angry rant about what they would have done to this station?

301
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,480
And he said, Go ahead and read it.

302
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,600
So I'm going to.

303
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:43,860
What do you gentlemen like to escort Reverend Stang out and lock him out of this place?

304
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,120
In all reality, help me somebody.

305
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,180
She ain't got no legs.

306
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,200
Pull the lever down and go.

307
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,740
My legs are on fire.

308
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,680
They smell praise dogs.

309
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,320
Oh, yes, dear friends.

310
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,300
Now, when I started into this subgenius business,

311
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,440
it was not, believe it or not, it was not out of hatred or spite.

312
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,540
I personally had no bone to pick with any religion.

313
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,420
Believe it or not, I hadn't been damaged by any of them as a kid.

314
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:20,320
And even though this whole church is a fanatical attack on fanaticism,

315
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,140
I certainly never had anything against any particular religion.

316
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,740
Only certain practitioners have said.

317
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:31,200
But I got back to town from San Francisco to discover,

318
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:36,340
that the judge decided to give K&ON's license to the Baptists.

319
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,260
And you know how that makes me feel, friends?

320
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,300
It makes me hate Christianity.

321
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,780
Now, that's a horrible thing to say, isn't it?

322
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,620
Not, some of you would go, yeah, right on.

323
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:55,860
But I mean, I know personally that Jesus Christ woke up Friday morning in heaven.

324
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:01,000
And when he read in the Times Herald that this travesty of justice,

325
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,740
had happened, he said to himself,

326
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:11,420
these money changers who have taken my name and used it as an excuse to shaft

327
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:16,780
the people of whom they are jealous, they shall pay for their sins.

328
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,200
And I think it's about time I came back down to earth, Jesus said.

329
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,760
But this time I come as a sword, an avenging warrior,

330
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,940
and I'd best call up my old drinking buddy, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

331
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,320
Friends, the money changers are in the temple.

332
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,720
All last year, people would say to me,

333
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:42,540
Reverend Stang, aren't you afraid the fundamentalists are going to succeed

334
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:49,080
in robbing us of our freedoms and turning this country into a fascist Nazi state?

335
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:53,700
And I'd say, no, those people make a lot of noise, but they're such a minority.

336
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:59,940
I mean, really, folks, 80% of the real Americans laugh at those idiots behind their backs.

337
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:05,380
But now, oh, now it's beginning, it is beginning to look like the average yuppie

338
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:12,520
doesn't even care if a superstitious fool wrecks the kids' education by censoring textbooks.

339
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:17,080
I guess the average yuppie American doesn't have enough soul left

340
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,480
to worry about preserving the spirit of rock and roll.

341
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,680
Well, Bob Dobbs wants to preserve the spirit of rock and roll,

342
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,800
because rock and roll is not powered by Satan at all.

343
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,920
If anybody's doing the work of God, then it's the spirit of God.

344
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,100
If anybody's doing the work of Satan, it's the fundamentalist so-called Christians,

345
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:40,260
because they make Jesus look so evil, so vindictive, so petty,

346
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,540
that they drive the smart people away from religion

347
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:48,360
and attract only the mean bullies and the guilt-ridden perverts

348
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,620
and the losers that have to cluster together and feed each other's illusions with lies.

349
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,100
And they do affect our lifestyles now.

350
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,180
They certainly do mine.

351
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,880
It's making me more cantankerous by the minute.

352
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,120
It makes us have to use shock value on this show.

353
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:08,380
Another thing, as far as I'm concerned, about these fundamentalist evangelicals

354
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,520
is that they're racist.

355
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,400
They're the most racist people in the country.

356
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,120
They love to talk love and brotherhood,

357
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,240
but if you want to know how they really talk and act,

358
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,080
you have to make them think you're one of them.

359
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,720
I deal with evangelicals on my job all the time,

360
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,180
and they never know that I'm really Ivan Stang,

361
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,900
sacred scribe of the Church of the Subgenius.

362
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,920
They think I'm a nightmarish,

363
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,640
young film editor.

364
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:36,460
And they'll look over their shoulder to make sure there aren't any non-whites around,

365
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,280
and they make the nastiest, sleaziest race jokes you ever heard.

366
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,800
I know how they think because I grew up with them,

367
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,080
but they don't know how I think,

368
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,460
and they don't know how you think.

369
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,260
Now what does this tell you?

370
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,260
It tells you, friend, that they are of low intelligence,

371
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,700
lower than a subgenius,

372
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,760
and that's saying something.

373
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,220
They may have started out smart enough,

374
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,520
but they dived into a belief system,

375
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,100
that makes their minds so lazy,

376
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,180
that they lose the ability to think.

377
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,780
But they think we're evil.

378
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:11,760
Oh yes, old Reverend Stang, he's an evil man because he cusses.

379
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,900
You're an evil man because you smoke.

380
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,240
Now young lady, you're evil because you dance.

381
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:21,080
And I'm an evil man when I try to say that they perverted the word of Jesus,

382
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,200
and turned them into the words of the conspiracy.

383
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:29,500
Now, Jesus H. Christ was one of the most anti-conspiracy,

384
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,580
guys there ever was until Bob.

385
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:38,600
But friends, your Jerry Falwell is to Jesus what the Ayatollah Khomeini is to Mohammed,

386
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,000
and what Stalin was to Marx,

387
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,420
and what Richard Nixon was to Thomas Jefferson,

388
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,660
and what the Bobbies are to Bob Dobbs.

389
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:51,820
Now right now, I'd say that as ridiculous as the Bible can be,

390
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:55,520
J.R. Bob Dobbs is the best friend Jesus has had,

391
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,020
and the so-called Christians are his worst enemies,

392
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,280
just as the Bobbies are Bob's worst enemies.

393
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,960
Why do you think Bob staged his own quote,

394
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,040
assassination, unquote?

395
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,240
Same reason Jesus did, to get away from his fan club.

396
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,380
Bob and Jesus, neither one of them looking for followers,

397
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:16,740
they're looking for equals, and that's a hard search, friends.

398
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,500
The person that's equal to Bob and the fighting Jesus,

399
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,080
in terms of knowing how to have a good time,

400
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,860
these people are few and far between, I'm afraid.

401
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,940
And I'm sorry it's so unfunny tonight,

402
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,780
but you know, this church, as we've said before,

403
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,780
this church could be the greatest joke ever told.

404
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,500
But only, only, dear friends, if Earth can make it to the punchline.

405
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,460
Some take the Bible for what it's worth

406
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:56,760
When it says that the meat shall inherit the earth

407
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:03,380
And some sheik has bought New Jersey last week

408
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,240
And you suckers ain't gettin' nothin'

409
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,540
Is Harirama really wrong

410
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:23,080
If you wander around with a napkin on

411
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,260
With a bell on a stick

412
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,000
And your hair in a hat?

413
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,720
The church is all gone

414
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,120
The geek shall inherit nothin'

415
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,220
You say your life's a fun deal

416
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,460
And you're up against the wall

417
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:49,000
Well, people, you ain't even got no kind of deal at all

418
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:55,040
Cause what they do in Washington

419
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:59,000
They just take care of the people

420
00:27:59,020 --> 00:27:59,440
Yeah!

421
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,520
From number one

422
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,880
And number one

423
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,040
And you

424
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:15,560
You ain't even number two

425
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,580
Old Jesus freaks

426
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,580
Well, they're friendly, but

427
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,240
They don't even want to talk about God

428
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,800
The shit they believe

429
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,100
Has got their minds all shut

430
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,500
And they don't even care

431
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,060
When the church takes a cut

432
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:43,560
Ain't it bleak when you got so much nothing?

433
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,460
So what do you do?

434
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:45,940
Hey!

435
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,200
Eat that pork

436
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,860
Eat that ham

437
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,960
Laugh till you choke on Billy Graham

438
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,780
Moses, Aaron, and Abraham

439
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,620
They're all a waste of time.

440
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,640
And it's your ass that's on the line.

441
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,980
It's your ass that's on the line.

442
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,980
Do what you wanna.

443
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,560
Do what you will.

444
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:23,080
Just don't mess up your neighbor's thrill.

445
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:29,520
And when you pay the bill, kindly leave a little tip.

446
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:36,040
And help the next poor sucker on his one-way trip.

447
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,340
Some take the fine.

448
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:47,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

449
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:52,680
Oh, give me half a dozen for the hotel room.

450
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,340
Oh, my.

451
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,600
Hotel room.

452
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,980
They are wherever we're from.

453
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,380
We should have noticed by now.

454
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,880
Our behavior is dumb.

455
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,340
And if our chances expect to improve,

456
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,100
it's gonna take a lot more than trying to remove the other race

457
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,760
or the other whatever from the face of the planet altogether.

458
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,620
They call it the Earth,

459
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,060
which is the Earth of the Earth.

460
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,140
Earth is a dumb kind of name.

461
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,580
But they make it right because we behave the same.

462
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,460
We are dumb all over.

463
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,460
Dumb all over.

464
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,500
Yes, we are.

465
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,040
Dumb all over.

466
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,180
Near and far.

467
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,620
Dumb all over.

468
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,800
Black and white.

469
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,600
People, we is not a reptite.

470
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,460
Birds on the left.

471
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,340
Birds on the right.

472
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,680
Religious fanatics on the air every night.

473
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,520
Seeing the Bible tells the story.

474
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:52,280
Makes the details sound real gory about what to do.

475
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:52,960
We are the geek.

476
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,680
We are the geeks over there.

477
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,260
Don't believe in the book we got over here.

478
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,660
You can't run a race without no feet.

479
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,260
And pretty soon there won't be no street

480
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,260
for dummies to jog on or doggies to dog on.

481
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,640
Religious fanatics can make it be all gone.

482
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,720
I mean, it won't blow up and disappear.

483
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,780
It'll just look ugly for a thousand years.

484
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,820
You can't run a country by a book of religion.

485
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:21,820
Not by a heap or a lump or a smidgen of foolish rules.

486
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:22,940
Of ancient history.

487
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:22,940


488
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,640
Designed to make you all feel great.

489
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,880
While you fold, spindle, and mutilate

490
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,000
those unbelievers from a neighboring state.

491
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,100
Two arms.

492
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,440
Two arms.

493
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,240
Hooray, that's great.

494
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,540
Two legs ain't bad.

495
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,940
Unless there's a crate they ship the parts to mama in.

496
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,520
For souvenirs.

497
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,340
Two years.

498
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,240
Get down.

499
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,140
Not his, not hers, but what they hate.

500
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,260
The good book says it's gotta be that way.

501
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:55,600
But their book says, revenge the bruisey.

502
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,660
Hey, we can't really be dumb if we're just following God's orders.

503
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,280
Let's get serious.

504
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,200
God knows what he's doing.

505
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,740
He wrote this book here.

506
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:09,640
And the book says he made us all to be just like him.

507
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:13,760
So if we're dumb, then God is dumb.

508
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:17,180
And maybe even a little ugly on the side.

509
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,340
.

510
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,840
Dumb all over.

511
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,660
A little ugly on the side.

512
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,140
Dumb all over.

513
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,940
A little ugly on the side.

514
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,360
Dumb all over.

515
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,200
A little ugly on the side.

516
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,680
Dumb all over.

517
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,280
A little ugly on the side.

518
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,720
Oh, yes, dear friends.

519
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,740
Dumb all over.

520
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,580
This is Frank Zappa from I believe it's the Them or Us album.

521
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,800
A little earlier, I played

522
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,840
some of the Rainmakers.

523
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,920
I'm going to play a little more of that.

524
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,740
And in between, of course,

525
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,720
we're playing the soundtrack.

526
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,520
It's not actually the soundtrack

527
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,900
from the Subgenius video

528
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,060
because that'll be intercut

529
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,500
with a lot of revival footage

530
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,540
from our Subgenius shows.

531
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,440
Anyway, I'll be carrying on

532
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,420
with that in a minute here.

533
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,260
Friends, I'm going to cut in.

534
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,140
I'm going to read this box number again

535
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,540
at the end of the broadcast,

536
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,080
so have your pencil ready.

537
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,800
But if you want to write for information

538
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,380
from the Church of the Subgenius,

539
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,400
that's Bob, write to Bob

540
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,920
at P.O. Box 140306,

541
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,180
Dallas, Texas, 75214.

542
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,700
And I'm going to give that box number again

543
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,640
a little bit later on.

544
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,800
But first, I've had a lot of calls,

545
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,560
and I think some of y'all need to know more

546
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,260
about the mighty Word of Bob.

547
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:44,860
Oh, yeah.

548
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,060
Wouldn't you love

549
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,900
like revenge on these mediocritans,

550
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,420
these pink boys,

551
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,020
these box-dwelling Barbies and Kens,

552
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,720
these normals who have made normality the norm?

553
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,420
Pinks.

554
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,020
Pinks are but living stereotypes,

555
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,100
insensate meat puppets

556
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,300
and mere food tubes

557
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,180
who lack and fear

558
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,460
the spark of originality

559
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,120
that ignites every subject in this song.

560
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,520
But the long, senseless march into slacklessness

561
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,240
may soon come to an end.

562
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,960
It won't be without a bitter struggle,

563
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,040
but at least there is hope.

564
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,860
For in this, the 20th century,

565
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,960
we have seen the coming of a symbol,

566
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,080
a beacon of slack,

567
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,600
a banner behind which we may unite.

568
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,020
It is the coming of J.R. Bob Dobbs

569
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:47,060
and his mighty Church of the Subgenius.

570
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,720
Is there a typical subgenius?

571
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,220
Of course not.

572
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,180
The very thought is blasphemy.

573
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,320
The only thing that most subgeniuses have in common

574
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,540
is that they're all different

575
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,420
and they have nothing in common with the conspiracy,

576
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,740
the pink meat masses which grope and clutch around us.

577
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,840
The Church is, shall we say, a disorganized religion

578
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,900
which theoretically should not exist

579
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,920
simply because it's composed of people

580
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,060
who are not joining us.

581
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,060


582
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,060


583
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,060


584
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,060


585
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,440
They share spring and fall.

586
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,080
It's learning and understanding

587
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:27,380
that makes them unique.

588
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,480
And I read that several times,

589
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,000
and I read that in compare to those who call themselves

590
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,260
an animals.

591
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:37,440
But that's a long story of science 말씀�ation .

592
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,620
You know how much your days are from our shadows?

593
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:39,680
Hundreds of long lives

594
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,780
The Ohioan epic is also a tale ofан out of plain sight.

595
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:42,780


596
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:42,780


597
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:42,780


598
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:42,780


599
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:42,780


600
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:42,780


601
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:42,780


602
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:42,780


603
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:42,780


604
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,420
the wise men

605
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:43,980
found that

606
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:43,980


607
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:43,980


608
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,840
Stay the night

609
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,380
and be aware

610
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:46,460
of the

611
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:46,460


612
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:46,460


613
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:46,460


614
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:46,460


615
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:46,460


616
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:46,460


617
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:46,740
thousands

618
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:46,740


619
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:46,740


620
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:46,740


621
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:46,740


622
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:46,740


623
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,060
destitute

624
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:47,060


625
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:53,480
Hormonger, a sleazy con man foisting his dangerous scam off on gullible suckers.

626
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:02,540
Well, dear friend, J.R. Bob Dobbs isn't some outmoded, overused deity from ancient fairy tales,

627
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,340
but a living, bleeding deity for today.

628
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,220
The divinely appointed messenger of slack,

629
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:16,980
the mystic super salesman upon whose wheeling and dealing skills the fate of this universe hinges.

630
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,020
Born to humble parents somewhere in the Midwest,

631
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:28,340
the child Bob experienced a traumatic, close encounter with a UFO at the age of three.

632
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:33,540
Soon thereafter, he began to exhibit strange powers of persuasion.

633
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,840
By age six, he had made his first million almost by accident.

634
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,380
In college,

635
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:44,180
he met and married his first and still his primary wife, Connie,

636
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:50,560
who is now revered by female subgeni as the blessed anti-virgin.

637
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:57,440
With Connie's encouragement, the young Dobbs became a salesman of legendary and almost frightening abilities,

638
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,980
known to his peers as the man who could sell anything.

639
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:07,260
He worked his way up to the very top of the conspiracy ladder and might have saved it.

640
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,600
But...

641
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,480
late one night in 1953,

642
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,600
while working on an amateur television of his own design,

643
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:22,000
an event occurred which was to become a milestone in man's mind path to slack.

644
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:28,320
He was suddenly seized up in the spirit by the hand of Jehovah One itself,

645
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,680
the cosmic puppeteer of the Old Testament,

646
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:36,880
the wrathful alien space god from some corporate sin galaxy.

647
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:45,460
In this timeless moment, which we call the divine immaculation of the Bob,

648
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,380
Dobbs received the first of countless brain-curdling pronouncements

649
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:54,520
which formed the sacred prescriptures of the church.

650
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:01,880
He was shown a vision, a world where all humanity was equally wealthy, rich beyond imagining,

651
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,780
but without working.

652
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,380
This experience, combined with his UFO-given sales magic,

653
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:12,120
led him inevitably into the religion field.

654
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:17,440
He quickly discovered the golden rule embodied in his classic saying,

655
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,000
they'll pay to know what they really think.

656
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,760
The true subgenius can learn to think for himself,

657
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,340
but only Bob can show him how.

658
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:36,160
And so, Bob Dobbs founded his church upon a sandy beach of common sense,

659
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,740
sense of humor, and...

660
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,540
dollars and cents.

661
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,800
A likely story, you say.

662
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,460
But it's simple, really.

663
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,980
Bob is lucky, not smart.

664
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:52,360
In fact, by the perverted conspiracy standards of intelligence,

665
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,180
he's gifted with incredible stupidity.

666
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:59,900
He lives in a perpetual state of contracted consciousness.

667
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,260
This enables him to act without thinking,

668
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,580
to effortlessly surf the luck plane,

669
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:10,960
to float down the fabled path of least resistance,

670
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,320
to, in fact, make a million dollars each time he screws up.

671
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,640
Thus, it is not his wisdom, but his divine follies,

672
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,680
his holy blunders which we emulate.

673
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:26,900
The miracle is not in what Bob does to you,

674
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:30,020
but in what he allows you to do to yourself.

675
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,940
He brings the student to the realization that

676
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,840
everything you know is true.

677
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:41,180
Pull the wool over your own eyes, he admonishes,

678
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,920
and you may finally relax in the safety of your own delusions.

679
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:50,540
Under the conspiracy, you're being ripped off every day,

680
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,640
but you can learn to enjoy it.

681
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,000
You can choose the way you're gonna get screwed.

682
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,840
Some ways are fun.

683
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,260
Dobbs journeyed to Tibet,

684
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,460
and under ancient holy men,

685
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:09,300
he perfected the arts of glandscaping and acupatting.

686
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,080
He also began modeling for hundreds of magazine ads,

687
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,480
leaving early clues of his presence.

688
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,420
These old ads are the only known photos of Dobbs,

689
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,820
for he otherwise remains elusive,

690
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,640
shunning both the spotlight and the authorities.

691
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:30,060
In 1979, he recruited two randomly selected nobodies,

692
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,120
Dr. Philo Drummond and Ivan Stang,

693
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,300
to begin a public outreach arm,

694
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,300
and spread his seed word of slack.

695
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,060
The church is now subjected to constant harassment

696
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,560
and attacks from every corner,

697
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,620
which only serves to illustrate how much they fear his message.

698
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,760
Some call us Satanists,

699
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:54,460
or the mockers prophesied in the Bible as harbingers of the end times.

700
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,800
Still others dare to deny that Bob exists at all.

701
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,620
But if that were so,

702
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:05,180
who posed for all those magazine ads in the 50s?

703
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,300
The feminist dupes of the conspiracy charge

704
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,060
that not enough members are women.

705
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,960
Bob would agree to that.

706
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,240
Indeed, he would say,

707
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,300
there will never be enough women,

708
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:19,260
but at least the ones we have are all women.

709
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,160
And Bob?

710
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,760
Bob is all men.

711
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,260
The James Bond of Zen masters,

712
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,060
the most dashing religious leader of his time,

713
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:49,780
and someone who needs pół to97.

714
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,780
Every small word you say

715
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,100
is said for the rest of your life.

716
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,280
You're the greatest man that ever existed.

717
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,580
You are one.

718
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,720
Lovers of all countries.

719
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,980
You're NOT ?

720
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,100
They still feel like they have no one as good,

721
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:57,220
but only as they see their life.

722
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,620
Why don't you ask your woman?

723
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,320
Sin Galaxy

724
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,120
Bob is a sex god

725
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:19,880
Bob is a sex god

726
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:27,800
Bob is a sex god

727
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,600
They think Bob is a just man

728
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,600
They think Bob is a good man

729
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:38,340
But they don't believe that Bob is the son of Jehovah One

730
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:42,040
Alien space god from a corporate sin galaxy

731
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:42,740
Alien space god from a corporate sin galaxy

732
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,380
Bob is a sex god

733
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,180
So what's next?

734
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:49,900
Is he going to be on the internet and say

735
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,520
this is a mystic culture, this is a political universe

736
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,380
Well what the hell is left?

737
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,980
Elvis Presley's a fat monster

738
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,580
the Ramones are covering the Chambers brothers

739
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,880
What the hell is left?

740
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:06,040
The church of the sub-genius children

741
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:10,320
Say it with me brother Doug

742
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,540
We may just be a joke

743
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:16,480
But it's a joke you can believe in

744
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:19,860
Who's in charge of the fools?

745
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:33,040
Children! Children! Children! If a Joseph is an honest, natural-minded, open-minded, he doesn't make history. He just exploits it.

746
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:33,860
Hi, Bob!

747
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:37,760
Right, Bob? Bob? Bob?

748
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:46,480
Through subversive measures, Devo passes on the word of Bob by, if you take a look at our last album cover,

749
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:53,960
his name's been airbrushed into the rubber hairlines of each of the band members, right next to the word sex.

750
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,080
Do Bob and sex go hand in hand?

751
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,740
Well, Bob is a kind of total, all-consuming sex.

752
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:17,860
Bob and sex go hand in hand.

753
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,660
There's nothing but the up and low.

754
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:44,120
There's nothing like some in and out.

755
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:47,560
There's nothing more than what you know.

756
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:48,760
Yes!

757
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:56,000
About the only slack that I get anymore is worshipping at the holy temple of Ioni.

758
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,160
Oh, my!

759
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:27,560
For Bob, my friend, Bob is a sex god.

760
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:36,340
Ain't a bigger abomination in the world than women wearing men's clothes and men wearing women's clothes and people being perverts.

761
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:36,920
That's the...

762
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,460
Uh...

763
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:46,580
Two of the greatest sins in the world is idolatry, witchcraft, homosexuality, and men and women wearing...

764
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,620
...the clothes of the opposite sex.

765
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,620
It's abomination.

766
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,540
And whosoever do it is abomination.

767
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:58,900
And there's more people today.

768
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,680
Their minds are perverted.

769
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,220
Their life is perverted.

770
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,780
And they've been given over to a reprobate mind.

771
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,340
So many people today.

772
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,180
Even people that aren't homosexual.

773
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,120
Their minds are perverted.

774
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,680
It's filled with filth.

775
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:16,540
And it's filled with all the ungodliness and wickedness that comes from the pit of hell.

776
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,000
And you see it on television.

777
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,360
You see it in the movie houses.

778
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,480
And you see it on the...

779
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,260
...on the market stand.

780
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:27,120
Yes, and I hope to see more of it, friends.

781
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:27,820
Hey, how about that?

782
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,680
Shucks, all you have to do is look around you.

783
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,560
Female body parts are available just about anywhere.

784
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:33,100
Ah, yes.

785
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,940
Or pick up some picture books with a free or a missing clip.

786
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:40,240
You know, there is nothing wrong with that filthiness and ungodliness.

787
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,220
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

788
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:45,080
Well, this is...I usually don't play more than one...

789
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:45,620
What?

790
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:46,920
Ooh.

791
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,400
I don't usually play more than one song by a given band.

792
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:52,940
But I really like this band.

793
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:56,280
And I like this song because this song is really about...

794
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:04,160
It defies the conspiracy programming about so-called good looks.

795
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:05,920
Shall we say?

796
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,240
And, uh, I don't know.

797
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,560
I always identified with this band.

798
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,760
The Rainmakers, once again.

799
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:19,180
One, one, two, one, two, three, four!

800
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,960
I want a big black blonde to hold my hand

801
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,880
To keep the skinny boy from blowin' away in the wind

802
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,980
I want a big black blonde

803
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:38,020
Whoo!

804
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:38,620
Whoo!

805
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,080
A big black blonde

806
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,040
Mama, mama, mama, keep your skinny girls at home

807
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,280
Cause this skinny boy wants a big black blonde

808
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,660
Me and my big black blonde, we like to fight and scratch

809
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:06,960
I know I'll be the loser of the wrestling match

810
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,120
With a big black blonde

811
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:09,940
Whoo!

812
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:13,000
There's a big black blonde

813
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:19,120
Mama, mama, mama, keep your skinny girls at home

814
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:23,420
Cause this skinny boy wants a big black blonde

815
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,640
Well, I'm talkin' six foot eight, I'm a big black blonde

816
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:32,640


817
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,160
Let's read forty, thirty, forty

818
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:39,140
And my side and bottom shelf's tall, deaf and dirty

819
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,180
Talkin' six foot blonde

820
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,260
I'm a blonde

821
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,420
I'm a blonde!

822
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:11,240
Well, me and Jay Salinger were sittin' on your porch

823
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,380
I wanna date with your sister

824
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,280
I'm new and he's power

825
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,540
A big black blonde

826
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:27,340
Inside everybody there's a big black blonde

827
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:31,320
If you don't believe me, take a look around

828
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,620
Big black blonde

829
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:39,460
Everywhere big black blondes

830
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:43,500
Mama, keep those skinny girls at home

831
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:47,960
Cause skinny little me wants a big black blonde

832
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:58,860
A big black blonde

833
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:02,600
A big black blonde

834
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,100
Big black blonde

835
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:14,060
Yes, Bob Dobbs is a sex god

836
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:18,260
He has come and keeps coming again and again

837
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:19,940
Not to forgive your sins

838
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:22,020
But to rationalize them

839
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,280
To justify your sins

840
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:28,320
Rather than forgiveness, he offers something far more powerful

841
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,640
An excuse

842
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,260
A divine

843
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:33,180
All-inclusive excuse

844
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:36,400
Which allows the bearer to free himself from the grip of temptation

845
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,060
By overindulging in it

846
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,820
Until it releases him

847
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:43,100
The true seeker must give himself up to temptation

848
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,100
Or he will never conquer it

849
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,400
As Bob says

850
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,620
Too much is always better than not enough

851
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,640
The sad, weakly self-denial preached by the New Age movement

852
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,420
Is pure conspiracy pablo

853
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:06,660
The true son or daughter of Bob knows that our universe is no laid-back, home-chanting cosmos

854
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:10,140
But an active, tumultuous, squirting universe

855
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:14,500
Bent on rampant reproduction and easy grins

856
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,900
The false cults may try to teach personal transformation

857
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,020
Psychic development

858
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:22,880
Human potential

859
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:26,280
But Bob goes straight for the glands

860
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,540
And seeks to amplify the self

861
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:32,360
To bloat the abnormality potential of his pupils

862
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:37,400
Only through excess can one contact the lower self

863
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,580
Where the real decisions are made

864
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:42,460
Don't just eat a hamburger

865
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,900
Eat the hell out of it

866
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,760
The advanced initiate

867
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,280
Once freed from conspiracy programming

868
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,460
As well as the worldly goods that had enslaved him

869
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:56,660
Makes his pilgrimage to Dobbs Town

870
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,520
The church's fabulous home

871
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:01,940
And the fabulous walled encampment deep in the jungles of Malaysia

872
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:07,560
There, the initiate's third nostril is surgically opened by psychic surgeons

873
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:13,240
Allowing him or her to whiff-read the psychic stench of those around him

874
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:19,260
He masters the mystic sciences of schizophreniatrics and memory editing

875
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:23,020
Creating a clean slate on which Bob may write

876
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,260
The art of excremeditation is taught

877
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:30,380
Whereby the mind is voided upon the great throne of relief

878
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:39,240
What is it that truly sets Bob apart from other would-be holy men and self-appointed gurus?

879
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,540
Everything

880
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:43,940
For Bob has always existed

881
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:46,900
There have always been Bobs

882
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:50,400
Every epoch of man's history has had its Bob

883
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,500
Most were what we would call good Bobs

884
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,820
Others, well, we needn't dwell on that

885
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:05,020
The traveling salesman jokes of mythology are based on his early exploits

886
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,380
So many ask, is Bob God?

887
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:13,820
The slack master himself vehemently denies that he is the Messiah

888
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:18,140
His mission is merely to show us how to live with our sins

889
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:19,740
And who better?

890
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,000
For Bob admits that he's a sinner

891
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,480
In fact, he practically embodies all the facts

892
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,820
And the failings of mortal men

893
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,080
Bob is merely the foremost of what he calls

894
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,940
Short-duration personal saviors

895
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,940
Or, Shorderper-savs

896
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:39,260
It is foolish and cowardly to cling to any one personal savior

897
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:43,360
The hectic pace of modern life demands disposable saviors

898
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,300
Specific ones suited to the moment at hand

899
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:49,800
A sort of while-you-wait, do-it-yourself religion

900
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,300
And don't let the fact that Bob is a white man fool you

901
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,980
His church truly spans the globe

902
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:00,800
And embraces all races, creeds, and several sexes

903
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,000
Some undiscovered

904
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,680
The subgenius race is the master race

905
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,400
Because it comes in all colors

906
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,060
Besides his own exaggerated human nature

907
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:15,600
And the powers granted by Jehovah One

908
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:20,400
Bob also benefits from being the chosen broker on Earth

909
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,460
For superior beings from the furthest reaches of none

910
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:29,200
And for the so-called men from Planet X

911
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,020
Or, X-ists

912
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:33,760
For they're nothing like men

913
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:38,060
Bob has a covenant with these angelic beings

914
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:39,920
A cosmic contract

915
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,440
A deal

916
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:45,740
On July 5th, 1998, 7 AM

917
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:49,480
The X-ists shall make a mass landing on this planet

918
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:53,980
The children of Bob shall be rewarded at this foretold rupture

919
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:55,900
This day of judgment

920
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,880
All those who paid their church dues

921
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,080
Will be lifted up in power and glory

922
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,600
To gain new homes and bodies

923
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:06,380
Aboard the pleasure saucers of the sex goddesses

924
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:10,380
All the while watching the hapless pinks

925
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:14,120
Bleat and wail in the death throes of their world

926
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:20,560
And we faithful shall be transfigured into new enlightened beings

927
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,960
Superior mutants

928
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,280
Called Overmen and Uberwomen

929
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,660
Who will start a new Jerusalem

930
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:31,180
In the promised land of Dimension X

931
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:32,340
Asgard

932
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:34,460
The Zone of Eternal Slack

933
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:38,400
And Cytospasmic Ooze-squirt

934
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,840
But what is the commodity with which Bob will bargain for the spite?

935
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,920
Some claim it is the souls of his followers

936
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:52,420
The true subgenius does not question Bob's wisdom in such matters

937
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,580
We have only our simple faith that heaven will be ours if only we believe

938
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:02,220
Ironically, his mission will not be to sell the earth

939
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:04,820
But to prevent earth being sold

940
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:08,720
And transformed into a kind of Stuckys in space

941
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:14,240
But this plan will succeed only if conditions are just right at the appointed time

942
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:20,500
Otherwise, dark forces of antiquity will be awakened from their slumber of aeons

943
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,280
And rise again from Atlantis

944
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,200
To rule our world in their sizeless grip

945
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,340
These primordial elementals

946
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:32,320
The Elder Gods

947
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:36,200
Have countless demonic and interplanetary minions

948
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,000
Carrying out their unholy schemes

949
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,720
Such entities of legend and nightmare

950
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,840
As the dreaded Nigi

951
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:48,780
And Gbrogfran the Unpronounceable

952
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:54,860
Indeed, they even control Bob's own evil twin brother

953
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:58,120
Dick Dobbs the Unclean

954
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:04,000
With all his powers, couldn't Dobbs really be defeated by these beings?

955
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,980
But you must not underestimate the conspiracy

956
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:14,740
Its weapons are so insidious that even the human conspiracy leaders are unaware of them

957
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:18,760
The fact that the conspiracy itself is ignorant that it is

958
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:22,560
A conspiracy gives it such control over our minds

959
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,760
That the very thought becomes unthinkable

960
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:28,720
That's right dear friends

961
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:36,400
And it'll be unhearable too if the appeals over the next year or two or three don't work out

962
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:41,320
And this station gets beat out by the conspiracy

963
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:46,720
Well, Ron Lindsey called a little while ago and said that he was going to be about ten minutes late

964
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:48,500
By the way

965
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:53,020
Dear friends, you're listening to the Hour of Slack radio ministry

966
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:56,980
The radio arm of the church of the subgenius

967
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:03,440
Here on KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas

968
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:15,400
Now, so I've got about ten more minutes to expel the word of Bob out of the pores of all the faithful

969
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,140
And into your ears

970
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:18,760
Now what you've been hearing is that Bob's the only one who's ever been in the church

971
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:25,680
And what you've been hearing was, as I said before, a rough cut of the soundtrack of the subgenius video

972
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,540
Minus the devival scenes

973
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:36,700
And actually, the video itself is really narrated by Hal Robbins from San Francisco

974
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,360
Who's about to sing for you

975
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:48,300
But in the process of putting the thing together, we recorded that extra narration for the radio

976
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:52,040
But in the meantime, friends, let's get off of these words

977
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:57,520
And hear this great old spiritual, this subgenius spiritual

978
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,720
I'm sure many of you have heard this one before

979
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,640
From Dr. Hal

980
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,480
He's Bob

981
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:09,820
Bob don't ever change

982
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:11,960
He's Bob

983
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,520
Always will be Bob

984
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:19,940
His face is the one big assembly

985
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:23,720
Of dots that shine in the dark

986
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:27,080
His grin is the one that looks friendly

987
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:30,460
But so does the grin of a shark

988
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:32,080
He's Bob

989
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:36,020
Bob don't ever change

990
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:38,080
He's Bob

991
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:42,060
Always will be Bob

992
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:45,520
His hair is the one with the highlight

993
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,480
That shines on the pompadour

994
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,080
That glimmers and gleams in the twilight

995
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:55,240
It's clear he knows what it's for

996
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,080
He's Bob

997
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:00,960
Bob don't ever change

998
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,960
He's Bob

999
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:06,980
Always will be Bob

1000
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,480
His pipe is the one with the dottle

1001
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,660
That rains on the roofs like fire

1002
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:17,220
His neck is the one with the wattle

1003
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:20,100
In flaming folks' desire

1004
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,060
He's Bob

1005
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:25,740
Bob don't ever change

1006
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:27,740
He's Bob

1007
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:31,620
Always will be Bob

1008
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,460
Yes, thank you, Dr. Hal

1009
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:38,320
That was lovely, that was just beautiful

1010
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:41,340
Oh, and friends, once again, that mighty P.O. box

1011
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:43,440
To which you may write for information

1012
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,500
About the Church of the Subgenius

1013
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:50,320
And, you know, you ain't no telling

1014
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,440
What kind of things you get from the Church

1015
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,380
Once you have that information

1016
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:56,220
In your sweaty palm

1017
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:58,380
Your hairy, hairy palm

1018
01:00:58,380 --> 01:00:59,180
Praise Bob

1019
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:00,960
And that P.O. box is

1020
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:05,740
P.O. box 140306

1021
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:12,360
Dallas, Texas 75214

1022
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,640
Help me, somebody

1023
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:19,960
Once again, that's P.O. box 140306

1024
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:25,500
Dallas, Texas 75214

1025
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,740
Pinker, my Bob, than thee

1026
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:33,840
Pinker than thee

1027
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:39,240
Though pink boys are everywhere

1028
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:43,400
Pinker than me

1029
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:48,460
Pinker, my Bob, than thee

1030
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,480
Pinker, my Bob, than thee

1031
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:58,800
Pinker, my Bob, than thee

1032
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:02,000
Pinker than thee

1033
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:02,720
And so on

1034
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:07,060
Yes, my baby knows

1035
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:12,040
P.O. box 140306

1036
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,740
Bob, in fact, is sex

1037
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:17,240
And all that comes in sex

1038
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,320
That is the very inness

1039
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:21,640
And surroundingness of the union

1040
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,980
Of both the enum and the uni

1041
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:26,280
And not just hetero sex

1042
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,920
All sex

1043
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,820
Bob does not choose to phonulate

1044
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:35,780
Bob has the tune of one time

1045
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:37,520
Has to phonicate

1046
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,180
And not just with women

1047
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:40,580
Not just with men

1048
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:42,220
With animals, with plants

1049
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:44,620
From the faithful oak tree in his backyard

1050
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:48,340
To the mighty wheels of the brining deep

1051
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:51,160
As the fairy earth it says

1052
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:52,980
That was fun

1053
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:54,940
Doctor!

1054
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,100
No, please, doctor, I beg you

1055
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:57,700
Does this hurt?

1056
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:58,740
Does this hurt?

1057
01:02:58,960 --> 01:02:59,120
No!

1058
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,780
Doctor, please

1059
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:04,080
No, wait, can you wait?

1060
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,660
It is a time of flagrant immorality

1061
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:10,180
A time when the old standards have crumbled

1062
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:12,640
As if hit by history's greatest tidal wave

1063
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:15,520
Of filth and perversion and sexual promiscuity

1064
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,420
Undreamed of even five years ago

1065
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:21,880
America's theater marquees

1066
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:24,700
Screen every kind of degeneracy known to man

1067
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:27,180
From witchcraft and occultism

1068
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:29,500
To devil worship and necrophilia

1069
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:33,020
