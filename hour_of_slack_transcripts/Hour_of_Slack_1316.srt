1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,920
Tonight, for your listening pleasure, the lovely Swinkle Sisters, Jim Morrisberry and his band of renown, and also the Tumbling Jakes.

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,540
So get ready, and get ready, because tonight's going to be a night you're not going to quickly forget.

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:23,960
No matter how you may try, it will be rerun again and again in your nightmares.

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,800
The show that will never die.

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,160
The Undying Show.

6
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,020
Afraid of fire.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,320
Okay, we can now start another show.

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,560
It is done, and so, and so it can begin again.

9
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,060
Flying saucer.

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,220
Flying saucers.

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:47,980
Flying saucers.

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,520
Now, am I crazy?

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,140
Yeah, something like that.

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,540
So you saw some sort of flying saucer, is that the deal?

15
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,760
Are you crazy?

16
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,140
You say you saw some sort of flying saucer.

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,320
Some sort of monster.

18
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,460
The saucer.

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,120
Are you crazy?

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,100
Flying saucer.

21
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,100
Flying saucer.

22
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,000
Flying saucer.

23
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,900
I thought I was going crazy.

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,700
What are you, some kind of...

25
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,000
Okay.

26
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:08,400
Okay.

27
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,020
There was a flying sausage, actually.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,340
Dying sausage, I thought.

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,420
You were rather sauced at the time.

30
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,380
At a high rate of speed.

31
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:26,160
And what was once the hour of slack, slowly, gradually mutated into a radio synesthesia.

32
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,960
Which is still...

33
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,360
Full of slack and slackers.

34
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,100
Praise the Lord.

35
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,260
These times are not going to get any better.

36
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,720
This show is not going to get any better, my friend.

37
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,900
Is it still being simultaneously cast to the northern hemisphere?

38
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,660
At the speed of light.

39
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:48,140
I mean, out there to California, the big relay post in the ground with the pictures of Reagan on the bottom.

40
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,480
Well, I think through the wonder of podcasts, they could...

41
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,320
Couldn't they?

42
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,660
Couldn't they get it out there in California?

43
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:06,440
Well, the only pods in California I know about are the ones that, like, people that look like you come out of and stuff after they've made you go to sleep.

44
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,620
Like me?

45
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,820
Like me?

46
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,380
Yeah, like you.

47
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,760
No, like...

48
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,160
Yeah.

49
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:18,100
Because they can duplicate these human specimens.

50
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,160
You know, we have to figure out who's fake and who's real.

51
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,820
And they do figure that out as you try to go up the ramp of the saucer.

52
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,140
And presto, there's a new person.

53
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,020
There are a lot of inauthentic, fake subs who are going to try to get aboard.

54
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,100
It's really tedious and irritating to have to deal with these people.

55
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,160
When there's this many pod clones, I just can't sleep at night.

56
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,400
You once were telling me about Planet X, Dr. Morbund.

57
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,400
Evil on Planet X is more than you could think of.

58
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,000
Evil stocks up.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,220
Every night and day, they wait to see the evil they go through.

60
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,600
Do they come down in flying saucers?

61
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,160
Flying saucers are bearing on us.

62
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,060
We don't know what to do.

63
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,180
We're here all alone.

64
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,240
The planets are fading.

65
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,740
The blood is running.

66
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,500
And the lights were fading.

67
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,100
And they stalked us one by one.

68
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,740
This is the Man in Black.

69
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,980
Here for the Roma Wine Company of Fresno.

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,820
Fresno, California.

71
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,580
Good evening.

72
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,340
This is Cleveland.

73
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,940
And the program is Synesthesia.

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,160
I'm your host, Dr. Sinister.

75
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:41,700
And it is my great honor and pleasure to have some really fun people here in the studio with me tonight.

76
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,520
Reverend Stang, thank you for sticking around.

77
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,600
And Princess We Are Do.

78
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,440
And Dr. Holland Owl will be on the air momentarily here.

79
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,880
And Lonesome Cowboy Dave is on the line with us as well.

80
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,080
Thank you for holding, Dave.

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,200
I'm wonderful right now enjoying myself.

82
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,180
Hey, you know, it's...

83
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,460
Enjoy yourself.

84
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,680
That last hour of slack was the easiest one I have ever done.

85
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,560
Well, it really zipped by, didn't it?

86
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:17,060
I only had to say about four or five words, and even those were probably not necessary.

87
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,700
When you've got Hal and Dave on hand.

88
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,000
It was succinct.

89
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:19,900
Yeah.

90
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,740
And perfect.

91
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,780
Well, we were channeling the great former cultural...

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,140
Memes of the old world.

93
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,300
For the last time, perhaps.

94
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:31,820
Yeah.

95
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,160
I hope.

96
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,760
I would pray, except I'm afraid who'd be listening.

97
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,960
Besides the listeners.

98
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,840
I mean, they're bad enough.

99
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,340
We're better in this time.

100
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,820
I'm afraid that's all you will find is listeners as you pray because of the vast emptiness we pray to.

101
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,460
It does...

102
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,660
It, with a big capital I, does not exist, perhaps.

103
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,180
Maybe.

104
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:50,920
I don't know.

105
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,060
You're wasting all your time praying to something that doesn't exist?

106
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,100
I don't pray.

107
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,980
Well, then you're not wasting...

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,900
I'm not wasting your time on you.

109
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,360
No, I demand of the cosmos, and I'm denied.

110
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:01,660
Hmm.

111
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,640
Well, I guess it doesn't hurt to ask.

112
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:16,460
Besides, it might take the big ol' cosmos a long time to answer your request because there's so much inertia about getting into magnum motion to deal with your case on an individual basis.

113
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,040
Plus, even assuming your voice could travel at the speed of light through space, which, of course, it can't.

114
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,940
Well, unless you've got, like, the right kind of transmitter.

115
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,840
Yeah, like we do.

116
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,020
Yeah, we got that here.

117
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,420
Right now.

118
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,660
Most of us don't have access to that kind of transmitter, you know?

119
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,920
It's like, you know, in space, no one can hear your prayers.

120
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,000
The only transmissions going on around here are disease.

121
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,180
Uh-oh.

122
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:42,080
We have been intercepting your transmissions and have learned your language, Daddy-O.

123
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,600
And now for a word from our sponsor.

124
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,020
See, it's all atomic testing.

125
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,420
This episode is brought to you by Children's Chewable Lithium.

126
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,180
That's right, Children's Chewable Lithium.

127
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,800
Look for it in the cool blue box featuring Barry the Bipolar Bear.

128
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,220
He is making your abler by keeping your mood stabler.

129
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,540
That was pretty.

130
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,940
We got Governor Rockner on the line.

131
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,360
Is this you?

132
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,180
Well, good evening, Dr. Howell.

133
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:07,620
Good evening.

134
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,040
Oh, hello there, Governor Rockner.

135
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,120
I've been staying in Princess Mary.

136
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,160
How is sports land?

137
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,840
Ah, it is interesting right now.

138
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,720
Yeah, I know.

139
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,420
I will say this.

140
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,960
The Bard's pleasure saucer is that he is banned from his pleasure saucer.

141
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,040
No, wait a minute.

142
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,960
Let's not get off into some little...

143
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,000
Little minor trivial...

144
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,120
All that trash.

145
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,440
No, last night, last night I actually...

146
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,340
Boys in the band.

147
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,800
Last night I actually saw a guy who has been banned from X-Day before.

148
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,700
He was...

149
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,120
Careening down the street in a drunken stupor.

150
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,000
He was tearing up the dance floor at our WCSB anniversary party.

151
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,200
You mean he wasn't rolling in the gutter in unspeakable filth?

152
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,520
I think I never knew you'd be talking about...

153
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,520
Depends on your definition of rolling.

154
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,980
Depends on your definition of gutter.

155
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,220
It depends on your definition of unspeakable filth.

156
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,180
This is the guy with the walking light show, right?

157
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,480
Wasn't he degraded below the lowest definition of a human?

158
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,080
Were you there?

159
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,140
No, but I didn't think...

160
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,920
I'm trying to think.

161
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,980
The only person who would have been...

162
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,760
Been at that party who is on the banned list, besides the bands.

163
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,660
He literally had...

164
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,180
Great bands.

165
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,880
Who are you defecating on right now?

166
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,000
You should explain to the listeners.

167
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,440
No, we don't want to get into all that.

168
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,440
We're not defecating on anyone.

169
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,920
We're elevating ourselves.

170
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,200
It's not about the exclusion.

171
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,500
It's about inclusion for all.

172
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,040
No actual persons are involved here.

173
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,800
Every subgenius will be lifted up.

174
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,500
That's right.

175
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,260
But some will have their own saucers and others will...

176
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:24,800
It's true.

177
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,300
False.

178
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,840
False.

179
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,960
Fake subgenius.

180
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,860
Subgeniuses may explode in midair like little bombs.

181
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,160
I mean, some saucers might be, you know, hundreds of miles in diameter.

182
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,320
Oh, that's a given.

183
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,100
And some other saucers might be hundreds of times larger than that.

184
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:47,100
My escape planet will contain upon it Wisteria, the campground.

185
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:52,280
And also Brushwood, the campground, however, will only keep the staff of Wisteria.

186
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:52,580
They can be made contiguous.

187
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,820
The staff of Brushwood will remain in a crater.

188
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,460
Left behind for...

189
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,940
Well, actually, come to think of it, I guess some of those folks were safe.

190
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,880
No, except for Frank and Darlene Barney.

191
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,460
Except for the original Barneys.

192
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,020
What about Barney Frank?

193
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,800
Not the friendly one that the children enjoy.

194
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,660
Barney Frank.

195
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,020
Yes, Reverend Barney Frank will be there.

196
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,240
Reverend Obama, believe it or not, has had his membership paid for.

197
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:17,980
The president?

198
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,600
Yes.

199
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,120
Why?

200
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:26,720
Don't ask me, but Reverend Chain Smoker of Australia always buys...

201
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:31,260
A membership for American presidents, and also he bought one for Sarah Palin.

202
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,300
Ah, okay, so as long as he bought one for, like, every president...

203
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,840
He bought one for Bush, he bought one for Palin, he bought one for the previous Bush.

204
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,780
So it's kind of like a blackmailing chip.

205
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,600
Reverend Chain Smoker will be at Exeter.

206
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:49,480
Just don't let the GOP Congress find out that Obama is a member, or we'll never hear the end of it.

207
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,660
But let me put it this way.

208
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,640
I accepted the payment.

209
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,900
I personally ordained Barry in my...

210
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:07,200
But I didn't really send the package to the White House, because I've already been through that with the Secret Service back in 1982 or something.

211
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,400
Yes, we don't care to repeat these old pleasures.

212
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:24,440
The membership pack does, in fact, if you recall, come with a drawing by Hellswami satellite weavers of Bob, Elvis, Buddha, and the Fighting Jesus, all attacking a Hydra,

213
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,960
one of whose arms is labeled...

214
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,500
Reagan or any president.

215
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,420
And that was the drawing that brought the Secret Service to my door in Dallas.

216
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,620
That was the drawing?

217
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,380
That was the drawing.

218
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,640
They said, that's in pretty bad taste.

219
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,220
We can't tell you not to do it anymore, but we hope you don't.

220
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:47,540
And the next week, People magazine reprinted that drawing in a glowing review of Book of the Subgenius.

221
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,700
And that's a true story.

222
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,640
Really?

223
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,220
Yes.

224
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:51,540
That's quite cool.

225
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:56,920
It's intimating that perhaps our media and our government might be sharing the same...

226
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,180
Same toilet?

227
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:05,240
No, we're saying that there are moles who have burrowed within who managed to save us from the consequences of our deepest folly.

228
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,780
Yeah, unfortunately, People magazine fired that mole, I'm sure.

229
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,980
Well, he had to take it on.

230
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,580
You know, like us, we destroy slack for ourselves just so we can bring slack to the slackless.

231
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,820
It's like show host syndrome.

232
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,440
Yes, you know we do.

233
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,340
We don't intentionally do it, but we have to do it to continue our ministry.

234
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,820
However, time is coming.

235
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:32,140
Shortly, when we can settle back, relax, and not worry about anybody else's slack.

236
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,040
Put those pampered feet up on the divan and smoke a pipe for a while.

237
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,800
Well, and you don't know what an ex-guy with long legs...

238
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,180
I can't believe how much porn there is on the screen right now.

239
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:42,960
Porn?

240
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,920
I need to look at the browser history here to see...

241
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,680
What's her phone number?

242
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,360
...some time here.

243
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,360
Mama, buy me debt.

244
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,800
I think I know exactly who's responsible for this.

245
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,660
That's subgenius.com.

246
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,180
We are going to be horribly...

247
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,580
Actually, you know what?

248
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,500
My workplace...

249
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,840
Dot com?

250
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,140
At the place where I work...

251
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:00,860
Dot com.

252
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,260
...the subgenius website is actually blocked.

253
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,200
Oh, yeah.

254
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:04,960
By whom?

255
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,840
Oh, it's blocked in a number of hotel chains.

256
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,780
It's a particular tentacle of the conspiracy.

257
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,720
I had a panicky, panicky day at the Grand Canyon thinking that...

258
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,900
At the Grand Canyon.

259
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:23,020
...thinking that my business had been taken down because when I got up that morning in the hotel to check things, subgenius.com was gone.

260
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,840
But isn't that a periodic fluctuation of the internet?

261
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,240
No, it's not.

262
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,920
It's that some businesses have less...

263
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,980
And the computer has actually crashed, apparently.

264
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,540
That's what you get for...

265
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,060
...subgenius.com trouble.

266
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:38,220
You were banned.

267
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,720
You were banned on not Motel 5 or whatever.

268
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,700
We can't mention that.

269
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,000
I know exactly who did this.

270
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,500
I know that there's somebody who's...

271
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,860
I'm not going to say it.

272
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,620
I'm not going to say it.

273
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,300
Well, you know...

274
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,300
Why give them any publicity?

275
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,060
I'm not going to say it.

276
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,420
Moles will be moles and foes will be moles.

277
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:52,780
Okay, come on.

278
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,180
Let's face it.

279
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,080
I've looked at the browser history when I see that...

280
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,820
Like, I type in...

281
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,900
I try to type in a URL.

282
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,860
And something really nasty pops up in the address bar as the auto-fill-in.

283
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,520
Which, of course, means I need to look at the browser history...

284
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,880
You know Bob has been in the studio.

285
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,440
J.R. Bob Dobbs just finished doing a show.

286
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,480
Do I need to get a sanitary wipe and wipe this chair down?

287
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,160
Oh, that's terrible.

288
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,180
You must do that.

289
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,480
Just before I left on my recent trip to Petrolia,

290
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,640
I noticed that on the internet they'd taken down many of Puzzling Evidence's videos

291
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,740
because of a complaint.

292
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,440
And they took down your commercial for the Church of the Subgenius.

293
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:24,640
What?

294
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,220
The short one.

295
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,960
Because it's supposedly of a...

296
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,460
Complaint.

297
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:27,860
What?

298
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,160
All this stuff was disappearing.

299
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,560
When I came back from my three-day trip, it had all been restored.

300
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,040
So this is like an effort that is not only continuous,

301
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,660
it's like peppery.

302
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,660
Kind of like a destabilizing...

303
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,900
Paul pointed it out to me.

304
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,360
What could I do about it?

305
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,300
I was leaving on a trip.

306
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,560
We have enemies out there who are so jealous of our slack

307
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,580
and the fact that J.R. Bob Dobbs himself has blessed us.

308
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,040
I know, it's true.

309
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,080
And what can we do?

310
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,680
We have to stand here with our heads bowed humbly,

311
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,640
naked unto the world.

312
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:11,220
But it doesn't mean that we have to get into this pissy internet type of flame war stuff.

313
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,040
Let's suspend all talk of who's banned and all this crap.

314
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,020
We do have one more caller on the line here who has not been banned yet.

315
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,200
But for those of you out there...

316
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,780
Oh, is R.C. is back?

317
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,380
Still young.

318
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:22,960
No.

319
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,360
An R.C. Coa?

320
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,740
I figure he's either dead, in jail, married,

321
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,900
or actually got a job.

322
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,840
This is me, Bernard Braithwaite.

323
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,180
St. Bernard, haven't heard from you in a couple of weeks.

324
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,220
Move on over.

325
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:33,960
Welcome to the program.

326
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,340
Royal Crown Cola.

327
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,200
It's a mad, mad, mad, mad cola.

328
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,720
Can do point fingers.

329
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,740
R.C., the one with the mad, mad taste.

330
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,040
And they do it constantly.

331
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,240
So, it's become a problem.

332
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,480
But what a night I picked to listen.

333
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,920
You picked a night to listen?

334
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,720
You can pick any night to listen.

335
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:54,580
Sir, listen along.

336
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,280
Whoa.

337
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,960
Oh, that one doesn't...

338
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,740
That one doesn't work very well.

339
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,220
Well, you know...

340
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:00,700
Here's the card.

341
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,460
My recent show, I...

342
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,040
I almost knocked everything over.

343
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,900
Had a scientific discussion going,

344
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,100
which I thought was so interesting,

345
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,420
maybe we could go...

346
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,480
You see, it's been asked...

347
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,200
All this talk about how the exists are going to fry Earth and so on,

348
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,260
and some people have sneeringly said,

349
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,620
where are they going to get the energy to do that, you know?

350
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,200
And how about these skeletonizer rays that they fire

351
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,100
that turn you into a skeleton, you know?

352
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,920
Well, that's like a...

353
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,600
How did God just rear back and pass a miracle

354
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,240
and order a whole mess of permanent?

355
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,420
Well, he had the Big Bang to work on.

356
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,200
But that's all over and done with now.

357
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,120
Where do they get the energy?

358
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,020
They get the energy from the pain of the pinks and humans.

359
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,300
But they get it from unlocking the subatomic world.

360
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,060
Right.

361
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,680
They tap the ether, which our machines cannot yet...

362
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,800
The model is the Martian beams in the War of the Worlds,

363
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,080
if you remember what Doctor...

364
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,080


365
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,360
Beams?

366
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,560
Beams.

367
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,280
The skeletonizing ray that Dr. Clayton Forrester explains in that movie.

368
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,000
He says that the mesons are directly affected.

369
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,800
But, of course, that's 50-year-old physics,

370
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,640
and today we know of gluons,

371
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,300
which, when they come unglued,

372
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,300
cause a general to disappear,

373
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,720
leaving a glowing skeleton, which itself disappears.

374
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,020
But the thing about this is that I'm trying to say...

375
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,680
They simply wink out of existence, so...

376
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,040
No, you don't...

377
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,240
They don't wink out of existence.

378
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,160
To leave existence releases an enormous amount of energy.

379
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,380
The amount of energy in atomic bombs is actually a very small amount.

380
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,160
A large general wearing a helmet and a sidearm and a suit

381
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,980
and having eaten a large meal, when discorporating,

382
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,760
releases more energy than all of the atomic bombs

383
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,120
ever created or exploded on Earth at the same time.

384
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,540
And smells just like bacon.

385
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,920
And that was the general.

386
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:52,900
That was one guy.

387
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,020
And the power of the explosion.

388
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:54,720
But then...

389
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,520
But then...

390
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,380
They start blasting trucks and tanks and so on.

391
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,340
This would be enough to blow the side out of our planet

392
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,380
with these energy releases.

393
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,340
And that is how the Exists will accomplish it.

394
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,960
Not as anything more than a byproduct

395
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,100
of the rays that they use to skeletonize the non-subgeniuses.

396
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,460
By scouring the ether,

397
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,320
dressed up as a Martian general...

398
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,080
Or a big-eyed beam from Venus.

399
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,980
Big-eyed beam?

400
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,980
I've been busy sniffing the ether.

401
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,040
There's really no charm involved.

402
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,720
Or a Masonic gluon.

403
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,640
And I've been sniffing the gluons too, yeah.

404
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,640
Well, then how...

405
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,980
Looks like a big-eyed gluon.

406
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,020
But sniffing gluons?

407
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,380
Well, I don't knock it if you haven't tried it.

408
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,620
Beat sniffing Masons.

409
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,820
That's right. Especially Masons.

410
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,820
Marsha Mason.

411
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,700
I actually had to walk home today and I had to kind of

412
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,200
relieve myself on a Masonic lodge on the way home.

413
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,460
Could you not do it when you got home, you disgusting fellow?

414
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:55,800
Could you not do it when you got home, you disgusting fellow?

415
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,380
Didn't you have the energy stored within your body

416
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,440
that you could have kind of imploded yourself home

417
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,300
and done your business as you should have?

418
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,160
Why wait for the first Masonic lodge you see?

419
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,960
Your urinate for crying out loud.

420
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,240
Isn't this what they say? TMI?

421
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,540
Too much information?

422
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,960
Or does that stand for Three Mile Island?

423
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:16,860
Anyway...

424
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,040
Down there uncontrollably...

425
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,760
Or Fukushima.

426
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,780
And the horse that rode in there.

427
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,200
Right, right.

428
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,860
The colors are feuding.

429
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,380
We're all thinking the same thing at the same time

430
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,200
and we're connected in time and space by those same gluons

431
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,820
we use as Masonic particles.

432
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,100
And with the Masonic handshake which keeps them attached.

433
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,620
Yeah, but if you've got like seven heads or like seven tentacles...

434
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,160
You know what's really weird?

435
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,800
In the last couple of months I've been introduced to like

436
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,580
two or three people who gave me the secret Masonic handshake

437
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,580
when greeting me.

438
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,140
They're tapping you.

439
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,520
They're tapping you on the shoulder.

440
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,200
I couldn't believe it.

441
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,560
It's like, why? What the hell?

442
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,420
And I called them out on it.

443
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:55,940
I said it out loud.

444
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,560
Did you just give me the secret handshake?

445
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,620
It's a very subtle thing.

446
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,840
Those of you who know what it is...

447
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:00,840


448
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,280
Yeah, exactly.

449
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,560
The average onlooker is not going to notice it.

450
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:03,880
But...

451
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,720
Did you just give me the secret Masonic handshake?

452
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,540
Or are you trying to pick me up in the bus station?

453
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,520
That's the one where the middle finger tickles your palm.

454
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:18,960
The forefinger and the middle finger tap the wrist.

455
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:19,620
Oh.

456
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,540
You're shaking hands, but your forefinger and middle finger

457
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,800
will squeeze like the wrist, like where your pulse is.

458
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,220
You're going to die for announcing that on the radio, won't you?

459
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,540
But you know how I read that? I read it in a book.

460
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,300
It's like a handshake, but one step beyond.

461
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,800
Was it the book by Jay Kinney on the Masons that just came out?

462
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,320
No, no. This is a book that came out like 30 years ago

463
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,540
called Big Secrets by William Poundstead.

464
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,860
I thought Bozo's on this Bus was written by some sort of

465
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:48,200
Masonic scribe guy as a thing he was supposed to do

466
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,500
to get the donuts on time.

467
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:50,760
Donuts?

468
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,340
They had a class and they said, well, what do Masons eat?

469
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,100
What's their favorite food?

470
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,260
And he produced donuts and coffee.

471
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,440
And I started crying because I'd been there for half an hour

472
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,580
and all I said to him was, there was one guy with a pointy hat,

473
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,340
and he said, you're going to have to learn not to laugh at stuff like this

474
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,400
or else then we're going to... I don't know what we'll do.

475
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,380
Save your humor for the humorous.

476
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,660
I'm the humor for the humorless.

477
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,480
Believe it. We're all on the edge of a precipice

478
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,300
that we're not going to be able to climb back from.

479
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,700
There's a lot of tension winding up, but after X-Day,

480
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:25,240
that huge hee-haw of a laugh will escape and be heard all over the universe.

481
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,860
Well, I think Bob had perfectly timed Fukushima

482
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,100
to the time of X-Day and he knew it and we didn't

483
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,140
because we didn't go back successfully to kill him

484
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,180
at the previous moment, at which time he would have not.

485
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,660
And never mind. You know what I'm saying?

486
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,460
I just read today that there's a nuclear plant in Nebraska...

487
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,020
Note you're saying.

488
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,180
...who's, uh, they had like 2,000-foot-high concrete barriers

489
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,180
or something around it.

490
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,960
And with all the flooding along the Missouri River...

491
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,400
That's pretty tall.

492
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,780
Yeah, it didn't make sense.

493
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,180
I heard like 2,000-foot-something.

494
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:53,620
I'm like, what?

495
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,940
That's like half a mile almost.

496
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,120
Yeah, that's a real tall nuclear plant.

497
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,840
So that couldn't possibly be right,

498
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,060
but I saw that some nuclear power plant in Nebraska

499
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,180
is getting flooded now.

500
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:04,820
Yes.

501
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,160
Who knows what could come after that?

502
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,480
Why can't we have thorium-based nuclear power plants

503
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,260
in this country, which are much safer than, you know,

504
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,560
these deadly uranium and plutonium?

505
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,000
Well, I'm afraid there's just not time.

506
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,260
There's not time to build them, Rocknar.

507
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,220
...something safer than all that.

508
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,860
Is there an odinium on the periodic table?

509
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,500
I don't think so.

510
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,840
Did you notice that they...

511
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,920
There's a thorium, but not an odinium.

512
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,200
...they recently added two new elements to the periodic table

513
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,200
just within the last month.

514
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,340
Two new elements have been created.

515
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,760
Or an onanium.

516
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,400
Well, onanium.

517
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,180
See, that's...

518
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:36,600
Not conium.

519
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,800
Onanium from cannobitium.

520
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,640
And what about dobsium?

521
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,580
Yeah, dobsium-537.

522
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,160
That's one of the most radioactive elements there is and isn't.

523
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,220
But it only exists for a flash.

524
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,460
A flash that lasts quite a few million years

525
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,940
and an after-flash, unfortunately.

526
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,500
Yes, it's quite true.

527
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,860
But the actual moment of the burst,

528
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,520
which could be likened to the Big Bang itself,

529
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,240
is a micropulse of cosmic time.

530
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,900
But it's just enough time to get arrested for flashing.

531
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,800
You've got to hit it just right and then get out of the park

532
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,880
before the police arrive.

533
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,500
And, Dr. Howell, you know what a Dyson sphere is, right?

534
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,380
Why, yes.

535
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,600
A theoretical Dyson sphere.

536
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,700
What if you could have a Dyson sphere

537
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,920
that was in the shape of a donut

538
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,940
and instead of the star being inside the sphere,

539
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,420
it would be outside the sphere

540
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,140
but in the ring of the donut?

541
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,040
And the inside ring of the donut

542
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,660
contains the habitable, you know, biodomes.

543
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,360
To me, that just doesn't sound like

544
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,440
the most optimal configuration you could have.

545
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,280
Because it's the wrong shape.

546
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,020
It is convex where it should be concave.

547
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,240
Why do subgeniuses always carry things into...

548
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,920
comparing them to donuts?

549
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,980
Well, it's dollars to donuts

550
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,740
that subgeniuses will always use these simple expressions.

551
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,220
I always thought it was a sexual euphemism

552
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,380
for m-m-my lady's, uh, part, part, pa-pa-pa.

553
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,020
Well, I guess your mind was there before

554
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,740
the Church of the Subgenius ever established its beachhead.

555
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,060
Yeah, Donut Factory.

556
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,280
That used to be semi-insulting, but it meant, yo, bitch.

557
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,200
Donut forsake me, oh, my darlin'.

558
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,640
Is it dumb?

559
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,680
It's because we're all cops, that's all.

560
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,140
That's right. We are the only ones policing this area.

561
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:21,460


562
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,360
I'm sorry, I had a tender moment thinking about it.

563
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,220
Well, then we have to have a Tim Hortons nearby.

564
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,180
Uh, is that...

565
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,140
Are they nearby right now?

566
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:30,720
You can...

567
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,560
There are no Tim Hortons franchises in the Cleveland area that I know of.

568
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,640
Not that I know of either.

569
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,380
I think you gotta go to Columbus or Canada.

570
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,000
That's too far.

571
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,460
I wouldn't want to go into one without knowing where it was.

572
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,920
There's actually talk about a Tim Hortons opening up in Lexington.

573
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,480
Really?

574
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,840
What, no fran- what, no important franchises?

575
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,280
It starts with that, it starts with that, and next thing you know they'll be selling ketchup-flavored potato chips.

576
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,840
Ketchup-slavery patrols?

577
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,760
I'd like some of that.

578
00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:02,740
I remember how saying in the original Arise video that Earth would be turned into one giant Stuckey's.

579
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,480
I'm afraid I have to stand by that statement.

580
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,500
Exactly, I stand by it too.

581
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,180
You're understanding that statement?

582
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,340
It's a Stuckey's for travelers in the cosmos.

583
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,300
Yeah.

584
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:22,460
They have these God Apple abomination crossover stores, which are like, you know, a combination, you know, like BP and Burger King or whatnot.

585
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,820
Most people don't even know what Stuckey's is anymore.

586
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,740
We can't say these commercial names.

587
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,300
Stuckey's was the old Speedway, you might say.

588
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:38,500
Long ago it was a franchise that was on the side of the highway that us oldsters grew up with.

589
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,140
That's right.

590
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,640
It was overpriced crap.

591
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,500
And bad food.

592
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,680
But it was a refuge from the hurtling highway.

593
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,680
I was shocked to see a Stuckey's on our most recent road trip.

594
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,640
An open, functioning Stuckey's.

595
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,440
Not dead, but liveth.

596
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,220
I've heard of them, but I'm too young to remember them actually.

597
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,400
But the thing is, these...

598
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:04,560
One of the items that they sell at Speedway is in the pastry aisle, and it's cheesecake.

599
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:10,700
And its barcode, the UPC barcode, ends in a 13013.

600
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,180
They are Bob's Cheesecakes.

601
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,700
The secret, sacred number of Bob's.

602
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,500
But you have to turn these cheesecakes upside down to get the number correctly.

603
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:25,320
And they are available at any one of the 1100 different Speedways in nine different states in the sky.

604
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,120
Well, would you mind making a run for us? We're here behind the microphones.

605
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:29,880
Really?

606
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,300
We don't want to turn this into an ad for your employer.

607
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,880
But it's... I wasn't out on a limb there.

608
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,740
They attract each other.

609
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,680
I didn't mention the price.

610
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,680
The doctrine is quite clear.

611
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:46,300
Earth will be turned into a cosmic Stuckey's after its present use.

612
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,580
Nothing goes unused.

613
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,780
That's not to say that you can be there and even get a job as a short order cook.

614
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,000
Our Earth will be completely gone.

615
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,440
But it will be a Stuckey's for wanderers in the cosmos.

616
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:05,560
What if it was also a crossover store that had the Kentucky Fried Humans in it?

617
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,420
Those are called the Thing.

618
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,720
Franchise, my friend.

619
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,000
Those crisped humans are called the Thing.

620
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,040
It's like those signs.

621
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,800
There are 38 billion signs that say the Thing.

622
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:15,900
Can you stop it?

623
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,400
But they have different names for it everywhere.

624
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,820
It's a cultural thing.

625
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,820
They're going to market them the way that the consumers like.

626
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,200
The Hunger Cobra.

627
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,100
Strictly from hunger.

628
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,680
I want to sell consumption itself.

629
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,340
Things that the consumptive will like.

630
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,980
Selling consumption itself.

631
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,940
The actual act of consumption.

632
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,380
Make people pay to make people consume.

633
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,320
Make them cough it up.

634
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:44,820
I guess the domain name is already taken over.

635
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,080
Consume.

636
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:51,080
This portion of the show is brought to you by Soylent Green.

637
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,740
Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.

638
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,560
Yeah, it's alright with the sauce.

639
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:04,080
Have you noticed the floors are made of copper and there seems to be a tunnel under the Earth?

640
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,280
A tunnel?

641
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,540
A tunnel under the Earth?

642
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,160
Well, you can't have a tunnel over the Earth.

643
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,580
That's axiomatic.

644
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,240
That's crazy.

645
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,000
Crazy talk.

646
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:13,520
Insane.

647
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,820
That's kind of crazy talk.

648
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:21,660
So it must exist then since the opposite could not exist then the opposite of something that doesn't exist must exist.

649
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,500
Bah.

650
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,860
Tautological paradigm.

651
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,960
There is a tunnel under the Earth and there's copper in my basement.

652
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,900
Or not, on the floor.

653
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,340
Speaking of tautology.

654
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,660
You keep talking like that you'll blow up the universe again.

655
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,260
I'd never believe it.

656
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,120
I've never actually blown up the universe before.

657
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:42,640
I've threatened many times but I would never actually do it on purpose until maybe, oh, I don't know, next week.

658
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:49,680
Well, hasn't there been like evidence that there hasn't been just one big bang but like several?

659
00:26:50,300 --> 00:27:02,960
Well, I can imagine the universe acting like a concertina, wheezing in and out with a bang then an anti-bang and this raucous carnival music is that which entertains the gods.

660
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,380
Right.

661
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:08,140
There was a Futurama that depicted repeated big bang.

662
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:08,400
That's right.

663
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,360
Cartoons know everything.

664
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,140
To the lord it's that's just the backbeat.

665
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,720
Yes.

666
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,240
That's true.

667
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,520
That's true.

668
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,020
Some cartoons.

669
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,540
Taste in music isn't better.

670
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,020
That Lawrence Welk-like polka.

671
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,600
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.

672
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,200
A senile space god.

673
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,940
Well, um, I think that's it for this episode of the Supernatural.

674
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:32,940


675
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,320
I guess that kind of wraps it up.

676
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,520
So maybe we should throw it open to questions from callers about X-Day

677
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,840
and how they plan to spend their last pathetic moments.

678
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:43,860
That's right.

679
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,100
216-6-7-0-VAL-F-E-R-N-E-V-E-S-T-E-S-K-E-S.

680
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:49,760
If you would like to get yourself on the air here, this is Synesthesia.

681
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,500
I'm Dr. Synesthesia.

682
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:55,080
I've got my special guest here tonight, Dr. Holland Owl and Reverend Ivan Stang.

683
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,120
And Princess We Are Doe, Governor Ragnar, and, of course, Wombat.

684
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,820
So join our conversation now in progress.

685
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,000
And Dr. Howell is so cool, he drinks his Ale-8 out of a Klein bottle.

686
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,500
Boy, I haven't seen any Ale-8 for some time.

687
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,160
That's ancient history.

688
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,580
Put it in the other side of the pillow.

689
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,480
Did you drink the wine of the ancient mariner?

690
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,640
Why am I having a sense of deja vu about this conversation?

691
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,820
I just heard the wine of the ancient mariner.

692
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,480
The caller.

693
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,800
Oh, well, the ancient mariner is an albatross around my neck.

694
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,800
When you went to Athens, Ohio,

695
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,920
did you check out the wine of the ancient mariner?

696
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,580
Did you check out the Kroger's?

697
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,240
Or did you just pass by and it's like, oh, it's a Kroger's?

698
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:42,380
Princess We and I carefully inspected the Kroger's in Athens.

699
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,140
But of course.

700
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,320
And not to advertise anybody.

701
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,380
I know what your question is.

702
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,920
Yes, there is a state liquor store inside there, and it is quite well stocked.

703
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,160
Well, I wasn't looking necessarily for liquor, but maybe for Ale-8.

704
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,880
Why would you ask?

705
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,840
Not probably.

706
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,740
You know, I can't say.

707
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,440
He was looking for a Pan Suma.

708
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:02,820
That's in Southern.

709
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,620
That's fairly close to Kentucky.

710
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:08,100
They don't sell Ale-8 in Northeastern Ohio, but you can get Werner's here,

711
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,740
which I understand is more of a Michigan thing.

712
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,480
Yes, Werner's Ginger Ale.

713
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,040
Werner's would used to be also an Ohio thing.

714
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,600
You know, let's see.

715
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,200
Here's the problem.

716
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,380
Rocknor is an Asian.

717
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,240
Yes.

718
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,900
I am a Strapalian.

719
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,640
We all have different certain foods.

720
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,100
Quite true.

721
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,420
Yes, I'm a Limonian.

722
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:29,800
I'm partial to Safeway's Refresh Diet Grapefruit Soda.

723
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,220
Want to welcome one more person to the program here?

724
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,900
Hi, it's Pisces.

725
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,680
Pisces?

726
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,980
I can't believe how long you've been here.

727
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,860
It's Pisces!

728
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:42,060
Thank you for finally, finally calling up after so many years.

729
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,900
Yes, folks, it's the delectable Priestess Pisces.

730
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,680
Yes, indeed.

731
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:52,900
I'm wondering if maybe just possibly this sex goddess could be made out of raspberry gummies.

732
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,480
Made out of it?

733
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,820
If you want her to.

734
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,460
I'm a petroleum additive.

735
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,900
I'm a huge fan of raspberry gummies.

736
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,120
Raspberry gummies and sure wine soda.

737
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:12,660
On the saucers, you will be making sweet love to raspberry gummy soda.

738
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,840
Is it too late to cancel my tour?

739
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,140
Endlessly.

740
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,400
And when you're rough with it, it'll bleed the soda.

741
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,280
Oh, that would be fantastic.

742
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,300
You know, got to get along.

743
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:23,980
Got to get along.

744
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,560
Got to get along.

745
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,800
Pisces, I'm going to save this story and just tell it only to you, but what the hell?

746
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,480
I'll tell it to everybody else on the radio.

747
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,160
Sure.

748
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,640
Oh, no.

749
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,160
Going to betray your confidence, eh?

750
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,620
Why not?

751
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:46,020
I was walking to the grocery store yesterday, and I passed a yard sale, and there was two pairs of spiky high-heeled shoes, and they were selling them for like two bucks each.

752
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,780
I'm like, hmm, black patent and a zebra print.

753
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,720
Oh, cool.

754
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:55,940
Beginning your new career as a cross or a cheerful cross dresser?

755
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,240
Yeah, I was wondering.

756
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,400
Didn't you get best moves one X day at the Bobby Awards?

757
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:14,500
Yeah, the first time I ever saw Rocknard, he was wearing a grease-stained white bathrobe, a pair of tighty-whities, and he was eating a pork chop on a steak.

758
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,880
Now, that's a song title right there.

759
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,240
The first time I met Rocknard, and then in parentheses, he was eating a pork chop, standing on a hot dog, waiting for the bus to arrive.

760
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:30,940
Now, the first time I saw Priestess Pisces, she was wearing only her pants.

761
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:31,620
Very little.

762
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,380
And marker.

763
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,420
Black marker.

764
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,100
Black marker.

765
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,640
And a smile.

766
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,960
I had autographed parts.

767
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,640
I'm bringing my markers of all colors.

768
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,720
Big, prominent parts.

769
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,160
Decorate the parts of those who care to participate.

770
00:31:46,940 --> 00:32:00,880
Anyone who clicks on the events, if you go to subgenius.com and click on the events, the first thing you'll see is a beautiful color painting of Priestess Pisces on X day.

771
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,020
Big, prominent parts.

772
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,020


773
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,020


774
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,020


775
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:07,960
With flaming mountains in the background, saucers overhead, and she's holding the head of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

776
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,920
The still-smoking head, I might add.

777
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:16,460
You know, the great thing about Bob is you can keep killing him over and over again.

778
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:20,980
So when I was posing for the picture, you know, we had to kill Bob first.

779
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,740
Not only can you, you must.

780
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,160
But luckily, he keeps coming back.

781
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,980
And you keep killing him.

782
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,000
So you have all those multiple opportunities for...

783
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,280
photo op.

784
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,480
Oh, yeah.

785
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,780
We can do that again.

786
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,420
And then you can argue

787
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,900
later on about the photographs

788
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,120
and 79% of the people

789
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:40,660
who I saw

790
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,780
of the original photographs

791
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,100
will mysteriously disappear.

792
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,740
And then people dressed

793
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,480
in black suits

794
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,140
and green underwear

795
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,160
will associate

796
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,340
with your doorway

797
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,700
and tell the bum

798
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,640
who is this guy.

799
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,060
And of course,

800
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,060
you'll have to answer them

801
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:52,760
and go inside

802
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,040
and answer a bunch

803
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,500
of questions.

804
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,600
I would tell everyone

805
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,700
not to do that

806
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,120
because once they

807
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,320
take that little radar...

808
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:01,400
What?

809
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,400
Don't answer the questions?

810
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:03,640
No, no.

811
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,680
Once they take the chips

812
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,960
out of your hands,

813
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,260
that's where they really are.

814
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,200
Then you're unprotected

815
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,360
and then you realize

816
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,280
there is no Bob.

817
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,960
This is all an illusion, too.

818
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,200
And you don't want to do that.

819
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:14,540
All right.

820
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,820
Let's keep this

821
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,220
theologically clean.

822
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,660
It's not that there is no Bob.

823
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:18,740
Dr. the Heretic.

824
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,460
Right.

825
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,100
It's not that there is no Bob.

826
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:21,660
That's not...

827
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,320
Dave is banned.

828
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,760
It's more that it's all

829
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,260
in your head.

830
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,740
It's not that there is no Bob.

831
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,320
It's just that

832
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,180
he's not really your friend.

833
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:28,680
Right.

834
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:28,900
Right.

835
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,120
That's kind of what

836
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:30,860
I'm trying to say.

837
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,600
It's a character, all right,

838
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,000
but it doesn't have

839
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,720
your best interest.

840
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,140
Well...

841
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,180
He's an exemplar.

842
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,160
His slack is perfect,

843
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,320
but it has to come

844
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,000
from somewhere.

845
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,720
Perhaps the slack

846
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,260
of those around him.

847
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:43,920
Exactly.

848
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,660
Like the X's

849
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,480
sniffing and snorting away

850
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,600
on the ether

851
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,880
and drawing in

852
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,120
the poo, poo, poo,

853
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,020
poo bunch

854
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,100
and the other mustard

855
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,300
and all the gases

856
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,480
that must eventually

857
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,760
come to an explosion.

858
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,080
He is alpha

859
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,560
and omega.

860
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:58,820
Omega.

861
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,740
Is mustard

862
00:33:59,740 --> 00:33:59,780
simultaneously

863
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,580
the mouth and anus

864
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:01,940
of the universe?

865
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:02,640
The Fuhrer thought it was

866
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,160
and that's why

867
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,020
he singed his hair

868
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,320
and he became a great leader

869
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,400
because he had singed

870
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,020
his own hair.

871
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,780
That explains the mustache.

872
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:09,760
Yes.

873
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,060
That's why so many

874
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,080
of his officer class

875
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,880
used to wear half mustaches

876
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,880
to show that they were

877
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,480
the eighth member.

878
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,120
The Fuhrer was

879
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,000
going to come to X Day.

880
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,240
He gets invited

881
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:20,760
every year.

882
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,400
He's not a...

883
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,300
You're talking about

884
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,200
some of Bob's

885
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:23,720
half mustaches?

886
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,440
Bin Laden put out

887
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,560
a type saying

888
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,160
that now that

889
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:28,540
everybody's

890
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,940
thinks he's dead

891
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,660
he can finally

892
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,560
come to the U.S.

893
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,420
and attend X Day.

894
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:33,960
He's been a big

895
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,300
subgenius fan for years.

896
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,160
We've been laden

897
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,900
with a heavy burden.

898
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,780
He wears his hair

899
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,520
the way he does

900
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,500
copying me,

901
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,020
he said.

902
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,120
Yeah, that's right.

903
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,000
And it looks

904
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,540
very distingué.

905
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,880
And Sting

906
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,640
has beautiful hair.

907
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,220
He does.

908
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,160
You see,

909
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:49,880
that's part of

910
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,320
his saintly nature.

911
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,640
And he's going to be

912
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,020
so happy to be there

913
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,480
because contrary

914
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,420
to what people believe

915
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,520
he's not a fundamentalist.

916
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:58,760
He's not a fundamentalist

917
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,100
at all.

918
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,720
He drinks like a fish,

919
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,880
swears like a mongoose,

920
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,820
and argues like a pink child.

921
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,780
Just to keep this

922
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,100
straight,

923
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,540
we're not talking

924
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,340
about Sting,

925
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,540
but about Osama Bin Laden.

926
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,060
Osama, yeah.

927
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:10,460
Yeah.

928
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:10,980
Wait.

929
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,940
Wait, he drinks fish?

930
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,260
He's not dead.

931
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,500
He's not really alive

932
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:16,920
either,

933
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,400
but you know what I mean.

934
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,460
The Phantom Zone?

935
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,340
Yes, he drinks

936
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,120
goldfish, too.

937
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,560
Goldfish?

938
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,560
Goldfleisch.

939
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,300
Feist.

940
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,760
Back in his throat?

941
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,100
I mean,

942
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:26,660
they're crackers

943
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,360
after all.

944
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,240
I noticed

945
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,740
Pisces got excited

946
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,480
when she heard

947
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,720
about the drinking

948
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,840
of the fish.

949
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,760
Uh-huh.

950
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,420
Yes, well,

951
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,460
fishy women

952
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,120
are like that.

953
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,080
Especially the goldfish,

954
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:38,400
you know,

955
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:38,980
maybe he'll help

956
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,340
get rid of the Asian carp

957
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:40,960
and the Great Lakes.

958
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,000
Are you part fin?

959
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,900
I wouldn't put

960
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,900
a fin on that.

961
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,080
Well,

962
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,800
I wouldn't touch

963
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,680
that one with a flipper.

964
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,460
Actually,

965
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,460
that tail

966
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,260
has long

967
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,600
been exhausted.

968
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,740
I've had it

969
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,220
to the gills.

970
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,140
Speaking of fins,

971
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,380
our friend

972
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,660
Sven Serrano,

973
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,600
the Mexican-Finnish-American,

974
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,180
just finished having

975
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,620
a big X-Day revival

976
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,640
in Shanghai, China.

977
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,500
And did it go

978
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,220
swimmingly?

979
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,060
It sure did.

980
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,620
All the Americans

981
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,700
came because it was

982
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,240
finally something

983
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,220
cool happening,

984
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,480
so all the cute

985
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,320
consular workers

986
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:19,820
came,

987
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,080
according to Sven.

988
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,240
I saw the DVD

989
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,220
of the one

990
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,100
last year.

991
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:26,640
And how did

992
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,040
that look?

993
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,100
Full of

994
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:28,940
cute young

995
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,560
Americans.

996
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,480
Shanghai is like

997
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,240
a big tourist

998
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:32,980
trap, actually.

999
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,640
If you want to

1000
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,540
really see China,

1001
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,320
don't go to Shanghai.

1002
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,120
That's what I've heard.

1003
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,240
I actually have

1004
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:39,940
an uncle in

1005
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,400
Chengdu,

1006
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,440
but I don't know

1007
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,300
if he was trying

1008
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:43,640
to make it.

1009
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,440
Chengdu is

1010
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:45,980
Xanadu.

1011
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,000
That's where

1012
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,860
Kublai Khan

1013
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,100
decreed his

1014
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,760
stately pleasure.

1015
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:51,820
Wow.

1016
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,420
All I know

1017
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,300
is he went

1018
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:54,900
to China

1019
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,700
and met himself

1020
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,200
a beautiful

1021
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,400
young wife,

1022
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,420
and married her.

1023
00:36:59,500 --> 00:36:59,700
Actually,

1024
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,360
Chengdu is also

1025
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,260
one of the other

1026
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:02,940
names for Beijing,

1027
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,100
I think.

1028
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:04,920
Well, it's his

1029
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,520
Chengdu.

1030
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:08,860
Isn't Shanghai

1031
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,360
a big old

1032
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:09,920
whole house?

1033
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,220
Certainly not.

1034
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,140
That's the 1920s

1035
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,440
they're talking about.

1036
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,760
It was bombed

1037
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,580
by the Japanese

1038
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,880
and then

1039
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,480
there were,

1040
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,500
you know,

1041
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,520
it was different

1042
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,060
after that.

1043
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:21,620
And it's all

1044
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,000
going to get

1045
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,580
bombed by the

1046
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,040
exes.

1047
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,080
Yes, that's right.

1048
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:24,440
Well, not bombed,

1049
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:24,840
but necessarily

1050
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,960
the laser beam thing.

1051
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:27,860
I'm going to get

1052
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,120
bombed.

1053
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:28,360
I'm going to get

1054
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:28,720
bombed as soon as

1055
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,500
this show is over.

1056
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:29,680
Oh, yeah,

1057
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,320
laser beams

1058
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,480
are so crude.

1059
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,660
Exes technology

1060
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,280
is so much more

1061
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,080
advanced than just

1062
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,420
crude human

1063
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,520
laser beams.

1064
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,660
Yes, that's

1065
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,180
quite true.

1066
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:41,480
Exes weapons

1067
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,620
make laser beams

1068
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,900
look like little toys.

1069
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,300
Yes, I was

1070
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:45,760
talking about

1071
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,420
laser beams

1072
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:46,960
look like

1073
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,660
lima beams.

1074
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:47,900
It's a

1075
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,600
skeletonizer ray

1076
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,340
that releases

1077
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,440
vast quantities

1078
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,500
of energy at once.

1079
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,840
Boston-baked

1080
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,280
beams.

1081
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,020
There's going

1082
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:55,520
to be some

1083
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,000
kind of a

1084
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,740
laser beam

1085
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,620
fight or

1086
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,760
a war at

1087
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,820
Starwood this

1088
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,100
year.

1089
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,260
I just put that

1090
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:02,920
into the program

1091
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,320
guide.

1092
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:03,960
Something happening

1093
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,300
at the

1094
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:04,580
Do you mean

1095
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,420
pagans use

1096
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:05,840
lasers?

1097
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,200
I thought they

1098
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,280
were anti-scientific

1099
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,200
lug-outs wearing

1100
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:09,860
wooden shoes.

1101
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,200
They play with

1102
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,200
toys just like

1103
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,560
subgeniuses do.

1104
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,220
I thought they

1105
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:14,740
had to play with

1106
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,060
hand-carved

1107
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,020
willow bark

1108
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,180
chileles.

1109
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:20,700
That would

1110
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,100
be pretty

1111
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:21,900
awesome to make

1112
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,780
a laser out of

1113
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,960
a hand-carved

1114
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,100
Chilean

1115
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:25,880
willow

1116
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:25,940
cinnamon stick.

1117
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,440
Well, I ought

1118
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:26,820
to play the

1119
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,140
game.

1120
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,000
That's all I can

1121
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,180
say.

1122
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:28,860
Fair weather

1123
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,180
sailors.

1124
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,480
It's only a

1125
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,060
certain kind of

1126
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:31,500
tree that you

1127
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:31,940
can make the

1128
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,680
lasers out of.

1129
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,600
That is true.

1130
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,220
This is true.

1131
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:35,960
A laser tree.

1132
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,580
Think about it

1133
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:37,920
like this.

1134
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,520
All you need

1135
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,340
is a tree

1136
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,000
and a ruby.

1137
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,700
Well, that was

1138
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,180
the original

1139
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:42,720
Well, don't let

1140
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,220
me keep you

1141
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:43,540
back.

1142
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,680
Get to work.

1143
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:45,520
Right.

1144
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,520
It goes back

1145
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,020
to biblical

1146
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:47,720
times in the

1147
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,700
days of Suez.

1148
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,680
When you think

1149
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,560
of Moses and

1150
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,060
the burning

1151
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:51,700
bush was

1152
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,860
actually a

1153
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,540
wooden laser.

1154
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,240
It was a

1155
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:54,880
futile attempt

1156
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,320
at first,

1157
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:55,820
but he had

1158
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,680
the right idea.

1159
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,580
I thought that

1160
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,000
was a sexually

1161
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,820
transmitted disease.

1162
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,600
And as we know

1163
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,440
from Spielberg,

1164
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,160
the Ark of the

1165
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,140
Covenant was a

1166
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:03,880
gigantic

1167
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,180
skeletonizing

1168
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:05,660
laser.

1169
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,340
Right.

1170
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:06,860
And it

1171
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,780
bursts out of

1172
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:07,920
him.

1173
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,180
Wait a minute.

1174
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:11,820
Wait a minute.

1175
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,420
No, I

1176
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,520
remember the

1177
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,320
1970 Chariots

1178
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:15,760
of the Gods

1179
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,300
documentary,

1180
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:16,980
and they said

1181
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,900
that the

1182
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:18,740
University of

1183
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,020
Minnesota

1184
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,020
actually built

1185
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,900
a full working

1186
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,020
replica of the

1187
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:23,440
Ark of the

1188
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:23,700
Covenant,

1189
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,540
and that it

1190
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,000
was actually

1191
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,480
a condenser

1192
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:26,960
that was

1193
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,140
building up

1194
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:28,840
hundreds of

1195
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,620
volts of power,

1196
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:29,980
and they had

1197
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,280
to have it

1198
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:30,940
dismantled.

1199
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:31,500
Ah, yes.

1200
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,700
And if it was

1201
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,620
in Chariots of

1202
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,100
the Gods,

1203
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:34,540
friends,

1204
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,040
then it

1205
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,600
must be

1206
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:35,900
true.

1207
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,120
Eric von

1208
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,640
Donaghan,

1209
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,340
the greatest

1210
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,220
scientist of

1211
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:40,740
our time.

1212
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:41,960
Yeah, that's

1213
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,200
what the

1214
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,460
documentary is

1215
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:43,880
all about.

1216
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,400
Everything is

1217
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,500
on the

1218
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,100
Internet now.

1219
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,380
Hey, that's

1220
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:49,420
right.

1221
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:49,780
That's the

1222
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:49,880
best thing

1223
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,200
about the

1224
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:50,380
Internet.

1225
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,760
And the

1226
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,220
worst thing

1227
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:52,600
about the

1228
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,320
Internet is

1229
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,400
everything is

1230
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:54,640
on the

1231
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:54,840
Internet.

1232
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:55,580
Yeah, I was

1233
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:55,880
going to

1234
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,000
say.

1235
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:56,680
Actually, I'm

1236
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:56,780
quite,

1237
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,120
unfortunately,

1238
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:57,640
there are some

1239
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,080
things that

1240
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,720
are not.

1241
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,040
But you

1242
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,500
can't have

1243
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,120
everything on

1244
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,440
anything.

1245
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,540
Actually,

1246
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,480
you can have

1247
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,220
everything on

1248
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,080
everything and

1249
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,860
anything on

1250
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,600
anything, but

1251
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,160
not everything

1252
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:07,880
on anything

1253
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,540
something.

1254
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,420
I'll have

1255
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:09,820
one with

1256
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,160
everything.

1257
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:10,820
Actually,

1258
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,660
just last

1259
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,820
night, yet

1260
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:14,740
another lady

1261
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,160
requested that

1262
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:16,680
I remove

1263
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,480
her photographs

1264
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,500
from X-Day

1265
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,140
from the

1266
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:20,480
Internet.

1267
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,360
So not

1268
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,020
everything is

1269
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:22,340
on the

1270
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:22,540
Internet.

1271
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,160
Why?

1272
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:23,480
Were these

1273
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,020
photographs

1274
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,020
compromising

1275
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:25,480
in some

1276
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:25,660
way?

1277
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:26,820
Extremely.

1278
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,040
And they

1279
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,160
were on

1280
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:29,700
the Internet?

1281
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:30,680
Well, of

1282
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:30,960
course.

1283
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,320
Remember, back

1284
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,420
in the years

1285
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,480
before our

1286
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,500
parents were

1287
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:36,960
on the

1288
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,140
Internet, the

1289
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,400
girls of X-Day

1290
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,180
were happy to

1291
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:40,500
have their

1292
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,320
pictures taken

1293
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,060
and be shown

1294
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:42,380
in the

1295
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,180
baptism pool

1296
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:43,540
and so

1297
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:43,800
forth.

1298
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,980
Then Grandma

1299
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,620
and Grandpa

1300
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,300
got on the

1301
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:46,600
Internet.

1302
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,140
Next thing

1303
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:47,400
you know,

1304
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:47,660
they're all

1305
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,060
writing a

1306
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:48,300
reference

1307
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:48,660
saying,

1308
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,900
I hate to

1309
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,420
bother you

1310
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:50,800
about this,

1311
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,260
but could you

1312
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:51,920
remove those

1313
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,180
1,000 topless

1314
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:53,940
pictures of

1315
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,140
me?

1316
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,420
I just told

1317
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:56,880
my dad,

1318
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,500
they were there

1319
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,220
and Danny said,

1320
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,060
okay, I won't

1321
00:40:59,060 --> 00:40:59,160
look.

1322
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,600
He said,

1323
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:00,940
he wouldn't

1324
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,200
want me,

1325
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:01,800
we can do

1326
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,100
that.

1327
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,140
Now, calm

1328
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:05,840
down, gentlemen.

1329
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,580
In my young

1330
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,060
childhood,

1331
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,500
resisted any

1332
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,100
chance they

1333
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:10,580
could to see

1334
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,020
me walking

1335
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:11,580
around bare

1336
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:11,840
naked.

1337
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,000
I think that

1338
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,480
was one of

1339
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:13,760
the most

1340
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,140
important things

1341
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:15,760
in their lives,

1342
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,360
just seeing me

1343
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:16,840
nude without

1344
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,280
clothes,

1345
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:17,860
standing in

1346
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,260
the backyard

1347
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,000
begging for

1348
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,480
food,

1349
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,900
arguing with

1350
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,360
the damn

1351
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:21,680
mutt,

1352
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,920
who has the

1353
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,540
best place

1354
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:23,760
in the

1355
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,360
doghouse.

1356
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,480
Fighting with

1357
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:25,800
the very

1358
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,620
dogs for

1359
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:26,820
each other.

1360
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,440
A scrap of

1361
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,040
sustenance.

1362
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,000
Quantum.

1363
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,000
Were the

1364
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,580
dogs naked?

1365
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:31,840
Was the

1366
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,660
dog, is the

1367
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,180
dog naked?

1368
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:33,580
Oh, yes.

1369
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,580
They're naked

1370
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,120
as a

1371
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:35,520
fur off.

1372
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:36,500
Made naked

1373
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:36,800
dogs.

1374
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,220
You don't

1375
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:38,560
have to put

1376
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,380
scales on

1377
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,180
a Pisces.

1378
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,000
They were

1379
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,600
already there.

1380
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,720
A Pythoness

1381
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,780
or Priestess.

1382
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:46,820
Yes,

1383
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,180
perfectly put.

1384
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,100
Well, now,

1385
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,820
I don't know

1386
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:51,720
if we want

1387
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,240
to do this,

1388
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:52,660
but we could

1389
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,440
also mention

1390
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,180
our individual

1391
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,660
special X-Day

1392
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,300
plans,

1393
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,040
since the

1394
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,640
time is coming

1395
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,160
soon, when

1396
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:58,540
we will

1397
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,220
know each

1398
00:41:59,220 --> 00:41:59,600
other's

1399
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,200
most intimate

1400
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:00,580
secrets.

1401
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,020
So, who's

1402
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,520
going first?

1403
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,100
Which plans?

1404
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,000
I mean, I

1405
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,340
have the

1406
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:06,940
secret plans,

1407
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,340
but the

1408
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:08,960
secret plans

1409
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,460
are secret.

1410
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,240
That's kind

1411
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:10,400
of the

1412
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:10,760
problem.

1413
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,660
Yes, but

1414
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,580
secret from

1415
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,580
the dull,

1416
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:14,360
vulgar,

1417
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,020
cuddly,

1418
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:15,360
chewing,

1419
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,100
mooing crowd,

1420
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:16,560
but not

1421
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,000
from your

1422
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,940
sharp,

1423
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,400
subtenuous

1424
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:19,700
friends.

1425
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:19,720
to ruin

1426
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,960
every memory

1427
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,360
of your

1428
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,000
favorite songs.

1429
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,240
Who's

1430
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:23,500
going to

1431
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:23,820
do that?

1432
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,620
Monkey Hive.

1433
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,180
Monkey Hive is

1434
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:26,540
going to

1435
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,880
ruin every

1436
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,720
memory of

1437
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,400
every one of

1438
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:29,800
your favorite

1439
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,040
songs.

1440
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:30,520
That's their

1441
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:30,820
plan.

1442
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:31,440
We've had

1443
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,120
chicken head

1444
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:32,900
visits, so I

1445
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:33,340
don't know if

1446
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,200
Monkey Hive can

1447
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:34,820
have any

1448
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,180
terror.

1449
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,680
My favorite

1450
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,460
songs are by

1451
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,360
the amino acids,

1452
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,240
so they don't

1453
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,120
have any

1454
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:42,600
amino acids.

1455
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:42,980
Well, they're

1456
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:43,260
not going to

1457
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:43,780
be there this

1458
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,340
time, though.

1459
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:44,980
No, they're

1460
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:45,200
not.

1461
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,080
But Fat Free

1462
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:47,620
has informed

1463
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,180
me that they

1464
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:48,780
will try their

1465
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,680
best to

1466
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:50,820
terrify,

1467
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,520
shock, and

1468
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,400
awe on the

1469
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,400
level of the

1470
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:55,860
amino acids.

1471
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:56,020
You know,

1472
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:56,140
you know,

1473
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:56,160
you know,

1474
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:56,560
Angry Layer is a

1475
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,220
great guitar player,

1476
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,320
but, like, Fear of

1477
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:58,860
the Future is not

1478
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,560
a hard song to

1479
00:42:59,560 --> 00:42:59,780
play.

1480
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,080
Maybe we should

1481
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,580
organize for the

1482
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,160
Dr. Jam and

1483
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:03,960
amino acids cover.

1484
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,060
And as for

1485
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:05,700
shock and awe,

1486
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,780
that's an old

1487
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,120
thing.

1488
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:07,720
It needs to be

1489
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,460
replaced with

1490
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,000
Dr. Octopus and

1491
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,120
George Bernard

1492
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:11,960
Shaw, that is to

1493
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,780
say, Ock and

1494
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:13,120
Shaw.

1495
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,480
Well, my fear

1496
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,580
with Fat Free is

1497
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:16,860
that Fat Free's

1498
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:17,420
drummer keeps

1499
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,380
wearing less and

1500
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,420
less clothes every

1501
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:19,800
year.

1502
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,560
You mean fewer

1503
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:21,760
and fewer?

1504
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,240
You work up a

1505
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:22,720
sweat playing

1506
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,260
drums, though.

1507
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,180
Oh, the

1508
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,060
drums, the sound

1509
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:27,640
of those drums

1510
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,600
drives me insane.

1511
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,140
The natives are

1512
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:30,460
restless.

1513
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,280
I mean, it's only

1514
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,200
because it used to

1515
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:32,940
get very cold.

1516
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,240
Does it get cold

1517
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:34,800
at night at

1518
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,680
Wisteria like it

1519
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,060
does at

1520
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:36,380
Brushnett?

1521
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,280
Oh, no.

1522
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,820
No, it's a hot

1523
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,560
hell of

1524
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,340
simmering,

1525
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:40,540
burning,

1526
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:41,920
blazing.

1527
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,980
No, and I

1528
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:45,960
expect the nice

1529
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,580
thing about

1530
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,020
Wisteria is I

1531
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:48,760
expect there will

1532
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,680
be many more

1533
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,500
boobs.

1534
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:51,980
Boobs?

1535
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,140
Well, I'm one.

1536
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,180
Okay, my fingers

1537
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:54,460
crossed.

1538
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:55,220
Right.

1539
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:56,600
It's going to be

1540
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:56,900
hot.

1541
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:57,740
Hot?

1542
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,440
And the girls

1543
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,340
will be hot.

1544
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,660
The pool will

1545
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,040
probably be the

1546
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,200
best place for

1547
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:05,440
relief.

1548
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,200
Actually, it's going

1549
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:06,660
to be rainy

1550
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:07,360
some days.

1551
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:07,960
But I heard there

1552
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,020
was no pool, only

1553
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,040
a filtered lake.

1554
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:10,580
And why do they

1555
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:11,400
have to filter it

1556
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:11,620
anyway?

1557
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,480
What's in there?

1558
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,340
A lake monster?

1559
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,020
Oh, you'll love

1560
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:15,260
it.

1561
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,040
You'll love it,

1562
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:16,500
Dr. Howell.

1563
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,700
You'll just love

1564
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:17,720
it.

1565
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:17,920
Don't you

1566
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,900
understand what's

1567
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:19,780
really afoot here?

1568
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,020
They're luring you

1569
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,000
there because you

1570
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,440
know.

1571
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:23,560
You know.

1572
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,020
Well, I don't want

1573
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,180
some pond monster

1574
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,340
to suck out all my

1575
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,280
vital juices.

1576
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:29,080
I have enough to

1577
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,080
worry about at this

1578
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:30,580
shindig.

1579
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,160
This is true.

1580
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,260
And the pond

1581
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:34,060
monster is filtered

1582
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:34,340
though.

1583
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,540
I mean, he's got a

1584
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,080
filter, so he won't

1585
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:37,320
cuss.

1586
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,260
You know, it's a

1587
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,320
clean pond monster.

1588
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,040
I've never known

1589
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:41,820
what my friend

1590
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:42,780
was not to fail.

1591
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:43,900
He's fine and

1592
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:44,200
friendly.

1593
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,500
Nature can cross

1594
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,160
all barriers.

1595
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:46,800
There's a woman

1596
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,000
who calls herself

1597
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,440
fish.

1598
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:48,920
Oh, the

1599
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,620
leeches?

1600
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,380
No, no, no.

1601
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:51,960
Not the leeches.

1602
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:52,420
They're little

1603
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,020
baby pond monsters.

1604
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:53,380
Leeches.

1605
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,780
I hate the leeches.

1606
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:56,260
Leeches.

1607
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,700
Sort of fish-like,

1608
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,480
but sort of

1609
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:58,540
got there.

1610
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:00,980
Leeches.

1611
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:01,120
They're very

1612
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,000
small when we

1613
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,680
saw them, but I

1614
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,260
assume there will

1615
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:03,860
be much bigger

1616
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:04,440
pond monsters.

1617
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,300
Pisces, one of

1618
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,780
those monsters you

1619
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:09,500
saw was a

1620
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,380
salamander.

1621
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:10,880
It was probably

1622
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,560
about a thousand

1623
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,000
years old.

1624
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,820
You say you saw

1625
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:13,500
some sort of

1626
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:13,980
monster.

1627
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,360
And that tadpole

1628
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,260
will look very

1629
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,440
different the next

1630
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,300
time you see it.

1631
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,120
I'm sure you

1632
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:19,840
thought you saw

1633
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,620
what you claimed

1634
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:21,640
you saw.

1635
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:22,740
Sometimes 200 feet

1636
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:23,460
long are

1637
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:23,820
existing.

1638
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:24,240
You know, the

1639
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,020
human mind's a

1640
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:25,980
strange thing and

1641
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:26,860
can play funny

1642
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,140
tricks, but in

1643
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,580
today's world, there

1644
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,100
are no more

1645
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:30,620
monsters.

1646
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,780
We've put a man

1647
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:32,320
on the moon.

1648
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,760
What if we are

1649
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,300
the monsters?

1650
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:38,460
Well, I was

1651
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:39,260
going to have to

1652
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:39,640
get there.

1653
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,320
I'm glad you

1654
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:40,960
forestalled me.

1655
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,260
That is, of

1656
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:42,640
course, the

1657
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,260
ultimate conclusion.

1658
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,280
Somebody once

1659
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,020
asked me, you

1660
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:45,620
know, what about

1661
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,760
this, you know,

1662
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:47,560
we're actually the

1663
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:47,920
monsters.

1664
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,160
What good does it

1665
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:49,400
do?

1666
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,640
That's why I'd

1667
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,280
send all the

1668
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,100
monsters if I

1669
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:52,440
wanted.

1670
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,000
I'd send them

1671
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:53,420
right to the

1672
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,160
moon and back.

1673
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:55,600
Well, that would

1674
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,580
keep them out of

1675
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,680
our hair for about,

1676
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,960
let me see, 46

1677
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,080
days, and then

1678
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:02,340
we'd still have to

1679
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:02,860
deal with them.

1680
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:04,220
Exactly.

1681
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,000
Can we get some

1682
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,680
tickets on Delta?

1683
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,100
They can fly

1684
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,160
economy like the

1685
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,200
rest of us and put

1686
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:11,720
up with the

1687
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,580
outrages that the

1688
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:13,140
rest of us do.

1689
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,040
The crying baby,

1690
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,020
the kid kicking

1691
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:16,700
the back of the

1692
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:16,940
seat.

1693
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:18,720
Now, monsters are

1694
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,340
really going to be

1695
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:20,620
rough when they get

1696
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:21,480
back to Earth, and

1697
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,420
they'll, you know,

1698
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:22,720
they're going to

1699
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,660
tear it apart like

1700
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:24,960
Fin Fang Foom and

1701
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:25,300
the gang.

1702
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,840
I always remember

1703
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:29,880
what monsters do,

1704
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:30,400
and they're not

1705
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,140
scaring people.

1706
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,660
They blab.

1707
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,040
They talk with

1708
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,280
endless egotism.

1709
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,380
For am I not

1710
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:36,900
brutal?

1711
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:38,660
Like, who cares?

1712
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,440
Just do your

1713
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,280
monster thing.

1714
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:41,640
I am Groot,

1715
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,740
lord of all

1716
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,100
timber in the

1717
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:44,600
universe.

1718
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:45,880
Groot, by the

1719
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,260
way, Dr.

1720
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,400
Hal, was from

1721
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,600
Planet X.

1722
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:49,320
Really?

1723
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:49,740
Yes.

1724
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,780
Jack Kirby.

1725
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:51,460
Then we'll be

1726
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,260
seeing him again

1727
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:52,360
on the show.

1728
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:52,740
I guess.

1729
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,300
Groot will be

1730
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,200
back, and his

1731
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,000
monster friends.

1732
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,080
Was it timber

1733
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:57,800
with arms wide

1734
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,040
open?

1735
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,820
Could I ask Dr.

1736
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,540
Hal one question

1737
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:01,480
about the

1738
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,320
magnetics of what

1739
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:04,640
we might call

1740
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,620
underground comics?

1741
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,560
You know, he who

1742
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,580
controls magnetism

1743
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:08,200
controls the

1744
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:08,480
universe.

1745
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,900
And also your

1746
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:10,560
mind as well.

1747
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,280
Well, what about

1748
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,360
magnetic underground

1749
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:13,880
comics?

1750
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:14,600
I don't think they

1751
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,200
ever installed

1752
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,080
magnets in them.

1753
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,680
You could shoplift

1754
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,640
underground comics

1755
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,960
without being caught.

1756
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:20,600
In fact, I think

1757
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,140
you were expected

1758
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:21,300
to.

1759
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:21,800
There was a

1760
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,340
special issue

1761
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,000
of the fabulous

1762
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:23,680
furry freak

1763
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,400
brothers that was

1764
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:24,940
printed with the

1765
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:25,760
same magnetic ink

1766
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,440
they put on dollar

1767
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,140
bills, actually.

1768
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,080
I'm talking about

1769
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,100
a person shooting

1770
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:29,940
a pig with a

1771
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:30,840
Nazi helmet on

1772
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,900
in 1949 or

1773
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:33,720
something like that.

1774
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:34,940
I think it's one of

1775
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:35,620
the rarest things

1776
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:36,400
I've ever found,

1777
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:37,340
and I thought it

1778
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:38,240
was one of the

1779
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:38,980
first underground

1780
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,420
comics in that

1781
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:41,300
sort of vein.

1782
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,220
Underground comics

1783
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,260
from 1949?

1784
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,040
Yes.

1785
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,100
Well, as we know

1786
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,140
from the great

1787
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,620
film God's

1788
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:49,040
Cartoonist, one

1789
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:49,540
of the first

1790
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:50,360
underground comic

1791
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,040
artists was the

1792
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,020
great Jack Chick.

1793
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,100
He's still in

1794
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:54,480
operation.

1795
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:55,380
He's still putting

1796
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,120
out his comic.

1797
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:57,200
Those little

1798
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:57,800
pamphlets.

1799
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:58,420
You know, one time

1800
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,340
I saw a parody of

1801
00:47:59,340 --> 00:47:59,820
a Chick tract.

1802
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,320
It was called

1803
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,180
The Other People.

1804
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,620
Yes, the pagan

1805
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,280
parody.

1806
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:03,940
There are many

1807
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:05,240
parodies of Chick

1808
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,300
tracts, and there's

1809
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,280
a guy in San

1810
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,120
Francisco named

1811
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,640
Bob Fowler, who is

1812
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:10,680
the archivist of

1813
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:11,940
all Chick tracts,

1814
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,320
and he also knows

1815
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,060
about all the

1816
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:14,860
parodies, and there

1817
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:15,360
are a number of

1818
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,160
them out there.

1819
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:17,300
There's a great

1820
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,360
anti-Christian one,

1821
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,140
for example, called

1822
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:19,900
The Greatest Myth

1823
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,160
Ever Told, and

1824
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:21,880
there's one called

1825
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,080
Atoms and Evil,

1826
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:23,720
which is about

1827
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,000
Alexander Shulgin

1828
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,320
and other pioneers,

1829
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:27,660
and they're all in

1830
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:28,660
that lovely Jack

1831
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:30,260
Chick format of

1832
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:31,020
the little pamphlet

1833
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,500
with, you know, a

1834
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,980
black field and

1835
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,160
then an image in

1836
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,600
red and inside an

1837
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,120
easy-to-digest comic

1838
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,160
that you can read in

1839
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,040
just the amount of

1840
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:40,940
time that it takes

1841
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,020
for a bowel movement.

1842
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,740
And Jack Chick

1843
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:44,540
created this

1844
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:44,840
format.

1845
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:45,740
Chicks dig

1846
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:46,140
Chick.

1847
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:46,940
Chicks.

1848
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,400
Chick tracts

1849
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:48,920
get read.

1850
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:50,880
Design for

1851
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,020
extra meditation.

1852
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:51,480
of God's

1853
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,020
Cartoonist.

1854
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:52,440
The Cartoonist, by

1855
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,020
the way, will be

1856
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:54,400
at the sex day.

1857
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:55,340
That's right, he

1858
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:55,600
will.

1859
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,340
That would be

1860
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,100
Kurt von

1861
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:58,700
Busse von

1862
00:48:58,700 --> 00:48:59,440
Kirsteiner.

1863
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,820
The Nazi

1864
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,460
subgenius will be

1865
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:02,740
there.

1866
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,540
And we'll have

1867
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:05,120
a high old

1868
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:05,500
time.

1869
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,420
Do you remember

1870
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,060
the Terry

1871
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:11,220
Schiavo Jack

1872
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,220
Chick parody that

1873
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:12,640
I made?

1874
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:13,600
Holy cow.

1875
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,240
I made you

1876
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:15,660
in Princess

1877
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:15,880
Week.

1878
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,280
Now there's a

1879
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,280
hilarious subject

1880
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:17,960
in this comic.

1881
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:18,940
It's probably on

1882
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:20,240
some site somewhere.

1883
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:20,740
America's

1884
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:21,700
Favorite Vegetable.

1885
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:22,320
It's probably on

1886
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,480
subgenius.com

1887
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,340
somewhere.

1888
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,320
But they won't

1889
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:26,960
let you eat the

1890
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:27,380
vegetables.

1891
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,340
Yeah, that's the

1892
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:30,340
meaning of the

1893
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:30,740
phrase.

1894
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:31,760
She's valid.

1895
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,060
Ask any

1896
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:34,340
vegetable.

1897
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:34,780
Back in your

1898
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:35,500
salad days.

1899
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,640
Well, now we're

1900
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,600
a little bit

1901
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,380
older and a little

1902
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,280
bit further on.

1903
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:40,760
We're tilting

1904
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:41,560
windward, I think.

1905
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:42,380
It's 2005.

1906
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:43,120
We've been coddling

1907
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,020
down the pike all

1908
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:44,520
these years.

1909
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:45,040
There's some

1910
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,080
wear and tear on

1911
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:46,420
the old

1912
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:46,640
book.

1913
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,200
A little bit.

1914
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,460
Hal, I actually

1915
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,600
remember reading

1916
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,640
the phrase,

1917
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,340
he who controls

1918
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:53,400
magnetism controls

1919
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,020
the universe.

1920
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:54,480
That's why I

1921
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:54,840
quoted it.

1922
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:54,940
In the Sunday

1923
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:55,640
Papers.

1924
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,720
From Chester

1925
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,140
Gould.

1926
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:57,940
Yes, Dick

1927
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:58,300
Tracy.

1928
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:58,620
It was a

1929
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,200
Dick Tracy

1930
00:49:59,200 --> 00:49:59,480
bait.

1931
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,320
And boy, did

1932
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,340
that strip get

1933
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,140
weird for a

1934
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:02,740
It was always

1935
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:03,540
weird, but it

1936
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:04,460
got super weird

1937
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:04,980
when you had

1938
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:06,020
Moon Maid and

1939
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:07,180
they went to

1940
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:07,780
the moon and

1941
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:08,340
the little kids

1942
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:08,980
with antennas

1943
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:09,620
running around.

1944
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:11,660
Didn't Junior

1945
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:12,800
marry Moon Maid?

1946
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:13,500
Yes, Junior

1947
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,340
Tracy married

1948
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:15,140
the girl from

1949
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:15,880
the moon who

1950
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,620
was rather sexy

1951
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:17,260
except for those

1952
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:17,860
little antennas.

1953
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:18,200
But you could

1954
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:18,700
get used to

1955
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:18,920
them.

1956
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:19,820
The kids all

1957
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:20,320
had them too.

1958
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:21,980
Moon Maid?

1959
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:23,960
It's the newest

1960
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:24,860
fad is getting

1961
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:25,460
antennas.

1962
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,720
But as Chester

1963
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:28,640
Gould got older,

1964
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:29,740
he got weirder

1965
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:31,220
and he was so

1966
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,140
chuffed that he

1967
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:32,960
invented the wrist

1968
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:33,740
radio that he

1969
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:34,660
started inventing

1970
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:35,380
other even more

1971
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,140
unlikely things

1972
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:37,300
like the TV

1973
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,140
set in the middle

1974
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:38,740
of your stove.

1975
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,340
Now mom can

1976
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,220
cook and watch

1977
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:41,560
TV.

1978
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:42,700
It's a TV.

1979
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:43,760
It's a stove.

1980
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,140
It's a TV and

1981
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:45,520
a stove.

1982
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:46,300
And the whole

1983
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,200
comic would be

1984
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,700
taken up with

1985
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:48,900
this.

1986
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:49,640
There's no

1987
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:49,880
forward motion.

1988
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:50,880
There's no

1989
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,220
forward motion

1990
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:51,220


1991
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,820
In somebody's

1992
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,000
private senile

1993
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,540
room only he's

1994
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:56,120
drawing it as

1995
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:56,920
vigorously as

1996
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:57,440
ever with the

1997
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:57,920
thick black

1998
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:58,580
ink lines.

1999
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:00,340
Well and think

2000
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,600
of Jack Kirby

2001
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,600
when they started

2002
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,740
letting Jack Kirby

2003
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:04,860
write his own

2004
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:05,940
comics as he

2005
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:06,680
became more

2006
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,180
famous.

2007
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,060
And you got

2008
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:08,600
things like

2009
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:09,740
Devil Dinosaur

2010
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:10,940
and Moon Boy.

2011
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:11,800
Yeah.

2012
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:14,020
OMAC.

2013
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:14,600
One Man

2014
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,320
Army Corps.

2015
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,560
Those are some

2016
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:17,680
of the most

2017
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,000
bulldada things

2018
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:19,640
in the world.

2019
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:20,000
Yes.

2020
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:20,780
Now let's

2021
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:21,800
consider that

2022
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,720
the most

2023
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,480
vigorous and

2024
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,380
famous products

2025
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,520
of Kirby and

2026
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,300
Lee supposedly

2027
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,220
were done

2028
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:28,520
20, 30

2029
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,240
years ago.

2030
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:29,880
When you're an

2031
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,020
old geezer you

2032
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:31,800
can't be expected

2033
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,420
to have the

2034
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:33,420
spring of

2035
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:34,920
youthful creativity

2036
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,900
leap forth in

2037
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:36,700
all its glory.

2038
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,140
It oozes out

2039
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:38,880
if it's there at

2040
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:39,060
all.

2041
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:39,920
So let's not

2042
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,700
run down Kirby

2043
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:41,240
for these

2044
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,340
anemic later

2045
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:42,640
creators.

2046
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:43,980
Kirby himself

2047
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,420
said that he

2048
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:46,500
created all

2049
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,020
this stuff

2050
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,100
and all the

2051
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:48,880
colorist and

2052
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:49,940
the dot man.

2053
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,860
Did their work

2054
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:51,800
and somebody else

2055
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:52,500
did the dialogue

2056
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,620
and he just

2057
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:54,580
became more of a

2058
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,760
crazed idea man.

2059
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:57,520
That's what I was

2060
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:57,860
getting to.

2061
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:58,720
The dialogue was

2062
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,720
from Stan Lee

2063
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,380
but first the story

2064
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:02,100
would be drawn

2065
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:02,820
by Kirby

2066
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:03,560
and according to

2067
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,360
Kirby Lee would

2068
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:04,860
just come along

2069
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:05,660
and write in the

2070
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:06,480
captions and that

2071
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,760
was his contribution.

2072
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,240
So in that sense

2073
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,600
he wrote the story

2074
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,640
but in a real

2075
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,840
architectonic sense

2076
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,660
Jack King Kirby

2077
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:15,640
had already created

2078
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:16,420
the story by

2079
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:17,640
drawing everything

2080
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:18,920
and only Lee

2081
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,480
came along

2082
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,360
and wrote in

2083
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,860
the slangy

2084
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:22,420
snappy

2085
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,140
yak that was

2086
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:24,680
in all the

2087
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,160
By the way

2088
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:26,720
I have to

2089
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,420
compliment you

2090
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:27,900
on your use

2091
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:28,280
of the word

2092
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,060
architectonic.

2093
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:29,580
That was

2094
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,800
Well the real

2095
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,540
understructure

2096
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:33,040
you know my

2097
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,100
meaning here.

2098
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:34,700
Absolutely.

2099
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:35,180
You know

2100
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:36,000
architect meaning

2101
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,440
master.

2102
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,680
Architect is a

2103
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,160
master builder.

2104
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,700
Tectonic plates

2105
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:41,380
are the things

2106
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:41,980
from which the

2107
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:42,480
earth is built.

2108
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:43,520
The master builder

2109
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:45,940
that over

2110
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:46,600
pertaining to

2111
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,300
a master builder.

2112
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:48,160
Well it's hard

2113
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:48,900
not to think of

2114
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:49,500
the underlying

2115
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,200
foundations

2116
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,620
at a time when

2117
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:52,360
very soon they'll

2118
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,220
all be whisked

2119
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:54,200
from under us

2120
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,360
by like a table

2121
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,400
cloth by a cheap

2122
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,120
magician.

2123
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:58,320
And the

2124
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,980
don't knock off

2125
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:00,560
the gin and

2126
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,040
tectonic.

2127
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,280
Well no the gin

2128
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,060
will stay on the

2129
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:03,640
table but the

2130
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,340
table cloth will

2131
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:05,220
be whisked away

2132
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,160
if he performs

2133
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:06,720
this illusion

2134
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,140
correctly.

2135
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,440
Yeah well all I

2136
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,120
can say is if

2137
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,140
thoughts had minds

2138
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,280
or words had wings

2139
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,700
then we could

2140
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:13,900
actually control

2141
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:14,700
our destiny.

2142
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:16,000
Yeah and if

2143
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:16,460
your grandmother

2144
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:17,260
had wheels she'd

2145
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:17,760
be a wagon.

2146
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:20,860
I don't know

2147
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:21,740
that handshake

2148
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,880
much when you

2149
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:23,300
were talking

2150
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:23,800
about the

2151
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,100
masonic handshake.

2152
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:25,960
Well they put

2153
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:26,500
their hands on

2154
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,380
your wrist

2155
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:27,740
and they

2156
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:28,580
tickle tickle

2157
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,740
and either you

2158
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:30,380
punch them out

2159
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:31,060
or you recognize

2160
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,860
that they're a

2161
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:32,200
mason.

2162
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:33,820
Like Jackie

2163
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:34,080
Mason.

2164
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:38,500
It's a roll

2165
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,180
of the dice

2166
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:39,640
all right.

2167
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:40,680
I'm talking

2168
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,700
about America's

2169
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,000
freedom and not

2170
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:43,700
just freedom to

2171
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:44,300
buy greasy

2172
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:44,960
french fries

2173
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:45,600
by the side

2174
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:45,980
of the road.

2175
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,040
And you know

2176
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:48,700
we are free

2177
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,200
to love Bob

2178
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,560
we're free

2179
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,580
to wait

2180
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:56,300
for the day

2181
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,540
when it's all

2182
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:57,840
over.

2183
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:58,780
But let's not

2184
00:53:58,780 --> 00:53:59,780
be too cautious

2185
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:00,620
let's embrace

2186
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,700
this full heartedly

2187
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,020
and full bloodedly

2188
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,760
and be giving

2189
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,240
and not miserly

2190
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:06,980
because we're all

2191
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:07,660
going to need

2192
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:08,420
each other's

2193
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,620
comfort in the

2194
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:10,500
terrible times

2195
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,540
that lie ahead.

2196
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:13,420
I comfort

2197
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:14,200
myself pretty

2198
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:14,500
well.

2199
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:15,300
It usually

2200
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:15,760
takes about

2201
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,320
two and a half

2202
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:16,640
minutes.

2203
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,380
Oh really?

2204
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:18,880
Well thank you.

2205
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:19,600
I guess

2206
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,700
I suppose

2207
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:22,360
there's no point

2208
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,480
dragging it

2209
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:23,620
all out.

2210
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:23,840
We only have

2211
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:24,380
to put up

2212
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:25,100
with this living

2213
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:25,840
hell for

2214
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,700
until July 5th.

2215
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:28,440
Yes.

2216
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,480
Yes that's

2217
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:30,500
all.

2218
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:31,080
And then it'll

2219
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:31,620
be moved to

2220
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:32,220
another planet.

2221
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:33,640
Well actually

2222
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,300
Princess we

2223
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,180
and I owe

2224
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:37,080
a certain number

2225
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:37,580
of people

2226
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,640
another festival

2227
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,400
after that

2228
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,000
and we'll

2229
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,540
have to move

2230
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:42,820
Starwood and

2231
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:43,760
Wisteria onto

2232
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,860
our escape

2233
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:45,580
planet.

2234
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:47,020
But you know

2235
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:47,920
that is after

2236
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:48,460
all a

2237
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:49,740
just a continuation

2238
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:51,220
like the cracking

2239
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:51,560
of ice.

2240
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,000
We can dump

2241
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:52,680
them out into

2242
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,520
space after

2243
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,000
they've gotten

2244
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:55,460
their show.

2245
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:56,080
Yeah.

2246
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,620
We got your

2247
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:58,060
money Bob.

2248
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:58,740
Yeah.

2249
00:54:58,740 --> 00:54:59,800
The ones that

2250
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:00,920
aren't subgeniuses

2251
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:01,980
they'll be

2252
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:03,760
ejected

2253
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,040
into space.

2254
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,240
Or turned

2255
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:07,740
into

2256
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,020
love slaves

2257
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:10,580
or something.

2258
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:11,140
I want the

2259
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:12,020
money honey.

2260
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:13,900
Well that's

2261
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:14,840
always an

2262
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:15,680
interesting debate

2263
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,080
amongst subgeniuses

2264
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,160
is oh do we

2265
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:18,580
keep them

2266
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:19,060
for pets.

2267
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:20,380
Right.

2268
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:20,720
That's the

2269
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,660
evangelical

2270
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,340
the evangelicals

2271
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:23,920
versus the

2272
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,920
holocaustals.

2273
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:26,480
Not to mention

2274
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,260
Jehovah One's

2275
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:27,560
witnesses.

2276
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,280
Well we don't

2277
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:30,620
want to

2278
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:31,880
dissuade people

2279
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:32,860
by talking about

2280
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:33,500
our theological

2281
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,520
minutia.

2282
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:35,860
There is more

2283
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:37,900
that we have

2284
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:38,820
in common

2285
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:39,840
than divides us.

2286
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:40,540
We must be

2287
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:41,120
ecumenical

2288
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,300
in these

2289
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,160
last days.

2290
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,120
Reach out

2291
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:44,520
with that

2292
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,500
extended fist

2293
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,780
that stark fist.

2294
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:47,920
Reach out

2295
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,140
and smite

2296
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:50,740
the conspiracy.

2297
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,640
Clock the conspiracy

2298
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,600
on the noggin.

2299
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,420
This is your

2300
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:55,240
last chance.

2301
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:57,440
If you must die

2302
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,600
then here's what to do.

2303
00:55:58,660 --> 00:55:59,740
Jump in Bob's pipe

2304
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:00,400
and let him

2305
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,020
smoke you.

2306
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,380
For you are all

2307
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:02,880
the dottle

2308
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,220
that rains on the

2309
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:05,040
roofs like fire.

2310
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,000
Please smoke me.

2311
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:07,700
Please.

2312
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:08,620
Smoke me.

2313
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:09,500
Eat me.

2314
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,380
Drink me.

2315
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:12,180
Yeah sorry

2316
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:12,880
little man.

2317
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:13,460
It sounds like

2318
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:13,880
a good time.

2319
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:14,340
I mean.

2320
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,240
Didn't the

2321
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,140
who do that

2322
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:16,420
song?

2323
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:17,720
Yeah.

2324
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:19,280
Smoke me.

2325
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:19,760
It's not good enough

2326
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:20,820
to live right on the lake.

2327
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:21,500
No it's sort of

2328
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,200
light me.

2329
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:22,800
Light me.

2330
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:23,640
Smoke me.

2331
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:24,240
See me.

2332
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,440
Inhale me.

2333
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,280
Exhale me.

2334
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,480
Be enlightened by me.

2335
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:29,100
I thought that was

2336
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:29,480
the door.

2337
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,920
Yeah but it ended up

2338
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:32,500
with we're not

2339
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:33,680
gonna take it.

2340
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:33,920
One little

2341
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:34,580
pamphlet.

2342
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,060
One little book.

2343
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,620
That was Allison.

2344
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:41,340
Allison Wunderland.

2345
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:41,440
It was like a

2346
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,080
skeeball machine

2347
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:42,940
and then

2348
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:44,920
everybody played

2349
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:45,420
skeeball

2350
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:46,280
and then we all

2351
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,200
took a bath

2352
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:47,600
and we

2353
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:47,740
sure.

2354
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:48,140
We played

2355
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:49,300
a skeeball.

2356
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:50,600
And then

2357
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,740
after we took

2358
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:53,280
a bath in

2359
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:53,760
canned beans

2360
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,540
we ran through

2361
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:55,420
a field of

2362
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:56,480
poppies and

2363
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,020
ended up

2364
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:57,520
in the

2365
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,340
Emerald City.

2366
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,100
That's what it was.

2367
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,280
Okay.

2368
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:01,300
You first.

2369
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,220
Who would not

2370
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:03,260
want to live like that?

2371
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:03,940
So if they have

2372
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:04,720
like poppy fields

2373
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:05,200
surrounding the

2374
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:05,780
Emerald City

2375
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:06,320
does that mean

2376
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:06,840
that Seattle

2377
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,280
is now in

2378
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:07,600
Afghanistan?

2379
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:08,860
It should be.

2380
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:09,820
Well if Earth

2381
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:10,360
is Mars

2382
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,120
nothing is

2383
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:11,400
impossible.

2384
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:12,440
Sure.

2385
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:12,740
Have you ever

2386
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:13,140
tried

2387
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:14,180
Afghanistan food?

2388
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:15,900
Pickles anyway?

2389
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:16,660
The pickles?

2390
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:17,720
The pickles?

2391
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,420
Well they were

2392
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:18,980
going to come

2393
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:19,580
but we don't

2394
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:19,900
have them

2395
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:20,980
nor the amino acids

2396
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:21,720
but we do have

2397
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,180
the Evolution

2398
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,120
Control Committee

2399
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,360
with trademark

2400
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:24,940
Gunderson.

2401
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,120
Fat Mandy

2402
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:27,820
I believe

2403
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:28,780
from Pittsburgh.

2404
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:29,900
Vera Defects.

2405
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:32,360
I mentioned

2406
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:32,860
Fat Free

2407
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:33,500
and Monkey Hive

2408
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:33,760
already.

2409
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:34,300
There's a

2410
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:35,020
cult of

2411
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:35,400
veer

2412
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,760
and of course

2413
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:37,260
the ever

2414
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:38,400
ever beloved

2415
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,140
and always

2416
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:39,720
incredible

2417
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:40,760
Duke of Uke.

2418
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:42,000
That's right.

2419
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:43,040
Hail Caesar.

2420
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,200
Hail Caesar.

2421
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,040
Hail you.

2422
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:47,740
I have heard

2423
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,320
him in elevators.

2424
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:50,940
They have included

2425
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:51,820
his works.

2426
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:52,540
Did he elevate

2427
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:53,100
your mood?

2428
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:54,040
He did.

2429
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,620
Wham, pam, pam, pam,

2430
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:56,080
pam, pam.

2431
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:56,720
I want to be

2432
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:57,460
sedated.

2433
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:58,120
Yeah.

2434
00:57:58,140 --> 00:57:59,180
He does the

2435
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:00,200
nicest ukulele

2436
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:01,720
versions of

2437
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:02,300
songs like

2438
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:03,220
Anarchy in the

2439
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:03,580
UK.

2440
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:04,980
I had him as a

2441
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:05,760
special guest on

2442
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:06,720
my show in San

2443
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,000
Francisco.

2444
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,120
He rocks the

2445
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:08,780
audience with

2446
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:10,400
his versions of

2447
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,300
those old

2448
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:12,360
punk stalwarts.

2449
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:13,480
Sure does.

2450
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:15,300
He's still got

2451
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,140
the spiked haircut

2452
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:16,780
and the big

2453
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:17,580
goofy glasses

2454
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:18,100
after the

2455
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:18,260
years.

2456
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:18,720
He looks like

2457
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,080
Elvis Costello

2458
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,100
on Lubrizol or

2459
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:21,440
something.

2460
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,140
He looks like

2461
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:22,740
someone stole

2462
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:23,740
his spleen and

2463
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:24,280
gave it to

2464
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,180
Prometheus or

2465
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:25,800
some devil.

2466
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,600
Well, he's not

2467
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,360
spleenless.

2468
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:30,960
I also heard

2469
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:31,500
that there will

2470
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,240
be an Ask

2471
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,140
Dr. Howe.

2472
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:33,740
Well, there

2473
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:34,060
could be.

2474
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:34,900
I'll be there.

2475
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:35,380
You can ask

2476
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:36,180
me for all the

2477
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:36,640
good it'll do.

2478
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:37,160
Sure.

2479
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,200
Ask Dr. Howe.

2480
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:38,560
All right.

2481
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,100
Actually, I have

2482
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,080
the brochure.

2483
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,760
The brochure

2484
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:44,620
was printed

2485
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:44,960
today.

2486
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:46,120
Actually, for a

2487
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:47,420
complete, for a

2488
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:47,980
complete listing

2489
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:49,260
of some of these

2490
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:49,880
interesting events,

2491
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:50,900
please stay tuned.

2492
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:51,320
Those will be

2493
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,420
coming up after

2494
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:53,280
the top of the

2495
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:53,460
hour.

2496
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:53,820
We need to

2497
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:54,060
pause.

2498
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:55,420
And, of course,

2499
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:55,800
it goes without

2500
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,300
saying that the

2501
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:56,880
views and opinions

2502
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,020
on this program

2503
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:58,580
are not necessarily

2504
00:58:58,580 --> 00:58:59,660
those of WCSB

2505
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:00,180
or Cleveland State

2506
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:01,680
University, but I

2507
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,140
kind of had to

2508
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:02,540
say it anyway.

2509
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:03,360
And don't have

2510
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,520
to flip the CD.

2511
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:04,760
We've got to

2512
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:05,880
flip the disc and

2513
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:06,160
then we're going

2514
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,000
to flip the script.

2515
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:07,680
So don't say

2516
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,760
anything funny.

2517
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:09,680
Ask away.

2518
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:10,280
Ask away.

2519
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:10,900
Don't say bad

2520
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:11,240
words.

2521
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,340
I don't know if

2522
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:13,800
you all want to

2523
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,500
hang on the line

2524
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,060
for a minute or

2525
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:15,440
if you want to

2526
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,000
try calling back,

2527
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:16,500
but we've got to

2528
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:17,480
pause here for a

2529
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,380
moment and we'll

2530
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:18,820
be back.

2531
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:19,860
Did you ever see

2532
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:20,780
a blue dog eating

2533
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:21,320
mayonnaise?

2534
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,340
We ever killed a

2535
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:23,880
gopher with a

2536
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:24,100
stick?

2537
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:25,440
Attract ourselves

2538
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,200
to that question

2539
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,260
when we return.

2540
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:30,260
The saucers

2541
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:30,960
are coming.

2542
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:33,440
The saucers.

2543
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:33,880
The saucers.

2544
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:34,260
The saucers.

2545
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:35,760
The saucers.

2546
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:35,760


2547
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:36,700
The saucers.

2548
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,400
The saucers.

2549
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,020
The saucers.
