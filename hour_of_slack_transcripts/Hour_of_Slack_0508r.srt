2
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:28,660
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

3
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,420
Hoping your time is all time, and all your unpermissible truths are happy truths.

4
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:39,460
Here's your host, Reverend Ivan Stein.

5
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,160
Folks, before I bring our star out, uh, well, you know, you know, what the hell, a joke's a joke, right?

6
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:55,780
And, uh, I mean, he kids a lot about religion, you know, and, uh, lesbians and dope and, uh, politics.

7
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,640
But what the hell, yeah, he was in the, in the service.

8
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,780
He was in the service for three years, and, uh...

9
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,140
They had once attacked him, and felled him to the pavement.

10
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,400
He was taken to the receiving hospital where his wounds were dressed.

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,120
Thanks a lot, Pete. That's all the Laugh-A-While news.

12
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,900
Welcome, dear friends, to the Laugh-A-While news.

13
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,400
We'll ask you to laugh along with us for a while, while we do the news.

14
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,400
Are you from Fresno?

15
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,420
Things are getting crazier all the time, Ted.

16
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,480
Crazier and crazier all the time.

17
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,060
But they're all making news, and it's all news.

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,040
Inform them.

19
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,800
Eternal salvation.

20
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,220
Or triple your money back.

21
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,500
The Church of the Subgenius

22
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,580
bring you another 33 minutes of condensed,

23
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,120
uraglic functions

24
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,080
over the quality audio-visual techniques

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,880
exacerbated,

26
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,400
and complicated

27
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,300

28
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,360

Copyright 1985-86.

30
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,980
Oh, Dr. Spurgeon.

31
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,280
Oh, Dr. Spurgeon.

32
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,800
What about the code, Bill? Are we doing all right?

33
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,600
Well, so far, uh...

34
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,440
I've got a copy here of the production code.

35
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,480
I think the, uh, talk of, uh, murder, Professor...

36
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,380
Initially, of course, the code says that the, uh...

37
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,560
technique of murder must not be presented in a way that will inspire, uh...

38
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:27,980
imitation.

39
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:28,620
Uh...

40
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,980
And, uh, and, uh, and, uh, uh...

41
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,120
Brutal killing...

42
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,680
Get on with it!

43
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,840
Brutal killings are not to be represented in detail.

44
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,120
I...

45
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,340
That is, revenge in modern times shall not be...

46
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,700
Uh, Ted, I think that you missed an important point there.

47
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,280
Ted?

48
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:42,900
Oh!

49
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,480
Oh, memories.

50
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,600
Memories.

51
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:58,880
Memories.

52
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,580
We ain't got no legs.

53
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,060
That means I ain't got no legs, you ain't got no legs,

54
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,180
and them men in there ain't got no legs.

55
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,080
Now, what does that sound like to you?

56
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,920
The subgenius.

57
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,400
It gets up and kills.

58
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,440
The people it kills get up and kills.

59
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,920
Should any other shows be heard from or contacted in the course of this show,

60
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,480
the listener is advised to...

61
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,160
To remain calm and only contact listed or unlisted officials

62
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,240
in the event of any material from this radio or other listening device

63
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,960
being inhaled during broadcast.

64
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,060
Uh, yes.

65
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,360
Uh, friends.

66
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,080
Good to be back with you, although, you know,

67
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,740
I've had...

68
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,980
Uh, your dear host and prayer partner, Reverend Stang,

69
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,340
may have to admit something to you.

70
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,460
Uh, we're kind of in trouble.

71
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,360
Here, I should say I'm in trouble with the conspiracy.

72
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:10,420
We told the conspiracy we'd have this new subgenius book finished by now,

73
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,420
and, uh, well, actually, we told them we'd have it finished last August,

74
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,660
and, uh, then we told them we'd have it finished by now,

75
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,340
and now we still don't, and, uh,

76
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,220
and, uh, until we finish that new subgenius book, Revelation X,

77
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,440
the, uh, the podcast,

78
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,700
we can't finish the Start the Fist magazine,

79
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,500
and, uh, can't get any other jobs,

80
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,960
and we don't get paid to look fun,

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,740
and can't do a whole lot of hour of slack preparation

82
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,800
when you're chained to that computer.

83
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,120
So, um, but what you do end up with

84
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,440
is lots and lots of pages of words,

85
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,480
and those words, I mean,

86
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,440
it's gonna be...

87
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,340
It's gonna be a year before you read those words,

88
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,080
so instead, you're just gonna have to hear some of those words

89
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:09,040
from, uh, Revelation X, the Bible Pocryphon,

90
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,040
and as it says here on this particular script,

91
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
dear friend,

92
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,780
did you know that through the church of the subgenius,

93
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,240
you can learn to live with your sins?

94
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,320
Oh, yes, dear friend,

95
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,160
because, you know, we, in this church,

96
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,040
we use promises of sex to lure converts,

97
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,380
uh, and so come and get it, man.

98
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,500
I mean, here we are.

99
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,820
Come and get it.

100
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,540
It's not pornography, officer.

101
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,480
It's empowerment.

102
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,140
And, my friends, my lady,

103
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:54,540
you can learn to masturbate without going blind.

104
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,140
You can perform astral,

105
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:57,760
sex,

106
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,120
with anyone you want.

107
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,340
You can, you, yes, you,

108
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,180
can have intercourse

109
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,040
with beautiful, live, nude,

110
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,160
Y-mind,

111
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,300
or damn near anything else.

112
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,300
Because Bob, friends, Bob is a sex god,

113
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,320
and he has come,

114
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,660
and come again to rationalize your sin.

115
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:26,240
Through the master Bob's patented techniques of astrochemistry,

116
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,320
and B.P. Wow's amazing tantric deviational technology,

117
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,900
you will learn the real secret behind magic and freemasonry.

118
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,260
Sex hurts, trademark, until it feels so good.

119
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,620
It hurts.

120
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,400
Yes, the restrained fury of fornication

121
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,740
can be re-channeled to release hidden energies,

122
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,940
which allow communication with higher intelligences,

123
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,400
from the stars.

124
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,760
Plus, your orgasm-onic radiation,

125
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,820
or aetheric fallout from any sex not for procreation,

126
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,280
will affect the genes of the normals around you,

127
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:14,700
causing their kids to be born subgeniuses.

128
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,520
You now have not only a right,

129
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,180
but a duty, a duty to do anything you want,

130
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,060
with any consenting partner.

131
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,140
And we'll help you find at least one.

132
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,460
Free blessing cloth with every orgasm.

133
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:37,580
Our women are screaming to meet you lonely lads and lassies,

134
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:43,780
and our men are dying to ravish you subgenius gals and guys.

135
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:49,400
We honestly don't care what you look like,

136
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,040
so don't fall for the bashful act.

137
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,800
Politely state your intentions.

138
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,680
Politely is the key word here.

139
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,200
And then sit back and watch the action begin.

140
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,240
It's that simple.

141
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,600
You'll be able to quit, or start doing it,

142
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,880
in a matter of days.

143
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,600
Eases recovery.

144
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,140
Don't bother with old-fashioned dowsing rods ever again.

145
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,640
Repels fleas, flies, and locusts for seven days.

146
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,600
Superb marital aid.

147
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,200
Keep dry the masculine way.

148
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,100
Satisfy your every fetish.

149
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,920
Your sweetie will never know you used it.

150
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,300
Weight loss, hair growth, romance.

151
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,060
No ma'am, you won't care how dumb he is

152
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,240
when you see these incredible results.

153
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:44,680
A purer ooze than drugs, the Bible, or even TV.

154
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,720
Imagine, no danger of stained clothing.

155
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,200
Truly invisible.

156
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,320
Won't rustle.

157
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,860
Amazingly comfortable.

158
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,760
All pulp chassis.

159
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,760
Flexible, yet resilient.

160
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,540
No more difficult de-spumming.

161
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,940
Name one other religion that can make these claims.

162
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,620
Industriosexuals?

163
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,000
Are you guilty of no sex appeal?

164
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,000
You can be more attractive with brain enlargement surgery.

165
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,440
Develop a fuller frontal lobe, like Barbie.

166
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,760
Overcome shyness and guilt with this perfect replacement

167
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,620
for a huge penis.

168
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,060
Or gigantic breasts.

169
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,400
Strap it on.

170
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,620
Your subconscious will do the rest.

171
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,460
Why bulk at anything?

172
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,640
Lose your pants with amazing slack.

173
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,620
There are worse fantasies.

174
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,280
Take and keep it off.

175
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,420
Get out of the dark.

176
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,880
Strum the pipa and rub the dilation.

177
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,500
We love it too.

178
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,240
Do you go soft too soon?

179
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,760
There's nothing to inflate. No zippers or snaps.

180
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,780
Just slip it on over your inhibitions and wow!

181
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,880
Don't worry about the abrasions if you start to overheat.

182
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,860
Automatic stake in the heart shuts it right down.

183
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,740
You'll shout hallelujah P-Dawg when you feast your eyes on this little sweetheart.

184
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:25,600
She jiggles, she shakes, she oozes like a prairie squid on a hot platter.

185
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,700
But best of all, you can be a virgin or an atheist.

186
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,280
And we'll still let you be a subgenius.

187
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,720
And thanks to...

188
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,740
Reverend Gene Osai.

189
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,820
For that lovely background music.

190
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,600
Aw yeah.

191
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,860
You are now about to begin...

192
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,740
A great adventure.

193
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,680
The journey...

194
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,920
Out of your mind.

195
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,160
Hush now little one, don't be scared.

196
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,880
Come sit with me on my favorite fucking chair.

197
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,460
I'll be right back.

198
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,920
Please tell me a story Mr. Mushroom.

199
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:30,100
Well then, would you like to hear something really scary?

200
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,380
Hmm?

201
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,940
Spitz-Ride.

202
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,140
Spitz-Ride.

203
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,340
Spitz-Ride.

204
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,520
Spitz-Ride.

205
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,660
Spitz-Ride.

206
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,620
Spitz-Ride.

207
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,000
Spitz-Ride.

208
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,180
Spitz-Ride.

209
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,740
Spitz-Ride.

210
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:56,740


211
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,360
Splat.

212
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:57,620
Spitz.

213
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:58,220


214
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:58,220


215
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,460
Continuously.

216
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,480
Incredible.

217
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:03,740
Do you ever feel that puking backs of your nose?

218
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:07,960
Well, you're right, there was only one thing I could Edgeaku.

219
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,360
We don't use needles or anything like that.

220
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,280
Yeah, now the shot is that.

221
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:10,940
Ok, well.

222
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,460
What's is that supposed to mean?

223
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,020
That's why we gottaad to it while we talk to her.

224
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,380
Okay.

225
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,400
Thank you.

226
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,020
Thank you.

227
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,660
Thank you.

228
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:50,020
And this is another psychedelic pop album.

229
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,480
It's a CD from Freak Beat Magazine,

230
00:13:54,260 --> 00:14:00,180
who has presented this thing called A Psychedelic Sauna.

231
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:04,320
And I was scanning through it, and everything good from it,

232
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,200
you just heard in that little musical collage I just played.

233
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,980
But although that instrumental part was the middle of a song

234
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,000
called Conspiracy by Me.

235
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,860
Mandragora.

236
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,900
However, the words were completely muffled,

237
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,220
and so I didn't try to play the whole thing.

238
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,420
But there was, out of all these 18 songs,

239
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:34,940
here was one by Poisoned Electric Head called Snobs.

240
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:39,120
And I thought you might likely to hear that.

241
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,000
Yeah.

242
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:12,640
And I thought you might likely to hear that.

243
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,180
They tell the dollar to stay away from people like you.

244
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,540
What you?

245
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,940
Just a socially inferior, defective, unwaking class too.

246
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,700
Don't stop thinking about you.

247
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,100
Think about you.

248
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,500
Don't stop thinking about you.

249
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,960
Think about you.

250
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:46,000
Don't stop thinking about you.

251
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,320
I went to the bank just to check on if I had enough

252
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,380
I made a packet but the file I packed was bigger than a summer roll suit

253
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:08,260
I thought I was a bum cause I didn't have a little amount of shit

254
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,920
One way or the other, what can I do?

255
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,980
I don't know what to do, I just want to see what I can do

256
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,840
I don't know what to do, I just want to see what I can do

257
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,660
We live in a neighborhood where everybody has a nice car

258
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,640
But no one's ever seen a real assistant living in a car

259
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:08,360
I've been to restaurants, I've been to chicken and wine bars

260
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,940
MKR, the West and the Indians were better seen for my car

261
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,720
No zone, they think they're better than you

262
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,240
They think they're better than you

263
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,520
No zone, they think they're better than you

264
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,180
They think they're better than you

265
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:33,460
No zone, they think they're better than you

266
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,960
They think they're better than you

267
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,000
Don't ask電Xun for extra benefits

268
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,120
ад Sofia

269
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,980
Don't ask them for extra formulas

270
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:46,000
Sister off-ipping

271
00:17:51,000 --> 00:18:01,200
Once you learn to understand the criteria for evaluating the truth or falsehood of a particular concept or statement,

272
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:10,820
you find that there are ever-branching paths that can lead one down in determining what is reality.

273
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:15,000
And Jerry, the UFOs are real. They are real.

274
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:27,600
However, the reality of them is so mind-boggling that words that we can understand have not yet been invented for the truth behind them.

275
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,560
And there is much more to be learned.

276
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:39,440
We're just grasping at the first inklings of what the truth is about these presences in our midst.

277
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:46,000
These are enlightening keys to the computer god worldwide top secret number code, which stratifies everything.

278
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,020
Not only the four billion living people, the computer god adopted it for speed and clarity.

279
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,540
This said number code is the means to make possible the computer god worldwide containment policy for stratification.

280
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,120
Why did it take one second in time to evolve X particles, quarks, nucleons, neutrinos, and electrons,

281
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:07,460
but it took one million years to form nuclei and then atoms?

282
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,400
Because Meekie wanted it that way.

283
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,200
Oh, what a depressing, paranoid answer.

284
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,740
And yet I sense there's a great deal of truth in it.

285
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:21,760
You know, recently I managed to perform a scientific experiment and, uh, gee, this is my apparatus right here.

286
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,920
I, I managed to pull in...

287
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,740
Hey, get that apparatus away.

288
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,620
I just wanted to show you the actual face of Meekie.

289
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,540
I've got it. I captured it and I made this image and I mailed it to, uh, Ivan Stang just, um, when? Just today.

290
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,140
Did he? So he won't get it for a while.

291
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:40,800
He won't get it for a while.

292
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:50,640
No, but when he gets it, it may cause his eyes to freeze in their sockets and each particular hair to stand on end like quills upon the fretful porpentine.

293
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,700
So it's like the Shroud of C.E., then?

294
00:19:53,080 --> 00:20:05,040
Well, it's an image. It's an image. It's created out of multi-dimensional bits of micro-information beamed through the reaches of interstellar space back from the cloudy and coheap beginnings of all time.

295
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,580
It's on an Etch-A-Sketch, right?

296
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,340
No, I sketched it on, I mean, I, what's that it say?

297
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:16,440
I enhanced the image. I did add a few details, you know, to make it more sexy.

298
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,940
You were telling us it's just a bit, didn't you?

299
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:23,580
Well, you know, science is largely interpretation. You have to interpret the data.

300
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,260
Isn't everything largely interpretational?

301
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:39,880
Well, he's smoking a pipe. He's smoking a pipe. His face is a dark mass with a few light areas rising out of it. The eyes are not the same size and are sort of round but not perfect.

302
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:45,820
They seem to be watery with light shining through them. There is the suggestion of a pupil.

303
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,360
Ooh.

304
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:58,600
It's, uh, the skin looks scaly and there are pimple-like things also on it. It's shiny on the top and generally the whole thing is a black mass. But it's smoking a pipe.

305
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,800
Well, it looks very familiar.

306
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,340
It looks devilishly so.

307
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,380
Yes, it does.

308
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,040
Uh, you know, this is what I get from my long-range deep dish antenna.

309
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,860
That's what you get from a pipe.

310
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,840
Yeah.

311
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,120
It's a strange dream that you have.

312
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,780
Now, after one million years, I dreamed that the galaxies formed.

313
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,460
Really?

314
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:26,300
Pardon me. I put that the wrong way. I dreamed that the galaxies formed after one million years. After we had, uh, atomic, uh, material.

315
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,060
You've been dreaming for a million years now?

316
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:34,340
Oh, yes. Deep in dreams, strewn with wandering fancies of the mind.

317
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,280
I had a dream about you once.

318
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,380
And what was in it?

319
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,140
You dreamed...

320
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,800
We can't tell that on the radio.

321
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,800
Oh, really? It has to be classified, eh?

322
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,180
Yeah, classified information.

323
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,080
Well, you get to tell your dreams, but others may not be so fortunate.

324
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,740
Others may not get to hear it.

325
00:21:49,860 --> 00:22:09,120
For to pass that grim gate with its blackened and undecipherable inscription, passing under the stained teeth of the portcullis, dried blood-red with rust, and venture yet only part of the way across that moldering ridge, to come so far and yet, through the temerity of timidity, venture no farther, to endure the

326
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,120


327
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,120


328
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,120


329
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:15,660
indulge in withered dithering so that the other side remains unappeasably unvisited, is to fall forever short.

330
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:23,240
Such a shortfall is an eternal embarrassment, and to pull up shorts, sweet as it may feel, still leaves exposed what the dispensation already has revealed.

331
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:32,700
Then, show not your shaking shanks to the prying eyeball of perpetuity, but snap your digits in defiance before the iris of that glaucous orb.

332
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,680
Are you...

333
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,820
Yeah, that's right.

334
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,100
I'm sorry.

335
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:57,660
Indeed, it is Dr. Howell, the good Dr. Howell there, howling away his poor philosophies as best he can, as best any of us can, dear friends.

336
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:05,900
Well, I would like to read to you a little bit more.

337
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,260
This time...

338
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:30,340
The New Book, Revelation X, will feature Gospels by those original thirteen apostles who knew Bob, who knew the Bob at the time, while he was alive and still talking to him.

339
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,440
And I'm just going to read this little section here.

340
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:39,080
This is kind of difficult for me because these are the remembrance books.

341
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:45,620
This is of Dr. Philo Drummond, and he's a friend of mine, and I'm not going to try to imitate the way he talks.

342
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,240
That would be pointless.

343
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:48,940
Uh...

344
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,720
But, uh...

345
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,000
Well, I'll just, I'll just go through it here, friends.

346
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,520
Um...

347
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,460
As we begin here...

348
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,600
Gospel according to Philo...

349
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,400
14.3...

350
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,420
Uh...

351
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,540
Philo is describing, after he had, uh...

352
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:16,040
Had, had risen on the conspiracy ladder...

353
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,720
This was in the, in the 50s, when...

354
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,860
The late 50s, when Bob was working for the conspiracy and had, uh...

355
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,240
Succeeded quite well.

356
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,900
He had not yet rebelled from them.

357
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,800
It says here, as Philo says...

358
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:39,060
Dobbs started getting increasingly paranoid about his enemies, the list of whom grew to include his business rivals, his bosses, his customers, his friends, and his friends.

359
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,780
His mother-in-law, the IRS, the communists, and the Venusians.

360
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,900
He certainly had some enemies, but how could they harm him?

361
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:50,700
But then, Dobbs was never known for his logical thinking.

362
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,440
He became something of a survivalist...

363
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,320
And constructed an elaborate bomb shelter under his backyard.

364
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:04,380
One time, when he sh- was showing off his anti-personnel gear to me, he said...

365
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,520
Give a man a fish.

366
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,140
And you feed him for a day.

367
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,340
Give a man a gun.

368
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:18,080
And others will feed him for a lifetime.

369
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:26,000
It was in this trough of negativity and despondency that Bob began his wanderings.

370
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,140
What we call his lost years.

371
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,520
Uh...

372
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,520
He quit his conspiracy jobs and dropped out of sight.

373
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:38,400
He told me that during this time, the late 50s, he was hitchhiking boat rides around Indonesia...

374
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,500
Trying to discover himself.

375
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,840
And, uh, they goes through various adventures he had.

376
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,440
Okay, I'll start again here.

377
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,880
Uh, 1497.

378
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,620
For- Dobbs, 1497.

379
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,860
His captors sold him into white slavery.

380
00:25:53,960 --> 00:26:01,700
And he was used by a wizened old sultan magician as an experimental sex toy.

381
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:07,420
He has never gone into detail about that, except to say that he learned a lot about himself.

382
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,560
After a couple of years in captivity, he hustled enough money to buy his freedom.

383
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:24,600
He then surfaced in Tibet, at a place called the Plateau of Chang'e, where he fell in with the lamas of the Sarmaun Brotherhood.

384
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:33,560
His arrival was prophesied in their holy text, which said...

385
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,200
He will come to you...

386
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,560
Smoking one pipe...

387
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,100
And having one solitary eyebrow which blights his face.

388
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,420
Dobbs had indeed lost an eyebrow.

389
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,200
He told the sultan... the Tibetans...

390
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,480
That it was because he had been branded by the sultan.

391
00:26:52,760 --> 00:27:00,640
But in fact, he had lost it by lighting the pipe too close to his face while fraternizing with his Burmese captors.

392
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:05,140
He successfully sued the Jakarta lighter manufacturer in 1960.

393
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:15,280
For a while, I think Bob got his kicks from flaunting his amoral western ways in the lamas' faces.

394
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:26,360
But their patience must have been rewarded, because he ended up swearing off his gamboling and sinning, and joined their monastery as a fellow monk.

395
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:36,180
Bob threw himself into the discipline, heart and soul, becoming such a good meditator, that he developed calluses on his scalp from standing up.

396
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,560
And he was standing on his head for so long every day.

397
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:52,920
He went for two years without bathing, wiping, or changing his clothing, letting the rain and the urine or spittle of his detractors wash him.

398
00:27:53,360 --> 00:28:02,840
He wore barbed wire shirts, put nails in his shoes, and rolled in thorn bushes every time he had an impure thought,

399
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,120
which he defined as the urge to sell.

400
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:17,500
He rode through all the villages backwards on an ass, wearing a dunce cap on which all his sins were listed.

401
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:24,620
Beset by tulpas of his own creation, he suffered poltergeist attacks continuously.

402
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,620
He lived in caves and fasted for months.

403
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:36,160
He wanted to levitate himself into the sky to escape the stench of death.

404
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,160


405
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:42,180
of humans, as he said, but, because he was afraid of heights, stayed inside and let his

406
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,960
head bump the cave roof instead.

407
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:52,380
Eventually, for Bob, there was no longer any difference between meditating and not meditating.

408
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:59,300
Every single word, thought, or act became a meditation, and thenceforth he was able

409
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:04,180
to practice unlimited action, or not think, trademark.

410
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:12,080
At this point, he abandoned his severe asceticism and more or less reverted to his old goatish ways.

411
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,560
As Bob told me upon his return,

412
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:27,220
One must be totally free from desire to achieve true freedom, and that means acquiring everything you desire.

413
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:32,060
I am become like a handywife.

414
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,100
A handywife.

415
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:44,060
The first one.

416
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:50,260
The woman that was too beautiful for the normals have let me sleep with them.

417
00:29:50,380 --> 00:30:01,120
The hunchbacked and obese and elderly ones and the cripples, and to me, each was the most beautiful woman on earth.

418
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,160
I have made love to two women.

419
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,700
I have made love to ten thousand beings.

420
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:10,900
But not once was the act defiled by lust.

421
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,300
I loved them with all my soul.

422
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,920
Similarly, I loved all the animals.

423
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:24,260
Animals have the Buddha nature, more so than humans.

424
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:30,420
And if one feels affection and lust for them, they will return it.

425
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,280
Except for chickens.

426
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:45,280
I would kill just the first to catch all the move-on

427
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:45,520
And they would be unwanted women, no matter how powerful they were.

428
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,420
The venomless and vile sonata sometimes can be aMelena again.

429
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:47,420


430
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:59,700
Oh yes dear friends, some readings from a new unpublishable book of the subgenius.

431
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:04,160
Yes, unpublishable, because sometimes it seems to be internal Hebrew,

432
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,160


433
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,160


434
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,160


435
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,160


436
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:21,700
Unfinishable. Ah, yes. Like this show. This show that never, never seems to quite go away and leave us in the peace we so rightly deserve. Do we not, my friends?

437
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:47,280
Oh, yes. And as I wait simply for this side of the show to end so that I can start the next side of the show, padding your spiritual emptiness as well as mine, just to get us through one more week, yes?

438
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,880
Yes. Yes.

439
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,620
Some people say they wouldn't be able to go into

440
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:58,480
work on Monday were it not for this horrible show, this hour of slack, and I'm sorry that we...

441
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,540
Are you on drugs, sir? I bet you use marijuana and all this kind of stuff.

442
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:09,260
You can come on down from the bathroom, honey. It's okay. I've got new brain in a briefcase.

443
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:13,080
You don't have to agonize on the toilet all morning trying to organize your thoughts.

444
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,120
I'll have the skin flaps folded, Margaret. I'm meeting with the CEO of Einvelt Petroleum.

445
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,500
As long as there's parkmen around the mummies,

446
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,440
there's going to be plenty of gravy for us white exploiter classes.

447
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,880
Okay, great. Then I'll just turn off the oatmeal.

448
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,840
And you can turn them inside out for greater storage space.

449
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,660
There's no floppy disks or software to worry about.

450
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:42,780
Only creased convulsions of pure synthetic brain tissue.

451
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:46,980
It's more than the party gag sensation of the 21st century.

452
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,200
It's... it's... it's...

453
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,220
It's a paranormal...

454
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,360
It's a paranormal thing.

455
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:53,360


456
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:53,360


457
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:53,360


458
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:53,360


459
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,760
No, I would say that is quite a... unfortunately, a normal activity.

460
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:02,600
How so? How can a normal person kill another person?

461
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,140
Well, it certainly happens all too frequently.

462
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,680
It does, but explain to me...

463
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:08,460
Go ahead.

464
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,820
It is explainable by certainly known laws of physics.

465
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,780
However, you're correct.

466
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:20,980
The emotional states that result in civil disorder could have an influence.

467
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,860
From beyond, certainly mere physical matter.

468
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,320
How can a... how can a person kill a stranger for no reason?

469
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:34,120
How can they kill a person for... a stranger for no reason?

470
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:42,720
Collar, you're posing a question that has baffled mankind for thousands of years,

471
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,880
and I don't know if we can...

472
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,020
It's not paranormal. As you said yourself, it's normal.

473
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,840
You have to, uh, you know...

474
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:59,100
It's about something different, you know, as into, uh, uh, ergonomic qualities or something like that,

475
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,960
or, uh, parabolic abnormalities or something, don't you?

476
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,260
Well, I... I don't know if parabolic abnormalities quite fit into this category,

477
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,560
but, Collar, I... I thank you for your concern in this matter,

478
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:16,140
and, uh, I hope, uh, perhaps someday on this station you will hear that song, Cop Killer.

479
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,200
Thank you for calling.

480
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,240
Yeah, you're trying to get off.

481
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,640
Yeah, that's correct. Thank you.

482
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,020
Okay, yeah.

483
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,940
When I'm about, when I'm about this, but when it's...

484
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,740
Food is splendid.

485
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,120
It will pass.

486
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,160
Ten percent said they used it daily.

487
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:36,940
There's a bank parking lot across the street, plus there's, uh, parking there in the Holiday Inn.

488
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,580
Don't you want to be part of that expansion?

489
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,440
Don't stop! Don't stop!

490
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,300
Stop! Or it could be your job in life.

491
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,320
Uh...

492
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,680
Uh-uh.

493
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,620
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

494
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,440
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

495
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,140
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

496
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:05,960
Hola!

497
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,520
Ah!

498
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,300
Ah!

499
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,120
Ah!

500
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,120
I love how you love me.

501
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:13,740
That's great.

502
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,380
That was great. Please call back with more of that.

503
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,880
I hate Claudie Lange.

504
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,660
I hate her.

505
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,920
You smoked faster, Williams.

506
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,260
Robert Williams is a bizarre painter.

507
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,520
He's painted himself blue, like his mailbox.

508
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,180
He's dancing.

509
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,680
That's a euphemism for a male man.

510
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,760
Oh, stop cooing like a dove, my dove.

511
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,520
And come close to my bosom.

512
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,880
I mean, bring your bosom closer to me.

513
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,820
And sit here on this swingy...

514
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:56,620
step why will you have some landa made hello yes landa made filled with ls potatoes drink it drink

515
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:08,160
it down i'm sorry hello hello i have recipe for you oh i received what gave a whisper yeah what is

516
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:18,140
it to take its recipe for pitted chicken bread pitted chicken breasts yes and how do you prepare

517
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:26,720
this delightful deluxe take a chicken breast open up you take a pitted olive

518
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:32,700
pour down the hatch there and you stick them under your armpit there

519
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:40,800
and you get some duct tape and tape them in real good and nice that's that that sounds very very

520
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:47,440
not well let's not say celebrities yourself savory but probably granger like yeah yeah

521
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:53,060
exactly it's kind of like what a chicken eats when it needs things in its throat to confuse its food

522
00:36:53,060 --> 00:37:00,180
ah huh yeah i see because you can't really digest the food if the chicken digests itself in your

523
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:06,620
stomach for you exactly but how do you pass the duct tape so then so then you take it and patch

524
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:14,980
the duct tape real good there yes and then assuming you have ovens pre-heated 400 okay assuming you

525
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,660
not have a home you walk in oven

526
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,040
You walk in oven.

527
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,300
And stay in there for three hours.

528
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,620
And then you come out and chicken bun.

529
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,140
Bon appetit.

530
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,620
Well, what a delightful and yet stupid recipe.

531
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:40,720
Because why would anyone want to stay in a 400-pound dung heap for three hours without one of those little digestive devices we all have to wear?

532
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,220
And it sometimes looks like duct tape, but it's still a hernia device.

533
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:51,560
So always, always, please remember this thing is dangerous.

534
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,760
It's not something you flip on like a girdle.

535
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:02,180
It's something that you put on like a taxonomic dessert that you kind of wish to fry on your friends.

536
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,780
You've been unseemly in your behavior.

537
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,260
No, no, friends.

538
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,420
These new duct tape corsets are fireproof.

539
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,860
They're osculoresistant.

540
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,980
And they also cause cerebral hemorrhaging.

541
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,700
I'm sorry.

542
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,000
Just had to make that doubly, doubly clear.

543
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:28,160
And at the end of the day, we're just going to have to be able to...

544
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,720
Next!

545
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:34,400
I push my pets away.

546
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,580
And while I'm standing there, pull down my underwear.

547
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,180
Try my La Flambier.

548
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,540
All right, here we go.

549
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,100
I've just been here this way.

550
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,200
Now I'm...

551
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,180
Still are their underwear.

552
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,480
Still are their straight and bare.

553
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,320
And brains.

554
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,560
But it's impossible.

555
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:53,920
That's right.

556
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,680
Because I should switch to my better copy of what comes up next there.

557
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:01,800
But first, before that, I should tell you what you heard.

558
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,780
Just then, I was...

559
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,900
Oh, little radio bit.

560
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,380
Whoa!

561
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,800
Oh, man.

562
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,020
God damn it.

563
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,460
Jeez.

564
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,360
I'm sorry, friends.

565
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,500
I was really surprised.

566
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,380
We've got this...

567
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,540
I didn't mean to...

568
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,220
Lose myself that way.

569
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,440
I honestly didn't.

570
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,900
But some of these things are unbelievably...

571
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:24,560
Whoa!

572
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,580
They're very real.

573
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,000
They're very real and they're very frightening.

574
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,860
And I'm sorry.

575
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,200
That just really threw me.

576
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:37,640
You think it's easy coming in here and doing these radio shows.

577
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,400
You think, oh, yeah, these guys get paid a lot.

578
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,780
They just come right in here and they can cuss all day.

579
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,200
They're like Howard Stern.

580
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,480
Hey, get away with murder.

581
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,120
I'm sorry.

582
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,120
I'm sorry.

583
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:47,260
I'm sorry.

584
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:47,260


585
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:47,620
But it's...

586
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,120
It's...

587
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,620
They...

588
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:49,500
Won't.

589
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,200
I don't use my head.

590
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,840
And they come back and forth.

591
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,400
They're in between.

592
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:53,940
See?

593
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,500
They're in the interspecies.

594
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,760
It's like an itch between your ear and your throat.

595
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,620
And the only way you can kind of scratch it, you can't...

596
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,580
You stick your finger in your ear and wiggle it.

597
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,360
But that doesn't help.

598
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:09,020
And about all you can do is kind of just go...

599
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,200
Yeah.

600
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:10,500
Yeah.

601
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,000
Yeah.

602
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:12,920
Yeah.

603
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:13,480


604
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:13,660
Yeah.

605
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:13,880
Yeah.

606
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:13,880


607
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:13,900
Yeah.

608
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,260
Yeah.

609
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:14,260


610
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:14,260


611
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:14,260


612
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:14,260


613
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:14,260


614
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:14,280


615
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,220
So, you can imagine.

616
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,340
You can probably...

617
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,420
Well, you can probably imagine.

618
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,840
The recipe...

619
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,280
We're so glad to be able to give you a recipe for the pitted chicken.

620
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:34,740
That was the Brain Rot East Coast or East Lake show on WCSB.

621
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:39,560
Loathsome Cowboy Dave and Scabbly Chaz Dave.

622
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,160
All three of them on that show.

623
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:48,060
And before that was a bit of a ZXQ radio show.

624
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,080
Alabama Neptune's show.

625
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,080
And a little Brain Rot.

626
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:02,860
Before that was some media barrages from Brain Rot West.

627
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,620
That's right.

628
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,860
And Michael Taylor Duke.

629
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,040
Don't you see?

630
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,500
But...

631
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:11,560
But...

632
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:12,800
But...

633
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,140
But...

634
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:13,140


635
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:13,140


636
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:13,140


637
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:13,140


638
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:13,140


639
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:13,140


640
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:13,140


641
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:13,140


642
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:13,140


643
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:13,160


644
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:13,560
But...

645
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,900
But...

646
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,200
But...

647
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:16,900
But...

648
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,720
But...

649
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,280
But...

650
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:21,280


651
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:21,280


652
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:21,280


653
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:21,280


654
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:21,280


655
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:21,280


656
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,340
Let's just...

657
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,500
Yes, yes, let's take a few more minutes.

658
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:33,980
Yes, they did spend an hour, guess me.

659
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,960
Now, actually, you know, corporate

660
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,100
Yeah, I'm just saying.

661
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:38,100


662
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,140
But can you put your hand there?

663
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:47,460
back there off because it's going to make me cuss again if I see how do I handle that for the out

664
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:54,520
of town shows you know that I have to cut the cussing out that I involuntarily did and yet here

665
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:59,960
I am referring back to it again you see I'll either have to put another sound effect in here

666
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:05,240
some little piece anyway okay okay then let's quit acting like regular preachers this is a

667
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:14,520
subgenius preaching here from Revelation X the Bob Apocryphon chapter 11 be actually the fall

668
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:25,860
of mutantis because how was it dear friends that we the lowly subgenie came to fall so far

669
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:33,200
from that yeti state of glory that heaven that was mutantis

670
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:33,960
you

671
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,520
you

672
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:43,860
and it was because the yeti made millions of terrible mistakes they called these mistakes

673
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:56,320
humans the human is far worse than a mere dna backfire evolved randomly over millions of years

674
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:02,640
everything that makes the human the spiteful murdering self-deluding barbarian that it is

675
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,880
was carefully installed by

676
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,040
you

677
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,800
and it was because the human was the most evil and the most evil of all the humans

678
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:15,400
the following is based on material dredged up from Bob's past life regressions under hypnosis

679
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:21,760
these ancestral memories come to him in non chronological bits and pieces our monks spent

680
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:26,840
many years piecing together his trance statements to reconstruct these most critical events

681
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,420
in yeti history

682
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:35,220
80 million years ago the closest thing to the true history of the human being is the

683
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:43,400
mass embedding problem the medical laboratory wiping away the

684
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,480
angry

685
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,820
vs

686
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,720
Ultimates

687
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:53,780
is

688
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:54,100
the

689
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:54,720
opposite

690
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:54,740
and

691

the

693

00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:03,740
one of our otherkim

700
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:09,820
reptiles senselessly fought and bedeviled each other. They were the ideal omnivores

701
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:15,100
for the experiments. Hardy and tenacious, they could survive anywhere like roaches.

702
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:24,540
These, the Yeti bred step by step into human pinks. The initial attempt produced blank-faced,

703
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:31,140
slack-jawed, apish pre-humans, more or less like Australopithecus, whose only defense

704
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:37,560
against predators was their unbearable odor. Their weak souls had a tendency to detach

705
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:44,620
and wander away shortly after birth. And worse, they were almost too stupid to copulate. The

706
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:50,620
thick-headed beasts practically had to be shown how. Their attention spans were so weak

707
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:57,060
that half the offspring they did manage to whelp were abandoned or eaten. With such low

708
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:01,120
imaginations and libidos, they wouldn't procreate fast enough.

709
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:01,120


710
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:10,980
The Yeti scientists proposed a challenge. To somehow make the humanoids enjoy coitus!

711
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:19,000
And even to pair bond, so that parents might tolerate their broods until they reached childbearing

712
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:25,500
age. The bodies required redesigning so that, no matter how they happened to bump into each

713
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:30,940
other, the creatures would still be able to stumble upon suitable positions and figure

714
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:31,120
out which ones they were.

715
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:40,440
The pelvis was swiveled, and the pelvis was raised. The degree of roundness and baldness

716
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:48,440
on the rumps of the females directly correlated with male sexual interest. It was theorized

717
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:56,500
that the doltish males would be twice as likely to breed if inspired by a second set of globular

718
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:00,940
sex triggers. The Yeti decided to duplicate these large

719
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:08,120
hind appurtenances on the fronts of the females by enlarging the lactating glands into

720
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:16,300
soft, bouncy buttock-fetched symbols. These counterfeit behinds were made target-like

721
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:21,800
by the addition of circles and dots that would change shape when played with, exciting the

722
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:28,400
females and keeping the males interested long enough to find the right place for seed dispensation.

723
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,920
And since the Yeti's first appearance in the male's body was a result of the male's

724
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:30,920


725
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:30,920


726
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:36,160
body, the Yeti greatly enjoyed pairs of soft hemial voids on each other. They reasoned

727
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:41,200
that it might be doing the humans a favor to drape them with even more large lactating

728
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:47,200
glands. They tried many combinations, hanging two in the front and three in the back, one

729
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:53,180
on either side of the head, rows of eight, four on each side. Some humans, they completely

730
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:59,640
surrounded with huge colorful cushions for the tuberosities of the ischium, with openings

731
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,140
everywhere.

732
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:08,440
But yet, the Yeti's found, making it all so easy lowered the anguish content of the

733
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:16,240
livestock's souls. If the souls weren't well-fatted on pain, there was no self-awareness and the

734
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:22,940
soul essence went flat. The Exists had no use for flat souls.

735
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:30,120
To increase the pain level, the Yeti found ways to make the humans both desperate and

736
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:30,120


737
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:30,120


738
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:36,560
eager to breed, yet foolish enough to cause themselves endless hardships in the process.

739
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:43,020
They amped up the neural connectors between the desire gland and that section of the brain

740
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:50,200
which lights up during sexual excitation. Chromosomes were tweaked, enlarging the desire

741
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:56,560
gland to twice normal size. Most of the logic centers of the brain had to be removed to

742
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,640
make room for it.

743
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,100
The tiny pleasure receptors were the only ones that could be removed. The tiny pleasure

744
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:07,860
receptors were dilated into such gaping cavities that the gland could never be stimulated enough,

745
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:15,440
compelling the humans to constantly also seek alternatives to sex, convincing themselves

746
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:23,560
that there might be something better. The anguish shortage and fecundity dilemmas were

747
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:30,100
solved. The head and genital chakras were realigned to stay unbalanced, never to be

748
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:36,040
synchronized. Instead of smoothly circulating, the sex-hurt energy would snap back and forth

749
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:41,920
spastically between head and groin. Whenever the little brain between the legs was charged

750
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:49,960
up, the head brain was at its most vulnerable and suggestible, rendering their minds laughably

751
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:59,060
malleable. By modifying the reward secretion distributor's trigger configurations, the

752
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:00,080
Yeti discovered a new way to deal with the pain. The head brain was at its most vulnerable,

753
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,040
fabricating it itself. The most

754
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,820
stable mode of injection for the feast ought to be the third noble devil. Even the forefront

And... where's the rest of my page?

764
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:55,560
Worse point, but where's page two of the Holy Gospel of the Yeti? I don't believe it!

765
00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:01,440
Friends, I guess you won't get to find out just what happened to make the...

766
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:05,800
Let's see here...

767
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:16,760
Why, this is just... why it's just so embarrassing, but you know, that's just the way these radio shows get falling together every now and then.

768
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:25,280
There's why... I guess we'll just have to continue the fall of Mutantis.

769
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:32,600
Next week, when we learn how the humans were designed...

770
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:48,020
The flaws in those designs, dear friends, and how the great empire of the Yeti, Mutantis itself, came to fall, and the humans to escape.

771
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:50,480
Yes, to escape.

772
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,400
Was then the conspiracy an accident?

773
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:55,540
Dear friends...

774
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,740
I think not.

775
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:05,620
No more so than, say, the KPFA radio show in Berkeley with puzzling evidence and Dr. Howell.

776
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,440
As Moe Factor is... punched up?

777
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,000
Who are we, and why are we here?

778
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,900
No, of your information, who are we?

779
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,280
Who are you?

780
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,800
Little bits of nothingness?

781
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:15,640
Who are you?

782
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:16,900
Hmm, that's a good start.

783
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:25,540
Well, let's look at it in a linear fashion, as if the show is a line, that it could be a line without end in a circle, or it could be...

784
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:29,140
...that the line has one end with us at it, and another end with you at it.

785
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:35,000
So, when the show travels from point A to point B, then you receive it, and you send it back to us back to point A.

786
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:35,900
Hmm, just the murder service punch-up.

787
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,060
It's described as A-B-A.

788
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:40,460
Yeah, this is not a jury, it's a jury of business candidates, uh, listening to us, uh...

789
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:40,780
Yeah.

790
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,600
Are we doing... are you guys going to be...

791
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,000
Thanks for speaking with me this morning.

792
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:47,200
Yeah, that's what we do. Okay, now, the other caller's talking to you there, right?

793
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:47,360
Sorry.

794
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:52,360
Well, I think the main issue is character, now. Why do we let characters like... like this on the air?

795
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:52,960
I'm not going to talk about character.

796
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,100
Okay, now we're at the caller debate.

797
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:55,520
No one's talking about character.

798
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,520
Do you want to answer that question, caller?

799
00:51:58,920 --> 00:51:59,320
Uh...

800
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,520
Let me ask the caller, random subgenius.

801
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:04,280
All right, let's see if Frank Bent wants to know about the question of character.

802
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:09,120
Now, nobody's asked a question about the subgenius, and so does the audience have a question about the subgenius?

803
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,280
Is there another subgenius caller still there?

804
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:12,600
I don't know.

805
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,060
There he is!

806
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,400
Oh, there, yeah, yeah, I think he just fell off the edge of the podium there, he's walking around.

807
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:18,720
Increase the magnification.

808
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:23,560
Do you feel you're better off now than you were ten years ago as a subgenius, can I answer that?

809
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:25,280
Uh, most definitely.

810
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:31,000
Because there... the issues are being exposed here, and finally we're dealing with everything.

811
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,280
Well, you know, it did happen on our watch, I'm not taking all the credit for it, but...

812
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,680
I'm ready to point the fingers and, uh, put the screws...

813
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,600
Put that finger away.

814
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:41,260
...down to where they... the screw holes and where they belong here.

815
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:42,540
Hey, keep it clean, fella.

816
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:46,080
But I feel if you know the problems inside out, then eventually you can solve them.

817
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:49,080
If you deny them, then sure, you're going to ignore them and...

818
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:52,740
No, there's one little thing here we're neglecting to acknowledge.

819
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,160
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please!

820
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:55,880
Our time is running short.

821
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,840
As far as I'm sure... I'm saying you had a good thing going there at one point, way back then, but, uh...

822
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:05,520
Then there was this, uh, unfortunate, uh, episode where he got... he got a visit from the...

823
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,920
Do you remember that fella?

824
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,180
Oh, the Mustafa?

825
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:12,660
Yeah, right, and they wanted to know, you know, he accidentally said a few clumsy things in the book,

826
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:19,260
and now they were down on his... on his, uh, tail, and he was having to give them subscriptions and explanations and everything, you know, and, uh...

827
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:20,200
Well, your family's threatened.

828
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:24,140
Yeah, well, it... see, that's... that's just the thing, though, you know, like, I can't... I can't... I can't...

829
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:28,880
I can't shake this image. I see him, I have to think, sitting there, his hands, his hands, his knobby knees, just a-knocking, thinking to himself,

830
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,680
well, well, maybe this was just a joke religion after all, yeah.

831
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:35,360
Fellow, you worry too much over matters that concern you not.

832
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,540
Leave gourmandizing, know you not the grave gets wider for thee than for other men?

833
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:43,620
Huh? What happened?

834
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,780
Uh, the eternal silence of infinite space.

835
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,220
Millions and millions of miles long, or big, or wide, or however you call it.

836
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:53,480
There's the mission going down the wire.

837
00:53:54,140 --> 00:54:07,700
For the first time, scientists have been able to directly view a human brain, human thought processes, tracing the complex patterns of electrical and chemical reactions to small clusters of brain cells.

838
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,940
Gauss? Or something?

839
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:11,820
What's that?

840
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:12,120
A cow?

841
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,580
A gauss-y.

842
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:14,900
Gow?

843
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:15,860
Gauss.

844
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:21,040
Gauss! Oh, degaussing the magnetic minds. Yes, I have to do it every day before I get out of bed.

845
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:21,880
Oh, God.

846
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:22,920
Means you're getting old.

847
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,000
Oh, my God, you guys are too funny.

848
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:29,400
Well, I don't, I was born that way.

849
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:32,780
I'm not sure why degaussing is so funny. It's something you just have to do.

850
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:39,960
Oh, I know, yeah, those lines of Gauss, my uncle has gone through it many times, and we just crack up. I just, you know, say it's like this.

851
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:40,420
Right.

852
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:48,340
I just remember by thinking, you know, the gassiest stuff, you know, and we know, I know what he's talking about, but he knows, like, the guy that invented it and all that.

853
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:50,980
The gassiest mineral, vegetable, animal, I know.

854
00:54:50,980 --> 00:55:02,160
As we wander through life, we have to keep those bits of antimatter walled up and captivated in a magnetic model.

855
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:07,060
And I'm wondering now, do you guys actually tell a comic story during this?

856
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:10,520
Our lives are a passion or a comic story.

857
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:14,900
Okay, so you don't tell, you tell anything out of a book or anything?

858
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:15,900
A book.

859
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:16,740
I mean, are you telling?

860
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:18,900
The only book that we...

861
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,000
Okay.

862
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,740
You know, it's the book of the sub-genius.

863
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:26,800
We're not allowed to plug it on the air because this is listener-censored radio, but there is indeed a book.

864
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,580
A book whose...

865
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:29,260
No, the one that you read out of each time.

866
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:31,360
Every chapter is better than the one before.

867
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:34,200
Okay, so it's just the chapters of life.

868
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:38,120
Yeah, now, we're not actually reading out of it, but there is such a book.

869
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,820
Well, the book is within your head.

870
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:40,440
Yes.

871
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:44,900
Oh, there was a little sample of it right there. That's some of the static between my ears.

872
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:45,600
Oh, my God.

873
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:49,980
All our dialogue to answer your question is ad libatory.

874
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:51,900
Okay.

875
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:58,740
So, some of these dilemmas maybe that you're talking about could be somebody's reality that they're going through at the time?

876
00:55:58,980 --> 00:55:59,700
Yeah, yeah.

877
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:00,240
Okay.

878
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:05,560
It's an interwoven, sort of like one of those hair club for men things.

879
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:09,480
Yes, I'm not only a show customer, I'm also a victim.

880
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,060
It could be real, but it could be imitation. That's what you're trying to present me.

881
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:18,520
Well, an imitation only in the sense that all of existence is an imitation of some eternal form which exists.

882
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:19,680
This show has to be on at 4.30.

883
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:19,960
Without a doubt.

884
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:20,120
It's a good morning.

885
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,000
So do you need...

886
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,660
...in the infinite darkness of outer space.

887
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:23,880
Oh, God.

888
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:23,880


889
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:24,340
Me and my...

890
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:25,220
It sure is cold out here.

891
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:29,840
It doesn't matter what time of the day or night this is, this can happen at any time.

892
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:30,940
What happened?

893
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:32,420
Did you have a mishap?

894
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:32,980
Did you see a monster?

895
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,220
Here, let me get my paper out here.

896
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,400
Now, let's go over that again.

897
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,100
You say you saw some sort of monster?

898
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:37,660
Monster?

899
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:38,860
Oh, I don't know.

900
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:40,100
Why don't we just talk about monster?

901
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:43,760
Don't you know that science has definitely proved there are no monsters?

902
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,960
This is the 20th century.

903
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,240
We've put a man on the moon.

904
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,840
Now, the human mind's a funny thing.

905
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:49,960
It's a very strange thing.

906
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:49,960


907
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,300
It plays strange tricks.

908
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:56,140
I'm sure you thought you saw what you said you thought you saw.

909
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:56,740
Oh, no, no.

910
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,600
I know about the illusions and all that.

911
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:04,500
Beware of the false fires leading you deeper and deeper into the swamps, the dancing lights

912
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,100
of deception.

913
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,240
Yeah, but the dancing chihuahuas I worry about.

914
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:08,860
Oh, I know.

915
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,360
I know the chihuahuas' deception.

916
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,280
Last year we had them at the show and they made a mess.

917
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:15,280
Just before, we had the flamenco people that came out right after them.

918
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:18,120
How are they supposed to dance with feathers everywhere and bits of costume?

919
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,960
Those pink lawn plastic flamenco people.

920
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:19,960


921
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:19,960


922
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:19,960


923
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:19,960


924
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:19,960


925
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:19,960


926
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:19,960


927
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:23,660
We can use those as an aid to create your little whirly bird type of maneuvers.

928
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:29,600
Or we can just take the seeds of the, whatchamacallit, that are shaped like little propellers that

929
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,580
come a-spinning down.

930
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,280
They're hallucinogenic, too.

931
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:32,620
They come a-spinning down.

932
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:33,820
I beg your pardon?

933
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:36,060
They come a-spinning down.

934
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,740
They come a-spinning down.

935
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:39,920
Banisteriopsis something-eye.

936
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,220
They come a-spinning down.

937
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:42,780
Yes, indeed.

938
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:43,660
Oh, good.

939
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,320
And so do you, after you brew a tea made of these little things and drink it.

940
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:49,540
Woo!

941
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:56,040
In short, we need not follow the foolish fires of novelty for its own sake.

942
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,460
No, let's go adventuring.

943
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:58,220
Okay.

944
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:00,920
Are you guys the flilty people?

945
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:01,660
You bet.

946
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,860
You could call us that.

947
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:03,380
Oh, yeah.

948
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:08,040
When you see us on the road checking out a crank call at some weird early hour of

949
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,780
the morning, we're in our fully equipped Land Rover.

950
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:11,780
Oh.

951
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,640
We've got every convenience of modern science.

952
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:16,560
Hey, open up the pool, Hal.

953
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:17,480
It's gone.

954
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,520
Well, it's kind of cold, but I'll just go and get it.

955
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:19,520


956
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:19,520


957
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:19,520


958
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:19,520


959
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:19,520


960
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:19,520


961
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:19,520


962
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:19,520


963
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:19,520


964
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:19,520


965
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:23,180
I'll just reel the plastic cover back off, slow down a little bit, and we'll take a dip.

966
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:27,880
Right on the blast off or submerged at any point.

967
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:28,820
That's right.

968
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:29,980
The flying tub.

969
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,440
A miracle of modern science.

970
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:38,060
Well, that's pretty much what my car is, and it's just a 1985 Crown Victoria station wagon.

971
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,280
Oh, man.

972
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:47,780
And Dr. Howell drives listeners insane.

973
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:49,500
Yes, he does.

974
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:49,500


975
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:49,500


976
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:58,920
Listeners to his show, his puzzling evidences show there in lowly and humble Berkeley.

977
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:05,100
God save those poor men living in that place, awful place.

978
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:10,880
And you're listening to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack, the compendium and

979
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:17,980
compilation of all the greatest subgenius tapes and all that kind of stuff.

980
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:23,880
From the church of the subgenius.

981
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:29,880
And I'm going to give you a number to write to that self-same church so that you may glean

982
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:36,600
for yourself information about the books, tapes, and all the marvelous things that you

983
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:39,060
can't know about until then.

984
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:42,360
And that number to write, just write to, just address it to Bob, friends.

985
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:45,240
That way, that's how we know they come from radio listeners.

986
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,960
Just address it to Bob at postoffice.com.

987
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:47,960


988
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:56,600
That's postoffice box 1403-06, Dallas, Texas 7214.

989
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:03,080
That's PO box 1403-06, Dallas, Texas 7214.

990
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:09,400
And even though we're late getting our book out and our magazine, of course, always takes

991
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,780
two years in between.

992
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:15,880
Yet, we continue to crank out this show.

993
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:17,360
We're featuring such artists.

994
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:17,960
We're trying to get them to get done.

995
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:21,460
and articles as this fella coming right up,

996
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,860
the great John Martles.

997
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:25,320
Oh, thank you.

998
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:32,380
Thank you.

999
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:45,740
I got out of work at five o'clock.

1000
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,220
Friday afternoon.

1001
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:54,080
I got into my car and I drove straight down

1002
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,580
to the first saloon.

1003
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,920
I jumped out to the bartender.

1004
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:04,440
Hey, give me something to drink.

1005
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:09,400
I drank 10 bitches all by myself

1006
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,600
and threw up in the bedroom sink.

1007
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,720
Well, I feel like a twat.

1008
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:19,420
Got to someone to be me.

1009
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:23,360
I said I feel like a twat,

1010
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,500
but I look just like a man.

1011
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:32,780
So they cut me off and threw me out

1012
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:35,180
and sent me down the street.

1013
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:40,620
I went straight down the corner to the next bar

1014
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,720
and ordered another drink.

1015
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:45,720
I said,

1016
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,800
I raised my glass into the air

1017
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:51,100
And poured the glass over the whole bar

1018
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,860
By the time the bar began to close center

1019
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:58,780
I was laying face down on the floor

1020
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,660
I sat at one thirsty fucker's

1021
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:05,160
Don't you understand?

1022
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:09,760
I feel like a small tank

1023
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,820
But I look just like a man

1024
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:15,580
Man, man, man

1025
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:18,300
I got the shuffle

1026
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:26,240
I got the shuffle

1027
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:50,920
I got the shuffle

1028
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:50,920


1029
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:50,920


1030
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:51,580
I'm

1031
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:00,900
I'm

1032
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,160
Will they pour the alcohol

1033
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,600
a bottle of it in my car?

1034
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:10,540
And my buddies drove me home

1035
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,380
My wife didn't notice when they turned me in

1036
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:17,200
Cause she was busy talking

1037
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,340
Nonstop in the pool

1038
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:22,100
My buddies tossed me a couch

1039
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,620
And struck off of the door

1040
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:29,600
But I moved back after ten o'clock

1041
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:33,380
And decided to drink some more

1042
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:37,000
I had one first and another

1043
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:41,020
You better believe I am

1044
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:44,800
I did just like a slow man

1045
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:47,740
But I look just like a man

1046
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:55,220
Man, man, man, man, man
