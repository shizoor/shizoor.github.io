1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
Listen.

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:01,940
Alright, I'm one.

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,140
Going up in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,460
The Super Genius Power of Swag Team!

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,880
We'll meet again at midnight.

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,320
And now live from the Pothakurin Ballroom here in beautiful Katsourmas,

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,560
it's time for King Koyos and the Kritorai.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,280
Beginning promptly.

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,080
No, not beginning promptly.

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,080
Beginning is a relative term for them.

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,640
Things.

12
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,820
And tell her that you love her.

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,200
Like you know it should.

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,700
Dave knows how to tell her he loves her,

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,320
because he knows all the scientific words for all them body parts.

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,680
I use a stick to get my way.

17
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,480
And he uses his tongue, baby.

18
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,320
He uses his tongue to talk dirty.

19
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,120
I am here.

20
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,040
Long night long.

21
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,020
I am built like a dog's head.

22
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,960
My face is long and cylindrical.

23
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:03,800
Lupine.

24
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,440
Canine.

25
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,840
Look at my incisors.

26
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,200
Just a dirty dog.

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,200
He's just a dirty dog.

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:19,460
As cruel and as ordinary as any other lover of that defecant, deviant Bob Dobbs ever existed.

29
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,980
You gotta learn to treat her right.

30
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,520
Gotta learn to spank in between the down times.

31
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,300
You gotta learn to give her slaps.

32
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,780
You gotta give her a massacre massage.

33
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,460
You gotta pound it where it don't feel right.

34
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,720
Yeah, sure you do.

35
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,920
Now we've all had these problems in communication in our love relationships.

36
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,700
For instance, Bob. The love of Bob. The adoration of Bob.

37
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,280
When we come to the force- the squank table, the swag table.

38
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,160
It's not queer if it's Bob.

39
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,660
Well, nobody ever-

40
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,060
That's a different kind of love.

41
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,300
If there's nothing queer about spunking into a picture of Bob.

42
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,300
It's like the obvious.

43
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,040
Over and over again.

44
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,740
Adoration of Sai Baba or something.

45
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,060
Until it makes the inkjet ink run.

46
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,520
Oh, jeez.

47
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,020
And mix.

48
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,900
That is an awful thought.

49
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:12,060
That's why in all the subgenius babe conneaut calendars we put pictures of Bob in the corner of each page.

50
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,520
So that just at the climactic moment you can divert your attention to the true object of your love.

51
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,880
Which is J.R. Bob Dobbs. That one savior.

52
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,880
Muscly and brown around the eye ridges.

53
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,640
He's been here.

54
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,060
He's been there.

55
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,320
And he's been in between.

56
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,000
He's J.R. Bob Dobbs, your secret slack master and avatar.

57
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,600
And he wants the breath from your soul.

58
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,380
Well, he wants your money too.

59
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,220
And he realized the similarity between pornography and religion.

60
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,960
Well, there's many similarities.

61
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,660
There's an altar to pound upon.

62
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,860
He made them even more similar.

63
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,620
A lot more similar than they were in most movies.

64
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,700
There's no other religious studies besides the tantrics of India.

65
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,360
India.

66
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,380
Back in the day.

67
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:01,660
India.

68
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,500
Back in the era.

69
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,440
And I don't mean macrobiotic tantric practitioners.

70
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,480
No, none of that.

71
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,420
Clevelandites who brag about it to their friends.

72
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,240
None of that.

73
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,840
Not here.

74
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,040
I'm talking about the ones that could not stop.

75
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,440
I'm talking about people that knew about sex hurt.

76
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,940
You hear this music in the background?

77
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,360
That is the sound of your nervous system on sex hurt.

78
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,800
It is painful but beautiful.

79
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,140
I wonder, I wonder.

80
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,340
Don't look at the colors.

81
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,620
When you get bored with the drugs, then you see the secret.

82
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,120
I hold on tight.

83
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,380
I hold on tight.

84
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,300
I hold on tight.

85
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:41,500
Sex.

86
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,420
Until it hurts.

87
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,760
All right.

88
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:46,940
All right.

89
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,620
Look, look, look way above your body there.

90
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,740
Hey, look down.

91
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,580
Here, check it out.

92
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,140
I'm a little bit of a gyration.

93
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,620
Disgusting.

94
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,060
It's beautiful.

95
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:58,780
I can't.

96
00:03:59,140 --> 00:03:59,780
I don't.

97
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,080
This is .

98
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,900
Shut up.

99
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,000
Well, first, the blonde with more curves than the road up Pike's Peak.

100
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,760
And dumb.

101
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,500
That's right.

102
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,140
Insult me.

103
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,040
Second, a blonde.

104
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,440
Okay, you can't argue with a blonde.

105
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:23,760
That's right.

106
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,560
It's a blonde.

107
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,040
Trust me, and believe me.

108
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,500
Set aside today.

109
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,720
Luciano Berrio.

110
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,280
What is this mess you're playing?

111
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,720
This is actually not, it's actually not Ligety at all.

112
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,220
It's not Art.

113
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,020
It's Aerosmith.

114
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,900
Or Luciano Berrio.

115
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,300
Backwards.

116
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,300
Or George Crumb or any of those 20th century composers.

117
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:53,620
Is this the recording of every single What's Her Name song played simultaneously?

118
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,540
And now, the song's playing.

119
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:54,540


120
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:54,540


121
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:54,540


122
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:54,540


123
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:54,540


124
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:54,540


125
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:01,560
Carl Heinz Stockhausen brought to you in an easy-to-listen-to format that the children love.

126
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,340
Listen to Carl Heinz.

127
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,540
And that's how it all ends.

128
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,540
Play every single Carl Heinz Stockhausen song.

129
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,580
I didn't know Carl Heinz Stockhausen had a high tenor voice like that.

130
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,840
And here's how it all comes to an end.

131
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,880
Lin with happiness.

132
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,580
Big German fella.

133
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,520
Can you imagine that? What a diaphragm.

134
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,220
Chaz, I feel that you could call that art and it would still suck.

135
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:30,880
Yeah.

136
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:36,620
You know, just because you put a capital A in front of it doesn't mean the cows are going to low and low and low, low, low.

137
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,820
You know what I mean?

138
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,680
We're talking about the Brahmin cows with the big, big wisdom teats.

139
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,000
The ones that need to be extracted every 7,000 years.

140
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,060
Oh, is it the wisdom teat you're after?

141
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:53,700
Yes, those nipples must be extracted and expectorated by the mildly amused gentlemen without salivary glands.

142
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,820
Addicted to philosophy.

143
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,460
Sucking on the wisdom teat.

144
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,080
It's sad, actually, if you ask me.

145
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,460
Pitiful, absolutely pitiful.

146
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,980
But nobody asked the old question answerer.

147
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,720
The old questionnaire-er-er-er.

148
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,600
Nobody ever ponders those in his way.

149
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,460
Sex with underage boys is a holy secret.

150
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,020
I downloaded the whole PDF file.

151
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:20,900
Holy W-O-L-L-Y?

152
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,340
Yeah, the whole PDF file was on CBS News.

153
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,080
I call that an unholy secret.

154
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,820
And it details from the Vatican.

155
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,060
It details.

156
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,420
And this was written in like 1964 or something and all that.

157
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:44,700
And it details in great detail how anybody involved in a sex scandal, including the person who got sexually molested,

158
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:53,160
it would be a holy secret or a holy sin to reveal this holy secret and you would be excommunicated.

159
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,520
Get out of here.

160
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:54,520


161
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,320
I'm not kidding you.

162
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:55,940
Don't go down there.

163
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,720
Want to find it?

164
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,600
Let's go find it right now.

165
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,240
That's getting pretty bizarre.

166
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,080
Well, I mean, no, that makes a lot of sense.

167
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:03,940
There's nothing bizarre about it.

168
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:08,880
I think old Papa John's getting, you know, I thought he was kind of okay considering his, you know, role as a Christian.

169
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,080
But geez, that sounds a little bit weird.

170
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:18,160
Okay, number one, it makes the church look bad if they find out the old fathers are deflowering the young altered boys.

171
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,520
And number two, the old fathers will run out of young altered boys if everybody's on them.

172
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:31,960
And they can't stop the buggering of young altered boys just because it traumatizes forever the altered boys.

173
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,100
These priests are men of God.

174
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:34,800
They have needs.

175
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,560
And they deserve to bugger the little 10-year-old boys.

176
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,360
However, that old drunk in the front row was playing with his camera right on the restaurant.

177
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,040
Oh, he's a sinful man.

178
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,840
The Catholic priests need to do more than lay people, as the old church does.

179
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,280
Geez, I must be so far out of the loop-de-gar.

180
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,440
I guess even older jokes.

181
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,880
It just doesn't play as well anymore.

182
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,540
You know, what kind of meat does a priest eat on Friday?

183
00:07:59,500 --> 00:07:59,900
None.

184
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,420
None.

185
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,260
No, that's too hetero.

186
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,020
Yeah.

187
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:04,800
That's too normal.

188
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,640
That's way too normal.

189
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,960
Yeah, way too normal for, that's not a holy secret anymore.

190
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,600
That's a holy bride.

191
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,100
Wait, wait, wait.

192
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,160
Did you know this is a decision angle American problem?

193
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,420
Oh, Father McBride!

194
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,320
Look at this guy.

195
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:15,980
That's his McDobs family.

196
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:16,460
Look at this.

197
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:16,960
Look at this.

198
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,840
There we go.

199
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,160
A Dobs father-in-law.

200
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,100
Where's my racket ball bag?

201
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,240
And this guy.

202
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,240
Look at this dude.

203
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,120
Look at this dude.

204
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:28,940
He's the guy who owned the restaurant that they all met up these little teenage boys at.

205
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,320
That's Marshall McLuhan.

206
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,520
Marshall McLuhan is having sex with teenage boys.

207
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,580
Actually, his name is Marshall McCarron.

208
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,460
Oh, my God.

209
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,040
Owner of Len Ernst Burger.

210
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,360
Come right in here.

211
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,580
Had a pension for underage lovers.

212
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,800
We gotta shut up the chairs early.

213
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,840
Quote, unquote.

214
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,500
Here, quote, unquote.

215
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:54,260
Young boys made me feel alive and young again.

216
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,080
That's him.

217
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,020
Young boys make me feel alive and young again.

218
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:00,680
Ah, damn.

219
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,040
Where's my golf bag?

220
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,100
Young boys.

221
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,840
And then look at this one.

222
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,520
Look at this guy.

223
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,700
He got them all involved.

224
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:13,500
He was taking the old gay priest around in the bar, the gay bars, and then they ended

225
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,500
up at his restaurant picking up little teenage boys down in Ohio City.

226
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,560
Well, there's a nice story, huh?

227
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:19,880
Now, wait.

228
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,900
Where can you go and pick up young teenage boys?

229
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,860
Where can you go pick up priests?

230
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:24,900
Oh, dear.

231
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,340
I'd like to go somewhere and pick up a priest tonight, and believe me, if we're in the

232
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:29,920
Now, here's this guy.

233
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,340
Young boys.

234
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:30,880
This guy.

235
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,500
Look at that face there, and he says...

236
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,320
Radio listeners, turn to page 14 of the script.

237
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,880
You'll notice all the white hairs in there.

238
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,140
Follow along with Chaz as he looks at the advertisement man on the...

239
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:48,100
Father McBride is an old, frail man who wasn't much fun to hang out with, but he agreed to

240
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,180
take McBride to a few gay bars.

241
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,180
That's it, man.

242
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,040
Wow.

243
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,680
Can you imagine that?

244
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,400
The driver.

245
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,280
Can you imagine?

246
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,160
This guy and the father.

247
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,360
He looks like a driver in a mops.

248
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,920
The father over here.

249
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,060
Let's get back to the father.

250
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,100
Cruising around Ohio City together.

251
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,380
That's what those kids were running from in our backyard.

252
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,120
Oh, my God.

253
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,980
We had these mystery kids running out of...

254
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,900
I'll just let them make it.

255
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,080
Just that I don't feel guilty.

256
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,720
Amazingly visual type of thought there.

257
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,480
I mean, the radio listeners can't see these pictures, but...

258
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,840
Well, go online to scene...

259
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,540
Glee scene dot com.

260
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,920
I think TV for the Blind is working quite well.

261
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,700
Just imagine any...

262
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,260
Clearing scene or glee scene dot com.

263
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,020
Red-faced, old, white-haired...

264
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,380
White-haired guy.

265
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,100
I'm sure those...

266
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,380
A collared...

267
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,220
Looks like a mugshot.

268
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:32,700
Some rotten old guy.

269
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,320
Father of patio, Matthew O'Mara.

270
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,900
When you read the story, he took him out to Lake Chautauqua, where he has a cabin.

271
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,780
Oh, boy.

272
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,200
And even detail in the story.

273
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:46,480
In this story, you can read about how he took him out to his cabin in Chautauqua, and then

274
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:53,940
he douched his anal sick, and then had the 17-year-old youth have anal sex with him,

275
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,980
and they did that, and then they came back to Cleveland.

276
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,920
Well, that's what I'd do.

277
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,700
I'd get right back in the car and cry all the way home back to Parma.

278
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,380
Tee.

279
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,800
What did I do?

280
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:08,580
Cleaned himself out with a little, like, I guess, portable enema douche thing, and then

281
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:08,720
had a...

282
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:08,980
I'm sure.

283
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,100
Doesn't everybody have...

284
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,580
A little bit too much information there.

285
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,540
And then had the 17-year-old boy...

286
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,580
That's part of your diocesan packet now.

287
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,480
Nowadays, when you know...

288
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,620
Give him an anal probe, I guess.

289
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,640
Each diocese passes out the special packs with the handy wipes and the gloves.

290
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,060
Do you think he went pretty slick?

291
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,920
Imagine what a great career this man has.

292
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,560
What a great career this man has had in his ministry.

293
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,320
Well, thank God he's not in a necrophilia, you know, for all those families waiting at

294
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:30,720
the hospital.

295
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,580
Who knows what this cat could be into.

296
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,500
I mean, come on.

297
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,720
Well, you know, they say that these...

298
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,700
All them cats, man.

299
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,920
Yeah, they buried all them bishops in the basement of the cathedral.

300
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,640
This just makes me ashamed of the Church of the Subgenius.

301
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,660
Because what are...

302
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,320
Too many heteros.

303
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,140
I mean, just...

304
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,000
What the hell are we doing?

305
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,380
What a boring dog.

306
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:47,960
Yeah, right.

307
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,660
I mean, what do you get?

308
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,720
That little bit of swapping out there at Brushwood, what nobody ever tells me about.

309
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,840
Are you changed?

310
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,280
Hey, I better not hear about it.

311
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,100
But I do.

312
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,820
And there's, you know, I mean, there's...

313
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:03,160
There's sure, there's the occasional crush and balls and vice versa.

314
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,240
But people want that.

315
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,980
They pay extra for that crap.

316
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,540
Don't ask me why.

317
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,320
They like it.

318
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:08,580
But...

319
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,420
Well, it's visually...

320
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,300
How the hell are we going to keep up with the Catholics?

321
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,480
When you see them pat?

322
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,140
I don't know, man.

323
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,480
And then it's a holy secret to reveal anything.

324
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,880
It's just a holy secret.

325
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,540
Well, see, that's what we've been doing wrong.

326
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,840
We've been bragging about it.

327
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,820
Every time somebody deflowers somebody in subgenius land, they shout it from the rooftops of the internet.

328
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,980
All I'm waiting for now is pictures of it.

329
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,380
Them lay sisters to be wearing spandex pants and those dike belts.

330
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,500
You know what I'm saying?

331
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,260
They do that in our church.

332
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:42,400
But that's like tame crap compared to these really perverted...

333
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,660
I mean, these guys rape little children.

334
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:46,780
What?

335
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,460
And teenagers that are not exactly little children, but easily confused by mushrooms and beer.

336
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,060
Well, when we take into consideration...

337
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,680
Various aspects of the apologetics involved.

338
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:03,360
Don't we think that perhaps, although we're all sinners, some of those small children enjoy being buggered?

339
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:03,820
No.

340
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,080
No, probably not.

341
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,280
No, probably not at all.

342
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,080
Well, don't you think one...

343
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,820
Speak for yourself!

344
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,340
One?

345
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,400
I think I know something that's coming out in the confession booth of the radio.

346
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,700
Damn, damn, damn.

347
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,200
One.

348
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,040
Stop lunging where you don't belong.

349
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,000
The little boy...

350
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,420
Next time you attend mass, you leave quickly and don't hang around waiting for cookies from the elf people, because it doesn't exist.

351
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,080
Why do you think they call it my ass?

352
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,840
You're just coming up with new stuff all the time.

353
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:45,180
I will ask Jesus to help me to keep my heart from sin.

354
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:52,580
After reflecting his goodness and awe, we shine.

355
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,760
We shine for him.

356
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,140
A sunbeam, a sunbeam.

357
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,420
Jesus wants me for a sunbeam.

358
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:07,720
A sunbeam, a sunbeam.

anything drastic. When you are with a lover, you have no control. When you are with a lover,

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:36,820
you have no control. When you are with a lover, you have no control. I want to be filthy and

00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:53,240
anonymous. Scum and slime. What's going on in here? It looks like everyone is underwater.

439
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:05,180
Give me a break. I'm dead and I'm asleep. I'm dead and I'm asleep. I'm dead and I'm asleep.

Don't stop.

All right.

Keep going.

449
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,200
Good.

450
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,180
Does he have a huge stromboli-like whale?

451
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,940
Yeah, let's not go into that.

452
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:23,640
Is he gone?

453
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,360
Let it get into us, rather.

454
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,700
Right. Let's not let Leviathan creep up our spines.

455
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:34,780
Since you set that horrible subject matter early in the game. No, it was Chaz this time talking about butt boys.

456
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,680
He's always getting after you.

457
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:45,420
He was talking about your butt talk. Now he's Mr. Butt-Oriented. You got to read the gross butt stories out of the local weekly...

458
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,340
Must be all the techno.

You there?

465
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,420
Fresh out of the office and you're bullshit.

00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:31,420


467
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:31,980
It's just the guy from TV.

468
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,480
It's him and you.

Maybe sports are on!

480

You know that sports are really just gay porn in disguise

481
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,900
All those big sweaty dudes wearing tights, slapping each other on the ass

482
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,040
That's the gayest thing I've ever seen in my life

Wally, we're making out.

502
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,280
Oh, well...

503
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,960
You can sit down, everything's ready.

504
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,820
Look, we got plenty of time together.

505
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,700
Well, I like to make out, dear.

506
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,580
Will you just forget about it for a while?

507
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,580
Oh, well, well, don't you want to?

508
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,520
Oh, it's not that I don't have fun or anything, but I've been meaning to talk to you about that.

509
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,520
Uh, Wally?

510
00:22:59,560 --> 00:22:59,980
Wally, uh...

511
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,240
Oh, gee, Dad, you're not gonna make me, are you?

512
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,580
He's never failed to cooperate before.

513
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,600
I'd really like to, but I just can't.

514
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,000
Well, what can I say?

515
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,800
Well, tell him that he just has to.

516
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:16,040
Well, now, June, I'm just as anxious to have Wally as you are.

517
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,240
Yeah?

518
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,100
But I'm not gonna make him if he doesn't want to.

519
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:18,800
Poor?

520
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,740
We're making out.

521
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,240
Yeah, the boys love it. They really go wild.

522
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,820
Hi, Wally.

523
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,580
It's a sporting universe.

524
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,280
A moment.

525
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,620
Get your finger off that box.

526
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,100
You break my heart

527
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,360
Let us not forget...

528
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,860

537
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,620
Son, step in here and let me put on a little music for you.

538
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,120
Do you like poppers?

539
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,080
Father, that hurts!

540
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,440
You're hurting me, father!

You're hurting me, father!

543
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,640
What do you think of the night is, baby?

544
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,300
Do you like poppers?

545
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,720
Climb aboard the art wagon, children.

546
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,660
We're all going.

547
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,960
We're all going to have a little canister of soup,

548
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,460
and we're going out to the art wagon to play with the wooden donkeys.

549
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,800
And your five Hail Marys and seven Our Fathers.

550
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,740
And by the way, do you like poppers?

551
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:52,220
Now you understand what we mean when we talk about the Holy Trinity.

552
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,800
That's three in grade.

553
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,220
Great.

554
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,940
Great, great feelings in the wagon.

555
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,040
Here, son, let me show you a purgatory.

556
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,400
I'll keep it in my closet right here.

557
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:14,160
Let me show you what to do with these prayer beads.

558
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,820
She like a pearl necklace!

559
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:26,520
Well, I'm telling you, then he described the damn rosary.

560
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,000
It's one of those butt beads that the Orioles use.

561
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,520
And for crying out loud, me and Mae was sitting there for two more hours

562
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,560
just trying to figure out what they were talking about.

563
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,780
But I can tell you one thing for sure.

564
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,960
It wasn't right in the head.

565
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,600
And it wasn't right, I don't think, for the children to be listening.

566
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,880
And so, well, we called up a number of people.

567
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,400
I wonder how many priests, like, when they're having mass,

568
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,700
and then the little altar boy comes up and he genuflects.

569
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:54,140
I wonder how many priests are sitting on the altar at that moment going,

570
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,960
man, I can't wait till, like,

571
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,040
all over his, everybody.

572
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,180
Oh, jeez.

573
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,820
Well, now they have altar servers, so...

574
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,540
But it would be a holy secret if they did.

575
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,760
Now, in Scientology, it's a whole different thing.

576
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,160
It's not a holy secret at all.

577
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,200
It's just holy.

578
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,120
They like the holes and they make no bones about it.

579
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,200
Bones, so to speak.

580
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:20,340
That's why I say the hell is the church of the subgenius

581
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,340
is supposed to be this nasty, terrible church.

582
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,460
How the hell are we going to keep up with the Catholics?

583
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,640
The temple...

584
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,120
Impossible!

585
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,700
Much less than even the Scientologists.

586
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,940
The great whore of Rome, or whatever they call it there.

587
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,000
Or the Raelians.

588
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,520
In the Baptist churches down south, they call those Catholics

589
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,820
the great whore in the Bible or something.

590
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,480
Ain't it like them Rome's old Rome's old.

591
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,160
Nice.

592
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,980
I understand what I'm saying.

593
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,600
I understand what I'm saying.

594
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,740
I understand.

595
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,900
I understand.

596
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:55,940
I understand.

597
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,420
I understand.

598
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,380
I understand.

599
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,480
You've got to believe me.

600
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,360
You've got to believe me.

601
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,820
Help me escape.

602
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,580
I understand what I'm saying.

603
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,000
I can't think.

604
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:08,820
I have a mind.

605
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,700
They make the same things.

606
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,720
They torture me.

607
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,420
They torture me.

608
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,080
I can't think.

609
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:15,780
I hate this thing.

610
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,700
I have a mind.

611
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,040
Don't let them kill me.

612
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,080
They torture me.

613
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,520
Kill me.

614
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,360
I have a mind.

615
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,460
Oh, you don't care.

616
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,500
They torture me.

617
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,260
I have a mind.

618
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:25,900
Go ahead.

619
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:26,640
I have a mind.

620
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,780
Shoot me.

621
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,120
Kill me.

622
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,500
They torture me.

623
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,840
I understand what I'm saying.

624
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:32,580
I have a mind.

625
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,020
I can't think.

626
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,780
I have a mind.

627
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,260
They torture me.

628
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,000
They torture me.

629
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,640
Why?

630
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,140
I can't think.

631
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,520
I have a mind.

632
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,160
Don't leave me here.

633
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,880
I have a mind.

634
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,480
I have a mind.

635
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,100
Don't!

636
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,420
Christians are gay.

637
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,800
Christians are gay.

638
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:37,160
The Punk Group from their CD, International Rock Stars.

639
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,520
www.thepunkgroup.com

640
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,860
And now, more lemur.

641
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:57,040
You know, we get lots of calls from people who are wanting their family members neck fractured.

642
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,400
If God can do this, then there's not a trace of Jesus in heaven.

643
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,880
That comes from Matthew up in Iowa.

644
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,180
Hallelujah, give praise to Ralph.

645
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,220
Tumor growth, tumor growth.

646
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:20,820
The Lord ballooned up, and God is all ballooned up, and God is cancerous.

647
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,840
Leukemia or ralphoma in a vital brain growth.

648
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:38,360
I come against this canthoma, lymphocera, cancerous Jesus soaking the growth, every trace of cancer, in Jesus' stomach tumors.

649
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:43,680
And I pray right now for 6,700 cancer tumors and growths.

650
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,200
And say,

651
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,880
I want it all.

652
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,060
Well, this just explains all of my hatred and confusion.

653
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,460
Can you imagine Christians behaving this way?

654
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,020
And of course, they do every day, and I'm just...

655
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:01,700
Yeah.

656
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,980
Well, I mean, look, I've been to subgenius services where the preacher looks up and goes,

657
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,680
What's that human wanting?

658
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,800
Yeah, what's that human wanting?

659
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,200
Oh, I guess that human's getting a bit uppity coming into a subgenius.

660
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:23,120
Man, I think the sub-Gs are, you know, they're getting outdone big time, and no one is outdoing anybody better than the Catholics right now.

661
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,900
You know what it is?

662
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,520
Slack.

663
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,500
Slackards.

664
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,420
They're just not motivated.

665
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:35,880
They think about boogering the altar boys, but they're just too busy fropping and watching Futurama or listening to music.

666
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:40,040
And we all thought it was real big when Jimmy Swagger, you know, did a hooker.

667
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,240
He came out about that, you know.

668
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,380
Look at what's coming.

669
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,740
Well, then now where are we at?

670
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,400
Oh, yeah.

671
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,420
Nobody even cared.

672
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,260
A preacher does a hooker.

673
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,680
Yeah, they get a medal for it now.

674
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,820
Oh, he's almost as good as Jimmy Swagger, but he's pleased he's not a Catholic.

675
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,880
At least he's not gay.

676
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:59,220
Sexual conquest has always been a part of the pastornage.

677
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:08,640
Incidentally, the opinions expressed on this show are those of the blabbermouths themselves and not of Cleveland State University or WCSB.

678
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,420
Or your mother.

679
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,380
Yeah.

680
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,600
Duh.

681
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,020
Schmuck.

682
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,020
Kbrr.

683
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,540
Ah, the cracks of the great, great problem of existence.

684
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,640
Keep an eye on the phone.

685
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,460
From PR News in Washington, I hope Bob's dead.

686
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:30,780
President Bush hopes Bob's dead in central Pittsburgh in a grenade attack today.

687
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,640
PR's Ivan Watson says the military has Bob's butt, but Bob's butt improves.

688
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,960
A folding dog under one arm and a folding pink under the other.

689
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,620
But Bob wants to reach out to PR's cronies' butts.

690
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:42,940
Yes.

691
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,940
Well, the bear butt ranch.

692
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,020
Well.

693
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,140
Well.

694
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:46,880
Well.

695
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,040
Well.

696
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:48,660
Well.

697
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,260
Well.

698
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:49,580
Well.

699
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,960
Thank you.

700
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,620
Thank you.

701
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,600
Thank you.

702
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,660
Thank you.

703
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,720
Thank you.

704
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,140
Thank you.

705
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:46,460
Thank you.

706
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,700
Thank you.

707
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,240
And it smells good, too.

708
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,620
Thank you.

709
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,300
Thank you, Artemia Salina.

710
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,740
Put a geodesic symbol on top of his head there.

711
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:22,600
Oh, he just wrote my name, as if somehow I wanted to have sexual intercourse with him.

712
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:34,360
Oh, no, it's love me, meaning that this person of Christ, this person of Christ.

713
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,560
That's five hail marys.

714
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,440
Seven hard fathers and, hey, kid, you like poppers?

715
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,060
Hello?

716
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,140
Yeah, I'm in the parking lot.

717
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:51,760
All right, man.

718
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,060
Coming down for you.

719
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:53,660
Okay.

720
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,300
Someone go fetch DJ.

721
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,740
Anybody, somebody, anybody.

722
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,520
Down, down.

723
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,680
Down, down, down, down.

724
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,320
Yeah.

725
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,060
Down, down, down.

726
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:10,960
Oh, yeah.

727
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:12,760
Oh, yeah.

728
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,040
Oh, yeah.

729
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:14,720
Oh, yeah.

730
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,460
Oh, yeah.

731
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,520
Oh, yeah.

732
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:18,740
Oh, yeah.

733
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,040
Oh, yeah.

734
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,920
Oh, yeah.

735
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:24,900
Oh, yeah.

736
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:27,500
Oh, yeah.

737
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,340
Oh, yeah.

738
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,180
Oh, yeah.

739
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:31,860
Oh, yeah.

740
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,140
Oh, yeah.

741
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,880
Oh, yeah.

742
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,720
Oh, yeah.

743
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,920
Oh, yeah.

744
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,320
Oh yeah.

745
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,260
Oh yeah.

746
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,020
Oh yeah.

747
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:47,940
Oh yeah.

748
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:48,280
Oh yeah.

749
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:49,720
Oh yeah.

750
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,520
Oh yeah.

751
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,800
Hey, that's only five by Elmery

752
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,020
and seven on Fowler.

753
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,360
Hey, can you like poppers?

754
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,740
Father, father,

755
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,740
you're hating me!

756
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,680
Forgive me, father!

757
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,080
I like my Nikes!

758
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:10,800
Forgive me!

759
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,580
Love me!

760
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,540
Father, father,

761
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,400
you're hating me!

762
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,100
Why do you think...

763
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,580
Jesus wants you to do this.

764
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,600
Father, put white pee in my front box.

765
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,600
This is like shooting fish in a bucket.

766
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,640
I'm not here right now.

767
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,260
Like shooting fish in a bucket.

768
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,360
A special communication

769
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,760
from Pluto.

770
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:35,540
Damn.

771
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,060
I finally get to get them back

772
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,620
for all them years of torture.

773
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,620
I love that.

774
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,120
I love Father Rod McCloughan.

775
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,420
I knew this was coming.

776
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,060
When I was eight years old,

777
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,780
I could see this coming down the road.

778
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,500
Listen to the world.

779
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,760
They never even touched me.

780
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,540
You just knew something was wrong.

781
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,820
Oh, hey, can you like poppers?

782
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,000
I'm a-having sandwiches and punch

783
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,040
over next to the retro area.

784
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,780
Can you hear this space?

785
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,060
Oh, yeah.

786
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,960
I'm inside a church.

787
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,180
You know, in the entrance,

788
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,300
you'd like to stop by for some cookies

789
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,460
and sandwiches.

790
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,020
Over in the...

791
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,380
Hey, you want to join me

792
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,940
over in the rectory?

793
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,700
What does this have to do with Jesus?

794
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,180
What would Waylon do?

795
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,400
What does Jesus have to do with anything?

796
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,100
Jesus ain't got nothing to do with anything.

797
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,380
Paint WWWD on the back of your pickup truck.

798
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,200
What would Waylon do?

799
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,800
We're going to start that new thing.

800
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,100
Pickup trucks with WWWD.

801
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,440
Pickup trucks with WWWD on the back.

802
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,740
What the hell does that mean?

803
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,640
Well, you better just put that on your car

804
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,320
and you'll find out.

805
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,260
What would Waylon do?

806
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,880
Till next week.

807
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,360
Oh, he ain't even up here yet.

808
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,680
I would say, what would Walrus do?

809
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,560
I'm back, back, back, back.

810
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,520
What would Waylon do?

811
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:59,940
He'd start wailing on you guys for your blasphemy.

812
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,500
What's with Willy Wonka?

813
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,220
Why?

814
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,040
Nah, I bet he'd be cutting right in there with it.

815
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,660
Warbens, boom.

816
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,200
Well, actually, it's...

817
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,920
Listen, we're not blaspheming the Lord,

818
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:14,360
but rather some members of his fan club.

819
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,520
While we were blaspheming the Catholic Church,

820
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,080
Waylon would have been hitting on the princes.

821
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:19,800
Right.

822
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,320
Yeah.

823
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,420
He would have been a good...

824
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,040
Hey, baby.

825
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:26,640
And somebody's got his priorities straight.

826
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:30,240
Well, the pizza on his hat and stinking...

827
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,220
Man.

828
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,240
You need coolin'.

00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,520
Baby, I'm gonna do it.

This is Whipley Snidelash, UFO victim and crowd-pleasing sound pornographer.

869
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,640
Oh, Whipley Screamer.

870
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,220
Yes, no, Whipley Snidelash.

871
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,920
Whipley Snidelash!

872
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,380
Somebody please the Lord!

873
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,380
What is the question for you today, honey?

874
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,240
Whipley Screamer?

875
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,720
You aren't there or everywhere.

876
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,320
We understand that these things could not be done by humans.

877
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,680
They can only be done by aliens.

878
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,740
And that's the only possible explanation.

879
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,960
Did you mean humines? Humines, right? Humines?

880
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:14,260
The only possible explanation is that this is an alien intelligence operating through some unknown means.

881
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:19,260
I think intelligence is not the right word to describe what you have done, sir.

882
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:24,520
Meet me on my knees. On your knees, Friday night at 7.30.

883
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:25,380
Praise Bob!

884
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,860
Praise Master Lighthouse.

885
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:31,760
You see, I think this whole thing is easily explained.

886
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:39,440
Simply by the UFO phenomenon and how they are adhering us to their mindset.

887
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,060
That's the story.

888
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:51,900
And I think this avoiding taking it seriously is going to cause more problems with our understanding them and they understanding us in the future.

889
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:53,680
Yeah, exactly!

890
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,920
Can I just offer one thing, Wiper?

891
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,740
Didn't it make your faith even stronger, brother?

892
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,520
Faith?

893
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,000
What does faith have to do with it?

894
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,280
Faith has nothing to do with what's happened here.

895
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,300
Now, now listen to this.

896
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,660
What is this?

897
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,080
This is damn sick of you.

898
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,120
It frightens me.

899
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,740
Sometimes I think there's a man who sits behind a counter and says,

900
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,600
Faith!

901
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:21,940
Faith! Faith is the most important sponge!

902
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:23,860
Sponge?

903
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,680
Do you think a man should have the sponge?

904
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:27,740
Of course!

905
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,600
This man!

906
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:29,940
This man!

907
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,380
Wishes to be a sponge!

908
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:33,520
To think!

909
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,760
But your client is deluded!

910
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,640
Well, uh, it's possible.

911
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,340
Do you ever think about things that you'd think about?

912
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,360
I do not think about things that I'd think about.

913
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,320
Sponge!

914
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,260
My friends, I believe in those principles.

915
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:55,020
I'm upset.

916
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,420
Yes! Good!

917
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,560
I protest!

918
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,480
Look, Mr. Free Preacher.

919
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,520
This is not only irrelevant and immaterial, it is illegal!

920
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,500
Stop it! Stop it!

921
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:04,880
Oh!

922
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:10,080
My mother brought me here, and I feel that God has touched me.

923
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,680
Yeah, I know he did.

924
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,600
And when the special place is you,

925
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,980
then you're never the same again,

926
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:22,040
because this is what the UFO phenomenon offers us.

927
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,500
It's communion.

928
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:29,400
Yeah, it's a form of communion you're found to be seen doing in the backyard.

929
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:29,580
Yeah, it's a form of communion you're found to be seen doing in the backyard.

930
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:35,080
I've been to the backyard and the valley ways of various creepy sex clubs in your town.

931
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,380
Isn't it your town?

932
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:41,340
What you may see as creepy is perhaps normal to another.

933
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,620
Yeah, a creep.

934
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:47,020
I find those orifices you plug your cannon into to be absurd.

935
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:52,200
Her suit and enough to make a grown man go away.

936
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:58,920
Well, I think Dr. Lagume said it best when he suggested the drill.

937
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:05,380
I think that's the way that, you know, they can all sort of go.

938
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:05,980
He said the drill!

939
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,500
Did you let that get out of the air?

940
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,860
Were you nuts?

941
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:13,100
The tree planing, as it were, is that what they call it?

942
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:13,680
Man!

943
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:13,780
Oh, that!

944
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,960
Oh, they're talking about that.

945
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,520
Oh, yeah, yeah, that, sure.

946
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,300
The psychotic fondling.

947
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:20,900
There's nothing wrong with that.

948
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,100
There's nothing wrong with it.

949
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:28,900
And it's like when the Pennsylvania Tech was in the middle of the night,

950
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,220
and the Dutch people make pretzels,

951
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:36,060
you have to respect it and know that it cannot have been done by humans.

952
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,900
It can only have been done by an alien intelligence.

953
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,000
I think it was done by an Amish penis.

954
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,980
That's how they make the little holes.

955
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,040
They put them on the shelf,

956
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:53,180
and Grandpa Yoder comes by and pokes each one with his own secret sauce.

957
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:56,260
What you may see as merely a penis

958
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,660
is really how the aliens

959
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,460
adhere themselves to us.

960
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,820
Sort of like friction in a tube,

961
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:06,880
or maybe it's like a scap lock?

962
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,420
Like Velcro!

963
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:10,600
Exactly.

964
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:13,300
I believe that Princess Wee...

965
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,000
Princess Wee in a can.

966
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:18,060
And she would know

967
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:21,820
because she can adhere herself

968
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:24,520
to the alien intelligences.

969
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,460
We've been corresponding for some time now.

970
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:28,900
Princesses are not aliens.

971
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:28,900


972
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:28,900


973
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:28,900


974
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,260
They are creatures of antiquity.

975
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,660
Ten million years at least in age.

976
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,300
I'm sorry?

977
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,760
Could I just ask you how long you were there?

978
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:40,040
Did you actually feel the drill go by?

979
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,320
Or was it a nasal implant?

980
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,820
That was what the first alien called himself,

981
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:46,820
was Drill.

982
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,880
Drill, that's right.

983
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,780
And when he took me out...

984
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:51,320
That's the drill.

985
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,880
During the first encounter,

986
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:57,700
where I thought my memory was being erased by hypnosis,

987
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,900
but it was actually a real memory.

988
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,880
It was actually being replaced by a dream state

989
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,440
or fugue

990
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,680
sense of reality

991
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:06,940
which is impossible

992
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,640
to prove, certainly in a

993
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,440
scientific environment.

994
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,780
It's almost as if you were making it all up.

995
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,880
You sound very hot, my friend.

996
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:17,260
How long has it been since your last...

997
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,760
Your last...

998
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,140
No way I could have made this up,

999
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:20,400
thanks.

1000
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,940
Hello, operator.

1001
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,880
I've just had a particularly idiotic idea.

1002
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:29,840
Oh, that's incredible.

1003
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,100
There has been no English lady here.

1004
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,620
Yes, that's why it's an idiotic idea.

1005
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:37,760
There has been no English lady here.

1006
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,400
Nothing but lumps of raw flesh.

1007
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,380
We are not in England now.

1008
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,280
I don't see what difference that makes.

1009
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,840
What difference does it make?

1010
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,560
There has been no English lady here.

1011
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,660
Oh, but, but...

1012
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,900
There has been no English lady here.

1013
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:54,360
Nonsense.

1014
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,020
I mean, after all, people go about tying up nuns.

1015
00:49:58,900 --> 00:49:59,680
Seems a bit queer.

1016
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,860
Well, I may be very dense, but if this is some sort of a joke,

1017
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:03,880
I'm afraid I'd see the point.

1018
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,240
I understand she's dumb.

1019
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,180
Shut up.

1020
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,300
The pressure that I was feeling

1021
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,660
constantly was in fact

1022
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,860
something that the aliens

1023
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:16,640
had actually placed in the bowel,

1024
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,180
which they used to observe us.

1025
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:20,600
And it's benign.

1026
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:22,340
It's not harmful.

1027
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,940
It's really...

1028
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,020
You only feel the sharp stabbing pains

1029
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,440
occasionally in your bowel.

1030
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:32,120
And the knowledge that they traded me for that

1031
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:35,280
is really infinitely worth it.

1032
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,080
...inferiority of being right

1033
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,480
is a formidable outcry in defense of cost.

1034
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:40,000
So, so, I don't see what your problem is

1035
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,160
and why you're a skeptic.

1036
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:42,400
There's no problem,

1037
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,120
and there are no skepticisms.

1038
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:45,740
There are no skeptics,

1039
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:47,540
and there are no scatological rumors

1040
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:48,760
going about you.

1041
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,100
Everything that you've dreamed

1042
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,520
is a dream of someone else's.

1043
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,860
As a certifiable UFO victim

1044
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,640
and crowd-pleasing sound pornographer,

1045
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,940
I've mixed many sounds of the aliens

1046
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:03,820
speaking through various organs

1047
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:05,700
and orifices of my body.

1048
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,040
And I believe

1049
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,100
Stang is familiar with this.

1050
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,160
He's certainly tried to debunk me

1051
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,460
along with the amazing Randy,

1052
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,220
but I have proof.

1053
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:15,680
Oh, yes.

1054
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,340
Those old hollow dreams

1055
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,440
of being raped by sound effects.

1056
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,380
I remember your face,

1057
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,620
that soft peach fuzz,

1058
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,300
that tiny little cranium.

1059
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,820
It is you, isn't it?

1060
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,460
Stang, it's his effort to debunk you.

1061
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,160
The camping fee goes to the...

1062
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,260
Because the only explanation

1063
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:34,800
for what's on your website,

1064
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:37,000
especially the recent pictures

1065
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,380
that were taken in Switzerland,

1066
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:42,920
is that there is actual contact

1067
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,300
with Planet X.

1068
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,100
That Planet X is real.

1069
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,000
And this whole,

1070
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,100
you know,

1071
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,900
so-called fictitious story

1072
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:54,860
that people think

1073
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:55,760
that you've been telling

1074
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,760
is in fact a very true,

1075
00:51:58,900 --> 00:51:59,180
real tale.

1076
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,780
And I think you should be proud

1077
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:04,380
that you've been able to stand up

1078
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:07,000
and erect for Bob

1079
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
what you've been erecting.

1080
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:09,760
What do you see?

1081
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,660
This is real.

1082
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,760
And the shoes that you've been wearing

1083
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,740
have been the right shoes.

1084
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,080
The suits you've been wearing

1085
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:17,900
have been the right suits.

1086
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,960
And the cards you've been playing

1087
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,200
have been the right cards.

1088
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,640
I think that's the main point.

1089
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,420
Because the only way you could have been playing those cards

1090
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,360
is to be actually

1091
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,800
an assistant of alien intelligence.

1092
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:34,900
It's funny how they always

1093
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:35,780
are telling...

1094
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:38,260
They always tell me instead of asking me.

1095
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,620
It's so nice to know.

1096
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,220
Well, isn't that

1097
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:45,920
what they directed me to tell you?

1098
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:46,840
Right.

1099
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,400
From PR News in Washington,

1100
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,880
I'm claiming to be the former Iraqi dictator,

1101
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:01,160
despite rebel pledges

1102
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,520
for a sexual abuse scandal.

1103
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,760
Meanwhile, an audio tape

1104
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,340
of some Archbishop of Boston

1105
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:07,960
says the rebels are now into

1106
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,300
increased sexual abuse.

1107
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,960
The 59-year-old Archbishop

1108
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,500
will immediately have to tackle

1109
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,520
more than 500 children in countries

1110
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,640
where costs are lower.

1111
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,040
This is PR News.

1112
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,160
It's burning in Colorado

1113
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,100
as predicted by Xcel Energy.

1114
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:22,780
I'm fine.

1115
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:27,820
I'm fine.

1116
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,000
Well, just like a tiny little spider,

1117
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,000
I'm going to recluse myself

1118
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,520
from these proceedings

1119
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,720
as I have a vested interest in my vestments.

1120
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,380
You'll notice here

1121
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,300
my popper belt right beneath

1122
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:40,700
the...

1123
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,180
And then me is going to evacuate

1124
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,420
himself in some way.

1125
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,200
Like Father

1126
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,320
O'Brien O'Malley or whatever

1127
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:50,820
he is.

1128
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,200
You know, when you cross yourself,

1129
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:56,220
you don't make any sacred signs

1130
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,200
below the waist.

1131
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:58,840
Well, what about when you genuflect?

1132
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,160
Well, yeah, you bend over, baby.

1133
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,880
That represents something else.

1134
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,080
You bend down.

1135
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,960
Here comes my crucifix.

1136
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,180
And then supplicants to the Lord

1137
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:11,040
thy God.

1138
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:13,380
The new children.

1139
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:17,340
A thousand spokes

1140
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:19,760
went into the young boy's brain

1141
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,860
when he considered what had happened to him.

1142
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,900
He wanted to go on retreat

1143
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,580
with Father McClellan.

1144
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,900
But he knew his geodesic dome

1145
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,540
would only fit the two of them.

1146
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:32,520
So as he curled up into his cot

1147
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,520
and pulled the blankies up around him,

1148
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:35,960
he said his prayers.

1149
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,420
His Hail Mary, his Our Fathers,

1150
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,760
and his prayer for his mom and dad.

1151
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,980
Now I lay me down to...

1152
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:43,900
Hey! What are you doing?

1153
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,380
Father! Father, no!

1154
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:54,180
Hi, folks. Captain Midnight here.

1155
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:56,720
And now the first full-blooded Jew

1156
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,580
to ever appear on the Grand Ole Opry stage,

1157
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,020
Kinky Friedman

1158
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,680
and the Texas Jew Boys.

1159
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,300
Well, a redneck nerd

1160
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,400
in a bowling shirt

1161
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,380
with a guzzling lone star beard

1162
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:14,800
talking religion and politics

1163
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,200
for all the world to hear.

1164
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:20,000
They ought to send you

1165
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,420
back to Russia, boy,

1166
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,360
or New York City, one.

1167
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:26,620
You just want to doodle a Christian girl

1168
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,400
and you kill God's only son.

1169
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,300
I said, has it occurred to you,

1170
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,780
you nerd, that that's not very nice?

1171
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:36,540
We Jews believe

1172
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:37,900
it was Santa Claus

1173
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,800
that killed Jesus Christ.

1174
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:43,460
You know, you don't look Jewish,

1175
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,760
he said, near as I can figure.

1176
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:48,900
I had you lamped for a slightly anemic,

1177
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:50,600
well-dressed country boy.

1178
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,000
Lord!

1179
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,660
They ain't making Jews

1180
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:55,700
like Jesus anymore.

1181
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,940
They don't turn the other cheek

1182
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,640
the way they've done before.

1183
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,380
He started in to shouting

1184
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,760
and spitting on the floor.

1185
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,180
Lord!

1186
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,580
They ain't making Jews

1187
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:11,700
like Jesus anymore.

1188
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:14,440
Oh, they ain't making Jews

1189
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,420
like Jesus anymore.

1190
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,680
We don't turn the other cheek

1191
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,300
the way we've done before.

1192
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:24,040
But hear that honky holler

1193
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:24,160
in the air,

1194
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,580
as he hit that hardwood floor.

1195
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:27,220
Lord!

1196
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:30,380
They ain't making Jews

1197
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:31,740
like Jesus anymore.

1198
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:33,200
Friends, you are listening to

1199
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,840
the subgenius radio ministry,

1200
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:35,700
Hour of Slack.

1201
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,500
Here's our address,

1202
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,340
got that pencil ready?

1203
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:42,640
P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1204
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,780
44118, that's where you send

1205
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:48,460
things to me to play.

1206
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:50,520
The show,

1207
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:51,560
the Hour of Slack,

1208
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,760
is the voice of the church,

1209
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:54,640
and you can learn more about that

1210
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,800
at www.subgenius.com,

1211
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,700
which includes a catalog

1212
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,040
of books and other things.

1213
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,040
Friends...

1214
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,500
I dreamed it was,

1215
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:08,160
well, Father Oclaris

1216
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,820
and Father Von Stumpf

1217
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:11,040
had a big white SUV,

1218
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,140
and they were like tooling around town

1219
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:15,560
and stuff, and one of them

1220
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:16,740
gave me the finger, so I said,

1221
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:17,860
I'm gonna chase them, you know?

1222
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:18,900
Now, will this start,

1223
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,340
what I wanna know is, will this now begin

1224
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:24,920
to be a new emphasis in the

1225
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,760
fetish fashion scene

1226
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,780
with Catholicism?

1227
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:32,000
Will there be now more nun outfits,

1228
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,160
rubber nun outfits?

1229
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,240
Oh man, didn't Madonna wear that out

1230
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,700
15 years ago?

1231
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,700
Really? It's been there.

1232
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:41,520
Well, you know when you get your last...

1233
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,280
Well, now it'll become all that it'll be about

1234
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,280
will be now, you know, that Catholic goth.

1235
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,380
That'll be what people wear in the supermarkets

1236
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:49,560
in Walmart now.

1237
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,100
Pretty soon, when you go to the fetish ball,

1238
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,900
they'll be doing the Stations of the Cross.

1239
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,880
It's like, you know, when you get your last righteous

1240
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,120
stuff, and the priest has your last purple thing on there

1241
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,500
and stuff, the bishop will come and slap you

1242
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,120
in the face and anoint your head

1243
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,000
with oil. Didn't that get old with

1244
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,120
Marilyn Manson? Actually, didn't it

1245
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:08,140
get old with Alice Cooper? Isn't that how

1246
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:09,900
Alice and Marilyn both got old? Actually, didn't it get old

1247
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,460
with the Dottas in World War I?

1248
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,240
Didn't it get old with Robert Johnson?

1249
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:15,980
Yeah, I mean like... Didn't it get old when

1250
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:17,940
Peter the Great started with all the

1251
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,880
drunken sign-off things? Didn't it get old

1252
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,000
when that nearsighted caveman

1253
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,020
talked to his buddies in the

1254
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,040
barnyard and went to get him some food?

1255
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,800
And what, uh, did he

1256
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,260
town, did he?

1257
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:31,460
It's real old. Yeah.

1258
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:33,360
Wasn't it old when that... It's old.

1259
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,140
...old, old policeman bent over

1260
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:37,780
and was roundly

1261
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:40,120
invigorated by that old, old, old

1262
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,860
policeman? Penta... I mean priest!

1263
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,400
Bent... bent across...

1264
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:45,480
Pentecost.

1265
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,620
Had to go through

1266
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:48,240
Benteclaw.

1267
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:51,520
Pentecostal studies.

1268
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,140
Ha ha ha!

1269
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,960
I was Catholic and I don't like what you guys

1270
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:58,000
were saying on the radio tonight. Oh, man.

1271
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:00,000
I was raised Catholic too, that's why

1272
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,040
I can come up with the better jokes.

1273
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,980
That's what the guy with the shotgun's gonna

1274
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:05,360
be saying in the parking lot.

1275
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:07,140
No, because you know what?

1276
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:10,160
I know from growing up in that church

1277
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:12,140
that everybody out there

1278
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:13,740
who did the same is sitting back on

1279
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:15,940
my God, I don't want to

1280
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:17,560
show my face to the world.

1281
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,600
I don't even want to admit it.

1282
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,080
I've never had anything to do with that thing anymore.

1283
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,000
...closed as far as my head is...

1284
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,140
Hey, DJ A is here!

1285
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:27,660
Until next week,

1286
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,720
keep your head on tight, you're back to the

1287
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,260
winter sack in the saddle!

1288
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,940
...in the sack to princess me!

1289
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:35,140
Auf Wiedersehen, you swine!

1290
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:42,860
...in the saddle!

1291
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,780
...in the saddle!

1292
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,900
...in the saddle!

1293
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:49,520


1294
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:49,520


1295
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:49,520


1296
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:49,520


1297
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:54,080
...in the saddle!

1298
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,600
...in the saddle!

1299
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,320
The path of the righteous

1300
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,940
man is beset on

1301
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:02,060
all sides by the inequities

1302
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:04,260
of the selfish and the tyranny

1303
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,660
of evil men.

1304
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,320
There is

1305
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,940
a God I

1306
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:23,840
know. I'm God

1307
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:24,940
