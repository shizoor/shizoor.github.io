1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:09,380
Yeah, it's fun. Why? Why? So exciting. Freaky. Crazy. Fun and games. Crazy.

2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,840
We have no clue and we're, why? But when we see an angel, ah! Whoa! Normalcy. My flesh,

3
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,860
my body longs for you. Touch. There's going to be a surprise waiting. Literally. Fender

4
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,980
bender. My uncle pulls into the rest stop and you may tap, tap, tap. To ignore means

5
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,500
you're going to miss something. Mental, mental physical sensation. Ah, it's a ghost! Whoa,

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,260
whoa, whoa. How do you react when he comes in a way that you've never seen before? Good?

7
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,900
Flesh? I've seen it many times when I remember my first time. Ooh, dear. This is strange

8
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:51,520
stuff. It's a progression. Ozzy Osbourne. Ozzy Osbourne. This is Ozzy Osbourne. Yeah,

9
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,840
yeah. If I had not have hired him, I would have either hurt myself, injured myself, or

10
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,060
quit. Thank you for using me.

11
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,620
Hey, fellas! Look! The Self Genius. Power of Swag.

12
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,520
It's a familiar object. You've seen one or it's pictured. Never touched one. Beautiful

13
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,660
and it's dainty, snub-nosed, wicked.

14
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:35,200
Pretty in its way, Inspector. Pretty and dangerous. This little blue 22 can be found

15
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:48,120
among the exhibits in the Black Museum. The Black Museum. Starring Flounder Salt. Well,

16
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:54,200
here we are in the Black Museum. It's an impressive place. The kind of echoing awe which comes

17
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,320
from a vaulted ceiling and somber lighting.

18
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,600
Weird. Fantastic. Well, yes, it's comfortable in your hand. And suddenly, a trifle strange,

19
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,300
isn't it?

20
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,960
Oh, thank you both for coming.

21
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:06,700
Funny.

22
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,620
What is?

23
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,700
Oh, now, leave me alone. Leave me alone.

24
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,820
An embarrassing conclusion, to say the least.

25
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,840
Very good. Another discrepancy.

26
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,140
Laugh, baby. Laugh for the last time.

27
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,040
I will kill you.

28
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,620
Thank you, Mrs. Merritt.

29
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,380
There was more. Much more.

30
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,280
Just a moment.

31
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:34,280
Oh, I must be gay. Oh, hello. Hello out there. No need to thank me for once again bringing

32
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,900
all those gay two-way cameras into your homes. That's what we're here for. All right. Well,

33
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,920
I can see through the two-way cameras, but don't worry. You know how entertaining that

34
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:48,000
I can be. Wait a minute. Get away from those TV sets. Don't turn those dials. Just relax,

35
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,280
sit back, and resume your customary drooling. Oh, they, oh, we almost had a little scene

36
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,380
there. All right. That was just an expression I was using.

37
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:56,820
Stay away from me. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to

38
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,220
do that.

39
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:57,540
Get out.

40
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,500
The bonging and the donging and the gonging on the bell. You mean.

41
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,160
Exactly.

42
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:01,940
But then.

43
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,600
I said.

44
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:02,920
But who?

45
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,040
But she. Kool-Aid and Bunny Man.

46
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,660
Coming. Coming. All you need to enter is an empty package.

47
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:16,040
From PR news in Washington, unimportant. Arizona turkey John McCain shot and wounded

48
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,740
four people. Killing himself yesterday, as the Bush administration looked on. On Wall

49
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:26,820
Street 6, 14, 4, 13, police in Cleveland reportedly have arrested children under the name of the

50
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:32,460
the age of two. The companies that make older children have voluntarily decided to pull infants

51
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:37,600
off the market. Pediatricians say children six and under are not effective in treating PR news.

52
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:46,140
The group says this is PR news. Drug super bug. A reality idiot idiot bugs. We have to obtain a

53
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:54,800
sample. We have to we have to grow sample sample growing uh exactly. No one should take idiot idiot

54
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:02,300
bugs. It's a good idea. Being contagious. Sharing the skin. Idiot idiot bugs. And or uh and or uh

55
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:07,020
they uh they uh that that that that that that that that that and I know it's in the world's

56
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:14,420
interest to make a nuclear weapon. Make a nuclear weapon. Make a nuclear weapon. I take this I take

57
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,260
the threat. I take this I take the idiot idiot bugs. Chief uh if I were surrounded by six or

58
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,100
eight of these things would I stand a chance with them? Well there's no problem. If you had a gun

59
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,780
shoot them in the head. That's a sure way to get them.

60
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,760
Move to kill them. If you don't get yourself a club or a torch. Beat them or burn them. They go up

61
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,800
pretty easy. Well chief McClellan how long do you think it will take you until you get the situation

62
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,920
under control? Well that's pretty hard to say. We want no matter how many of them there are.

63
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,940
You know when we find them

64
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,620
.I'm gonna kill this .

65
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,200
ndying to get the situation under control. Well that's pretty hard to say. We don't know

66
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,180
Michelle Wheeler and Casey казanoff.

67
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,840
Uh in time...

68
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,080
wrap this up in 24 hours?

69
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,580
Well, we don't really know.

70
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,760
We know we'll be into it most of the night,

71
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,040
probably into the early morning.

72
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,740
We're working our way toward Willard,

73
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,740
and we'll team up with the National Guard over there,

74
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,460
and then we'll be able to give a more definite view.

75
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,480
Thank you very much, Chief McClellan.

76
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,800
This is Bill Cardill, WIIC-TV11 News.

77
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,900
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

78
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,220
This is KRK-TV, and now for the latest news.

79
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,120
Early tonight, the captain of a Swedish icebreaker

80
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,840
in the Barents Sea reported seeing a strange red fireball

81
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,660
come out of the sky.

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Says the captain,

83
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,560
it hovered above my ship for about a minute

84
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,220
and then headed south by southwest.

85
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,560
Unquote.

86
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,340
Radio Cairo reports a herd of camels

87
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,040
stampeded by a comet-like object

88
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,560
streaking southwest across the Sahara,

89
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,380
and in Cape Town, Africa, a boar, no doubt,

90
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,740
reports a similar flash across the sky.

91
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,860
And still one more, ladies and gentlemen.

92
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,920
A farmer in Auckland, New Zealand,

93
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,880
reported the strange glowing object

94
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,500
this time moving northeast.

95
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,160
Now let's see.

96
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,880
Barents Sea.

97
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,860
Cairo.

98
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,660
Auckland.

99
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,360
New Zealand.

100
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,640
Considering the timetable of these reports,

101
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,680
the stranger from space should be over our California desert

102
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,660
in a matter of minutes.

103
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,920
And that stranger from space

104
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,120
actually is this radio station.

105
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,480
A WCSB station

106
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,860
flying over...

107
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,940
Cleveland, not California.

108
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,040
And this is the all...

109
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,000
This is our new all-news format, friends.

110
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,760
This is the all-powerful muscle of truth.

111
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,080
My script for this show is only five sentences long,

112
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,700
and if I say,

113
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,480
thanks to Fernand and Andy Lemur

114
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,700
for the opening collages,

115
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,620
as well as

116
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,700
Norrell Preff of norrellpreff.com,

117
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,800
then it would be better,

118
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,580
and I would have only three sentences left in my script.

119
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,360
Also, thanks for those wonderful erotic photos

120
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,820
of our Lord Beezus,

121
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,740
hey, Reisties.

122
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,940
That's what makes this show better

123
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,720
is the fact that there's no control,

124
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,280
only loose, flaccid control.

125
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,860
Better, better.

126
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,860
It's better, better, better, better, better, better, better, better, better, better.

127
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,600
It's less.

128
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,440
It's flaccid.

129
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,680
It needs to be perked up.

130
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,100
It needs caffeine.

131
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,120
A shot in the arm.

132
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,320
A boost in the ego.

133
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,740
A pop in the eye.

134
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,860
It needs to be subdued.

135
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,620
Geniusized.

136
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,980
And that's what we need Bob for, friends.

137
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,840
Little Bobby.

138
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,580
Good little Bob.

139
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,240
And bad little Dave.

140
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,120
He is Bob.

141
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,680
Bob is not here,

142
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,280
except in Spirite.

143
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,960
But Dave is here.

144
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,220
I am with the floating pipe,

145
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,100
doing many, many different types of takeoffs

146
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,860
on different stupid things,

147
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,360
only to support the stupid message.

148
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,860
Votes of genius is coming and cumbering.

149
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,460
The erection.

150
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,520
The erection.

151
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,880
Well, when you vote subgenius, who do you vote for?

152
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,780
I mean, aside from writing in Dobbs as world overlord.

153
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,120
Well, um.

154
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,060
Hello?

155
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:04,780
Hello?

156
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,340
Hello?

157
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,920
Princess, Princess Weena, remember.

158
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,480
Hello?

159
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,540
Remember what they taught you about being close to the mic.

160
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,360
Oh, yeah.

161
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,080
Yeah, I thought, I thought you might need that little reminder.

162
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,900
If my forehead flies off, you must respond to feel the air which is dead.

163
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,860
Remember, Bob does not permit the air which is sleeping.

164
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,900
Sleeping at the top.

165
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,200
Not only that, he don't never change.

166
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,360
Never, never.

167
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,720
Only if there's a fly in the oinkment,

168
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,560
and sometimes it gets too greasy where he comes from.

169
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,420
Yeah, but who doesn't want a slippery sky?

170
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,580
Little bit at least.

171
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:38,480
Nyeep.

172
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:39,820
Nyeep.

173
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:40,620
Nyeep.

174
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,880
Damn flies everywhere.

175
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,220
It's all over my oinkments.

176
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,780
Those are the observe, uh, obverse.

177
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,800
Oh, it's time for another obverse fly.

178
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,680
Wink in the oinkment.

179
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,500
Hello, you're here, you're on the airs.

180
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,300
Okay, well, I guess they have nothing to say.

181
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,180
It's a pronoun.

182
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,980
That was the outer space line.

183
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,380
It is a pronoun.

184
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,520
We're not allowed to pick that one up when we're on the air, Dave.

185
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,140
Do you know that?

186
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,660
Of course I know this.

187
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,540
Since I was a child in Hugo, Armenia, the Armenians used to come and eat my pants.

188
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,480
Really?

189
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,260
It was horrible.

190
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,660
Oh, I'm so sorry.

191
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,900
And some days the Americans were involved with the Soviet Union.

192
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,600
Mm-hmm.

193
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,540
And in the other times the fascist Hitler used to buy my parents underpants.

194
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,260
Wow.

195
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,840
Talk about making light of a bunch of stupid serious stuff, eh?

196
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,600
Eh?

197
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,140
Eh?

198
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,640
Eh?

199
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:32,900
Eh?

200
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:32,920
Eh?

201
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,160
Eh?

202
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:33,860


203
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,060


204
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,060


205
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,160
Eh?

206
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:34,320


207
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:34,420
Eh?

208
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:34,440


209
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,340
Eh?

210
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:35,380
Eh?

211
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:35,380


212
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:35,380


213
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:35,840
Eh?

214
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,440
Eh?

215
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,320
Eh?

216
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:47,360
Eh?

217
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:53,940


218
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,360
I'm embarrassed.

219
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:02,500
Oh, I remember now.

220
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:02,940
For some reason I've remembered.

221
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,520
How would I know that that's Stelles Hansen?

222
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,700
Because all my mistakes against you, Well, I only put his

223
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,760
left ear in Detective George's mouth.

224
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:06,760


225
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:06,860


226
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,320
The only evil I ever had was that you were behind me.

227
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:08,420
You could never tell.

228
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:08,420


229
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,840
Manure on the yards of America, you might say.

230
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,840
Starting in Baltimore on November 10th.

231
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,380
Baltimore doesn't actually need any more manure,

232
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,460
but it's getting it in the form of Reverend Susie the Flusie.

233
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,340
Y'all can go to Falls Point, Dar.

234
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,080
And the amino acids.

235
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,240
And have your crab cakes.

236
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,120
And Reverend Carter LeBlanc.

237
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,300
And Priestess Pisces.

238
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,940
And Bleepo is going to be at Baltimore, I just found out.

239
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,960
Oh, son of the abject Lucifer.

240
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,420
Lucifer, I'm so unhappy to hear that.

241
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,180
And when did he decide to resign?

242
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,360
On November 10th.

243
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,980
That's when that show happens, is November 10th in Baltimore.

244
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,140
But that doesn't do the Cleveland Scotsyites any good.

245
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,360
Did you know that Baltimore was named after Lord Baltimore?

246
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:59,580
I thought it was a reference to the great subgenius Tim Orr.

247
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,840
And it was a commandment.

248
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,120
Tim Orr went by the name tentatively a convenience.

249
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,840
He was the first subgenius to get us in the international news

250
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,560
by making artwork out of two decapitated dogs

251
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,300
he found rotting in a train tunnel under Baltimore

252
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:24,260
and painting them, stringing them up by their hind legs.

253
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,480
They were decapitated and rotting.

254
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,180
Did I mention that?

255
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:27,660
Yes.

256
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,600
It was the smelliest art project that I ever heard of.

257
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,060
And he covered himself in white grease paint and nothing else.

258
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,940
And that's how the police found...

259
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,820
And that's how the police found him and a tunnel full of subgeniuses

260
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,240
who were all holding their noses.

261
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,420
Oh, I thought you were going to say decapitated and held by their hind legs.

262
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,020
No, no.

263
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,400
This is a true story.

264
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:52,200
And the sad thing is that that was the first time most people ever read

265
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,340
about our tender, loving church of the subgenius.

266
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,980
It was under the headline, cult leader kills dogs.

267
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,200
Now, has this one tentatively had his head covered with mustaches

268
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,420
and the big full beard?

269
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,320
Yeah.

270
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,200
I don't remember if this is when his scalp had a beard or the mustaches on it,

271
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,880
but it was one of those.

272
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,440
Since then, he tattooed a brain on his scalp,

273
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,380
although you don't see it when he has hair in there.

274
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,260
He was part of the new interior design cult,

275
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,220
which now does the modifications on the inside of several of his diamonds.

276
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:23,720
That's right.

277
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,780
That's the cool way.

278
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,840
Ultra, ultra cool.

279
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,580
If you want to have something, a design put on your, inside your skull,

280
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,540
why not put it inside your skull so your brain can look at it

281
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,820
instead of the people around you and be repulsed by it?

282
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:34,980
Right.

283
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,680
Here's the thing.

284
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,100
I mean...

285
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,640
Repulsed by it?

286
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,580
Every shirt.

287
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,820
Everybody wants to be cool.

288
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,860
And this particular season, the way to be cool is if you're a guy,

289
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,460
you have, I guess you're bald-headed or was that last year?

290
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,520
And you have to have the nose ring and the tattoos and stuff.

291
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,080
But that's because you're being trendy.

292
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,140
You want everybody to look at you and go,

293
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,480
man, you must have been cool in the 90s.

294
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:56,620
Yeah.

295
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,840
But, friends, if you're really cool,

296
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,260
you don't care what other people think of you

297
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,040
and you don't really care whether they even see your body modifications.

298
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,040
So the way we do it is we modify our insides.

299
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:14,200
We break bones and reset them with different artistic patterns to them.

300
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,620
And you can't see them.

301
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,760
And we don't care because it's what we feel.

302
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,860
That's why we do our art, our body modifications.

303
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:29,300
I can't show you my tattoo because it's on the inside of my stomach walls.

304
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:29,980
That hurt.

305
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,620
It was pain.

306
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,040
But that was real art.

307
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,800
That's the art that means something.

308
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,360
I do.

309
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,620
Like Phil Spector.

310
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,700
He was that kind of artist.

311
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,020
Right.

312
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,820
He'd get a tattoo on the inside.

313
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,360
And, dude, you know, if it's going to hurt, it's got to feel good for art.

314
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,340
Whoever the hell that is.

315
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,880
But, anyway, this one here is when I was in Austin.

316
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,740
I'm saying, saying, that's enough for New York State.

317
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,040
Yes, I do say that.

318
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,300
This one is when I was in Bacaville.

319
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,940
That's out in California for the mentally ill persons.

320
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,080
This one here is when I discovered.

321
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,380
You are now in Sing Sing.

322
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,220
J.R.B.

323
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,480
I am now in Sing Sing.

324
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,140
Yeah, the guy.

325
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,640
Did you see this pie up here on my titty?

326
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,340
Yes, I see the pie.

327
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,500
That's the pie for Bob.

328
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,060
I got that while I was in New Jersey State Penal Correctionist Institution.

329
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,000
I noticed they corrected that thing pretty well.

330
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,080
It's almost hardly bent anymore.

331
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:22,020
Well, he is doing much better now that he has had the exterior parts of his brain removed.

332
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,320
But there are still lots of tattoos inside we cannot take out.

333
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:31,860
If we only could come up with some sort of anti-laser device to remove the interior tattooing.

334
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,320
Is that outside tattooing?

335
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:42,060
When you do the anti-tat rant, I think you are really treading on some very thin ice there.

336
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:42,880
Thin skin.

337
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:43,900
Thin skin.

338
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,240
There are some thin skin listeners out there.

339
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,060
I don't care if they fail.

340
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:55,220
If their sensitive modernist ears feel a little bit insulted by the word of a subgenius preacher

341
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:01,160
who might be criticizing their tendency to want to normalize themselves and to wallow

342
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,920
in normalization.

343
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,260
Do you think some of these people have hair?

344
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:05,320


345
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,300
I think they are post-humanist ideas where you want to have your eye, ocular, the things

346
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,740
that hold your eyeballs crushed so your eyeballs appear completely fat with the front of your

347
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,100
forehead.

348
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,300
Can you get one of those?

349
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,260
Of course you can.

350
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,260
That's what I'm talking about.

351
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:17,480
Oh.

352
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,920
If you are like one of those unfortunate few who have not had your ocular, what do they

353
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,240
call them?

354
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:23,780
Ocular sockets.

355
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,180
Ocular sockets.

356
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,060
Yes, the ocular sockets.

357
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,160
The ocular sockets.

358
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,260
Yes.

359
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,860
Shaved down, smacked down and put down so they are all completely smooth.

360
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,580
Ocular smack down?

361
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,180
The rest of your face.

362
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:33,760
Yeah.

363
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,580
Hockey socks we call them.

364
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:35,920
Hockey socks.

365
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,500
Hockey socks.

366
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:36,700
Yes.

367
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:45,620
This music in the background, which I know is making you feel high, is by Reverend Just

368
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,420
John of just-john.com.

369
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,340
You don't write out dash.

370
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,240
It's a little dash between just and john.

371
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,260
You mean like just John, huh?

372
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:54,720
.com.

373
00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:00,560
And he has a new album out called The Old Double Melman, which is not a double album.

374
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,260
It's just called The Old Double Melman.

375
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,700
It's his old album too.

376
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:09,320
And that's what we're playing and that's why it's just-john.com.

377
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:14,800
I felt fine until you started describing that and that made my brain turn flip flops.

378
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,700
Now speaking of brains turning flip flops, we have to go to Amsterdam in the country

379
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,200
of Neanderthal lands.

380
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,360
How do you prepare for that, Stan?

381
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,800
I mean how do you get ready to go to Amsterdam to have your locks trimmed?

382
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,620
You take inoculations for marijuana.

383
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:32,880
You get inoculations.

384
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,780
You get marijuana inoculation shots.

385
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,880
So that you won't catch marijuana when you go to Amsterdam.

386
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,180
New York City?

387
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,300
So you get the frat bug or the Bobby Brook or the hop nigger?

388
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,060
Well, so you won't-it's contagious, you know.

389
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:47,740
Pops, man.

390
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,380
Pot is contagious.

391
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,160
And that-now we're going to Europe.

392
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,900
Notice that Princess Wee that we're choosing to go to Europe at a time when one euro is

393
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,560
one and a half dollar and one dollar weighs two pounds.

394
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,860
So basically we're going to be there.

395
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,980
We're going to be the poorest third world immigrants in Europe about the time we get

396
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,920
there with our American dollars, which will take a hundred American dollars and convert

397
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,680
into about 60 euros, which will buy you a pack of cigarettes.

398
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,060
But we're going to be there with friends and they'll take care of us.

399
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,180
Right.

400
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:25,000
Like they did last time, leaving us in that hotel in Hamburgerland in Germany.

401
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:25,440
Oh, well.

402
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,480
I thought they were just hearing that.

403
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,440
With those men interrogating us and that little puppy dog Pope who insisted on

404
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,140
taking over the whole subgenius country-euro power block.

405
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:42,360
Well, I heard that at one time both of your bodies bloat-your bloated bodies were found

406
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,120
in the Amsterdam canals after overconsumption of over-nanching canals.

407
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:51,840
Yes, that's why they're trying to outlaw everything in Holland just like here.

408
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,280
That's right, they should because-

409
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:53,620
No more oil slides.

410
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,880
No more smoking cigarettes in your own house.

411
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,580
Things have gone too far here.

412
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,220
You know what I'm trying to say?

413
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:57,920
More oil slides.

414
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,240
It was a pretty good place to have gone on there and then all of a sudden they decided

415
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:01,720
to ruin it.

416
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,820
You know, then everybody wants to smoke everything all the time.

417
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,000
America is a nation of figs.

418
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,880
You know, heck with this.

419
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,460
Figs?

420
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,040
Finks.

421
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,200
Oh, I thought-

422
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,600
No, Holland is a nation of figs.

423
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,280
I thought you dried fruit.

424
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:20,620
But, and Macedonia is a nation of figs, but America has become a nation of finks carrying

425
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:26,560
around their little pee test jars going, I can't wait to, please Mr. Boss Man, test my

426
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,220
pee pee so I can prove that I'm a good worker.

427
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,160
Well-

428
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,480
Oh my God, it makes me sick.

429
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,140
It makes me want to-

430
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,100
Oh my God, it smells awful in here now.

431
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,640
Can you believe we did that?

432
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,500
I'm Zaffa's daughter, Jane.

433
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,800
Now, what we're going to-

434
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,900
Now, this does concern the Cleveland Discozziites.

435
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:57,440
What we're going to miss, Princess Wee, when we go to preach at the Milkweg with Dr. Howell

436
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:57,620
and so forth.

437
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,460
No, the Milkweg's pretty close.

438
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:05,460
We're going to miss the Chaz Tribute Show at the Beachland Ballroom on November 23rd.

439
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,060
Well, I'll be there.

440
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,220
Well, everybody harpooned on the-

441
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:09,680
That's right.

442
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:09,960
Dave-

443
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,400
I'll be there.

444
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,000
I'll be there.

445
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,420
Dave will be there carrying tunes in a big-

446
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,080
Dobbs Welling.

447
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,800
Wheelbarrow.

448
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:23,520
Probably everybody who's ever played in Chaz's bands will be there, which would be over 100,000

449
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:23,900
people.

450
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,480
Yeah.

451
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,440
So, that's November 23rd at the Beachland Ballroom.

452
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:28,440


453
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:28,440


454
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:28,440


455
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:28,440


456
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:28,440


457
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:36,020
We're going to be there at the Beachland Ballroom in Cleveland for the tribute.

458
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,720
And then we got Mongoloidapalooza in December in San Francisco.

459
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,940
But that's like a devotional, a sub-devotional.

460
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,340
It's not as big as the real devotional.

461
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,540
It's not even a subgenius show.

462
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,560
They're just bringing me in because I used to know those guys.

463
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,520
Can you believe that?

464
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:06,400
And I can pass on dirty stories about the devos that I learned from my study of them.

465
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,000
You know, I hardly know those fellows, and yet I even know a few dirty devo stories.

466
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:16,340
Go back to the days of Kent, Ohio, which they thought was their playground or something,

467
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,560
their psychic and obverse obtuse.

468
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,480
It was their birth, their hometown.

469
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,660
My goodness.

470
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,000
Have you ever seen the little red boogey boy book?

471
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:25,540
No.

472
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,040
Yes, I have a copy of it.

473
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:27,460
Oh, I have one also.

474
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,000
Really?

475
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:28,440
Yes.

476
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm surprised you haven't sold it.

477
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,400
Those things are probably worth money.

478
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,340
Oh, I was even offered.

479
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,040
They're almost worth as much as Mal's little red book.

480
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,400
I have one of those also.

481
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,960
No, I really have a boogey boy book.

482
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,920
And it's signed, sealed, and delivered.

483
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,780
It has a number there.

484
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,280
I have no idea what the number means.

485
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,200
It's not a real number, if you know what I mean.

486
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,180
Right, and you can hardly read the book.

487
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,620
But I certainly—

488
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:54,200
Since he eschewed punctuation, I believe, or capital letters for the whole book.

489
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,300
But it was real artsful.

490
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:04,040
But he did love seeing Betty Page in a hernia suit surrounded by little ducks with big sharp teeth.

491
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,720
So, you know, I was sold on that.

492
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,820
Yeah, I would be too, especially if Mark did it.

493
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,160
Well, we're all kind of devolved.

494
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:22,780
Princess Wee and I were talking about how we had gone to visit a friend of ours who's a hippie.

495
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,780
And as we were leaving, we realized, well, we're not exactly hippies.

496
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,200
I mean, nobody really is anymore.

497
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,520
But, well, I guess some people are.

498
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,000
But we were more like—our friend is a hippie.

499
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,320
But we were more like beatnik hippie punks.

500
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,600
Sometimes it's cultural movement.

501
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:46,180
Because you couldn't say we were proper hippies because we're too smart-ass to be proper.

502
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:52,020
We're not nice and sweet and lovey and peace-y enough to be proper hippies.

503
00:21:52,020 --> 00:22:00,860
We're too no-future, end-of-the-world, planet-of-the-apes, Twilight Zone punks.

504
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,260
Well, I think you should extract—

505
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,560
Repo Man. The Repo Man generation.

506
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,160
You could keep Repo Man in there.

507
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,720
And also Planet of the Apes. Planet of the Repo Apes. And completely—

508
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,580
Planet of the Repo Men.

509
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,060
Starring—well, they're doing a—

510
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:18,780
Harry Dean Stanton, man.

511
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:22,000
Whatever movie Charlton Heston starred in in the past—

512
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,620
Now it'll be Will Smith.

513
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,580
I'm not kidding. The Omega Man is about to come out.

514
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,080
The new remake of the Omega Man starring Will Smith.

515
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:31,980
Oh, please. Oh, no.

516
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,720
Well, now, I've said that about—

517
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,920
His Genghis Popkart.

518
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,320
I know.

519
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,740
I-Robot and I-Stang. And those were both pretty good.

520
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,600
Will Smith did a good job playing Ivan Stang in that Subgenius movie.

521
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,240
I wasn't—it was like, I don't know if I can handle a black guy playing Ivan Stang.

522
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,980
Is that so far from the real—but, you know, he did a great job.

523
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,020
I got a hand in it, too.

524
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,740
Yes, he really did.

525
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,660
It was pretty smooth, I must say.

526
00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:00,180
And, in fact, any job he tackles, any role he tackles, he tackles like a star.

527
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,840
And that's because—that's what we're all about here on the Church of the Subgenius.

528
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,640
Right. Stardom.

529
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,140
Star culture. Yep. Stardom.

530
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:07,780
Celebrities.

531
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,140
Celebrities. The blockbuster mentality.

532
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:18,600
I've been keeping up with that by watching a website called thesuperficial.com.

533
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,740
Because you're ugly.

534
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:29,360
And because I've been following that sarcastic website, I know what all the women with large breasts in Hollywood are up to

535
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,460
and what products they're holding in front of their breastages.

536
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:39,080
And I know exactly where Britney and Kevin are in their various court battles.

537
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,220
See, but this is a new—

538
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:40,920
And drug tests.

539
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,880
This is a new cultural thing. That's where—

540
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,040
I've been reading and sniffing Britney's drug tests online.

541
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:50,820
See, you are there. You understand this culture and you're there.

542
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,400
Finally. Finally.

543
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:51,880
And the women in this are still—

544
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,060
Finally.

545
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,960
Are still—have hardly passed the point of,

546
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'm Britney. I'm not.

547
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,440
Well, you can start—

548
00:23:59,440 --> 00:23:59,740
You know, that's your only pain.

549
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,180
Leave Britney alone!

550
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,460
Leave Dobbs alone!

551
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,840
He's a human being!

552
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:15,300
That poor guy's going to be a has-been before he's even been.

553
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,500
I'd like to dance with him.

554
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,260
I thought it was a girl when I first saw it.

555
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,040
We both thought it was a girl.

556
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,000
We both thought it was a mannish girl.

557
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,240
I knew it was a teenage gay guy. I knew that part. I still want to dance with him.

558
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,560
You're so savvy, Dave.

559
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:38,140
I think that would be the new cultural thing to do. Just for one dance and then have it on America Loves Dancing with Dave and that guy.

560
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:48,520
What is that program where they do all those ballroom dances and they're judged by their foreskins and their peerages, different people look down their long noses at them or their big feet?

561
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,020
American Idol? Queen for a Day?

562
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,480
Is it American Idol where they dance the night away?

563
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,140
Idling in America.

564
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,500
No, there's a new American Idol where like,

565
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:00,020
Alright, Mr. Gingerfish, you're going to dance with—

566
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,660
And then, you know, they have some real hooky star come out there and dance with this.

567
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,620
Oh, I got to dance with her!

568
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:09,340
This is one of your Earth television shows.

569
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:14,320
Yes, correctly, it is. One of the Earth television—not mine. You know, come on now.

570
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,300
But it is your Earth days.

571
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,000
It's not mine.

572
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,140
It's my Earth. It's not Stang's Earth and it's not your Earth. It's not ours.

573
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,520
Actually, friends, this is a rented planet, it turns out.

574
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:26,820
Yeah.

575
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:35,060
And Jehovah One had been renting it to the Exists, who consider us about on the level of mildew.

576
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:46,500
The way we regard not even ants, but mildew in our kitchen. That's the way the aliens regard the human race on their planet Earth. Earth Farm One, it's called.

577
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,980
Earth Farm, yeah. Terra Farm also won. Terra Farm.

578
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:58,420
Well, it used to be on Mars, during World War II, of course. They switched over, and that sounds ridiculous and I say all this to ensure disbelief.

579
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,640
I get so tired of that.

580
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,460
It blew us through Winsley's too, you know, a little little hole out in the desert or whatever.

581
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:18,880
We went to a little bit on Mars on Earth today. Princess Wee and I have been slumming, or rather, industrialling—on Sundays when the weather's nice we've been driving out to the Flats and south of the Flats.

582
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:18,960
Slumming along the Earth, er, these are two beauties sitting on the Earth to stay warm.

583
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:18,960


584
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:36,160
There's this whole area between 71 and 77, extending south from downtown down to bordered by Harvard Street, where the metal, steel plants, and all the water treatment, the steel pollution water treatment facility.

585
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:40,060
It's basically, we call it hell.

586
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:46,900
Princess Wee had been down there on the job at one point and seen a hellish land that she wanted to show me.

587
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:54,480
And we had a little trouble finding it by car, so we used Google Earth to examine Cleveland from the alien point of view.

588
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:58,860
And sure enough, we looked for, where is the spot where there's nothing alive?

589
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,500
And there is a big, big spot.

590
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:10,660
It's vast. It's a vast expanse of death, where it's nothing but concrete and tar and steel and...

591
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:14,320
Piles of rocks and dirt and asphalt.

592
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,620
And there's a big black hole, right?

593
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,440
In the middle of it.

594
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,540
A featureless nothingness.

595
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,140
It's got a golf course just on one side of it.

596
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:29,440
But, yeah, we were intrigued by this blight.

597
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,920
The forbidden zone, you might say, in Cleveland.

598
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:39,120
So we'd been trying to drive in there with, you know, we'd take radiation medication and stuff before we'd go in.

599
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:44,200
Because I know, you can see the toxic monster stuff seeping out of the ground.

600
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,760
You can see things popping up, the zygotes and the ergot.

601
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,800
That was a...

602
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,020
That was a punk rock thing to do in my erstwhile days.

603
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,140
Really go out to the decaying Cleveland.

604
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:56,200
We would go out there and take pictures and, like, you know, hang, you know, around decaying things.

605
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,420
Weird, rusted out things that you couldn't even describe.

606
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,580
And look at the unnatural holes filled with green.

607
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,400
No, it's gray.

608
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,400
No, it's pink.

609
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,440
What is it?

610
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,100
Oh, it's both.

611
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,100
Oh, we better get away from it.

612
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,040
No, let's stay here.

613
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,680
Urban spelunking.

614
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,600
Yes, urban...

615
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,700
That is brilliant.

616
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,940
Urban spelunking.

617
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,300
Is that what they used to call it in France?

618
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,480
I think that's what they call it in San Francisco.

619
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,320
But we...

620
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:17,820
I'm sorry.

621
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,560
But we...

622
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,240
It's hard.

623
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,700
There's a lot of places that are locked up.

624
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,180
I mean, it's like...

625
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,840
It looks like a nuclear testing ground.

626
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,060
Do not enter private property only.

627
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:40,960
It looks kind of like the end of Robocop, where the evil criminal gets the acid poured all over him.

628
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,780
They filmed that in Dallas, actually, but this whole area.

629
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,580
Oh, did they?

630
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,120
For miles.

631
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:46,600
Miles.

632
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,180
And miles and miles of blighted...

633
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,380
We call it Clevelandescotsea.

634
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,640
That used to stretch right to the lake until they turned the flats into the yuppie, wonderful,

635
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,900
calm flats area.

636
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,220
Right.

637
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:58,660
Right.

638
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,400
There were strange things right there.

639
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:06,500
There's a lot of strange hideousness still on the river in the flats, but they...

640
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,380
Absentively.

641
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,960
You have to go a little bit further down and deeper into the hellishness of hell.

642
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,080
Yes, comrade.

643
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,680
To see where it's undisturbed.

644
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,780
You're sold to mine still.

645
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,500
Yeah.

646
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,540
And the rust mines.

647
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,900
Now, that was where we went.

648
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:23,460
Like, they still give tours of the rust mines of Cleveland, and we took that tour.

649
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:31,360
You go down 5,000 feet underground, and for like 20 miles going out from downtown Cleveland

650
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,840
and under the lake, they're mining this rust.

651
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:39,700
And I read on Wikipedia, that's where, like, when you leave your tools out in your shed

652
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:44,740
and leave the door open and everything gets covered with rust, that rust all comes from Cleveland.

653
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,160
Yeah.

654
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,280
That's from the Cleveland rust mines.

655
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,160
If you get rust on your...

656
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,380
It's magnetic there.

657
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,460
You're in Alaska, and your stuff gets rusty.

658
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:57,580
That rust is brought in by the government that's bought from the Cleveland rust mines.

659
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,060
They don't have to have...

660
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:04,180
You know, there's no real need for rust, but it's a subsidy that dates back to, like, World War I.

661
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,460
They needed rust back then, so they started paying these guys to mine the rust out of Cleveland.

662
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,920
And now, it's like...

663
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,700
It's such a big pork barrel thing for this area.

664
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,860
They're still exporting rust all over the world, even though nobody needs it or wants it.

665
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,440
The governments all force it on all metals.

666
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,720
Yes, well, we are talking to the River of the Stain.

667
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,720
Unless you pay that extra stainless steel coating tax.

668
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:34,220
The subgenius candidate for the mayor of Cleveland, also the lovely Mrs. Princess Wiardo,

669
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,080
candidate for the mayoress of Cleveland, talking about the rust mines.

670
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,740
Cleveland rust mines, yeah.

671
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,300
And also, we've been getting some emails saying that,

672
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,140
what would you do in the current situation?

673
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,680
What would you do in the current situation regarding the rust mines?

674
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,340
Would you simply move them to another place?

675
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,540
Get rid of the government subsidy?

676
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,440
What would you do?

677
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,200
Is that the rust mines or the rust mires?

678
00:30:54,300 --> 00:31:00,780
I would use them as a nuclear waste storage facility.

679
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,580
See, I would crank up that nuclear power plant out near where you live, near Ashtabula, the dangerous one.

680
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,760
I'd build a whole bunch more of those on that fault line.

681
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:15,080
And then bury the waste under Cleveland in these miles and miles.

682
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:15,400
And then bury the waste under Cleveland in these miles and miles.

683
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:20,760
In fact, I feel that the tunnels themselves are a danger because of sinkholes.

684
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,500
You know, they're creating sinkholes already in many parts of town.

685
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:31,980
So we need to pump the nuclear waste, fill up those miles of tunnels with plutonium, waste plutonium and so forth,

686
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:38,800
that keeps the alcatas and cicadas from getting it and getting into it.

687
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:44,360
It seals off the rust for future generations, if they ever want to get to it.

688
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:44,520
Right.

689
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,080
Right.

690
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,140


691
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,140


692
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,140


693
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,140


694
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,140


695
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,140


696
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,140


697
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,140


698
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,140


699
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,140


700
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,140


701
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,140


702
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,760
And of course, it'll keep the rust alive forever.

703
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,300
Well, now, what about...

704
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,880
And cause also, the other thing about the radiation is...

705
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,100
All right.

706
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,240
I learned this today.

707
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,380
It can cause women to grow 50 feet tall.

708
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,120
Certain types of radiation.

709
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,320
And that would help when perhaps you're trying to start this new race.

710
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,980
You want to start these subgenius 50-foot tall women or...

711
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,200
That would basically just help with my...

712
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,840
That's just for my personal fetish.

713
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,540
Just a climbing...

714
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,880
Great, big, healthy, strong...

715
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,420
Trying to get up those legs all the way up to 50 feet up in the air.

716
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:13,820
Big, big women.

717
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,380
Climbing like a mountain...

718
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:15,920
I don't know.

719
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:20,640
This is like the most convo-torqued logic I have encountered.

720
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,380
But what if you had a 50-foot pappy?

721
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,260
50-foot man.

722
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:26,940
A 50-foot man.

723
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,680
To love you like a little baby dog.

724
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,120
Oh, Kong.

725
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,720
Or perhaps to flip you out the railroad windows.

726
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,580
I'd rather die.

727
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,640
I'd rather die.

728
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,400
Oh, Kong.

729
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,860
Oh, Kong.

730
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,980
Well, to be calm.

731
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,320
That is what is wrong.

732
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:43,800
Kong.

733
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:43,800


734
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,280
Is he...

735
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,180
He is world-weary.

736
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,920
He is tired of the struggle of fighting his inner demons.

737
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,940
Who all appear to be tattooed to the inside of his skull.

738
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,140
But that's another story.

739
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,540
They still inhabit the different parts of the ganglia.

740
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,460
All the way down the spinal column.

741
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,060
He is one of them now.

742
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,520
He doesn't even know it.

743
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:13,500
He is a man of the past.

744
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:13,880
He is a man of the past.

745
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:13,880


746
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:13,880


747
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:13,880


748
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:13,880


749
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,420
I don't get your sense of humor.

750
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,200
I can't understand what's wrong with you people.

751
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,080
I don't get it.

752
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,780
Can't you please leave me here?

753
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,580
He is convo-torqued.

754
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:24,820
I don't get it.

755
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,180
Get out of my dreams.

756
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,220
I can't.

757
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:30,940
Dave, have you ever lost a job because of your sense of humor?

758
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,040
I...

759
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,100
Well, no.

760
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:33,820
I...

761
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,500
I'm pretty sure...

762
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:41,300
I'm pretty sure I've not gotten lots of jobs because of my sense of humor shown during a job interview.

763
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,080
I think many people...

764
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,260
They didn't pick up on it.

765
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,360
They didn't get it.

766
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,500
Well, they're not...

767
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,080
They got real mad.

768
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,540
That's what happened.

769
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:48,900
They hit me.

770
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,620
They sued me.

771
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,280
Hit you?

772
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,200
They ran me out of the business.

773
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,420
They tried to run you over?

774
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,900
They said, you'll never work in the Dallas industrial film business again, buddy.

775
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,720
I put you in the fuzzy box where the little red light comes on and goes,

776
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,420
What the...

777
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,880
You blew that joke.

778
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,000
You're never going to work in this town again.

779
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:11,060
Unless you learn how to blow it right.

780
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,100
See, everybody.

781
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:13,740
Starting here.

782
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,100
Fizz, fuzz, fizz, fuzz.

783
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,840
Now you work in Hollywood, you gotta learn to blow it right.

784
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,380
No, the series is...

785
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:26,260
Princess Wee's quoting my dad's list of...

786
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:27,820
Of blowing it.

787
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,400
How would you put it?

788
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,320
Crepitations.

789
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,140
Crepitations?

790
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,660
Yeah, when your butt blows it.

791
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,400
They come in these...

792
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,000
These categories.

793
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,480
The fizz.

794
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,560
The fuzz.

795
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,280
The fizz fuzz.

796
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,160
The fuzzy was...

797
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,580
The rattler.

798
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,060
The rattler.

799
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,040
The rump splitter.

800
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,420
And the frosted fernanner.

801
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,960
The frosted fernanner.

802
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,220
That's a real light one.

803
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:50,800
That's like...

804
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,800
Silent but deadly.

805
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,000
You saved that for last.

806
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:54,940
Yeah.

807
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,360
I thought maybe the rump splitter was...

808
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,380
Well, it starts with the fizz, which is small.

809
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,300
You know, a little...

810
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,000
Piff.

811
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,660
Up through the fuzz.

812
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:01,840
Piff.

813
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,300
Piff.

814
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,400
Which is really what you need.

815
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,100
Mostly here.

816
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,240
The fizz fuzz.

817
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:07,560
Oh, no.

818
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,300
Wait, wait, wait.

819
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:08,820
Which old people do a lot.

820
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,740
The fuzzy was...

821
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,500
Oh, the fizz fuzz is the rattling of the...

822
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,640
No, that's the rattler.

823
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,540
Oh, that's the rattler.

824
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,440
Oh, you mean the cheek slapping together is the rattling?

825
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:16,880
The rattler.

826
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,920
Oh, I thought it was a snake.

827
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,540
But, okay, so what's the fizz fuzz?

828
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,420
That's the two-parter?

829
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,140
Like an old lady two-parter?

830
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,360
Yeah.

831
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,820
Like grandma walks by and goes...

832
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,060
Right.

833
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:24,460
Fizz fuzz.

834
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:24,860
Exactly.

835
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,920
When grandma walks by, you hear the fizz fuzz.

836
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,920
The fuzzy was...

837
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,160
What are you talking about?

838
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:30,920
I don't do that.

839
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,780
I'm a woman, see?

840
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:35,300
The fuzzy was is more like when your dad wakes up in the morning.

841
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,820
So that you're blinded for about a half an hour?

842
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,460
Yeah, just prior to the rattler.

843
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,540
The rump splitter, of course, we don't need...

844
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,800
I mean, that speaks for itself.

845
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,820
It shouts for itself.

846
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,040
It was the 23rd president, wasn't it?

847
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:55,120
And the rattler, the rump splitter, and the frosted fernaner.

848
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,260
Fernaner.

849
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,500
Is that some sort of Carolina vernacular?

850
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,180
It's very quiet.

851
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,020
It's the one that...

852
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,220
You think you can get away with.

853
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,720
Are children allowed to eat fernaners, so to speak?

854
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,620
Is it a fruit from the vegetable kingdom in the south of the border?

855
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,340
When I was a kid in Texas...

856
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:18,300
Now, I have not encountered this particular little kid tradition anywhere else.

857
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:25,760
When we were kids in Texas, if some kid in the classroom or the tree house or whatever cut one,

858
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,560
freds out, whatever,

859
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:36,320
the last person to put their fist against their forehead like that with their little finger raised near,

860
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,940
a fist against forehead, the last person had to catch it and paint it green and eat it.

861
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,040
Oh, man.

862
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,160
Does that ring any bells with you?

863
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,200
Man, we didn't have that.

864
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:52,260
No, all we had was slugs and no returns, where if you let one go, everybody could beat you up unless you screamed slugs and no returns first.

865
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:52,960
I never heard that.

866
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,820
Now, see, if we'd known that, we wouldn't have had to hit ourselves in the forehead all the time.

867
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,540
No, we didn't have that.

868
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,880
We didn't have paint kits or any of that stuff.

869
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,660
Did you guys have any other special equipment?

870
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,600
Because, man, that would have really caught on great around here.

871
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,820
Children love excreted inflations like nobody's business.

872
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,380
We had a game where you had to be different horses' names,

873
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,220
and you'd go around the circle shouting out your name as if you were rooting in a race for your horse to win.

874
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,320
So it would be like, lightning, midnight, hoof-hearted, hided.

875
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,400
Hoof-hearted.

876
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,460
The person that got hoof-hearted and hided, the one that got hided,

877
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,520
when they finally realized that they were going to win,

878
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,220
they were being forced to shout out that they were the one that had broken wind.

879
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,880
That was the big joke.

880
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,260
That's so immature.

881
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,740
It was a shaggy dog for little girls at a sleeping party.

882
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,400
Come on.

883
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:46,040
We actually lit our excreted inflations and had contests to see who could make the hugest blue flame.

884
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,400
I swear to God, like lepetamine.

885
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,660
We had little uniforms that you could, you know,

886
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,180
they were like things cut out of the back, and you'd pull that down, and you would let people...

887
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,160
For pyroflatulation contests.

888
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,200
Yeah, pyroflatulation contests.

889
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,440
We had one at X Day.

890
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,100
We had one at X Day 9, and I won because nobody else entered.

891
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,120
Well, that means you lost.

892
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,020
They all passed out.

893
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,260
They drank too much and were passed out, and I was the only one left.

894
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,420
But your beard was scorched.

895
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,780
Princess, we ran away, but I had a couple of three-footers.

896
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,840
Yeah, and most of the hair on your body was burned off, too.

897
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,800
I wasn't about to paint them any color or do anything else with them.

898
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:22,280
Why do women hate pyroflatulation excretion?

899
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:22,800
I don't.

900
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,840
You like them?

901
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,820
I don't like them, but I don't hate them.

902
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,440
See, there you go.

903
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,500
See, you don't like them.

904
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:32,300
She'll watch a YouTube video of one, but she's not going to shoot one for you.

905
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:40,120
She's not going to film your YouTube video of your pyroflatulation contest or whatever.

906
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,260
Okay, excuse me, guys.

907
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,160
I have to go fizz-fuzz down the hall now.

908
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:45,840
Wow.

909
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,260
Wow, that was quick.

910
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,980
Not too much talking about that.

911
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,100
I guess...

912
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,240
Usually they go all the way to 11 o'clock at least.

913
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,240
I guess maybe we better...

914
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:54,920
Let's...

915
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,880
This calls for a break.

916
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,480
We need to...

917
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,660
We just need to run some of the...

918
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,480
That was like about 10 minutes of talking about...

919
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:00,640
Okay.

920
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:05,560
This music in the background, by the way, is again, this is Just John from his new album,

921
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:11,460
The Old Double Melman from just-john.com.

922
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,240
We'll be right back.

923
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:45,920
He's bald, always good to be bald

924
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,360
His pipe is the one with the gavel

925
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,620
That rings on the roof like fire

926
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,040
His neck is the one with the waddle

927
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,160
In the flame in the folks' desire

928
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,980
He's bald, but don't ever change

929
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:04,700
He's bald, always good to be bald

930
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,120
He's bald

931
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,700
He's bald

932
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,840
That's Dr. Hal singing.

933
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,640
Dr. Hal Robbins of AskDrHal.com

934
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,520
I can't remember who did that mix.

935
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,500
It's a great mix.

936
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,680
Dance floor mix.

937
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,200
Ibiza, Sunrise on the Dance Floor, Dance Floor mix.

938
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,080
Democrats and Republicans.

939
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,560
Nope, new ideas.

940
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,820
Nope, future.

941
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,100
Democrats and Republicans.

942
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,040
We should be able to.

943
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,200
Agree that we must benefit from the chaos.

944
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,620
Chaos.

945
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,140
Democrats and Republicans.

946
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,100
Nope, new ideas.

947
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:47,740
Nope, hope.

948
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,740
Nope, hope.

949
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,160
Democrats and Republicans.

950
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,960
Destructive ambitions.

951
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,180
Democrats and Republicans.

952
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,420
Evil.

953
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,140
Democrats and Republicans.

954
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,120
Government must end.

955
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,080
Government must end.

956
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,960
Read the math.

957
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,940
Democrats and Republicans.

958
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,840
Leave our children to face a far more dangerous world.

959
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,420
Okay.

960
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,760
Every child must learn.

961
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,400
Blood of my blood and flesh of my flesh.

962
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:16,600
Okay.

963
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:16,760
It's curious.

964
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,700
No, future.

965
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,020
Democrats and Republicans.

966
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,040
Government must end.

967
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:24,660
Chaos.

968
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,100
Chaos.

969
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,220
Life is a fish.

970
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:44,700
Entertainment is a fish.

971
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:55,440
Confused, confused, confused.

972
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,200
This is a strange, dangerous and awful game.

973
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:58,200


974
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:58,460
Go fishing.

975
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,520
Teens of a pure commercial path.

976
00:41:59,520 --> 00:41:59,580
The black and blue line of borders.

977
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,220
Important.

978
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,100
приходating from you.

979
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:02,100


980
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:02,100


981
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:02,280
Pepper.

982
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,820
Democrats and Republicans. Nope. New ideas. Nope. Future.

983
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:15,180
Democrats and Republicans. We should be able to agree that we must benefit from the chaos.

984
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:18,940
Democrats and Republicans. Democrats and Republicans.

985
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,080
Democrats and Republicans. Nope. New ideas.

986
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,240
Harry, I saw a satellite tonight.

987
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:31,100
How's that all? You know, everyone's seen satellites these days.

988
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,820
Not like this. It came out of the sky and landed in the middle of the highway.

989
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,300
Harry, I almost hit it.

990
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,380
And a man, a giant of a man came out of it.

991
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,380
I could feel his hands at my throat.

992
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,560
I think he was after my diamond.

993
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,120
Oh, please, Art, you believe me, don't you?

994
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,640
Of course I do, sweetheart. Now, you've had a terrible night.

995
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,040
I think you need some rest.

996
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,760
Every place that Mitt has gone, problems, problems.

997
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:05,860
From Mitt.

998
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,020
I believe the American people are over.

999
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,360
And the government is we're .

1000
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,120
I believe our laws ought to be written.

1001
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,760
Look. Look. We face attack from unelected judges.

1002
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,000
We face We're using too much oil.

1003
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,900
We're spending too much money here.

1004
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,220
This is from Asia.

1005
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,520
This is a time for more talk and dithering.

1006
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,420
It's a time for more talk and dithering in Washington!

1007
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,820
I'm Mitt Romney.

1008
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,460
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, running, running, running

1009
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,920
running, running, running, running, munh, munh, munh, munh

1010
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,540
You cut somebody's head off of me.

1011
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,600
Bible was written by men to control other men.

1012
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:40,980
Freak, freak.

1013
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,340
It's, it's, it's, you know.

1014
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,740
But if you want to, you know, you've got to follow directions, Bob.

1015
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,560
Lady, you don't know what in the hell you're talking about.

1016
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:52,660
Hello, Bob.

1017
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,120
Hi.

1018
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:53,920
What?

1019
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,400
Reality, whatever.

1020
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,840
I think you hit it on the head.

1021
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,880
Building character, right?

1022
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:01,800
Building character.

1023
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,040
Hello.

1024
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:03,720
Hi.

1025
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:07,080
Turn to drugs and gangs and crime.

1026
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:07,860
Black.

1027
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:12,060
What do you think when you hear the word homo?

1028
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:14,720
Hi, this is Les Glimbo.

1029
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,200
Oh, no, no, no.

1030
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,620
Oh, no, no, no.

1031
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,760
No, no.

1032
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,540
No, no, no, no.

1033
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,900
I don't know.

1034
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:22,920
No, no, no.

1035
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,420
It's going to be great fun to fight leukemia.

1036
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,780
Yes, I would like to come.

1037
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,740
Yes, I would like to come.

1038
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,740
No, no.

1039
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,300
No, no, no.

1040
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,420
No, no, no, no.

1041
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:44,760
Actually, Norrell Preff did that guitar work that you heard there behind George Bush.

1042
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,180
That wasn't Bush on guitar.

1043
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:51,720
Oh, man, what a disappointment to hear that it was an actual musician instead of George.

1044
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:54,940
Das meute Freund.

1045
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,640
The baby friend.

1046
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,500
The baby friend.

1047
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:10,940
I would like to remind my fellow subgeniuses that the following next few weeks will be hard work.

1048
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:22,940
Demand a lot of sacrifice on the part of various subgeniuses in our various precincts.

1049
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:31,920
I want them going around house to house, shaking hands, shaking feet, shaking booty, and trying to get people out to the polls.

1050
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:32,240
Yes.

1051
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,140
Yes.

1052
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:33,400
Yes.

1053
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:33,700
Yes.

1054
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:33,700


1055
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:33,700


1056
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:33,700


1057
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:33,700


1058
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:33,700


1059
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:33,700


1060
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:33,700


1061
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:33,700


1062
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:33,740
Yes.

1063
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,520
Yes.

1064
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:36,520


1065
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:36,520


1066
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:48,580
Now, this is not a title which I confer lightly upon those who either disagree or disagree or disagree hardly with my format.

1067
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,880
I don't like it.

1068
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,500
If I did put it in the mouth.

1069
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:56,540
No.

1070
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,540
No, I forgot.

1071
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,220
Yeah.

1072
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:01,800
What that thing was.

1073
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,200
Yes.

1074
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:03,500
Yes.

1075
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:03,880
It was enormous.

1076
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:04,860
It was ugly.

1077
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,580
It was ugly and enormous.

1078
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,860
And then I screamed.

1079
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,460
I screamed like a little woman.

1080
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,800
Like a little baby girl.

1081
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,960
And I dipped my feet in the water.

1082
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,040
The river was so soothing.

1083
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:22,640
So calm.

1084
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,200
So refreshing.

1085
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,920
I couldn't remember anything anymore.

1086
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:41,180
Are those soothing microbes tickling away at your toes?

1087
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:50,880
H1 has been genetically engineered to provide maximum comfort and safety.

1088
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:55,240
Soothing away your cares.

1089
00:46:55,740 --> 00:47:01,440
When you're swimming in Saving Solution, doing the butterfly or the backflip,

1090
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,540
don't forget.

1091
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:05,600
It's never always time for...

1092
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,740
That stuff.

1093
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:17,760
My grandfather had been blinded by the great war.

1094
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,840
No one was made actually officially aware of the occurrence

1095
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,680
until long after the surrender.

1096
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,820
They counted the great unseen unheard.

1097
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,560
I missed it.

1098
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:31,580
And by God,

1099
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:32,520
I got quite a few.

1100
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:35,220
We always just wanted to pack up and head across the river.

1101
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:38,680
But there were no rivers in them days to come.

1102
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:41,220
It was all dried up like your ideas, fatty.

1103
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,540
So then we took a walk, yeah?

1104
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:46,340
We just kept on walking until our feet couldn't do it no more.

1105
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,760
Mine rotted off.

1106
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,620
I felt so bad for them.

1107
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:54,080
I really, really did when I read about that.

1108
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,440
I just thought that was awful.

1109
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:01,120
The great movements of people around the planet

1110
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,300
from hither and yon,

1111
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,160
moving to the poles,

1112
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,460
and thence off into the silver cosmos

1113
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,780
to be removed once again

1114
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:12,900
like a vacuum tube original.

1115
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:13,500
Goodbye!

1116
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:14,800
Goodbye!

1117
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:16,080
Goodbye!

1118
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:16,760
Goodbye!

1119
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,520
So long, Dave.

1120
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:20,880
So long, Dave!

1121
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,680
Boy, that was weird.

1122
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,920
See you guys on the other side of X-Day 29!

1123
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:30,040
Dave's gonna be gone until X-Day 29,

1124
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,020
or when he comes back, whichever is first.

1125
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,900
This is our first...

1126
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:44,060
Pretty jazzy background music there, isn't it?

1127
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,920
That's a rural war room

1128
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,060
from our friend St. Byron Warner

1129
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:51,340
and his friend Donovan Suit.

1130
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,500
Or Suit, as I like to say.

1131
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:59,460
By the way, I got an order from a Brian Warner.

1132
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,020
Brian Warner.

1133
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,520
Not Byron Warner.

1134
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:02,680
Yes, I did.

1135
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:05,120
Today, we got an order for a membership,

1136
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,460
an ordainment as a minister

1137
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,260
in Church of the Subgenius

1138
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:10,340
from someone named

1139
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:13,620
Brian Woerner.

1140
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,400
As opposed to St. Byron Warner

1141
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,240
who has done audio

1142
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,900
of this perverse kind for many years.

1143
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,460
By the way, that's

1144
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,020
ruralwarroomrecords.com

1145
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,020
That is a beautiful piece.

1146
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,020
Say that three times fast.

1147
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,240
Rural war room records.

1148
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,500
Rural war room records.

1149
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,020
Rural war room records.

1150
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:35,980
Rural war room records.

1151
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,620
Rural war room records.

1152
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,000
I got one of those messages

1153
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,440
like where they cut out different words

1154
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,140
from different newspapers and magazines

1155
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,320
and it was from a guy named Brian Shrimp.

1156
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,880
And I guess he was trying to ruin my life somehow

1157
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:48,920
but I was trying to let the...

1158
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,680
You know, and he left no recording address

1159
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,880
so I could return the dismal failure

1160
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,640
and tell him, hey,

1161
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,980
my life already is a miserable wreck.

1162
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:57,960
Yes, Shrimp.

1163
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,000
Yes, Shrimp.

1164
00:49:59,020 --> 00:49:59,540
Check it out.

1165
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:00,020
Shrimp.

1166
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,860
Hey, baby, you're going to ruin my already...

1167
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,740
They don't like dancing down here, okay?

1168
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,700
Especially people with no legs, eh?

1169
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,340
I mean, there's something crude about it.

1170
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:20,680
It offends his sensibilities.

1171
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,360
He went to the war college he did.

1172
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,120
I think it was the Byron Warner Rural War College.

1173
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,740
Like Sandhurst did, you know.

1174
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:32,720
They make men out of boys and vice versa.

1175
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1176
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,220
And they've got no legs.

1177
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,880
It's because the legs were on fire.

1178
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,700
What's that pipe tattoo on your arm, Seaman?

1179
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,660
I couldn't tell you.

1180
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,420
It must have been something that happened

1181
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,320
when I fell asleep when I got drunk.

1182
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,600
Seaman Staines, this is about the 15th time

1183
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,120
I'm going to have to warn you.

1184
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:55,420
I may have to warn you more vigorously next time.

1185
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,520
If you know what I'm saying.

1186
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,840
Are you going to have it removed?

1187
00:50:58,840 --> 00:50:59,280
Removed?

1188
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,060
Are you going to have the rest of your body removed?

1189
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,480
Heal cold and cold healed and...

1190
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,260
The X's were listening to us.

1191
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,720
Did you hear it?

1192
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:14,480
Did you hear this?

1193
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,880
They were listening to us.

1194
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,680
They were listening to us.

1195
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:19,940
Is that them?

1196
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,100
Are they still listening to us?

1197
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:24,380
I don't have a CD on, if that's what you're asking.

1198
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:25,060
That's what I mean.

1199
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:27,440
I've turned off all the background stuff.

1200
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,820
I don't know where this noise is coming from.

1201
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:32,200
So then we have to like what they are doing

1202
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,100
or else maybe we get your...

1203
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:36,080
Maybe this is X Day.

1204
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,380
Maybe this is now.

1205
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:40,000
Maybe it's 7 a.m. 1998, right this second.

1206
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:40,900
In real life.

1207
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,520
In real time.

1208
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:44,400
It sure sounds like it to me.

1209
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,200
It feels like it.

1210
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,800
It does. It smells like it too.

1211
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:48,920
The end of the world.

1212
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:51,900
My third nostril is not only completely functional

1213
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,920
but it's trying to...

1214
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:53,920
Look, look, I'm levitating.

1215
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:54,440
I'm levitating.

1216
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,480
There he goes.

1217
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,140
There he goes.

1218
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:58,140
Dave.

1219
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,400
Dave.

1220
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,180
Hey, speaking of the end of the world,

1221
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,660
I have a plug I should do.

1222
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:05,760
I should plug something.

1223
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:09,180
I mean, not like what Princess Wee

1224
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:10,820
was just plugging a minute ago.

1225
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:14,660
But speaking of the end of the world,

1226
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:17,900
there's a new novel by John Shirley,

1227
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:20,480
the great science fiction writer.

1228
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,720
Happens to be a minister in the church,

1229
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:23,700
Reverend John Shirley.

1230
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:24,420
Piss Baptist.

1231
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:26,100
You have to plug mine afterwards.

1232
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:27,820
Well, yeah, but...

1233
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,180
John's is called The Other End.

1234
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,720
It's a novel called The Other End.

1235
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:37,380
And it's about the other end of the world.

1236
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,500
We're used to an end of the world

1237
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,060
that's dictated by the Christians

1238
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:41,980
and Revelation

1239
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,760
and St. John of Patmos and so forth.

1240
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:47,540
Daniel.

1241
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,040
St. George of Scythos.

1242
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,360
All these various predictions

1243
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,060
of this horrible end of the world

1244
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:53,600
where God will punish all the...

1245
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,580
Well, what if God really did punish the...

1246
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,820
Well, not exactly punish,

1247
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:59,520
punish the guilty,

1248
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,420
but change them so that they saw

1249
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,420
what they had done wrong

1250
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,640
and were prompted to correct,

1251
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,300
to change the way they did things.

1252
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:08,600
What if the end of the world

1253
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,040
was the end of injustice

1254
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,920
and there was an epidemic,

1255
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,280
as happens in this strange book

1256
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,180
by John Shirley,

1257
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:17,440
The Other End,

1258
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,260
an epidemic of justice.

1259
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,520
And the people who are keeping

1260
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,500
other people as slaves...

1261
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,880
I'm going to decide about it daily.

1262
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:24,980
I do.

1263
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:27,060
Evil gangs that are keeping people

1264
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,820
as slaves and prostitutes

1265
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,240
and prostitution change their...

1266
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,520
Suddenly, these cones of light

1267
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,360
enter their heads

1268
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:35,200
and they change their minds.

1269
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,320
They free their slaves.

1270
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:36,620
Wow, man.

1271
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,700
And evil industrialists

1272
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,160
who are about to just totally wreck

1273
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,960
another country, Burma,

1274
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:46,880
with their evil oil deals, Chevron.

1275
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:49,780
It suddenly changed their...

1276
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:51,700
Suddenly have a...

1277
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:53,400
Are stricken with conscience.

1278
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:56,100
It's a very weird science fiction book

1279
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,420
where the world ends in a good way,

1280
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,780
and God is a good guy

1281
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:02,880
instead of a bad guy.

1282
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:03,520
Wow, man.

1283
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,980
So then it does actually end

1284
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:08,640
after the apotheosis of all these Andalusian dogs.

1285
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:09,040
I don't know.

1286
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:09,760
I haven't finished.

1287
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:11,600
I'm only about two-thirds of the way

1288
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,120
through the book.

1289
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:14,580
It's like every John Shirley book.

1290
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:15,700
It's really good.

1291
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,860
But if you know John Shirley,

1292
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,600
it's really John Shirley.

1293
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:21,880
Well, I know that's not a very manly name.

1294
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,920
His name should be named John Shirley.

1295
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:24,420
Shirley, Shirley.

1296
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,460
Yeah, John Certainly would be more...

1297
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,700
Yeah, that's more like a non-diplomer

1298
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:28,820
guy.

1299
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,920
Well, John's a tough...

1300
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,060
He's a real tough badass, though.

1301
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,740
And so he's the kind of guy that...

1302
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,840
You know, it's like Mick Jagger could act

1303
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,020
real girlish because he was so macho.

1304
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,700
And at Burning Man

1305
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:42,700
for about five years,

1306
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,620
the most macho thing you could do

1307
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:46,680
was walk around with women's

1308
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,400
stockings, hose.

1309
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,740
And butterfly wings.

1310
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,840
Yeah. Guys would dress like girls

1311
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,660
to prove how manly they were,

1312
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,300
and they weren't scared of being called a sissy.

1313
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,280
Like they were shoving huge slices

1314
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,280
of quiche in their mouth.

1315
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,040
Sissy wearing them high heels

1316
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,300
and stockings, and they'd go,

1317
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,420
Who you calling a sissy, buddy?

1318
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,280
I can kick a soccer ball 150 miles.

1320
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,040
Anyway,

1321
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,260
so I just wanted to put in that plug

1322
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,520
for John Shirley's book, The Other End.

1323
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,440
However, there is a yet

1324
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,740
a greater book,

1325
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,940
greater because no one can even read it yet

1326
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:22,520
unless it's emailed to you,

1327
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,320
called InfoScan

1328
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,260
by lonesome

1329
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,960
clown boy dame

1330
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:29,840
DeLucan.

1331
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:32,800
The luckiest, well,

1332
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,960
DeLuca, that means unlooked.

1333
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,520
The luck removed.

1334
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,580
In English, it means unlocked.

1335
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:39,020
Yeah.

1336
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:42,300
And our sacred agent, Dave and I,

1337
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,740
share a sacred agent

1338
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,460
whose name I don't want to

1339
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,180
give out on the air because

1340
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,340
he has a family.

1341
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,500
And since we do share him like the

1342
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,460
Eucharist, we wouldn't want anybody

1343
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:55,780
stealing any of the wafers.

1344
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:56,940
And now I know neither.

1345
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:58,520
I wonder if you're really plugging those.

1346
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,800
You're just giving people information about these books.

1347
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,320
No, we can plug John's

1348
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:05,880
and we can plug Dave's because no one can buy it yet.

1349
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:08,280
And also, Dave is not really a station member.

1350
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:08,900
Oh.

1351
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,940
I can't plug my books because I'm a station member.

1352
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:13,560
Oh, I shouldn't have even mentioned my books.

1353
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,300
But I can say that they're...

1354
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,120
No, no, no, you can't.

1355
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:16,860
I can't even say it?

1356
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,140
No, no, because somebody died,

1357
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,860
I might make money off Book of the Subgenius.

1358
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,320
How many books does somebody, you know,

1359
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:23,980
say be somebody like you,

1360
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,880
how many do you have that such a person would,

1361
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:27,520
would might have out?

1362
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:28,260
John?

1363
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,640
No, such a person...

1364
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:30,740
Oh, such a person as me?

1365
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:32,760
Only three at this time.

1366
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,080
The church, per se.

1367
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,940
In our purses, we only have the three.

1368
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:40,860
And there was one that was released just last year,

1369
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:41,260
wasn't it?

1370
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,180
Hey, isn't the next...

1371
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:43,340
It's Bob Leografon.

1372
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:46,460
You're not supposed to say the name Bob Leografon.

1373
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:49,020
Is the DJ supposed to come in here at some point?

1374
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,180
Is there a light blinking or flashing?

1375
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:53,600
No, and I didn't see any traces

1376
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,040
of any sinisterness in the hallway.

1377
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:56,160
No way.

1378
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:57,140
Well, we'll...

1379
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:59,580
Tiny little Carmelite friars are going to come in here

1380
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,860
and insert almonds into our fizz fuzz thing.

1381
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,700
You know, he often causes this show

1382
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:05,720
to go on for longer than an hour,

1383
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,060
which causes me editing problems later.

1384
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:10,400
Oh, poor, poor Reverend Stang

1385
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,520
has too many minutes of slack.

1386
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,740
He has to shave off minutes.

1387
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:17,180
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1388
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,160
Well, I've heard he falls asleep

1389
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,060
in the parking lot listening to us.

1390
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:26,020
He's made so satisfied and desperate,

1391
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:26,920
he's going to have to go to the hospital.

1392
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:26,920


1393
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:28,880
What does that...

1394
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:29,320
What does...

1395
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:29,920
Descoupe.

1396
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:31,100
What does that mean?

1397
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,260
What is Descoupe?

1398
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:33,680
It's a word I saw,

1399
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:34,720
and I don't know its meaning.

1400
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,720
Well, I know what decoupage is,

1401
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:38,540
but I don't know what Descoupe is.

1402
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,140
Oh, well, then that would be the real Descoupe.

1403
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:42,920
See, you wouldn't say Des,

1404
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,000
because that's silly.

1405
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:46,200
Right, it would be Descoupe.

1406
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,420
Because Descoupe is spelled Descoupe-age.

1407
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:49,200
Descoupe-age.

1408
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:49,980
Descoupe-age.

1409
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:51,780
It probably has to do with organic chickens.

1410
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,780
Well, since I'm going to have to cut some stuff out,

1411
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:57,940
I might as well mention that, uh...

1412
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,300
Cut here.

1413
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,260
I'm going to get that phone call,

1414
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,860
and I'm going to just put on a tape, okay?

1415
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:03,080
Okay.

1416
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:03,800
Okay.

1417
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,140
Sheriff, I want to talk to you.

1418
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:07,880
Go ahead.

1419
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,820
This court will recess till two this afternoon.

1420
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,200
Raise your right hand.

1421
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,320
You swear that the thing but the not truth

1422
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,280
the whole truth tell the truth?

1423
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:21,820
Definitely not.

1424
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,820
Truth that the whole but true thing

1425
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:24,440
the not tell the truth.

1426
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:25,400
I'll see your truth.

1427
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:26,320
I do.

1428
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:27,180
I do.

1429
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,820
Now, Mr. Burris,

1430
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,200
what did you see?

1431
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:33,220
Well, I saw the bus and the wind and broke the law,

1432
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:34,900
and did you hear anything?

1433
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:36,220
Oh, yes, sir.

1434
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,660
What did you see?

1435
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:39,220
I heard a woman scream.

1436
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:40,680
Did you see anything?

1437
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:41,820
No, sir.

1438
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:42,740
I see.

1439
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,460
What did you see?

1440
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:47,160
Well, I saw the inside the lens table,

1441
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:49,520
and the glass broken out,

1442
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:51,340
broken the wind just a little bit.

1443
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:52,780
Your witness.

1444
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:55,100
Order!

1445
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:56,060
Let's have order!

1446
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:56,540
When?

1447
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,440
Your Honor, I requested my fur with concession,

1448
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:01,140
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1449
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,180
That seems a reasonable request until 315.

1450
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:07,300
Your Honor, I'll state frankly to Mr. Mason

1451
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,280
that witness must cross to a stint check any

1452
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,340
opposed on ear of the nuts.

1453
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:15,360
Sir, Your Honor, I think you're a cook and housekeeper

1454
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,660
employed by Mark Cushing.

1455
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,420
No, certainly not.

1456
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,180
Then I want to take the stand.

1457
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,600
Mr. Mason, you don't have to answer this question, all right?

1458
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,900
But do you have anything to say?

1459
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:27,760
Yes.

1460
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:31,240
I expect right in his car and the door on the

1461
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,180
be a handle to have in some part.

1462
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:33,720
Stop it!

1463
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:34,620
That's all.

1464
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,140
Cocky socks, yes.
