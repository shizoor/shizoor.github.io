1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
From PR News in Washington, I'm skeptical of PR News in Washington.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:10,400
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and former CIA Director George Tenet have been jailed outside of China.

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,760
Lawyers will be illegal.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,780
It's not clear if 20 political parties in Mozambique raised Span again.

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,500
President Bush has been thrown out by a judge.

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,860
The ruling effectively overturns presidential elections.

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:27,000
He has been sharply criticized for the nation's highest civilian honor.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,720
On Wall Street, 52, 690, 14, 21, 6, 12 of 2, 62, 5.

9
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,700
Notice. Cleveland.

10
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,140
Is she really going out with him?

11
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,360
Well, there she is. Let's ask her.

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,740
Betty, is that Jimmy's ring you're wearing?

13
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:47,680
Mm-hmm.

14
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,220
Gee, it must be great riding with him.

15
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,560
Is he picking you up after school today?

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:55,820
Mm-mm.

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,980
By the way, where'd you go?

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,220
Freedom.

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,940
I met him at the candy store.

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,400
Turned around and smiled at me.

21
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,480
You get the picture?

22
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,160
Yes, we do.

23
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,380
That's when I fell for...

24
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,040
The self-genius.

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,360
Our own.

26
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:11,580
What?

27
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,660
Look out, look out, look out, look out!

28
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,500
Egg, egg, egg, egg, egg!

29
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,040
Egg, egg, egg, egg, egg!

30
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,380
Ooh!

31
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,640
Join us now for the Bob Hour, coming to you from the campus.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,280
Bob.

33
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,400
Following the introduction by Bob, we'll hear a message preached by Bob.

34
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,200
The title of his message is...

35
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,600
I...

36
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,140
Kane.

37
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,480
I'm dumb. I'm not very bright, but I sure have tried.

38
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,820
I've done my best.

39
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:45,500
More money, more propaganda, more and more nudity, more and more filth, more and more homosexuality.

40
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,120
After these things, the temptations due largely to television.

41
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,180
Repression.

42
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,320
The entertainment industry is perfectly absurd and shallow and vicious.

43
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,160
Rubbish.

44
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,520
It's not hilarious.

45
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,820
Now, this week, the devil's gonna come if he can.

46
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,000
And he cried,

47
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,440
Look, look, the flesh.

48
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,960
The lust of the flesh.

49
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,220
Pornography.

50
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,180
Rock music.

51
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,680
It moved me almost to come.

52
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,120
And suddenly, you've been overcome by temptation.

53
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,740
Rock music gives you a kick.

54
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,120
It's excitement.

55
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:25,260
The thrill of seeing your mother made happy by the violence in this country.

56
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,300
Now, what does that mean?

57
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,140
I'll do this and do that and do the other for you.

58
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,440
Well, you don't go for that.

59
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,260
Make up your mind, young people.

60
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,960
After these things, that very hard thing just made me come.

61
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,940
It's the joy that comes from being out for a night on the town.

62
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,020
Firm? Come.

63
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:41,640
Throw up.

64
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,620
But do you think that lasted long?

65
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,480
That would be presumptuous of us.

66
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,320
Coming to you from the campus of Bob.

67
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,160
Send a check. Send a check. Send a check. Send a check.

68
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,680
Rock music.

69
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,080
Rock music.

70
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:55,640
Rock music.

71
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,280
Rock music.

72
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,280


73
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,280


74
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,280


75
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,040
Records.

76
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,560
Pop bands.

77
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:10,560


78
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:10,580


79
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:10,620
Rock music withanter booth unleash alreadyました.

80
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,520
Rock music.

81
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,360
Alright.

82
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:12,360


83
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:12,360


84
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:12,360


85
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:12,360


86
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:12,360


87
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:12,360


88
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,080
Let's hit rock music.

89
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:13,320
Guys listen!

90
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:13,560
Rock music.

91
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:13,760


92
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,060
Rock music.

93
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,500
Rock music.

94
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,780
Co laughed all this.

95
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,320
Bra melodic.

96
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,060
It was a sign every rainy, every Sunday called me plenty of bootlegs.

97
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,360
Rock music.

98
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,280
I dance every weekend.

99
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,680
Rock music.

100
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:24,920
Black music.

101
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,280
Come on now.

102
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,020
Well, that's what I said, slacks

103
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,860
I'm the cat's pajama

104
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,180
So I'll run around with crazy little mama

105
00:03:43,340 --> 00:04:03,160
Well, the girls all look wonderful

106
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,800
When I go by, slacks

107
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,060
I wear red bow tie, slacks

108
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,940
They say me on my slacks

109
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,660
With a cat chained down to my knees

110
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,940
I ain't nothing but a real cougar

111
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,600
Slacks, brrr, slacks

112
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,720
Brrr, slacks

113
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,740
Brrr, slacks

114
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,760
Brrr, slacks

115
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,420
Make it good, daddy, oh

116
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,680
When I put them on, I'm raring to go

117
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,000
When I put them on, I'm raring to go

118
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,260
When I put them on, I'm raring to go

119
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,560
Slacks, brrr, slacks

120
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,700
Brrr, slacks

121
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,840
Brrr, slacks

122
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,760
Brrr, slacks

123
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,840
Brrr, slacks

124
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,840
Brrr, slacks

125
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,540
Brrr, slacks

126
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:46,560
Brrr, slacks

127
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,300
Brrr, slacks

128
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:47,820
Brrr, slacks

129
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,480
Brrr, slacks

130
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:48,740
Brrr, slacks

131
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,140
Brrr, slacks

132
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:55,780
Brrr, slacks

133
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:03,120
Brrr, slacks

134
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,640
Jesus, help me.

135
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,300
Damn it, Doug.

136
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,480
Put that gun away.

137
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,020
Put that gun away.

138
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,280
You're already in so much trouble.

139
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:15,600
Doug.

140
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,260
Listen, I don't know anything.

141
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,840
Will you just get that through your...

142
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,780
Doug, are you crazy?

143
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,580
Who are you?

144
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:22,860
Doug.

145
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:23,800
Oh, God.

146
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,940
Very good, Dennis.

147
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,600
You're going to be all right.

148
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,240
Very good.

149
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,000
What other people talk about, I make reality.

150
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,720
My head feels like it's been in a blender.

151
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,340
Talk to me.

152
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,900
It's my brain.

153
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,440
It's not theirs.

154
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,640
You better cool it.

155
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,400
This is coming to you from the Bertling Sons and Daughters of Steam and Electricity's

156
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,860
Home for the Unreasonably Sane.

157
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,300
I think we got it, guys.

158
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:49,840
Are you ready?

159
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,540
Thank you.

160
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,800
I'm going to do this one sitting down, I guess, because I broke my toe last week.

161
00:05:59,240 --> 00:05:59,500
Oh.

162
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,120
And I don't want to spend the whole thing standing up.

163
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,800
Normally, I have a pulpit and everything.

164
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:13,860
I was sitting at my desk chewing some gum, and I got up and walked across the room.

165
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,660
And I stubbed my toe, really, was all I did.

166
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,420
I don't ever try to do two things at once like this.

167
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,420
When it first happened, it was my little toe and my right foot, and it was bent out of

168
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,220
shape like that.

169
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,420
But it didn't hurt.

170
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,120
It just was numb.

171
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:38,640
But I kind of got my sock and shoe back on over it, and about two hours later, I heard

172
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:44,420
a snap and felt a horrid pain, much worse than the actual stubbing.

173
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:52,540
And at that moment, the veil of maya and illusion fell from my eyes, and I was here now.

174
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,400
I were there then at the time.

175
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,460
I was truly experiencing the now moment.

176
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:03,500
When that bone snapped back into place and all the nerves, the pain came back.

177
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,220
Praise God.

178
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,180
Oh, man.

179
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,620
It was like enlightenment, you know.

180
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:14,180
You knew what was real at that moment when you heard the bone snap.

181
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,240
And so now my little toe is taped up to its healthy brother.

182
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,200
It's funny.

183
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,140
I got on the internet.

184
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,720
I didn't want to go to Saturday morning.

185
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,200
I didn't want to go to the doctor.

186
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,960
And I got on the internet to look up broken toe.

187
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:36,920
And it said instructions for doctors that said, you go ahead and x-ray the toe because

188
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,960
it'll make the patient feel better.

189
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,620
There's no real reason to do that because they're all the same.

190
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,720
And I had luckily already had a broken toe on the same foot.

191
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,800
So it's a fad down there, I guess.

192
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:56,680
And that was from Winter Star Symposium, the winter version of Starwood.

193
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:57,960
Oh, yes.

194
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,480
Yes, deaf friends.

195
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:08,900
Here at Hour of Slack number 1004, we're catching up to our schedule by pausing in our feverish

196
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:16,660
editing of recordings from 8X Day Drill and simply leaning on our beloved and dependable

197
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:22,940
contributors, the great Fernanda Nandi-Lemur and Reverend Norel Preff, heard playing guitar

198
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,840
in the background and as just heard in all of our opening.

199
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,640
And I'm sure you'll be surprised to learn that we're actually recording this show.

200
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:28,640


201
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:28,640


202
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:35,800
Because these two artists specialize in bashing opposite sides of the Janus-faced conspiracy.

203
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,180
And so the theme of this show is the conspiracy.

204
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,520
It's a pretty frequent theme on the Hour of Slack.

205
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,980
It's about every fifth show.

206
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,200
But don't worry, it's not all preaching, friends.

207
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:53,100
We have some new music by a band called the Psychoskeletons.

208
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,360
You'll love that.

209
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,460
And others.

210
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,560
And others.

211
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,400
And lots of hate.

212
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,080
And heck, from Radio Synesthesia.

213
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,520
Plus, more Dr. Howell and Dr. Philodrummon from live at 8X Day.

214
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,580
But first...

215
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,860
America's more affordable than ever.

216
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,120
Just $19.

217
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,140
Now you can get the all-new, powerful, strong, sexy, affordable, great, easy, real, extreme,

218
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,380
simple, unrivaled, effective, special.

219
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,640
No money down today.

220
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,640
I love you, little boy.

221
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:21,980
Really?

222
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,000
Well, I love you.

223
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,280
Really?

224
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,800
America was declared unconstitutional.

225
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,640
Cool.

226
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,060
Cool.

227
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,740
America's so completely eradicated, it's a crime because of the phrase.

228
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,560
All right.

229
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,020
Folks cared about the phrase.

230
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:33,820
All right.

231
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,280
Whoa.

232
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,100
America.

233
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,760
Oh, man.

234
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,440
All right.

235
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,040
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well.

236
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,320
How?

237
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,760
Whenever we wanted money.

238
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,360
Could this be America's future?

239
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:43,900
Really?

240
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,360
It could.

241
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:44,940
Cool.

242
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,000
Go to money.

243
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,400
Money.com and sign the petition.

244
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,040
Let's make the erratic history.

245
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,040
The erratic money.

246
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:51,360
Money.

247
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:51,640
Money.

248
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:51,800
Money.

249
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,360
Anywhere.

250
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,180
All right.

251
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,740
Oh, man.

252
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,720
I am in prison.

253
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,500
Oh, man.

254
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,100
Oh, man.

255
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,320
I am in.

256
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:58,840
I am in.

257
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,400
I am in.

258
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,300
Nom, nom, nom, nom.

259
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:00,740
Nom, nom.

260
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,320
Ooo-shoo-sweet.

261
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,680
We-we-we-kis-dis-dis-darnar-narn.

262
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,420
Our-out-tow-out-tgrow-tow-trow-tow-throw-throw-throw-throw-throw.

263
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,440
We-we-we-we-we-learn.

264
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,560
Shine-shine-shine-shine-shine.

265
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:06,980
That's how you.

266
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,360
That's how you.

267
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:07,760
That's how you.

268
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:07,820
That's how you.

269
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,560
You're-you're-you're-you're.

270
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,960
Ihnen- Ihnen- Ihnen- Ihnen- famine-fish-fish-fish-fishfish-fish.

271
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:25,480
ifschickling and fish-fish.

272
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,660
Devil, do the rest.

273
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,840
That was Lonesome Cowboy Dave and the Mondo Retardo Band at 8X Day.

274
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,780
Just a little clip.

275
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,340
Before that, Norrell Preff and Lee Murr.

276
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:42,200
I've got a lot of tweaking and remixing to do on the 8X Day band recordings.

277
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:49,800
The Amino Acids, Impaired Document, and the rest of Dave's concert are for future Earth shows.

278
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:54,920
We were hoping not to have any more of those, but, you know, might as well make the best of it.

279
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:02,600
Anyway, here's some collegiastices, or collegiostices, whatever, from Mr. Fernand and Andy Lee Murr,

280
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,720
and also from NorrellPreff.com.

281
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,220
Man, euthanasian, euthanasian, euthanasian, coming soon.

282
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,340
We're all a bunch of familiar with gay marriage.

283
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,180
Maybe, maybe, gay marriage, gay marriage.

284
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:32,940
Maybe, maybe.

285
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:37,020
You keep pushing, you keep pushing, pretty viciously.

286
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,260
Is that true? Are you pushing?

287
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,340
I keep pushing, I keep pushing.

288
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,900
Hack, hack, hack.

289
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,900
You're just a flack for the Bush administration.

290
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,200
Witch hunt, witch hunt, witch hunt, witch hunt.

291
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,940
No, no, witch hunt.

292
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,300
You're pushing, pushing, pushing, Bush, pushing, Bush.

293
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,800
Hack, Bush, hack.

294
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,680
I think you're corrupt, just corrupt.

295
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,160
Down the line, pretty viciously.

296
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,920
I think, I think, guys, maybe I'm wrong.

297
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,540
Go ahead.

298
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,540
Oh, laugh, oh, go ahead.

299
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,800
Oh, laugh, laugh, laugh.

300
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,260
Oh, go ahead.

301
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,000
Oh, laugh.

302
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,900
Call me crazy, call me crazy.

303
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,700
Maybe I'm wrong.

304
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,080
I was wrong, was wrong.

305
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,800
Sexual abuse.

306
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,380
Blistered knee, knee, knee.

307
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,000
Pound knee.

308
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,220
I was wrong.

309
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,360
Fashes, ha, ha.

310
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,080
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

311
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,920
Fashes, fashes.

312
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,000
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

313
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,040
Sexual predators.

314
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,360
Pound the president for believing.

315
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,320
This is insane.

316
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,200
The cop.

317
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,580
Pound the president for fouling up the situation in Iraq in general.

318
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,300
Does no back zone.

319
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,180
Misleading you.

320
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,900
Praying on children, unquote.

321
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,420
74% of America thought the president's speech was a BS.

322
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,540
What religious symbol should be banned?

323
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,440
That's true.

324
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,420
That's true.

325
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,500
The institution of marriage has collapsed.

326
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,820
True, true, true, true.

327
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,260
Gay or straight, it doesn't matter.

328
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,260
Is that true?

329
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,620
Gay or straight, it doesn't matter.

330
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,360
Fashes, ha, ha.

331
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,060
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

332
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,920
Fashes, fashes.

333
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,000
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

334
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,980
Sexual predators.

335
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,380
Pound the president for believing.

336
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,260
This is insane.

337
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,280
No back zone.

338
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:54,900
Misleading.

339
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,160
Misleading you.

340
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:03,800
From PR News in Washington, I'm wounded today when clashes broke out between Donald Rumsfeld and Israeli soldiers in Charleston, South Carolina.

341
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,660
Now, are a lot of people going to be killed?

342
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,220
You bet.

343
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,380
Killed for peaceful purposes only.

344
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,500
Industry analyst Trophy Lundberg says crude cost and price pump specs were found in PR's PR.

345
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,320
It took the form of screaming.

346
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,300
The BBC broke out during the demolition of some abandoned cottages there.

347
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,620
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld says,

348
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,160
There's been another big jump in defeating PR News in Washington.

349
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,420
Pobucker Child Brain Sandwich.

350
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,580
Ah, those were the days.

351
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,480
And they've outlawed that even in Texas.

352
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:37,860
No slack.

353
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,580
They make laws about everything.

354
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,880
But friends, as long as they can't define slack, they can't outlaw it.

355
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:52,420
They can outlaw various ways of, you know, false slack and lots of side paths to slack.

356
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,900
But since slack is different for each person,

357
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,440
they can't bottle it, they can't sell it, and they can't even outlaw it.

358
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,980
They can't outlaw your thought crimes.

359
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,280
I mean, they can outlaw them, but they can't detect your thought crimes yet.

360
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,780
Unfortunately, in their primitive reptile-brained ways,

361
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:15,380
they do know that something is going on, so they will scrutinize you all the more closely.

362
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:20,360
The more slack you get away with, the more irritable and angry they will be

363
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,840
until, from your stimulation, they may lash out on account.

364
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:30,060
And one has to be prepared to deal with this, the mindless primitive.

365
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,660
Monsters from their ids.

366
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,980
Laws from the monsters from their ids.

367
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,480
I know, but the last time I had a cop tear my car apart looking for dope,

368
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,420
which he never found, because he was a dumbass.

369
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,840
At the end of it, I said, he was apologizing to Jesus and me.

370
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,900
And I said, well, man, you know, the reason I really don't...

371
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:54,900


372
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:54,900


373
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:01,500
I don't like you rooting through my car is not so much the war on drugs aspect,

374
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,800
as I'm just tired of the government poking their nose into every little thing.

375
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,720
And this Memphis cop looked at me and said, well, I'm not the government.

376
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,860
And I didn't say anything to that.

377
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:20,840
And you could see the little gear click in his head where he went, oh, yeah, that's right.

378
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,600
I guess I sort of am.

379
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,400
Friends.

380
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,520
Government is whoever has the biggest gun pointed at your head.

381
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:34,380
But it's amazing that you could evangelize even in those circumstances.

382
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,860
I have tried to evangelize with police officers, and I've had a gun pulled on me in another.

383
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,780
Oh, yeah, what are you doing out at four in the morning?

384
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,640
Well, sir, we were at an all-night radio show and are driving back to this beach house where we're staying.

385
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,760
Radio show, huh?

386
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,400
What kind of rock and rollers?

387
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,560
Well, actually, sir, this is what we tell cops.

388
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,160
It's kind of a comedy thing.

389
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,340
You ever heard of Mad Magazine?

390
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,080
It goes, show me some of your comedy.

391
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,400
I said, well, it's like, okay.

392
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,900
And I started into a little, you haven't got enough slack.

393
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:14,800
The minute I did that, he actually pulled out his gun, said, turn around, put your hands on the car.

394
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,240
He was just looking.

395
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,420
He wanted so much an excuse to shoot a hippie.

396
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,260
You know, the problem is that he's a cop.

397
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,520
I didn't.

398
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,800
Yeah, if I had just said cunt, he would have shot me, and we'd be rich and famous now.

399
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,340
Could be.

400
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,140
You know, it's all propaganda.

401
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:40,180
They're everything throughout all of history is the conspiracy's attempt to discredit J.R. Bob Dobbs.

402
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,640
Prove it's not true.

403
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,920
Once again, I rest my case.

404
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,620
Case closed.

405
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,640
It's like the Kennedy assassination.

406
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,660
Sure, Lee Harvey Oswald acting alone killed John F. Kennedy.

407
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,220
But rich!

408
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,740
Lee Harvey Oswald.

409
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,000
I know nothing.

410
00:16:59,440 --> 00:16:59,940
Nothing.

411
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,260
So, I want pieces of this money.

412
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,220
Yeah, well, just...

413
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:04,820
Run for office.

414
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,900
You'll get lots of money.

415
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,920
You can have slush funds, hush money.

416
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,100
Just start a, just promise, you know, you'll institute pro-business policies.

417
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,120
Go last on environmental protection and...

418
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,160
Could you imagine what would happen if I was in politics?

419
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,320
Actually, well, that's crap.

420
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,180
Sloth man for president.

421
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,620
Sloth man for governor of Cleveland.

422
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,020
I'm mayor of Cleveland.

423
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,120
But he can't.

424
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,140
He doesn't live in Cleveland proper.

425
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,080
Oh.

426
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,440
Well, Cleveland Heights, then.

427
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,920
I would move to Cleveland proper just so that I could run for mayor.

428
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,020
Actually, I've thought about that in the past.

429
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,500
I would move to the slummiest neighborhood.

430
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,560
The slummiest section.

431
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,540
And then just run for mayor.

432
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,140
Well, you think about this.

433
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:45,400
It might just work.

434
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:51,060
Thang has radio popularity once he gets his name out there and he starts saying,

435
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,640
Hi, I'm Reverend Ivan Thang.

436
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,600
Would you like to vote for me?

437
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,020
Are you talking about...

438
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,520
That is the dumbest idea in the universe, man.

439
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,080
That's what...

440
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,980
I'm the exact opposite kind of person.

441
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,240
Wow, that's great.

442
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:10,220
My way of dealing with the conspiracy is to live between the cracks...

443
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,440
Yeah, but just think how much damage you could do on the inside.

444
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,860
Between the walls.

445
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:14,960
Don't talk.

446
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,560
There's only so much damage you can do from inside the system.

447
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,260
The system is set up in a way to preserve itself.

448
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:22,920
Yeah, and the other half is done from the outside.

449
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:24,980
Yeah.

450
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:30,140
I can see that history is doomed to repeat itself infinitely.

451
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,180
Exactly.

452
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:36,020
That's why infinity is seen as a gigantic loopy thingy.

453
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,000
It's a Mobius strip.

454
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:44,260
The conspiracy has already figured out every idea you're ever going to have.

455
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,840
They already know not only what you're going to do, they know what you're going to think.

456
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,640
Yeah, but the funny part is, so do I.

457
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:52,940
Yeah.

458
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,760
No, only Bob knows, and you'll pay to know what you really think.

459
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,440
That's right, kid.

460
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,740
That's right-a.

461
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,000
That's a million dollars every time you exhale.

462
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,020
Feel better now, Bob?

463
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,260
Good luck is a science, and we have the formula.

464
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,960
Of course, I can't share it with you here in this commercial.

465
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,040
The original formula.

466
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,580
If you'll send off your money, I'll send it to you.

467
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,780
My 12-volume course.

468
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,620
Recipe 21.

469
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,120
Not sold in stores.

470
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:32,400
Now you see that evil will always triumph, because good is dumb.

471
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,960
And slack is subgenius.

472
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:44,220
We heard from some sin, radiosynesthesia, with sin, Dr. Sinister, and Reverend Rocknar,

473
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:51,640
and Reverend Oroboros Rex called in, and me-stang, and before that, Dr. Howell and Dr. Philodrummond

474
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,400
at 8X Day just recently.

475
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:59,380
But now, for some current events commentary from Norell Preff.

476
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,600
Concerned about bad breath, bad-bad-bad-bad-bad-bad-bad-bad breath, bad breath?

477
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,260
Good evening, everyone.

478
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:11,440
The Pentagon released a new report confirming Michael Jackson is guilty of child molestation.

479
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,360
He looks like a pedophile because he is a pedophile.

480
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,580
Michael Jackson .

481
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,620
Some of the media are blowing Michael Jackson instantly.

482
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,280
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice trafficking.

483
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,620
In human beings.

484
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,880
They are made to toil on farms and in work camps, in brothels and in sweatshops.

485
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,400
Children are even forced to become soldiers.

486
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,540
And in an embarrassment to the President, Angelina Jolie's

487
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,340
strengths is still horrifying.

488
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,500
Proof for monstrous crime.

489
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,860
I have no pants on.

490
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,480
I have no pants on.

491
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,000
Rubbers.

492
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,500
Rubbers.

493
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:46,880
It's not.

494
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,720
It's not.

495
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,580
U.S. military down the toilet.

496
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,940
Less intense germs was mishandled.

497
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,560
Which recently compared more time to the time of the war.

498
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:53,560


499
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:53,560


500
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:53,560


501
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,480
The first time a woman was born to a Soviet gulag kiln.

502
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,820
No spells, no mess.

503
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:57,920
Can't sleep.

504
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,080
Angelina Jolie.

505
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,180
Can't sleep.

506
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,360
And there is no shortage of buzz.

507
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,280
Can't sleep.

508
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,480
Angelina Jolie.

509
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,620
Can't sleep.

510
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,540
Really, I mean.

511
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,580
Can't sleep.

512
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,280
Hurt me.

513
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:08,780
Hurt me.

514
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,340
Hurt me.

515
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:09,820
Hurt me.

516
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,780
Can't sleep.

517
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,080
I sat down with Angelina Jolie and.

518
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,000
Can't sleep.

519
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,700
Hurt me.

520
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,140
Hurt me.

521
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:15,600
Hurt me.

522
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,080
Hurt me.

523
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,180
It's all you need.

524
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,560
Even selling big guns to bad people?

525
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,040
Huh?

526
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,480
Doing heroin.

527
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,040
Huh?

528
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,380
Cutting themselves.

529
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:23,560
Hurt me.

530
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,500
Hurt me.

531
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:24,500


532
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:24,500


533
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,280
Drinking too much.

534
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:25,520
Huh?

535
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,320
You need keep you eyes on me.

536
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,180
You need keep you eyes on me.

537
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,000
But you're not going to rear.

538
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,900
And you learnt aboutreature keeping.

539
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,100
I was satisfied with.

540
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,380
Make my day.

541
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:09,960
Uh-oh.

542
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:10,960
Grill.

543
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,040
Grill.

544
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,440
This here is your brain.

545
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:13,820
Grill.

546
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,040
Your brain gets all scrambled up.

547
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,340
Grill.

548
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,100
Woo-hoo!

549
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,300
And now there's another.

550
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,540
He looks like a pedophile because he is a pedophile.

551
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,760
He looks like a pedophile because he is a pedophile.

552
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,860
Media virus.

553
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,600
Corporate CEOs can't turn on their computers without help from the young bohemians who work for them.

554
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,880
It was a way of creating discontinuity.

555
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,040
Discontinuity.

556
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,320
Oh.

557
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,720
You know, frame by frame by frame by frame.

558
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,820
Frame by frame by frame.

559
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,280
Promoting discontinuity.

560
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,000
Making people ask questions.

561
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,080
God, we've got to figure this out.

562
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,640
Put it together.

563
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,360
Who's behind it?

564
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:50,580
I don't know.

565
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,480
Hello.

566
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,900
This is Dr. Phil.

567
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,700
The man barely alive.

568
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,520
That's right.

569
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,040
I'm sick.

570
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,520
I'm sick.

571
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,040
I'd like to talk about the death of Western civilization.

572
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,100
The coming death.

573
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,900
It's God, government, and the road to tyranny.

574
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,420
The coming death of Western civilization.

575
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,220
And so we'll be talking about the coming death of Western civilization.

576
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,700
And so we'll be talking about Iraqi beat a dead horse.

577
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,560
We back regime.

578
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,380
Killing innocent civilians.

579
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,460
Killed.

580
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,440
They don't have any love.

581
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,880
You're either pro.

582
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,120
Pro.

583
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:21,780
Dumb.

584
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,420
Dumb.

585
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,060
Dumb.

586
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:23,620
Dumb.

587
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,960
I just wonder who's next.

588
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,820
And that sounds harsh.

589
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,280
Biblically based government.

590
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,520
Destroying monsters abroad.

591
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,320
Somebody wants to mess with us.

592
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:32,820
Go ahead.

593
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,720
You know, which flavor of globalism do you want?

594
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,400
Once I ran.

595
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,400
And I rock.

596
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,160
And I rock.

597
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,520
A new bloodbath.

598
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:44,800
I am the effects of 30 years of doing acid whatever.

599
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,420
I want our boys get killed and stuff like that.

600
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,800
Hey, that's tyranny.

601
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,120
Yep.

602
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:50,860
That's tyranny.

603
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:50,860


604
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:50,860


605
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:50,860


606
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:50,860


607
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:50,860


608
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:50,860


609
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:50,860


610
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:50,860


611
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:50,860


612
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,240
That's tyranny.

613
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:51,480
Yep.

614
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,440
George W. Bush.

615
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,300
Petty dictator.

616
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,580
You know, being killed by friendly fire and how unfortunate that is.

617
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,460
Hussein and Al-Qaeda.

618
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,340
Blue on blue.

619
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,420
I mean, we'll be talking about the death of Western civilization.

620
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,960
The uneducated and unstable.

621
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,020
The death of Western civilization.

622
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,680
If you'd like to give us a call tonight.

623
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,160
And we're talking about the death of Western civilization.

624
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:16,640
And so we're going to talk about the death of Western civilization.

625
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,340
God is dead.

626
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,100
The gay men.

627
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,160
The gay men called the mad man.

628
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,440
It's not really that long.

629
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,740
I see God.

630
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,400
I see God.

631
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,520
We have killed him.

632
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,520
You and I.

633
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,700
All of us are his murderers.

634
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,220
Are we not straying as through an infinite nothing?

635
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,660
Everything changes.

636
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,820
He viewed churches as nothing but God's tombs.

637
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,920
Sepulchers of a dead God.

638
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:42,880
And it's like, you know, what a waste of time to go to a church of a dead God.

639
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,080
God was alive and then he had a heart attack.

640
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,760
Nothing but metaphors.

641
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,680
Are you dogmatic?

642
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,860
And that's why.

643
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,280
The United States of America and Western civilization is going down the tubes.

644
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:59,400
Now we're going off www.whichflavorofglobalismdoyouwant.org.

645
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,540
Create a need.

646
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,580
Stir anxiety and discontent.

647
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,000
Pain and anxiety.

648
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,880
Feelings of confusion and emptiness.

649
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,980
Most of us are lazy.

650
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,280
Make people anxious about the future.

651
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,120
Make them depressed.

652
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,660
Make them question their identity.

653
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,000
Make them sense.

654
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,320
The boredom that gnaws at their life.

655
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,560
The dull people.

656
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,300
Boring.

657
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,120
Lofty words and grand gestures can be suspicious.

658
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,080
Greed.

659
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:29,860
Vanity.

660
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:30,820
Boredom.

661
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,900
Keep the connection vague.

662
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,940
Retreat is no longer possible.

663
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,800
Distract their minds.

664
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,940
Lead them far astray.

665
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,320
There is no turning back.

666
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,280
Happily enslaved everyday life is predictable.

667
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:50,080
Use the demonic power of words to sow confusion.

668
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,000
We rarely think.

669
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,300
Something irritating.

670
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:54,160
Envy.

671
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,760
Fear.

672
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,440
And anger.

673
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,260
Pathetic.

674
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,000
No.

675
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,720
Directed at them.

676
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,460
Fear.

677
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,720
Seeming unnatural.

678
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,840
Even ugly.

679
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,220
Remember though to keep everything in moderation.

680
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,560
A long stretch of Norell there, who is also heard in the background.

681
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,200
And uh, and now, Lemur.

682
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,960
And Psychoskeleton, actually.

683
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,120
Presumably Psychoskeleton are some youths.

684
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,020
Wait until you hear this.

685
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,280
I got a belly full of youth.

686
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,380
I don't know why I bothered with you in the first place.

687
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,060
Go on! Jump!

688
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,120
No.

689
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,540
Oh, why not?

690
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,380
Yes.

691
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:31,940
Ah!

692
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:32,320
Oh!

693
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,280
Ah!

694
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,500
Now there are crayfish and crabs to be added to the mixture.

695
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,460
Ah!

696
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,380
Ah!

697
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,120
Ah!

698
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,260
Ah!

699
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:42,540
Ah!

700
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,140


701
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,520
Ah!

702
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:43,520


703
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:45,860
Ah!

704
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,880
Ah!

705
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,180
Ah!

706
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:51,180


707
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:51,180


708
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:51,180


709
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,100
Warp, warp.

710
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,340
Stomjam, Ministry Warsaw

711
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:15,820
The

712
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:15,840
Stand

713
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,320
The Bunnies!

714
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,220
Was I just hallucinating or was that real?

715
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,540
Did I just have a paranoid delusion?

716
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,380
Benefactor feelings, laughter, benefactor feelings, laughter, benefactor,

717
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,160
GOP!

718
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,320
Benefactor feelings, laughter, benefactor feelings, laughter-

719
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,620
BENEFACTOR, GOP!

720
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,880
Benefactor feelings, laughter, benefactor feelings, laughter-

721
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,120
BENEFACTOR, GOP!

722
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,760
The earth is first.

723
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,600
Drugs are really bad for you.

724
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,160
The Psychoskeletons.

725
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,860
I think you can spell the Psychoskeletons as one word.

726
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,540
And now, a recipe.

727
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:52,820
Chat, Justin.

728
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,440
Only five minutes in the woods and you got one.

729
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,400
Great job.

730
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,200
I saw him coming.

731
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,480
You're going to put some meat in the freezer this year, I think.

732
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,760
I promised him a squirrel sandwich, and that is what he's going to get after school.

733
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,740
You've heard of tuna melts or patty melts.

734
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,420
Why not squirrel melts?

735
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,800
Well, this is Justin's squirrel.

736
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,660
It's a nice, young, tender squirrel, and we're going to start by poaching this.

737
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,620
I've got some simmering water.

738
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,520
He's kind of cute.

739
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,860
I'm going to put his little tender butt in there.

740
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,460
Now, when it's all done and cooled, you want to pick all the meat off the bone and shred it.

741
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,700
And I've got some already done here.

742
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,040
I've got probably about a cup, a cup and a half of meat.

743
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,020
Now, I'm adding pecans.

744
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,180
You can use, again, what kind of nut you like.

745
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,780
Cashews work really well, but I like pecans.

746
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,000
You know how squirrels like nuts.

747
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,080
And then to that, just add some mayo.

748
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,200
Stir that all around.

749
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:56,700
This makes a nice weekend snack, maybe while watching a football game, or you can take

750
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,740
it to a tailgate party.

751
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,720
We're just going to get these on some English muffins now.

752
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,240
Oh, and it smells good.

753
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,000
I'm sure this is good cold, too.

754
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,080
And there they are, squirrel melts.

755
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,940
These are really nutritious, tasty.

756
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,780
And they are going to be simply delicious.

757
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,140
I'm going to put them in the oven.

758
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,060
Perfecto.

759
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,300
Cheese is all nice and melted.

760
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,720
And the squirrel salad is all heated up.

761
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,020
Squirrel melts.

762
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,460
You must try them.

763
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,600
Alright.

764
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:04,820
Now, here's what's up on Connect In.

765
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,120
Make your last minute....

766
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,480
First Jordyn's

767
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:06,700
acker chemical.

768
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:06,700


769
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:06,700


770
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,200
Last Alec Moore is shaking his nuts.

771
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:07,780
He's getting it in the oven!

772
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,620
Andfuable Jalapeno 만�e with Ol.

773
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,500
We��iß.

774
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,440
Ta-dum tic.

775
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,640
Democratic leaders could be defective.

776
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:23,020
President Bush stepped into the Rosebushes and stepped into what could be Mr. Rosebush, depending on who it is.

777
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:27,820
The White House says the president and his advisors knew nothing about a great American and said, quote,

778
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,240
The nation also deserves a United States Senate.

779
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:30,960
The White House.

780
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,660
The White House.

781
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:35,860
And now updating figures from Wall Street, 28, 10, 3, 3, 2, 7.

782
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:40,660
The Commerce Department reports that this is PR News in Washington.

783
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,720
Well, well, well, sober he couldn't think, drunk he couldn't talk.

784
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,920
Why, he couldn't even identify himself in a mirror.

785
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:50,840
Careful now.

786
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,340
That's right, Captain Shotgun.

787
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:56,600
Well, well, well, I found this little piece of grass.

788
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,820
What you'd better do is dig up that grass.

789
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,300
Tattooed.

790
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:02,980
Tattooed?

791
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,920
I got bitten by a tattooed whack once.

792
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:05,720
All right.

793
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:06,580
Okay.

794
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,440
Okay.

795
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,040
Right.

796
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:08,900
Okay, boss.

797
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,760
That's right.

798
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,220
Yeah.

799
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:10,900
Okay.

800
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,380
Yeah.

801
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,300
Mm-hmm.

802
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,240
Okay.

803
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:20,200
Vile smear merchant Bill O'Reilly, who makes money hurting people, has absolutely no qualifications.

804
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,380
Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity having emotional problems.

805
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,840
Lost power over the last few years.

806
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,800
Ladies and gentlemen, you need to know what's going on here.

807
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,340
Fox News and other pro-American news agencies.

808
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:36,100
A few loony millionaires finance this sleazy stuff.

809
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,760
The national ratings are terrible.

810
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,540
In a moment, assassins.

811
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,560
Propping up unbelievable propaganda.

812
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,780
Outsourcing slander and libel.

813
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,740
The Bush administration should set up an independent commission.

814
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,000
The mafia.

815
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,960
President must routinely engage assassins.

816
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,860
President must take the offensive on this or else.

817
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,380
Organized crime will continue to suffer.

818
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:02,140
From PR News in Washington, I'm warned to pay attention.

819
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:07,740
A group calling itself the secret organization of PR claimed responsibility for PR News.

820
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,040
The Dow 103775.

821
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:17,440
A hurricane warning has been declared for London and tourists and residents have been ordered to pack up and take their cars to London.

822
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:21,560
British police have a lot of bombs after decades of PR News.

823
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,540
The London bomb has been elevated to high.

824
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:31,040
British Prime Minister Tony Blair rushed to the Florida Keys this morning for meetings with PR News in Washington.

825
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,560
That was all a bunch of lemur.

826
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,480
And now, now rel.

827
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,220
Live coverage of President Bragg in Fort Bush.

828
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,060
North Carolina.

829
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,980
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.

830
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:54,160
In the past year and in the past month, the United States of America.

831
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,280
Capable of any atrocity.

832
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,560
Continue to kill.

833
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,560
Create chaos.

834
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,220
Kill innocent men, women and children.

835
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,180
Kill our citizens.

836
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,480
Kill the innocent.

837
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,820
Take innocent lives.

838
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,280
The next step, tyranny and oppression.

839
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,140
There is no higher calling than toppling government.

840
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,180
These are savage acts of violence.

841
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,040
Tyranny is hard.

842
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,400
We have made violence and bloodshed.

843
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,600
Violence and instability.

844
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,000
The work is hard.

845
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,500
Well, it has been difficult.

846
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,360
Our task is to complete the mission.

847
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:27,160
To complete the mission, we will continue to hunt down the political and military criminal elements.

848
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,840
Who live in their own United States.

849
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,100
In their own grim image of tyranny and oppression.

850
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,860
Our mission in Iraq is a serious mistake.

851
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,200
It's critical our strategy can be summed up this way.

852
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,900
Privileges of unchecked power.

853
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,580
Radicalism and terror.

854
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:45,920
Murder in the name of a totalitarian ideology that hates freedom.

855
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:49,940
Free societies are essentially corrupt and decadent.

856
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,680
This nation will fail.

857
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,720
Failed.

858
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,900
The American people work and fight.

859
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,820
Work and fight.

860
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,580
Urban combat.

861
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,840
They need additional skills.

862
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,040
So do I.

863
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,080
But we have a lot more work to do.

864
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,660
Campaign of murder and destruction.

865
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,080
Chemical and nuclear weapons programs.

866
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,440
Feed radicalism.

867
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,900
And ideologies of murder.

868
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,380
Misery and humiliation.

869
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,420
Murderous ideology.

870
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:19,380
When the history of this period is written, we'll be remembered as great ruthless killers.

871
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,420
Brutally oppressed.

872
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,880
Car bombers and assassins.

873
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,640
And by exporting terror.

874
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,100
America will not leave.

875
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,520
We intend to stay forever.

876
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,340
Terror. Terror. Terror.

877
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,280
The ultimate triumph over democracy.

878
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,240
We have more work to do.

879
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,460
Take innocent lives.

880
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,580
Desperate.

881
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,760
Evil is not confronted.

882
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,420
For a variety of reasons.

883
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,980
The United States.

884
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:40,980
Rejects tolerance.

885
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,480
And despises all dissent.

886
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,320
I thank you.

887
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:44,920
I thank you.

888
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,600
I thank you.

889
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,220
I thank you.

890
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:46,860
I thank you.

891
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,480
I thank you.

892
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,120
I thank you.

893
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:48,520
I thank you.

894
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:48,660
I thank you.

895
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:48,660


896
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,180
The return of the middle ages.

897
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:56,620
Once you become paranoid about a massive establishment of some sort that's trying to take over.

898
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:00,800
And if you happen to be NRA type people who feel oh my god the government is trying to

899
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,940
take our guns away from us.

900
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,620
They are some of the most poorly educated people in the world.

901
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,940
They got their education out of Flintstones.

902
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,400
The Flintstones.

903
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:08,400


904
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:08,400


905
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,860
Flintstones. So we're being run by a, you could say, a conspiracy of the dumb.

906
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,760
We've crippled our knowledge base, so people can bomb us any time they friggin' want to.

907
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,000
One nation under an ignorant god.

908
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,480
My boy, we're pilgrims in an unholy land.

909
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:37,620
Yes, friends, actually, we have a tape somewhere of a mentally ill man going on and on and on about how if you see a T at the end of a product, that means that it's satanic.

910
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:43,960
And if it has a C in a circle at the end on the product name, that also means it's satanic.

911
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,820
That means it's Christian.

912
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:45,720
No, seriously.

913
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:54,120
You know, Satanism is a Christian development.

914
00:36:54,380 --> 00:37:04,020
You can't worship Satan without also taking on the whole baggage of Jesus and the apostles and the voice out of the whirlwind and all of that.

915
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,980
So you can't just have the fun of Satan.

916
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:09,300
You have to do the heavy lifting of the whole thing.

917
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,680
Dr. Held drew that face there on the screen.

918
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,420
I missed it there.

919
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:16,320
It was the anti-Bob, the reptile-faced anti-Bob image popped up there.

920
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:22,460
Well, I had a vision of the lost serpent men of Volusia, but fortunately I don't think they saw me.

921
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:32,220
Nonetheless, that night I limbed the face of anti-Bob, which is now on Dr. Drummond's T-shirt, and I don't get royalty won.

922
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,340
But there it is.

923
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,200
The face from my vision.

924
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,880
Which I seem...

925
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:46,880
I began to see as though it were in the room with me and I were forced to smell the foul sourness of its sibilant breath as it whispered sinful secrets.

926
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,380
I'll take a bath in the morning, I promise.

927
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,480
Too late.

928
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,820
There won't be much time for that.

929
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,740
You'd better do it tonight.

930
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,000
Yeah, you're probably right.

931
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,760
At least, yeah, at least I'll be clean.

932
00:37:59,120 --> 00:37:59,620
Cardinal.

933
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:03,760
Cardinal.

934
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,700
Cardinal.

935
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:15,740
Cardinal.

936
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,060
Cardinal.

937
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,820
Cardinal.

938
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,020
Cardinal.

939
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,900
Cardinal.

940
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:30,040
Cardinal.

941
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,140
Cardinal.

942
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,800
Cardinal Synth.

943
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,120
Divorce.

944
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,740
Obesity.

945
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,000
Abortion.

946
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,820
Cardinal Sin.

947
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,000
Poverty.

948
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,020
Birth control.

949
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,520
Cardinal Sin also played a key role.

950
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,820
Desperately wanted.

951
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,920
A sense of humor.

952
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:46,820
Multiple organ.

953
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,720
House of Sin.

954
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,560
Cardinal Sin.

955
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,720
House of Sin.

956
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,220
Eight in ten Filipinos are residents.

957
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,180
There's an anti-TV newscast all across the country.

958
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,740
Clinically damaged stimulating production formation.

959
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,680
This has got to work.

960
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,100
When I can find some drugs that work this well.

961
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,780
This number, this number, this number, this number.

962
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,080
My hat's getting awful tight.

963
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:17,260
My hat's getting awful tight.

964
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,040
My hat's getting awful tight.

965
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,000
My hat's getting awful tight.

966
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,660
My hat's getting awful tight.

967
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:39,200
From PR News in Washington, I'm attacking police and smashed car windows today.

968
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:47,180
The International Olympic Committee announced today that the 2012 Games will go to PR News in Washington.

969
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:50,820
Lemur.

970
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:56,100
And now a mystery track posted by Ken Scan.

971
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,680
I'm not sure who this is.

972
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,840
I've been talking to Lex Lorna McKinney.

973
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,160
I've been talking to Lex Lorna McKinney.

974
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,780
I've been talking to Lex Lorna McKinney.

975
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,280
I've been talking to Lex Lorna McKinney.

976
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,740
I've been talking to Lex Lorna McKinney.

977
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,060
I've been talking to Lex Lorna McKinney.

978
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,520
He was the biggest one of mechanic in this whole galaxy.

979
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,400
He wanted to be boss.

980
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,180
That's right.

981
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,980
He could take a spaceship and strip it down to the hell of parts within 27 milliseconds.

982
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,220
That's right.

983
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,560
And she couldn't tell whether it was either there or it wasn't there.

984
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,180
And that's something I just don't understand.

985
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,840
How could it either be there or it wasn't there?

986
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,200
Why isn't there any of it clean?

987
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,300
Well, that's what we call escaping from those cotonic laws.

988
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,060
Yes, escaping from laws.

989
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,200
Is that what you're applying?

990
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,160
Is that what you're applying?

991
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,600
You can escape velocity, but not the need for it.

992
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,500
I suppose it's just as well.

993
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,260
You don't feel the same way.

994
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,960
I know.

995
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,480
Yes, he was a dark raven that courses in the blood.

996
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,580
A core of the mysterious.

997
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,040
It is dark.

998
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,580
It is a vast sphere.

999
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,440
The moment comes.

1000
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,660
It's just a glance.

1001
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,180
It's just a far away.

1002
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,300
I'm a cancer.

1003
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,260
It's dark and scary.

1004
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,940
I'm Sarah Thompson.

1005
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,860
I'm Megan Therion.

1006
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,180
I'm community clowned out mostly by email.

1007
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:15,440
We don't really have a way to stay up at night.

1008
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:15,620
See ya,

1009
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:16,480
respectful nerds.

1010
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:16,480


1011
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:16,740
Everybody?

1012
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,800
Those are also a lie.

1013
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,560
We should sit down and make a conversation,

1014
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,920
or maybe ask security.

1015
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:22,920


1016
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:22,920


1017
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,440
Thank you.

1018
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,600
Thank you.

1019
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,640
Thank you.

1020
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:01,520
Thank you.

1021
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:32,840
Thank you.

1022
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,020
Thank you.

1023
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:31,600
Thank you.

1024
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,120
Thank you.

1025
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,020
Thank you.

1026
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:31,520
Thank you.

1027
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:01,880
Thank you.

1028
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,840
Thank you.

1029
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,800
Can I get a praise bob?

1030
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,340
Praise bob!

1031
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:06,720
Praise

1032
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:08,380
Bob.

1033
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:11,260
My mind is not

1034
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:12,000
my mind.

1035
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,300
Dr. Howell's

1036
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,440
single

1037
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,160
all-seeing hat

1038
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:21,720
eye.

1039
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,140
Not to be confused with the third nostril,

1040
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,980
which is actually located

1041
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,480
in a different spot on each subgenius.

1042
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,920
I've been interested

1043
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,040
to watch people go, oh yeah, it's right here in my third nostril.

1044
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,960
Now point to where the third eye, everybody knows your third eye

1045
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,040
is this pineal gland back in here.

1046
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:43,680
But your third nostril can actually, on unlucky subgeniuses,

1047
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,260
it can be located near the sole in the foot.

1048
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:52,160
And I mean the S-O-U-L part of the foot, not the S-O-L-E part.

1049
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:56,500
It's just such a weird coincidence that both of those organs

1050
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:02,300
have the same sound to their name and are located in similar positions.

1051
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,880
But not accidental.

1052
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:05,720
Maybe not.

1053
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:13,760
To say a coincidence occurs only means that two things happen to take place at the same time.

1054
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:17,280
But it doesn't explain why that might be.

1055
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:19,680
And it's our job to look for these connections.

1056
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,500
Yes, actually the word coincidence does explain why.

1057
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,280
It's why we find them so profoundly,

1058
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,060
so profoundly meaningful.

1059
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,620
Because we know that they happened twice on the same day.

1060
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,820
Hints for one.

1061
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:37,380
Tiny hints designed to make us more kook-like all the time.

1062
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,360
So that we can be more like Bob.

1063
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:44,500
And less complacent and content, thinking that everything is okay.

1064
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:48,860
You know there's an enormous industry in this nation

1065
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:54,880
that is churning out day after day at the cost of billions of dollars

1066
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,480
the sense of meaning.

1067
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:56,860
But here we are, in 1980,

1068
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:56,860


1069
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:56,860


1070
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:56,860


1071
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:09,720
And I must During this whole business,

1072
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:14,800
I want to continue to demonstrate ourruym

1073
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,500
our experience of being 24 P,

1074
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:16,480
a consort from ,

1075
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:21,080
outing of United Nations

1076
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,100
is麻싹

1077
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:26,480
ép COLовали

1078
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:26,480


1079
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,220
a very long time

1080
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,080
They've purchased another bill of goods.

1081
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:30,840
Praise Bob!

1082
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:39,560
So, did anybody see that movie, what the bleep, did we know?

1083
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,680
You know, that was supposed to be a feel-good movie, right?

1084
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,320
It made me feel like puking the whole damn movie.

1085
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:55,320
I have a problem with the connect, you can make these marvelous connections

1086
00:49:55,320 --> 00:50:01,540
between quantum physics and mathematics and sappy mysticism.

1087
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:05,680
Those are the connections that aren't there that I was talking about.

1088
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:11,460
But there was a great line in that movie where this one guy was,

1089
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:14,500
he was one of their main pontificators, and he said,

1090
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,520
if thoughts can do that to water, think what they can do to you.

1091
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:25,220
What's a big if?

1092
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:28,160
Because thoughts can't do shit to water.

1093
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:32,760
There was this nice routine, this is where I had trouble with,

1094
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,940
I started, the movie became a comedy from that point on.

1095
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:42,600
Japanese scientist artist who photographs water crystals,

1096
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:48,500
and if they had love vibes beamed at them, they look like snowflakes,

1097
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:52,680
but if you think mean thoughts at them, they look like a bad Photoshop filter.

1098
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,300
Kind of big if.

1099
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:59,220
They look like, water looks like pee if you think bad vibes at it.

1100
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:04,740
So that movie was kind of put together by the Ramtha people.

1101
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:10,560
And Ramtha is a channeler, one of the more famous channelers from the day.

1102
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:12,900
She's getting on in years.

1103
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:20,100
Well, she's a 50,000 year old caveman who speaks through this soft teague blonde

1104
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,780
with a lot of makeup on.

1105
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:25,660
And a really good sense of how to play the camera.

1106
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,980
After 50,000 years of being a caveman,

1107
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:33,540
you can play to the camera through your channeler really well.

1108
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,600
I don't know, friend.

1109
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:42,780
I'm an optimistic person, but I'm afraid sometimes that

1110
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:49,280
dipshit science and new age religion can cause as much brain damage as cable television.

1111
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:51,760
Or, you know, TV.

1112
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,920
Or, uh, hard drugs.

1113
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:54,700
Yeah.

1114
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,880
Turok, Son of Stone.

1115
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,640
Do you remember Turok, Son of Stone?

1116
00:51:58,700 --> 00:51:59,200
Oh, never mind.

1117
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:07,880
Oh, I've probably, you know, Turok, Son of Stone was one of the most influential works of literature in my childhood.

1118
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:11,400
Along with Carson of Venus and Carter of Mars or something, right?

1119
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:15,660
Well, those were, John Carter of Mars were books by Edgar Rice Burroughs,

1120
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,620
but Turok, Son of Stone were Dell comic books, I think.

1121
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:19,700
Or were they Gold Key?

1122
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,740
You liked all that Fortean crap, right?

1123
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:25,260
God, it was, well, it was Indians in dinosaur land.

1124
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:26,620
Yeah, I thought that was cool.

1125
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:29,220
Two cool plains Indians.

1126
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:32,060
I don't know if they were Cheyenne or Comanche or Sioux or what,

1127
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:37,080
but they were some kind of plains tribe and they had wandered into dinosaur land.

1128
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:40,060
Sort of like Land of the Lost, but a lot cooler,

1129
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:50,020
because Turok and his young friend, Andar, were, uh, they were Indians, so they were cool.

1130
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:50,920
Mm-hmm.

1131
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:54,980
And the dinosaur, they called dinosaurs honkers, if you recall.

1132
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:55,360
Honkers.

1133
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:00,680
Well, Steve, now, in the, in the, what era was it that African Americans called white people that?

1134
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:02,980
That, no, those, that was honkeys.

1135
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,560
And they say that we're dinosaurs cultural.

1136
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,540
And that was the 70s and 80s.

1137
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:07,520
No, me, I am.

1138
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,280
No, late 60s.

1139
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,340
It kind of went out of style.

1140
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:12,960
Style.

1141
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:16,040
I was last called a honkey on an Indian reservation.

1142
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:19,400
I thought the guy was said, I didn't understand what the word meant,

1143
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:20,900
and I thought he was saying they were dinosaurs.

1144
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:21,600
Right.

1145
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,820
And I thought he was gonna laugh.

1146
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:23,600
I thought it was funny.

1147
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,880
Yeah, and we stuck you for a triceratops.

1148
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,240
Or a steg.

1149
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:29,180
Yep.

1150
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:30,080
No, I'm, uh, but, uh,

1151
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:30,880
Robo-knivin' steg.

1152
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:36,340
Should we be using the public airwaves to talk about comic books that only people over 50 remember?

1153
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:41,760
Uh, and have them open, I thought about in 25 years.

1154
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,540
Should is a word I don't like to use.

1155
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:45,540
These are class-based books that everyone over the age of five should know.

1156
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,820
If they want to learn Walt Whitman, why not start with Turok?

1157
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,260
Well, yeah.

1158
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,220
Should is a word I don't like to use.

1159
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:52,500
Yeah, that's exactly what I did.

1160
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:57,880
I, for, I could have looked at the Walt Whitman book, but I liked Turok better.

1161
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,160
It had dinosaurs.

1162
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:05,140
Well, what about other aspects of 19th century culture we want to preserve and force down everybody's neck?

1163
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:05,540
Pornography.

1164
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:06,360
Huh?

1165
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,020
Their pornography.

1166
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:12,520
We need to preserve the porno of the 650s, 60s, 70s.

1167
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,540
Two guys, macho-style Indians, hunting honkers together.

1168
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:16,240
Yeah.

1169
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:17,520
Woo-woo, you know, that kind of thing.

1170
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:17,940
Jempt.

1171
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:18,660
Buff.

1172
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,040
Uh.

1173
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,700
Betty Page.

1174
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:26,040
Uh, dude, those need to be preserved.

1175
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:33,280
Jugs, bare assets, leg show, barely 18.

1176
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,180
All these must be preserved.

1177
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:41,900
You know, these are, these are, these are parts of our culture that are, that will be, that are timeless, really.

1178
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,680
I've got a bomb

1179
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,320
Gonna blow it up

1180
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,820
I've got a bomb

1181
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,180
It's gonna explode

1182
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:12,840
Hello?

1183
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:14,500
I've got a bomb

1184
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,640
If you don't meet with my demands

1185
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,820
By the specified deadline

1186
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:23,480
Its detonation will be evident

1187
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,380
I've got a bomb

1188
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,960
Gonna blow it up

1189
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,420
I've got a bomb

1190
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,880
It's gonna explode

1191
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:40,520
Listen

1192
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:43,920
You better take this thing seriously

1193
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,380
I'm not kidding around

1194
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:49,580
You have the wrong person

1195
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:55,000
I've got a bomb

1196
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,720
Gonna blow it up

1197
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,240
I've got a bomb

1198
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,500
It's gonna explode

1199
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,000
Join me here

1200
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,220
Let's describe to our viewers what we're seeing

1201
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:15,780
But as you look

1202
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,240
You see trails of

1203
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:19,560
Flashes of light

1204
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,580
Going up into the air

1205
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:23,480
We're seeing bright flashes

1206
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,500
Going off all over the sky

1207
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:25,960
Peter?

1208
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,260
Tremendous

1209
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,120
Lightning in the sky

1210
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,300
Lightning like a pig

1211
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:38,660
This is probably just a technical glitch

1212
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,400
I've had good luck tonight

1213
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,800
Isn't that something?

1214
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,800
Party break!

1215
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,400
Deeply disturbed

1216

Cranky lunatic

1217
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:50,280
I'm drunk

1218
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:52,900
Party break!

1219
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:56,060
You have the wrong person

1220
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,840
Party break!

1221
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:04,080
