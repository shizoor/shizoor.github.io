1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Well, right now, this minute, I'm going to do something that may overthrow the entire radio business.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:12,740
I'm going to read you a commercial, but I'm not going to say a word about laboratory tests or quote you statistics or make medical claims.

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,360
All I'm going to say simply and honestly is this.

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:21,040
Ladies and gentlemen, try, just try, the finest money can buy.

5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:27,140
Every advanced technique and control is concentrated on the subgenius.

6
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,220
I don't even know what that means.

7
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,360
Mannies and tailies?

8
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:47,960
Sure.

9
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,280
Tell me this.

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:57,000
How did you, when you were here in Dallas, what made you want to start this church?

11
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:13,500
Well, my buddy Philo Drummond and I used to collect what you might call kook pamphlets or any kind of extremist material, including pornography and comic books.

12
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:22,260
But we were looking at either a Jehovah's Witness watchtower or maybe it was a John Birch Society thing.

13
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,980
We were thinking, you know, we could print up.

14
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,880
Now that these modern day.

15
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,900
Newfangled instant print shops are around and the newly invented photocopier machine.

16
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,320
We could print our own little cult pamphlet.

17
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,580
And then we discovered that J.R. Bob Dobbs had beat us to it.

18
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:46,240
He was the guy that you see in all these old ads and magazines in a hammock.

19
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,280
He's a square looking dude with a pipe.

20
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,420
He's always grinning.

21
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,520
He looks like Ward Cleaver.

22
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,100
He's always mowing the lawn or watching his wife mow the lawn.

23
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,420
Is that the guy on your website?

24
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,500
Pardon me?

25
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,040
Is it like do you see clips of him on your website?

26
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,220
Yes.

27
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,640
Untold thousands.

28
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,240
Yes.

29
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:03,680
OK.

30
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,080
I love that face.

31
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,500
That's a that's a face that'll knock your socks off.

32
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:08,760
Yeah.

33
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,300
I love that face because it has it has earned me a living.

34
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:13,840
Good.

35
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,320
Just owning that little piece of clip art has has worked wonders for me.

36
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,040
That's a great piece of clip art.

37
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,720
And I noticed that in some of the clips that the.

38
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,400
Members of the church or are pipe smoking as well.

39
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,360
Well, you know, everybody wants to be kind of like Bob.

40
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,960
Well, of course, some of them are just flat out potheads.

41
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,240
That's all there is to it.

42
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,600
Bob, people are always going to bullshit.

43
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,280
What's Bob smoking in his pipe?

44
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,040
And I'm afraid it's nothing but cheap cherry blend, pork and riff most of the time.

45
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,740
Because Bob doesn't need drugs.

46
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,960
Bob is drugs.

47
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,500
Right.

48
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,760
You throw yourself into Bob's pipe.

49
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,740
You let him smoke.

50
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,060
Yeah.

51
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:57,280
You.

52
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:57,780
Yeah.

53
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,740
He uses you as a crutch.

54
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,980
You don't use him as a crutch.

55
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,260
See.

56
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,340
Yeah.

57
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,540
And if you we make a guarantee in our religion that no other religion makes eternal salvation

58
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,560
or triple your money back.

59
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,180
Wow.

60
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:12,760
Wow.

61
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,940
The Baptists don't even do that.

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,140
No, they don't do that.

63
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,500
It's hard to prove that you didn't get eternal salvation because it takes a long time to

64
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:20,820
prove.

65
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,160
He is.

66
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,360
But we're ready to, you know, it's 30 bucks to join.

67
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,820
Bob Dobbs.

68
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,640
Bob Dobbs is standing at the gates of hell ready to give you a $90 refund.

69
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,760
When you get there.

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,520
Yeah.

71
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,520
And he has a little book called Hell on $5 a Day, which I think is $85.

72
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,440
Wait.

73
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,340
How do we know you're for real?

74
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,520
You don't.

75
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,000
That's all we've got for you today.

76
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,440
But we are having a great sale on Scale Conditioner.

77
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,440
Two for one.

78
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,620
Really?

79
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,580
Oh, I love two for one.

80
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,300
B seria yeah .

81
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:02,700
Okay, well, what's the deal?

82
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:02,700


83
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,320
What's up, son?

84
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:07,320


85
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,740
Well, this was all planned for one night, huh?

86
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:12,960
It is.

87
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,260
I like the

88
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,700
way it done.

89
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:15,780


90
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:15,780


91
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:15,780


92
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:26,800


93
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:26,800


94
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,620
Yes, if you overthrow Eris, you will be normal and pink.

95
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,760
How about that for a synchronistical sub-Discordian clip, huh?

96
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:41,200
That is from an inadvertently hilarious and psychedelic children's cartoon

97
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,120
called Barbie in the Mermaid's Tail.

98
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,860
The villain's kind of a hot-looking Darth Eris.

99
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,460
Well, friends, we have lots of new music and talk,

100
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,000
including a bowel-centric puzzling evidence show,

101
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,460
and yours truly guesting on a show hosted by Jack E. Jett

102
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,540
on Rational Radio in Dallas,

103
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:11,200
and even some old music on this Hour of Slack number 1,253.

104
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,020
Let us start, then, with this on-topic song

105
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,960
by Reverend Max Slack of maxslack.net

106
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,800
from his forthcoming collection,

107
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,160
I Do Not.

108
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,080
Compute.

109
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,260
Give me slack.

110
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,640
Slack.

111
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,060
Give me slack.

112
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,420
Slack.

113
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,160
Make the pain just go away.

114
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,380
Go away.

115
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,280
Every time that your head aches.

116
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,400
No more tension, no more stress.

117
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,600
A life of ease, more or less.

118
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,220
As a matter of fact.

119
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,300
As a matter of fact.

120
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,560
Give me slack.

121
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,120
Give me slack.

122
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,300
Give me slack.

123
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,460
Give me slack.

124
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,280
Give me slack.

125
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:32,500
Hettero.

126
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:32,500


127
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,580
Er-h-h-h.

128
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,000
Slack.

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,200
Give me slack.

130
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,200


131
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,200


132
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,060
Or give me slack.

133
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,920
As a matter of fact.

134
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,340
Give me slack.

135
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,360
Uh-uh-uh.

136
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,360


137
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,400
Give me slack.

138
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:52,680
Just a matter of fact.

139
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,860
No more stress

140
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,900
A life of bees, more or less

141
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,400
As a matter of fact

142
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,000
Give me slack

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,300
Give me slack

144
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,740
Give me slack

145
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,220
Give me slack

146
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,840
Make the pain just go away

147
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,880
Every time that your head aches

148
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,160
No more tension, no more stress

149
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,200
A life of bees, more or less

150
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,600
As a matter of fact

151
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,120
Give me slack

152
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,460
As a matter of fact

153
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,880
Give me slack

154
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,000
A life of bees, more or less

155
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,220
As a matter of fact

156
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,720
Give me slack

157
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,180
As a matter of fact

158
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,140
As a matter of fact

159
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,600
Give me slack

160
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,840
The life of these molas

161
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,760
More or less.

162
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,840
MaxSlack.net for more rather than less.

163
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,120
Now let us tune into puzzling evidence from KPFA, Berkeley,

164
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,300
and see what they've been able to determine about the bolus

165
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,800
as they peer deep into the intestines looking for the parasite.

166
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,860
The bolus. Don't forget the bolus.

167
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,460
Lord, look at this, sir.

168
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:56,020
And this parasite, this horrible-looking giant worm with sharp teeth

169
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:01,160
that burrows into your intestines and gooses you from the inside.

170
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,500
A person that sees this for the first time will be shocked.

171
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,340
They will be dismayed.

172
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,660
They will be completely bamboozled.

173
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,860
Yes, parasites are more common than you might think.

174
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,920
In fact, here's a shocker.

175
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:26,740
The majority of us are already infected with these parasites.

176
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,080
You'll be shanghaied into the future.

177
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,580
Of course, you might think, gee, I don't have parasites.

178
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,800
But they're far more common than you might think.

179
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,400
Every human thing has at least one parasite that lives inside or on it.

180
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,420
But then that would be redundant.

181
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,120
Many, including humans, have far more.

182
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,220
For example, everybody that we know and you too

183
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,400
You have a friend here on the show.

184
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,220
You have a special type of job.

185
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,100
A jointed arthropod that lives in your eyebrows exclusively

186
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,400
and never strays from vents.

187
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,520
And then you'll have that bolus that Dr. Hal is talking about right now.

188
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:07,860
Unless your colon and digestive tract are cleaned out by regular bowel movements,

189
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,420
three a day, rotting food, viruses, sticky people matter,

190
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,580
all builds up on the walls of your colon,

191
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,680
feeding these hideous, lurking parasites.

192
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,200
Pigment.

193
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,580
Turd vaporizer.

194
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,280
Yes, the pigment turd vaporizer.

195
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,900
We don't want to blow up your intestines with some stupid explosive.

196
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,540
That's no way to treat it.

197
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,700
The Mayo Clinic believes that excessive gas may be a sign of another digestive disorder

198
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:40,560
such as gastritis, acid reflux, or worst of all, an irritated bowel.

199
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,320
Do you remember Cat on a Hot Tin Roof by Tennessee Williams?

200
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,220
Yes, I do.

201
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,400
Big Daddy was reputed to have a spastic colon.

202
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:51,900
Yeah.

203
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:56,160
And he said, and it's spastic because all of you guys are making fun of me, not so much.

204
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:01,120
But, of course, actually it was something far worse than a spastic colon.

205
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,260
It was the bowel disorder that takes you away from this world

206
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,900
and across the sticks into the bowel.

207
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,800
Okay, I'm cleaning your mind, caller.

208
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,880
I'll be right with you.

209
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,080
Pay no gas bubble.

210
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,480
Please take the number.

211
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,020
It's clean.

212
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,700
Your gas problem will be taken care of and cleaned.

213
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,340
Oh.

214
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:19,540
Oh.

215
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,160
Fecal incontinence is the...

216
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:21,720
See?

217
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,020
...ability to control your bowel systems.

218
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,060
Yeah, phylo is a working...

219
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,040
Now, if you remember the other one.

220
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,680
Oh.

221
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,020
No, no, no.

222
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,660
Oh, sorry.

223
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,260
Oh, judgment.

224
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,060
It's 0 and 1.

225
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,440
Now I've fled to brutish beasts.

226
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,920
Occasional constipation.

227
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,360
And lost my reason.

228
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,100
I'll just keep breaking the feeling of being bloated.

229
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,780
Until we get it right.

230
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:35,780
Oh, no.

231
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,260
Oh, no.

232
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,060
Well, that's...

233
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:38,740
Oh, yeah.

234
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,580
Up to snuff, eh?

235
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:40,860
Don't let the name come down.

236
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,400
A hundred million Americans have serious bowel problems.

237
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,880
The roof's got a hole in it and I might drown.

238
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,560
Oh, no.

239
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,200
I thought all the lasho took all of it.

240
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,000
Ah-ha.

241
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,080
Lasho was down here.

242
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,500
Let the rain come down.

243
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,460
No, no, come on.

244
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:54,820
Wake up.

245
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,140
Oh, no.

246
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,500
You've got to be awake.

247
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,140
I thought it was the lasho, but...

248
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:58,320
Yeah, come on.

249
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:58,620
Be awake.

250
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,940
It's the next to the lasho.

251
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,680
All right.

252
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,280
Everybody, gentlemen, please, please.

253
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,400
Calm yourselves.

254
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,700
What happens if they just play nothing but old movies?

255
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,760
It's 4.30 in the morning.

256
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,080
A gas bubble is created.

257
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,720
Yes, it happens, you know.

258
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,820
Gas bubbles are...

259
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,460
Gas causes pain and discomfort.

260
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,720
It does indeed cause pain.

261
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,340
It causes waves of pain.

262
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:18,940
Gas is the smell.

263
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,340
Not a single thing but a pulsating...

264
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,960
A loud, noisome...

265
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:28,000
At times seems so intense it hardly seems endurable, but then it subsides.

266
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,240
Although it will soon climb again from the trough and subsidence into the towering edifice

267
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,140
of pain that it creates and represents.

268
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:38,880
The pain.

269
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:44,380
Dr. Howell and Philo Drummond explore the bowels on the Puzzling Evidence Show.

270
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,560
More of that and on.

271
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,780
Right now, we'll take a mental break.

272
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,140
More specifically, an instrumental music break.

273
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:56,840
With Reverend Joe Newman and the Rudy Schwartz Project, a new version of his Invasion of

274
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,780
the Chrome Fish People.

275
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,800
Music.

276
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:02,400


277
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,320
Music.

278
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,420
Music.

279
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,460
Music.

280
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,240
Music.

281
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,680
Music.

282
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,700
Music.

283
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:13,960
Music.

284
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,700
Music.

285
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:14,700


286
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,360
Music.

287
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:19,640
Music.

288
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,360
Music.

289
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:21,420


290
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:21,420


291
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:21,420


292
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:21,420


293
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:21,420


294
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:21,420


295
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:21,420


296
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:21,420


297
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,220


298
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,040
Thank you.

299
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,660
Thank you.

300
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,280
Thank you.

301
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,260
Thank you.

302
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,060
Thank you.

303
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,840
Thank you.

304
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,480
Thank you.

305
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:30,820
Hey, Mo.

306
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,260
Face this kiddie.

307
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,820
Thank you.

308
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:52,960
Thank you.

309
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,220
Thank you.

310
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,320
Thank you.

311
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:09,840
Thank you.

312
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,660
I've been around.

313
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:33,220
Thank you.

314
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,500
Thank you.

315
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,160
Well, you're surrounded by those just if you have a job.

316
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:55,700
Right.

317
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,340
What we like about Branson was things like Dollywood.

318
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,220
Uh-huh.

319
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,480
Actually, I'm not sure that Dollywood is in Branson.

320
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,880
Or maybe it's in a couple of different places.

321
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:14,800
But just, you know, it's really a gigantic amusement park for what we call the pinks.

322
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:19,360
The normals, the mediocritans, the Barbies and Kens.

323
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,760
The conspiracy of normal people.

324
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,480
Right, right, right.

325
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:30,140
Which is what the Church of the Subgenius was founded to sort of avoid, exploit, make fun of.

326
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,640
It certainly helped to save me from having to work a straight job.

327
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,900
I haven't had a normal job in 15 years.

328
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,160
Well, let me ask you this.

329
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:45,000
The Church of the Subgenius was founded by a man named J.R. Bob Dobbs.

330
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,680
Praise Bob.

331
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,080
And praise Bob.

332
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,760
The living avatar of Slack.

333
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,400
Okay.

334
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,440
No relation to Reverend Bob.

335
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,020
I'm Reverend Bob of Dallas.

336
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,360
Yeah, we know Reverend Bob of Dallas.

337
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,060
Yeah, we know.

338
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,360
Well, to deliberately confuse the issue, when we did a Subgenius commercial for MTV,

339
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,820
we hired Reverend Bob to play the generic Subgenius in it.

340
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,380
Just in order to further muddy the waters and confuse.

341
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,600
Because, you know, we used to be headquartered in Dallas.

342
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,640
Our goal was originally to unbuckle the Bible belt.

343
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,680
Oh.

344
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,420
So that its pants would fall.

345
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,560
Fall to its ankles and it would be forced to gaze unflinching upon its own private desires.

346
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,600
That's something that I'm still here trying to do.

347
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,860
Well, praise Jack.

348
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:42,720
I had to leave for a more sophisticated city, Cleveland.

349
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,460
They have burning rivers.

350
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,840
We might yet end up back in Texas.

351
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,280
Right.

352
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:51,420
Right.

353
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:56,020
As I was telling Jack earlier, the only thing I really miss about Dallas is Fort Worth.

354
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:56,640
Right.

355
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:57,820
Right.

356
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,680
Right.

357
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,340
Right.

358
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,200


359
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:16,540


360
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:19,380
Right.

361
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,340
Right.

362
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:21,400


363
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:21,400


364
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:21,400


365
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:21,400


366
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,720
Me so stupid

367
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,820
What is my IQ?

368
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,020
What is my intelligent quotient?

369
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,560
I could have been the Golden Gate Bridge

370
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,240
Or Einstein's nemesis

371
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,020
I could have been the Dirty Jacket

372
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,560
But it's all come down to this

373
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,940
Me so stupid

374
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,920
Me so stupid

375
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,720
Me so stupid

376
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,800
What is my IQ?

377
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,100
What is my intelligent quotient?

378
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,160
What is my intelligent quotient?

379
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,900
What is my intelligent quotient?

380
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:34,260
What is my intelligent quotient?

381
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,260
What is my intelligent quotient?

382
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,940
What is my intelligent quotient?

383
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,700
Me decorationism

384
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:40,700


385
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:40,700


386
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:51,280
Me cosas creativas

387
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,400
The yelling will cease and the killing will commence.

388
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,300
I'm walking a white line all the time.

389
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,180
I don't bother nobody.

390
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,340
Nobody bothers me.

391
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,380
You better start doing the same.

392
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,940
Well, I don't know.

393
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,640
Sometimes I wish God would give me a Holy Ghost machine and I'd pull your hair off.

394
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,600
My engine's revving to go.

395
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,320
It's revving up.

396
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,660
How about yours?

397
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,320
And if it's not, you know what?

398
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,720
If your engine is not revving up, you know what you need?

399
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:35,240
You need a Holy Ghost enema right up your spirit.

400
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,300
Wow.

401
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,780
I just have one of the biggest poops of my whole life.

402
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,740
Sorry about this.

403
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,720
I know it's a bit silly.

404
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,620
I know it's a bit silly.

405
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,700
We discussed the niceties of proper sanitation during the Stone Age.

406
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,840
Now we must band together.

407
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,260
Facing the terrors of nature.

408
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:35,520
Prehistoric humans didn't worry too much about bowel dysfunction.

409
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,400
They were too busy being chased.

410
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,100
Oh, sure.

411
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,080
Chased by bowel mammoths.

412
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:44,660
Hello.

413
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,600
Hello.

414
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:46,940


415
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,280
Hello.

416
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:54,740
They were too busy being chased by bellowing mammoths to stop and observe proper sanitation.

417
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,220
You know, those mammoths could chase you all day.

418
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,600
There would be little opportunity to visit the local latrine.

419
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,940
Is your life dull?

420
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,400
Who do you blame?

421
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:16,280
It's interesting to think that the life of a prehistoric man could be both dull and full of danger and violence.

422
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,200
It's so illegal.

423
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,920
And that is so unfortunate.

424
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,920
But I'm sure there were many who were esthetes even at that time.

425
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,860
Did you know there's people out there to get you, Dr. Howe?

426
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,960
I know that.

427
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:35,520
And sometimes they do because my layers of protection are not impassable.

428
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,580
Have you been able to make strangeness work for you in your life, Dr. Howe?

429
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:40,620
What?

430
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,760
Have you been able to make strangeness work for you?

431
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,280
I have in the past.

432
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,480
And sometimes I still...

433
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,620
You can, but one never knows when one has the moxie in one does one.

434
00:24:53,340 --> 00:25:00,160
Sometimes I can go against the effect of gravity and form minor neurotoxins.

435
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,320
You never know when you're going to have that.

436
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,240
It has two sides.

437
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,920
One has vocals and one don't.

438
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,320
That's bizarre.

439
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,940
You have to go with the vocal one here.

440
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:12,380
It seems to be connected to spiritual practice, but that could simply be an illusion.

441
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,040
We know that he came here after the days of the dinosaurs.

442
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,000
That's just...

443
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,440
We know that he's related to...

444
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,760
To melephants of today.

445
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,360
And we know that Will saw man before he went away.

446
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:29,480
Willie, Willie wore two coats of hair to keep him warm and toasty.

447
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:36,340
Though he did not mind the sun, he liked cold weather mostly.

448
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:43,700
Willie, Willie, Willie, Willie, Willie, Willie Mammoth has gone away.

449
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,980
Wow, the mighty mammoth.

450
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,620
There goes the mammoth.

451
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:47,620


452
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,040
There goes that one.

453
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,820
And it's about time.

454
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,180
I couldn't have done it without you, I said to myself.

455
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:59,080
Without that magnificent mammoth trumpeting over the Pleistocene snowbank.

456
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,240
I wonder what they tasted like.

457
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,360
They...

458
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,800
Tasted the same as it did last time.

459
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,260
They tasted like...

460
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,420
Only more so.

461
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:14,960
They taste similar to what the Indian elephant would have been if you prepared it as a little...

462
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,900
Go ahead and I'll blow the brains out of all my...

463
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,240
Myself.

464
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:24,100
I used to believe that pygmies in Africa ate elephant meat which had been rotted.

465
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:32,880
And after a long rotting, they finally would consume the elephant meat which would intoxicate them.

466
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:41,600
And they would fall into a comatose state from gorging on this putrid rotten elephant meat.

467
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:47,080
Now this could be some just goofball story that has no basis in fact.

468
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:52,740
But it is true that the elephants in the pygmies at least at one time occupied the same country.

469
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,300
And the pygmies even did hunt them.

470
00:26:54,660 --> 00:27:04,060
So maybe that's the only element of truth in that strange story which seems to come out of the annals of Tarzan of the Apes.

471
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,080
Lord Greystoke and all that sort of thing.

472
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,060
Born to be tree grandpa when the

473
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:47,060


474
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:47,060


475
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:47,060


476
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,800
Thank you.

477
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,140
Ahoy!

478
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,060
Ahoy, mate! Ahoy, ahoy!

479
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,840
I see that you're a sailor boy.

480
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,860
I owned a boat, a beauty, too.

481
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,000
Fifty times as big as your, uh,

482
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,280
as big as your, uh,

483
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,060
as big as your shoe.

484
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,580
My, my.

485
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,340
My, my.

486
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,000
Lost her, though, in a furious gale.

487
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,800
But I came home on the back of a whale.

488
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,640
But tell me how you caught the whale.

489
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,620
Simply grabbed a hold of his tail.

490
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,580
My, my.

491
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,060
My, my.

492
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,960
My, my.

493
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,480
I climbed a mountain six feet high.

494
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,360
I put my head against the sky.

495
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,440
And there I was.

496
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,520
Where was I?

497
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,420
On the island of Alibi.

498
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,220
My, my.

499
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,620
My, my.

500
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,660
My, my.

501
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,380
But now my life is very dull.

502
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,720
They ought to make me a mad girl.

503
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,940
Now that's the job that I enjoy.

504
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,740
I must be going.

505
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,860
Ahoy, ahoy.

506
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,620
My, my, my.

507
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,760
From PR News in Washington,

508
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,980
I'm demanding the government step down.

509
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,760
The head of the Anglican Communion

510
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,620
is attacking the ecumenical sex in Ireland.

511
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,340
Interviewed by the BBC,

512
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,420
the Archbishop of Canterbury

513
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,780
describes having sex

514
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,060
by the name of the Archbishop of Canterbury.

515
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,160
Suddenly coming.

516
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,480
It is a problem for everybody in Ireland.

517
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,420
There is word of more deadly

518
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,600
spirit of humanity.

519
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:55,940
PR is bad.

520
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,780
PR is bad.

521
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,120
President Obama is urging people

522
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,860
this Easter weekend to embrace PR News.

523
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,480
All of us stretch back through the ages.

524
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,380
More now from PR's failing institutions.

525
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,320
The President notes

526
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,700
Jewish families are celebrating

527
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,360
the resurrection of PR News.

528
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,460
The Obama administration

529
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,060
should be labeled a currency manipulator

530
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,500
as some lawmakers have asked

531
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,360
for refusing to halt its PR.

532
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,960
I'm basically

533
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,280
a shy retiring type

534
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,280
So shy in fact that I

535
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,360
make movies every night

536
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,060
And even if I do that,

537
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,060


538
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,060


539
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,260
Don't take that shot.

540
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,280
Am I in shock?

541
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,280
The press are mean.

542
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,160
I'm in magazines.

543
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,320
I'm all messed up.

544
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,380
It's in my book.

545
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,280
It's my doctor's note.

546
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,280
My fans will want to know.

547
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,960
Those laws on privacy.

548
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,200
Those laws apply to me.

549
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,260
Just let me be.

550
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,980
In my big SUV.

551
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:15,920
Please stop drawing attention to yourself.

552
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:24,420
It's almost like you like drawing attention to yourself.

553
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:31,980
Please stop drawing attention to yourself.

554
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:40,340
It's almost like you like drawing attention to yourself.

555
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:46,480
We've all got something to hide and there the problems arise.

556
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,440
If you're a star you must try to keep what's hidden inside.

557
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,520
But you're a fucking celeb so you have no common sense.

558
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,520
You have to publicly sue and the world knows the truth.

559
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:02,540
And if they did it before it's on the news before dawn.

560
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,540
It's going round and around in playgrounds, offices, town.

561
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,480
So keep to keep it immersed.

562
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,680
You've made it many times worse.

563
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,200
And there's the whole irony.

564
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,520
Put that on your Twitter feed.

565
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,720
Shining star.

566
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,040
That's opticored attention.

567
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,900
Thatㅠㅠ

568
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,160
Quicken

569
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,160


570
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,160


571
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:29,360
Just by doing it you Dar BY

572
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,080
Please

573
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:31,840
Stop

574
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,440
Drawing Attention

575
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,400
To

576
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,560
Yourself

577
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,580
It's almost like

578
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,140
That's a good joke.

579
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:40,160
You've got much more to say.

580
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,780
New life

581
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:44,340
Drawing attention to yourself.

582
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,360
Just keep your eyes on it.

583
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:46,420
There's nothing you can't say.

584
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,580
You can't blind the public eye

585
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:54,640
You can't get them worked up, then just hide

586
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,420
Maybe you still need to be employed

587
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:02,500
Maybe this is the job to avoid

588
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:06,400
Is there a moral world? Yes, just keep yourself to yourself

589
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,600
These things flow over in time, just keep your head down, it's fine

590
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,540
But self-proclaims and superstars can't get their heads down that far

591
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:18,400
They always need the spotlight, and hence the downfall tonight

592
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:26,160
Please stop drawing attention to yourself

593
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:34,440
It's almost like you like drawing attention to yourself

594
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:41,980
Please stop drawing attention to yourself

595
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,520
It's almost like you like drawing attention to yourself

596
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:50,220
You like, you like drawing attention to yourself

597
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:06,180
You like drawing attention to yourself

598
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,320
Told you it was gonna be a lot of music.

599
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,660
Can't buy kids today, can you?

600
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,720
I think I we adopting a famous psycho

601
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,600
But you knew it was an old trick

602
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:33,540
Can't you find it on your phone?

603
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,740
Can you become popular today, walking outside your hotel room?

604
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:34,740


605
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:34,740


606
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,720
I need more London.

607
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,760
from the album In Sound from Way Out.

608
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,100
Thanks to Mr. Sister for the Perry Kingsley

609
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,440
and Reverend Byron Warner for the term Space Age Bachelor Pad music.

610
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:57,860
And now, oh, and by the way, this background music is also by Perry Kingsley,

611
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,940
which has a dash in between Perry and Kingsley.

612
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,520
Very funny.

613
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:08,840
And now some subgenius music by the good Reverend Slack T.

614
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:13,560
That is, music, the music is controlled by him, but he is controlled.

615
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,080
Controlled by him.

616
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:19,980
Controlled by him.

617
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,520
Controlled by him.

618
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,060
Uncontrolled by him.

619
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,100
Controlled by him.

620
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,620
Thank you.

621
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,680
Thank you.

622
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,900
Thank you.

623
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:17,820
Thank you.

624
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,160
Thank you.

625
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,620
Thank you.

626
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:54,540
Thank you.

627
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,700
Thank you.

628
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:43,900
Thank you.

629
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:13,920
Thank you.

630
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:14,180
Thank you.

631
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,100
Thank you.

632
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,540
Thank you.

633
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,420
Thank you.

634
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,340
Thank you.

635
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,520
Thank you.

636
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,880
the first gay subgenius minister.

637
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,580
Oh, sorry, you're going to have to get behind

638
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,500
about a thousand other...

639
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,180
Are there really?

640
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,100
Oh, yeah, tons of them.

641
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,380
Of gay ministers already?

642
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,000
Yeah, yeah.

643
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,900
You had asked me whether we'd done any gay marriages,

644
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:08,200
and I had only done, I guess,

645
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,240
what you would call lesbian transsexual marriages.

646
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,900
Yeah, that's unique to me.

647
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,680
I just, by coincidence,

648
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,920
I haven't performed any normal gay weddings,

649
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,660
only really weird,

650
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,060
or what you might call especially queer gay weddings.

651
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:25,440
Right.

652
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,880
But none of your traditional, you know,

653
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:33,200
kind of square gay weddings.

654
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:36,660
Well, then what's going to be special about me

655
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,180
when I become ordained?

656
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,980
How do I make myself special?

657
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,880
Well, you've met the...

658
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:43,940
You've met the dueling bankheads,

659
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,780
Charo and Sean Young.

660
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,600
Right there, that's enough to...

661
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,160
You know, that...

662
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,080
You could probably...

663
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,180
I would give you a price break,

664
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,560
but it's against our religion.

665
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,720
I don't need the price break.

666
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,980
I just need to know that, you know,

667
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,920
that I can lay some level of self-importance upon myself.

668
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,520
That's what I need for my ego.

669
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,800
He had a good game going.

670
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,260
He had a good game going.

671
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,740
He had a good mother to help.

672
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,960
He had a good father to help him in his game.

673
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,980
I was kind of over on the sidelines

674
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:18,340
trying to look over the track.

675
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,780
Put that math out on your head.

676
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,080
Finish that thought.

677
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,620
I told him,

678
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,880
dude, you're doing this to yourself, man.

679
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,460
In other words, I'm in the cell, right?

680
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,240
He let me out, and I walk around.

681
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,540
The guy says, if you don't do this,

682
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,440
we're going to lock you back up.

683
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,140
I said, well, okay, I don't care anyway.

684
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,060
I already gave up that thought.

685
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,720
Prison's in your mind, man.

686
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,720
You can sit in the cell.

687
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,580
The guy says, are you in prison?

688
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,580
I said, no, I'm just here.

689
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,440
He says, what are you doing?

690
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,820
I said, well, I'm just sitting here

691
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:46,820
waiting for these people

692
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,280
to get done doing what they're doing

693
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,000
so I can get out.

694
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,020
I said, my old lady.

695
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,000
She says, let's steal a car.

696
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:53,880
Go to California.

697
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:58,120
I said, man, I ain't going to steal a car.

698
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,660
Go to California and get put back in jail.

699
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,000
She said, we won't get caught.

700
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,840
We won't get caught.

701
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,980
Charlie, we won't get caught.

702
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,400
And she was right.

703
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,340
We didn't get caught.

704
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,220
Just I got caught.

705
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:15,720
From PR News in Washington, I'm still missing.

706
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:18,840
Japan rattled Japan's main island.

707
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,460
Take cover.

708
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:23,700
Early warning systems detected PR News minutes before it struck.

709
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,060
For PR News, I'm bent in London.

710
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:26,840
M-m-m.

711
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,540
Officials say this is PR.

712
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,980
In the U.S. and the Northeast, it's New England.

713
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,520
Three people linked to the U.S. Consulate General in Mexico

714
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,880
were killed yesterday during a snowmobile competition near Ciudad Juarez.

715
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,860
In a statement, the White House says U.S. citizens employed by the U.S. Consulate General

716
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:42,860


717
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:42,880
U.S. citizens employed by the U.S. Consulate General are not in the U.S. Consulate General.

718
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:43,280
U.S. citizens employed by the U.S. Consulate General are not in the U.S. Consulate General.

719
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,960
Husband of a Mexican citizen employee.

720
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,280
U.S. citizens Mexico.

721
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,700
U.S. citizen husband.

722
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,280
Government U.S. Mexican justice.

723
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,360
Mexican violence.

724
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,260
Mexican PR News, Washington.

725
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,280
Utility crews are still working to restore PR News, Washington.

726
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,040
The Lone Turd.

727
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,820
A fiery I.O.sler.

728
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,020
I.O.sler.

729
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,100
The Lone Turd.

730
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,620
He was known as the Lone Turd.

731
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,760
For his coming.

732
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,680
An organization was developed to combat the evil of American pioneers.

733
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,860
An organization called the Texas Lone Turds.

734
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:23,400
The most ruthless outlaw band in the West.

735
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:24,680
Sure, why not?

736
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,160
Good.

737
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:29,220
A lone figure gurgling in a shady cave.

738
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,560
You... you're Tonto.

739
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,880
That's right. Me, Tonto.

740
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,680
You are a Lone Turd.

741
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,220
Yes, Tonto.

742
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,000
I am a Lone Turd.

743
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,640
Nothing could save you.

744
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:48,920
This is a treacherous place.

745
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,600
The Larry Brown Act is not a damn thing to make a name for.

746
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:50,420
I live here in Stacy or a land I decline to call Кол taco.

747
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:51,300
You're not busy out there.

748
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,260
It isn't about how you live.

749
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:52,540
I am the only one you love, Leo.

750
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:52,760
The thing is, Tonto is dead from

751
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:52,760


752
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:52,980
All the crazy growth that you caused...

753
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,080
No matter how many times you die, I'll のoo kill you as soon as you can.

754
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:56,020
Tonto...

755
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:58,660
prot ihnen вeded goes...

756
00:46:58,660 --> 00:46:59,240
to see.

757
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,700
Formerly Christian was the bulgarian Waitress...

758
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,420
things were starting to change.

759
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:03,420


760
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:07,860
What? right.

761
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:21,100
done. What that? Dig another grave out there. That hard? That'll be my grave. Me glad, Kimo Sabe.

762
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:28,080
That's good. That's right, Kimo Sabe. That good. Will the loner triumph as he fights law and order?

763
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:33,160
Be sure to be with us again next week at the same time. Another loner.

764
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:36,560
Here we go, man.

765
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,560
Okay, man, hold it. Hold it.

766
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,260
The key to slack is lemur.

767
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,180
Milk. Milk.

768
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:53,740
You like some cold milk? Anybody?

769
00:47:54,240 --> 00:48:03,100
Telling you that milk comes in trucks is like telling you that milk comes from cows.

770
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,960
Everybody needs milk.

771
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,700
You do it all the time.

772
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,100
You would think we were doing a milk thing.

773
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:12,720
Telling you that milk comes in trucks is like

774
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:17,100
telling you that milk comes from cows.

775
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,960
Everybody needs milk.

776
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,700
You do it all the time.

777
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:21,620
You know what that makes you?

778
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:22,860
You're gonna need ice cold milk.

779
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:31,640
What you may not realize, all of America's milk supply moves to you by truck.

780
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,220
Anybody?

781
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,200
By truck, by truck, by truck.

782
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:37,120
Everybody needs milk.

783
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:42,100
Nearly everything else that you eat, drink, use or wear.

784
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:42,700
Everybody needs milk.

785
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,080
You're gonna need ice cold milk.

786
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:44,500
You're gonna need ice cold milk.

787
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,400
Everybody needs milk.

788
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:49,240
By truck.

789
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,740
That sounds like an ad for milk, huh?

790
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:56,300
By truck, by truck, by truck, by truck, by truck, by truck, by truck.

791
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:57,260
You know what that thing is?

792
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:03,320
The next time that you see a cow, remember it is waiting for a truck.

793
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,960
Why did you paint that image of me?

794
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,460
And now you have that brain worm.

795
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:12,520
A maddeningly catchy song by Reverend Mark Hosler of

796
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:18,940
Negative Land, although that song by truck is from his semi-solo album, Thugmo Tactic.

797
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:25,020
And now from Winterstar, a song about Gandhi by Tommy Amoeba and Fat Man D.

798
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:30,620
Well, I don't know about you, but that last video got me very excited.

799
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,580
I get that a lot.

800
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:34,960
It got me really, really excited.

801
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:41,560
I mean, it got me so excited, I'm gonna sing a little bluegrass song about Gandhi that

802
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,820
my husband, Tommy Amoeba, wrote.

803
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,740
And it goes a little something like this.

804
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:54,440
If you know the words, sing along.

805
00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:02,560
Gandhi lives and Gandhi breathes, but only if you so believe.

806
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:06,760
You act as if you were a saint.

807
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:10,400
Well, Gandhi is an angel saint.

808
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:14,620
Gandhi is just like a king.

809
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,200
And everybody does their thing.

810
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:24,640
So how can you just hang around while our Harvey G年前-

811
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,060
Gandhi, shake.

812
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,060
You do the shake, shake, shake, shake, Gandhi, shake.

813
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,860
Shake, shake, Gandhi, shake.

814
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,720
You do the shake, shake, shake, shake, Gandhi, shake.

815
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,480
Shake, shake, Gandhi, shake.

Put your upon my southeast

820
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:05,140
Eat the call, dance in the dust of desert sand.

821
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,840
The day of karma is at hand.

822
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,680
Gandhi lives alive and well.

823
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:15,680
He's living in a big hotel.

824
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:20,360
No doubt a soul, alive or dead,

825
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:24,080
it might come back as Mr. Head Shake.

826
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,140
Gandhi Shake, you do the Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake.

827
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:28,560
Gandhi Shake, Shake, Shake, Gandhi Shake.

828
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,820
You do the Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake.

829
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,380
Gandhi Shake, Shake, Shake, highlighter Shake.

830
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:33,480
You do the Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake.

831
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:37,520
Gandhi Shake, Shake, Shake,шего,Save, Shake, Shake

832
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,920
Shake, Shake, Shake here we come on.

Dickey, dickey, dickey, dickey, dickey, dickey, dickey, dickey, dickey, dickey, dickey, dickey,

836
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:53,040
Dickey leaves!

837
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:03,260
Ladies and gentlemen, as you may or may not have guessed, this is one of my now two husbands,

838
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:07,520
the one I've been with for about ten years now.

839
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:13,920
I'd like to introduce you to the one and hopefully not to be only, Tommy Amoeba!

840
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:21,260
He wrote this song, and many others.

841
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:23,820
He has his own act called Amoeba Knievel.

842
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:31,280
Fortunately, they were able to let him off to join me here for our first Winter Star.

843
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:36,060
So if you like this song, it's all his fault.

844
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,200
Shake, shake, body shake, you do the shake, shake, shake, shake, body shake.

845
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,900
Shake, shake, body shake, you do the shake, shake, shake, shake, body shake.

846
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:43,900


847
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,820
Shake, shake, body shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.

848
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:55,360
Dibby Liberal party, Dibby Blondie, Dibby Blondie.

849
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,940
Shake, shake, Dibby Blondie, Dibby Blondie, Dibby Blondie.

850
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,640
Shake, shake, Dibby Blondie, Dibby Blondie, Dibby Blondie.

851
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:05,460
Shake, shake, Dibby Blondie, Dibby Blondie.

852
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,180
Dickey, dickey, dickey, dickey, decikey, body.

853
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:19,600
Fat Mandy and Tommy Amoeba live at Winterstar 2010.

854
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:23,500
The Gandhi Shake, another maddeningly catchy tune there.

855
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:29,860
Fatmandy.com, by the way, is spelled P-H-A-T-M-A-N-D-E-E.

856
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:34,880
Incidentally, they will be performing at X Day this July 4th,

857
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:39,660
along with the Amino Acids, the Duke of Uke, Psycho Charger, Fat Free,

858
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,500
and many more, including Dr. Dark's drive-in.

859
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:47,740
And now, something that won't be on the broadcast version of this show,

860
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:51,500
but only on the internet and subscription versions,

861
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:58,580
Joe Newman's brand new song at the Illinois Pole Barn Cluster Fuck.

862
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:19,700
Lord, the catch was all jumping at the Illinois Pole Barn Cluster Fuck.

863
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:24,340
Big, tall Sammy and freckle-faced Dan brought sandwiches,

864
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:29,100
and the pole-winkle ladies' choir sang dirges and mule shanties.

865
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,860
Made the menfolk proud.

866
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:37,840
The full complement of penetrators and oil-based lubricants was laid out on a crimped-up gunny sack,

867
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:42,400
and we all wondered who'd be the first to expose their crotch once the young,

868
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,160
old-timey Americans cleared away the punchbowl.

869
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:50,860
Old Uncle Willie started things off with them rollin' pink testicles we'd all seen before.

870
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,920
They popped out one at a time and startled Mrs. Pickering,

871
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:58,320
and he draped them over a shovel to keep the hens away.

872
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:03,760
Shorty Crenshaw straddled a plow and pulled out a carton of goat cheese.

873
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:08,800
The ladies all gathered round and spread it a couple inches thick on Shorty's backside,

874
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,100
settin' the table, if you please.

875
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,380
Hogs was brung over to sample Shorty's wares,

876
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,860
and Granny Trout slid her colostomy under some hay,

877
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,480
so as not to put anyone off their supper.

878
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:27,260
Merle and Mavis Thicket brought their stag reels and Porter Wagner records,

879
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:31,460
and Mavis proceeded to show Merle the cold, hard facts of life.

880
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:37,560
Folks say they'd never seen so many peculiar objects go up Merle's anus in one session,

881
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,160
and the cows could hear the screams clear over by the highway.

882
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:47,560
Discipline was strictly enforced as the ladies gathered the menfolk in a circle,

883
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:51,500
led by their cock rings and a sour leather horse strap.

884
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:56,940
Nobody dared talk back at the Illinois pole barn clusterfuck.

885
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,280
Whistle

886
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:00,620
Whistle

887
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,220
Humming

888
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:06,540
Humming

889
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:34,420
Greece

890
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:34,420


891
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:34,420


892
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:34,420


893
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:34,480
Greece

894
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:34,480


895
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:34,700
Greece

896
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:35,320
Greece

897
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:36,340
Greece

898
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:36,480
Greece

899
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:36,480


900
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:36,480


901
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:36,500
Greece

902
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:36,500


903
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:36,500


904
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:36,500


905
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:36,500


906
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:40,820
But I waited till December

907
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:44,680
Me so stupid

908
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:48,860
Me so stupid

909
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:52,480
Me so stupid

910
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:57,220
What is my IQ?

911
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:02,040
What is my intelligent quotient?

912
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:08,080
Mmm, that's so wrong

913
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,980
If you wanna surprise Bob do it correctly

914
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,460
And then a little bit of fussing and bintossing.

915
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,160
Can we help?

916
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,100
Don't worry, though.

917
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,100
Steer it out.

918
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:21,700
Don't be scared.

919
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,920
Where is it going to be?

920
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:25,640
Is it in New York?

921
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:28,400
Hello?

922
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:30,100
It's always in New York.

923
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:31,720
New York, New York.

924
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:32,800
Oh, were you talking to us?

925
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:33,520
Sorry, I was asleep.

926
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:34,060
What happened?

927
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:35,040
Huh?

928
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,480
Did I shoot Bob yet?

929
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:37,660
Yeah.

930
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,440
I thought Taxi Bob was retired.

931
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:40,140
That's coming up.

932
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:40,560
The anniversary.

933
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,580
Taxi Bob is retired.

934
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:44,440
January 24th.

935
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,140
No longer Taxi Bob.

936
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:48,140
I know we're all going after a day of seclusion and going to mourning.

937
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:51,080
Yeah, and wear hair shirts and self-flagellate and all that stuff.

938
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:52,620
Oh, and mask.

939
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:53,620
Mask.

940
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:54,340
Do we get a mask?

941
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:56,260
Like hair shirt mask.

942
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:58,200
Or hair taxi Bob mask.

943
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,700
We're all going after the oof lodge in Point Arena.

944
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,940
And we end up at the International House of Pants.

945
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:03,300
When's this?

946
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:04,420
Oh, yeah.

947
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:06,460
On the anniversary of shooting at Bob.

948
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07,160
Oh, yeah.

949
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:09,580
January 21st, 22nd.

950
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:10,620
Anniversary.

951
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,180
This year, I think I'm going to be in next day.

952
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:14,600
You do.

953
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:15,140
No, it's coming up.

954
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:17,200
It's January 24th.

955
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:22,220
From PR News in Washington, I'm going to prison after being convicted of corruption.

956
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:26,280
That is according to the sheriff in the town of Centennial Bank of Utah.

957
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,200
He spoke on the 40th anniversary of the nuclear non-treaty.

958
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,340
President Obama says you're listening to PR News.

959
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:36,200
President Obama also said he will seek PR News.

960
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:44,340
Police in Najaf, Iraq say Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki is warning Iraqis to stay home and not turn out to vote.

961
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:50,040
Icelanders are voting on a referendum today on how to pay a group of religious pilgrims killed

962
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:54,080
as they were lined up to board their nuclear warheads outside a shrine.

963
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:59,360
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation says there will be PR News in Washington.

964
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,580
Now, Reverend, are you married?

965
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:01,960
Yes.

966
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:05,780
I am happily married to...

967
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:08,780
I married a character from outer space, yes.

968
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,320
Oh.

969
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:13,560
I'm married to Princess We Are Doe, queen of all the UFOs.

970
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:14,920
She's not...

971
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:21,980
Unfortunately, it's unidentified flying object, so we don't know who her subjects are.

972
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:23,300
Right.

973
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,100
But she is a goddess?

974
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:27,660
Yeah.

975
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,880
Oh, do you have any...

976
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,040
She's a bit of a slob, too, but...

977
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:32,400
Ha!

978
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:32,620


979
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:35,180
You know, if you're a princess, that goes with the territory.

980
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:37,640
Do you have any little godettes?

981
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:39,380
I...

982
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:49,700
With a different wife, I created two homunculi who are both grown up and live in Los Angeles now.

983
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:53,740
My son is a Hollywood director who does commercials.

984
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:54,380
He's not...

985
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,220
You wouldn't know his name.

986
01:00:56,220 --> 01:01:00,660
And my daughter has delivered a little grand yeti.

987
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:01,760
Hmm.

988
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:03,520
She married...

989
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:10,960
We try to encourage subgeniuses to marry within their species, which means other descendants of the yeti.

990
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:13,660
It doesn't have to be the opposite sex.

991
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:13,940
All right.

992
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,600
It can be any sex you want.

993
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,180
It doesn't even have to be part human, but it doesn't have to be part yeti.

994
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:19,280
We've got to wrap things up here.

995
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:20,040
I'm sorry.

996
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:20,820
So we've got to...

997
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:23,140
Let's give your website address real quick.

998
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:25,760
Subgenius.com.

999
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:26,720
Thank you.

1000
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,440
Subgenius is not spelled with an O, but dot com is.

1001
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:31,320
Yes.

1002
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:32,940
The future of broadcasting is now.

1003
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:34,560
The future is here.

1004
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:40,180
I think we have both learned a valuable lesson today.

1005
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,320
Okay, maybe not.

1006
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:47,360
Well, the one thing we have learned this week is there are no easy answers.

1007
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:53,060
If a tree falls in the forest and there's nobody there to hear it, does it make a sound?

1008
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:55,500
Who cares?

1009
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:58,760
Oh, son of a...

1010
01:01:58,760 --> 01:01:59,800
Son of a...

1011
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:00,620
Son of a...

1012
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:01,280
Gun.

1013
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,040
You thought I was going to say son of a bitch, didn't you?
