1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
What does that red button over there do?

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,720
Go ahead, please.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,760
Once upon a time, in a famous story,

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,500
a girl named Alice got very curious about a little white rabbit that passed by.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,560
She followed him, and soon found herself falling down a very deep hole

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,460
into a strange place called Wonderland.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,760
This is A Voice of Colossus.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,360
The voice of God.

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,620
The choice is yours.

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,920
Obey and live, or disobey and die.

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,300
Quiet, numbskulls. I'm broadcasting.

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,760
The Soul Juice.

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,040
The Soul Juice.

14
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,860
Unless they have control of your radio, too.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,580
And I do, too.

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,900
Good. This is Ren Hwock.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,880
And this is Stimson J. Catt of the Ren and Stimpy Show.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,380
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack.

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,180
Keep listening, you idiots.

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

21
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,480
Else I shall kill you.

22
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,740
Thank you for listening.

23
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,340
I write just for you.

24
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,540
But others hearing this may find

25
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,720
things they would argue.

26
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,560
I do not sing what I believe.

27
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,440
I only give them facts.

28
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,880
If they believe quite otherwise,

29
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,880
it still will have impact.

30
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,360
I do not sing what I believe.

31
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:56,360


32
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:56,740
If they believe quite otherwise,

33
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:56,740


34
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,680
It will still have impact, my friend.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,480
Thank you for listening.

36
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,440
That was L. Ron Hubbard singing,

37
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,600
the founder of Scientology.

38
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,920
And this, dear friends,

39
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,860
is Hour of Slack number 795.

40
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,580
We survived the sixth annual

41
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,760
end of the world drill

42
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,360
and brought back many recordings

43
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,200
of that spirit-filled weekend

44
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,000
at our survivalist campground

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,800
in Sherman, New York.

46
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,640
But Sub-G and I the world over

47
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,980
celebrated X-Day,

48
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,520
including this promising new band,

49
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,140
the El Queso All-Stars.

50
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:29,980
Now check out the show.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,500
Check out this song,

52
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,460
Planet X or Bust

53
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,680
by the El Queso All-Stars.

54
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,560
Planet X or Bust by the El Queso All-Stars.

55
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:04,560


56
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:04,560


57
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,740
I cut my finger on a soup can lid.

58
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,300
I got an infection and it spread to my dick.

59
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,400
It swelled up to the size of a human head.

60
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,020
And then a mouth opened on it.

61
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,020
And this is what it said.

62
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,460
It said to kill the pink boys.

63
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,400
Put your job,

64
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,980
mock the world and worship Bob Dobbs.

65
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,100
We'll build a ship and take a trip.

66
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,100
Come on and get up here, write the coordinates.

67
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,840
Three and a half months in my garage,

68
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,440
tearing parts off of old used cars.

69
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,600
My groin at this point,

70
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,220
it was unusual.

71
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,980
I was given occasionally hum

72
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,300
while smoking cigars.

73
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,560
Our project was finished.

74
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,680
This ship would hold 20.

75
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,900
The power source was anything

76
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,080
the crew would think was funny.

77
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,020
We didn't need this lacklustre hapless.

78
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,320
Our merc-group is worth it,

79
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,440
escaping a star fist.

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,760
On our way to Planet X for sex,

81
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,380
the next next.

82
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,900
The parries quit and Harry Potter money shot a connie twop.

83
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,660
It's an all-haas hour of bonanza.

84
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,040
It's like a world without Tony Danza.

85
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,140
Or Banza, the pink shit that gets the charts.

86
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,420
In a world of death arc,

87
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,500
simultaneous lobotomy and sodomy.

88
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,460
We take a moment and we pause to reflect.

89
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,900
On the pinks that we killed,

90
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,120
and the planet that they wrecked.

91
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,480
Then we laugh like banshees,

92
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,620
and howl like our manjees.

93
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,540
We're a victory dance,

94
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,100
in our under-roos and panties.

95
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,700
Our fantasy is a reality.

96
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,340
Earth turns to dust.

97
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,860
Planet X are bust for us.

98
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,120
As Bob's pipe is lit,

99
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,100
space and time shift.

100
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,180
A temporal disturbance.

101
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,920
The contents of the flag were

102
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,800
a ten-dimensional split.

103
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,160
Severance forever,

104
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,660
sub-geni for pink shit.

105
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,340
Bob walked in a circle,

106
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,080
and steadily exhaled in the smoke,

107
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,980
I can see why the pink boys fail.

108
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,260
DNA's has con-destruction.

109
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,580
Sick and full of slack with suction.

110
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,960
Pay-per-view alien abduction.

111
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,300
Functioning on source slack.

112
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,660
The money should be painted black.

113
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,180
The leak from space that stole your balls.

114
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,380
Will soon come back and take it all.

115
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,960
Return to slack, return to bars.

116
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,500
Repent slack off and quit your jobs.

117
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,960
The smoke of the BCR.

118
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,560
Bob hungry.

119
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,180
Lick and throbbing,

120
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,000
day to the slave.

121
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,480
Now you're sleeping like a babe.

122
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,040
Bob will be up to keep on the job.

123
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,520
Guys be talking with the UFO in his garage.

124
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,520
I cut my finger on a soup can lid.

125
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,100
I got an infection and it spread to my dick.

126
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,160
It swelled up to the size of a human head.

127
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,820
And then a mouth opened on it.

128
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,840
And this is what it said.

129
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,220
It said to kill the pink boys.

130
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,260
Quit your job.

131
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,360
Mock the world.

132
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,760
And worship Bob Dobbs.

133
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,860
We'll build a ship and take a trip.

134
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,900
Come on and get a pen, write the coordinates.

135
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,600
Three and a half months in my garage.

136
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,220
Tearing parts off of old used cars.

137
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,560
My grind at this point was unusually large.

138
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,980
It would occasionally hum while smoking cigars.

139
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,340
Our project was finished.

140
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,500
The ship would hold twenty.

141
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,900
The power source was anything you could think was funny.

142
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,820
It's lackless, they're hapless.

143
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,120
Our birth proof is worth it.

144
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,360
Escaping a stark mix.

145
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,180
On our way to Planet X for sex and rex next.

146
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,720
The very sweet Harry Potter money shot iconic walk.

147
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,500
It's an all-haas hour of bonanza.

148
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,880
It's like a world without Tony Danza.

149
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,960
A fan to the pink shit that hits the charts.

150
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,340
In a world of dead hearts, I believe in this lobotomy and sodomy.

151
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,860
We take a moment and we pause to reflect on the pinks that we killed in the planet that they wrecked.

152
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,380
We laugh like banshees and howl like Karanjis.

153
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,940
We're victory-digging in our under-oos and canyons.

154
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,540
Our fantasy is a reality.

155
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,140
Earth turns to dust.

156
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,680
Planet X are but for us.

157
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,860
Depress the eddy blood that flows in your veins.

158
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,200
Let the froth-pot-pot breathe slack like rain.

159
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,700
Let Bob control what's left of your brain.

160
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,040
Oh yeah, send all your money to the Reverend Island stand.

161
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,460
Depress the eddy blood that flows in your veins.

162
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,800
Let the froth-pot-pot breathe slack like rain.

163
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,320
Bob control what's left of your brain.

164
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,680
Oh yeah, send all your money to the Reverend Island stand.

165
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,640
Planet X are but for us.

166
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,640
The El Queso All-Stars, my friends.

167
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,480
I love that song, especially the ending.

168
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,640
And there's a lot more of their music at www.mp3.com

169
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,780
slash El Queso All-Stars.

170
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,860
El Queso All-Stars.

171
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,740
But let's get back to X Day.

172
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,580
Dave, what else do you remember?

173
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,500
There were a number of weird sightings and things going on.

174
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,700
As usual, and I even told Reverend Toth as we were walking off to have his friend try and bite my foot.

175
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,580
Or no, to get some oil and stuff.

176
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,840
There was a huge X in the sky.

177
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,720
Again? When?

178
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,140
It was around about an hour before the gig and that Friday night.

179
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,340
Before you guys played?

180
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,080
Right, as I was off to oil land, Toth pointed up the sky and said, look at that X.

181
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,240
And I thought, that's stupid.

182
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,820
And I looked and there was a perfect huge X of two planes crossing.

183
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:51,720
That was a lot more impressive the first day in 1998 at 7 a.m. when there was a giant X in the sky.

184
00:07:51,720 --> 00:08:02,720
Now, it's like, well, how come there weren't four big X's to match four X days since we've been let down four times in a row on this so-called destruction of all the universe?

185
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,480
Bob!

186
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,940
Why would there be an X at any time, though?

187
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,280
Just think, you know, your synchronicity cabbage is not correctly hued.

188
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,000
Your monster is gone asleep.

189
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,320
I'll tell you why there's an X.

190
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:21,060
Because the conspiracy jet airplanes make those X's so that the satellites can have a, they have a, that's the way they keep the maps.

191
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,480
The coordinates.

192
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,200
The maps and the coordinates.

193
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:22,560
Right.

194
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,460
To track the disease germs and so forth that they spray with those big X's.

195
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,540
That's the hit spot then.

196
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:34,180
In other words, your mark, as they used to say in the final career of sociopathic acting.

197
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,500
What?

198
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:35,500


199
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:35,900
Bob!

200
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,280
Bob!

201
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:36,800
Bob!

202
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,260
Bob!

203
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:37,880
Bob!

204
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,300
Bob!

205
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:38,720
Bob!

206
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:38,940
Bob!

207
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,180
Bob!

208
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:40,200
Bob!

209
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,640
Bob!

210
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:40,820
Bob!

211
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:40,980


212
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,080
Bob!

213
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,060
Bob!

214
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,760
Bob!

215
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,100
Bob!

216
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,100


217
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,400
Bob!

218
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:54,400


219
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:54,400


220
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:54,400


221
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:54,400


222
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:54,400


223
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:54,400


224
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,480
Bob!

225
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,700
What's that mean?

226
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,340
paogleæ

227
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,760
There's no way you can trap the world's mostottles and do shit like that about a man, right, or a person, and try to prune a manPoint

228
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,980
You sooner than you've ever done.

229
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,440
You saw the light of him, eh?

230
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,280
I'm just trying to see what you'rehistorykick to it.

231
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,280


232

I've set up a Bush I can similar Isữa toRIID IELа participant in PubgComic callhumre

Don't, don't, don't, don't you, you, you, you, you believe it

Thank you.

279
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,760
There's a new rule for the pagans this year.

280
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,240
We like to call them pay and pay again.

281
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,740
All pagans must pay twice to get into the subgenius festival.

282
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,660
Please don't feed the pagans.

283
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:35,620
I like when you're walking by the pagans and they're like peeing or like jacking off in their cage.

284
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:36,780
Meeeeee.

285
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,460
Even their own shit.

286
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,420
Hi, how are you?

287
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,280
Hi, how are you?

288
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,540
Yeah, I have a question for Reverend Stang.

289
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,040
Yeah?

290
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:54,940
Okay, I've heard about all these alien sex goddesses that are supposed to service the subgeniuses after the world blows up.

291
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,260
Yeah, yeah.

292
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,600
Yeah, I just have a question about them.

293
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,000
Next year.

294
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,200
That has been delayed just slightly apparently.

295
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,220
It is a riddle darker than it is being discussed right now.

296
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:04,780
What was the question?

297
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:09,280
Well, I'm just trying, well, I mean, what if you're a female subgenius?

298
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,260
Do you get an alien sex goddess?

299
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,160
Or what if you're a gay or lesbian subgenius?

300
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:21,560
What kind of a sexist are you to distinguish between these so-called human genders?

301
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,100
You may have any procreative special you like.

302
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,660
Hey man, it's a goddess.

303
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,800
You may have a cigar in your butt.

304
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,740
It could be a cigar in your butt.

305
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,500
It could be you.

306
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,720
It could be a mirror.

307
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,700
It could be your right hand.

308
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,980
Sometimes I change into all sorts of people for you, baby.

309
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,900
I'm so glad when you do that too, baby.

310
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,640
I know.

311
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,120
When you're the third person from the left is where the way I like it the best.

312
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,980
You don't understand, man.

313
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:49,340
The subgenius babes are more manly than pink men.

314
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,080
Baby, what kind of question is that?

315
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,100
It's not a question.

316
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,400
It's a demand against us.

317
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,540
You don't question the word of Bob.

318
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,940
You just don't question it.

319
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,280
No question.

320
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,720
What kind of a religion do you think this is?

321
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,560
Some rationalist, humanist, logical thing where two plus two equals four?

322
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,080
I'm sorry.

323
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,260
This ain't that kind of religion because this is the kind of religion that works, damn it.

324
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,400
And you can't use it.

325
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:15,200
You can't mess it up with logic and your serious so-called sciences and philosophies.

326
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,020
It works all night and you wouldn't understand, man.

327
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,620
No, how could you understand, especially dressed the way you are?

328
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,340
Your mother is ashamed of you and your father has desecrated our own graves.

329
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:24,460
Hold on a second.

330
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,840
I've got to go drink cranberry juice.

331
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,340
These holy stones which you're standing and defecating on now are the remnants of a past,

332
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,720
past ancient empire.

333
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,760
Ah, my heart throbs in my little teeny tiny bird chest when I think of it.

334
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,260
Of course, my brain says,

335
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:39,860
Oh, thanks, guys.

336
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,460
The stems are being sucked into me.

337
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:49,300
And now, friends, Reverend Armand Gettin, live at 4X8 with Saint Anne on the keyboard.

338
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,680
Good day, Harry.

339
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,060
Woo!

340
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,220
Hello, hello, hello.

341
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,560
Where'd you all put your monkeys?

342
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,280
I see them all out there.

343
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,860
Monkeys!

344
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,020
All fucking monkeys!

345
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,020
Woo-hoo!

346
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,720
Woo-hoo!

347
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,120
Woo-hoo!

348
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:07,700
Woo-hoo!

349
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:07,780
Woo-hoo!

350
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:07,860


351
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,080
Woo-hoo-hoo!

352
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,640
Woo-hoo!

353
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,520
Woo-hoo!

354
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,220
Woo-hoo!

355
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:15,740
Ah!

356
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:15,740


357
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,480
He's a vector fax cop.

358
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,380
What the fuck's a vector fax cop?

359
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:17,740
Billy!

360
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:17,820
Willie, are you a veteran?

361
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:17,820


362
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,540
You know, there were a lot of people who found out Brad Pitt was in the fac- club.

363
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,140
And they—

364
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:25,180
I hear a lot of people says that, oh, the church of the sub genius, they're just like

365
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,740
escribal .

366
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,780
It's just like a ficlub.

367
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,080
But if not, it's because of ficlub they fucking did something!

368
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,060
Yeah.

369
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,680
I had to go see him-

370
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:37,680


371
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,720
Oh, my notes are...

372
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,600
You know, I don't know how long it's been since I've seen

373
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,720
a mob spray-painted under a bridge

374
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,680
or on the side of the road or on a high school.

375
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,900
That fucking sucks.

376
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,220
You people, you don't know how to recruit.

377
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,160
Keep recruiting for bobs.

378
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,280
More women!

379
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,580
And more women!

380
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,220
Man, fuck, it's not that hard.

381
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,560
You just gotta do something.

382
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,300
Fuck does not equal laziness.

383
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,700
I mean, how hard is it to go to Kiko's

384
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,900
and print up 100 bobhead flyers and just post them?

385
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,780
I remember the days when old flag ruled Houston.

386
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,020
Everything ended up on old flag.

387
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,260
Not just the old flag.

388
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:35,260


389
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:35,720
Not just the old flag.

390
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,860
It's the fuck one.

391
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,540
We should be running the worldwide web.

392
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,460
All in the talk shows.

393
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,760
Start your own TV show.

394
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,680
Do you know how easy it is to start your own TV show

395
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,620
on cable access?

396
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,380
Under $50.

397
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:56,920
Easy.

398
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,100
Easy.

399
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,820
Because I like my club.

400
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,280
The first rule of the church of the subgenius is

401
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,020
to always talk about bob.

402
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:10,700
Yeah!

403
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,240
The second rule.

404
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,100
Is to always fucking talk about bob.

405
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,640
Recruit, recruit, recruit.

406
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,420
I cannot stress that enough.

407
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,760
If only 1% of America were subgenius,

408
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,180
that would be over two and a half million.

409
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:35,260
That would be over two and a half million.

410
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:35,260


411
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:35,260


412
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,200
I'm the most subgenius!

413
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:36,760
Yeah!

414
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,040
Because, folks, I don't know a little with you here.

415
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,180
We're not about quality, we're about quantity.

416
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,840
It's all about volume, volume, volume.

417
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,300
The more subgenius, the better.

418
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,720
You know that Jesus works a conspiracy job because he fucking has to?

419
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,540
It sucks! I work a fucking conspiracy job!

420
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,560
You are a conspiracy!

421
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,660
You're out of your house, boys.

422
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,860
The fuck do you care?

423
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,300
I swear to God.

424
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:27,480
X-Day, X-Day, Sidney, bigger than Starwood, bigger than Burning Man, whatever the fuck that is.

425
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,400
Bigger than the fucking Super Bowl!

426
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,440
People make me sick.

427
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,540
I'll tell you why we're still on Earth.

428
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,940
We're still on, we're still on Earth.

429
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:50,120
Because the fucking crop is not worth reaping yet!

430
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:59,700
All in one, I don't even want one percent of America, a half a percent, one million subgenius, is that so much?

431
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,240
Is that so much?

432
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:01,620
No!

433
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,100
It's so...

434
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,100
Listen.

435
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,340
I have a homework assignment for all of you.

436
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,440
Everyone here.

437
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,240
Next X day.

438
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,380
Because there will be a next one.

439
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,140
Hopefully the last, but probably not.

440
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,720
Because you're all a bunch of slackers.

441
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,880
Next X day.

442
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,200
Bring a friend.

443
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,660
Bring a friend who's never been to X day.

444
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,520
It will instantly fill up all the population.

445
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,280
You keep that up.

446
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,280
And what was the percentage of the law there?

447
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,760
We will have one million sub-GAs by 2010.

448
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,680
One million sub-GAs.

449
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,560
We won't need Russia.

450
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,280
We'll need the entire fucking upstate New York.

451
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,300
We'll be a state of sub-GAs.

452
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,000
Can you imagine a Coney Island calendar?

453
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,300
A 52-week Coney Island calendar.

454
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:21,740
That's all.

455
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,380
52 weeks.

456
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,700
Two for every week.

457
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,480
Two for every week.

458
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,640
Two for every week.

459
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,340
That's all I have for you.

460
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,040
Not that you're going to pay attention

461
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,000
or all of it, whatever.

462
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:39,740
Next thing.

463
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,420
You're not going to pay attention.

464
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,280
Look at that!

465
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,900
It's going to be real!

466
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,340
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi!

467
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,200
Hello, everyone.

468
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,220
I talked to you last year

469
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,060
and I yelled.

470
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,260
I screamed.

471
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,080
I'm not going to do that this year.

472
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,620
Last year I was ranting

473
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,820
in favor of stress

474
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,720
against slack.

475
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,400
This year, I'm ranking against sex.

476
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:14,340
And I'm going to be revealing DNA's plan for you, and you, and you, and all of you.

477
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,340
Not a pretty picture.

478
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,560
Now, you've got to ask, why rank against sex?

479
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,560
Why rank against DNA?

480
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,320
There isn't anything you can do.

481
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,000
It feels good to do it.

482
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,260
It's like a frat boy just giving that good, beefy, pink chuckle.

483
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,920
Yeah, man.

484
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,580
You know, don't go along with it.

485
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,020
Take a look at that gift horse's mouth.

486
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,460
Doesn't it smell like a rat?

487
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,060
Isn't there something there?

488
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,420
Hmm, maybe DNA is not our friend.

489
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,700
I don't know.

490
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,180
Anytime.

491
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,500
I'm being pushed into something.

492
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,540
I get nice and stubborn.

493
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,940
I dig at my feet.

494
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,880
I don't want to go any further.

495
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,460
Until the feedback stops.

496
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,300
I'm going to tell you something.

497
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,440
Some conclusions I've come to about sex.

498
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,360
About DNA.

499
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,280
About the pull.

500
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,440
This is the pull of DNA.

501
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,200
The Pavlovian ring.

502
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,740
The deep animal sound.

503
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,880
Sexy, ain't it?

504
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,940
When the sex surge.

505
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,660
Kicks into gear.

506
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,740
The human polarity.

507
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:31,640
Switches.

508
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,060
North becomes south.

509
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,280
South becomes north.

510
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,340
When that happens, mental thinking stops here.

511
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,840
Continues in the smaller brain below.

512
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,060
Yes, humans have two brains just like the brontosaurus.

513
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,480
And I don't mean the apatosaurus.

514
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,800
I mean the brontosaurus.

515
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,140
They took away our brontosaurus.

516
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,720
But I know they're still out there.

517
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,040
Various symptoms of this switch in polarity.

518
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:56,980


519
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,220
Tunnel vision.

520
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,960
The bees in the head.

521
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,100
The red shift in the color.

522
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,660
Sweat.

523
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,240
Steam.

524
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,300
You know, you act like the cartoon wolf in the nightclub.

525
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,660
All the Tex Avery-isms.

526
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:15,180
The loss of inhibitions.

527
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:19,720
And the ease with which the money can be extracted from the victim.

528
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,060
The highly suggestible nature.

529
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,700
This is all small brain thinking.

530
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,700
It robs the higher thinking.

531
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,680
This is not necessarily a good thing.

532
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,060
Let's move on.

533
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,060
DNA's plan for you.

534
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,940
DNA isn't concerned about you as an individual.

535
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,220
Doesn't give a damn.

536
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,180
Doesn't give a damn about population explosion.

537
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,960
Doesn't give a damn about anything other than marching forward.

538
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,680
And you only get to make a couple of those footsteps before you're out there.

539
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:56,680


540
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:56,680


541
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:56,680


542
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,260
You're out of the picture.

543
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,380
DNA wants you to be born.

544
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,620
Grow up.

545
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,520
Fuck.

546
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:02,940
Reproduce.

547
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,960
And die.

548
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,200
Yes, die.

549
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:11,340
DNA doesn't want you to do anything after you've given birth and raised that kid up a little bit.

550
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,620
You're out of the picture.

551
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,940
DNA turns off the healing in your cells.

552
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,820
So that you can't fight cancer anymore.

553
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,360
You can't fight the infections.

554
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,360
You stop repairing yourself from within.

555
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,160
Does that sound like a good thing to you?

556
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,860
Does that sound like your friend there?

557
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,220
Is DNA your friend?

558
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,000
No.

559
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:37,820
No, it wants to call that bell that the magnetic forces shift to the little brain.

560
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,260
Oh, gotta get out there.

561
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,660
Gotta get some of that tail.

562
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,660
That poontang.

563
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,980
Excuse my expressions.

564
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,980
This is not something that one would choose.

565
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,620
But we don't have any choices.

566
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,200
We are crack babies on DNA.

567
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:02,420
We have this tingler inside of each and every cell twisting us to its whims.

568
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,560
This is not a beneficial thing.

569
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,100
This is not progress with an end product in line.

570
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,940
This is just a mad beast stumbling forward.

571
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:16,080
It doesn't care if the creature it evolves into is any good.

572
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,820
It'll keep going.

573
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,240
And maybe that's the strength here.

574
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,280
DNA loves mutations.

575
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,780
Maybe that is our strength.

576
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,680
Because you, and you and you and you, all you people here, you are mutations.

577
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,600
That's obvious.

578
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:38,900
Like Reverend Stang was telling you, if you weren't fucked up, you wouldn't be here.

579
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,300
But that is our strength.

580
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,660
So how can we fight DNA?

581
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,800
I mean, how can we disengage this automatic urge?

582
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,320
This animal call to breeding?

583
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,520
Those are all good ideas.

584
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,780
There's self abuse.

585
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,860
There's abstinence.

586
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,800
Purity of essence.

587
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,960
Peace on earth.

588
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,500
All in all, you're just another prick in the hole.

589
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,540
You can turn gay.

590
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,020
Castration.

591
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:16,880
Heaven's gate.

592
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,460
No.

593
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,200
Terence McKenna and his brothers.

594
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,780
And his brothers.

595
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:30,920
He used to think that, well, when they were on mushrooms once, they heard this great insect sound of a higher intelligence, they thought.

596
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,840
And it made a certain vibratory sound.

597
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:50,580
He thought, and they tried to put this into action, that if you could get high enough on mushrooms, bellow out this sound as strongly as you could, it would unlock your DNA and let the mushroom molecules bond with the DNA.

598
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,740
Did it work?

599
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,100
Not yet.

600
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:53,960
Not yet.

601
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,580
That's not to say that it won't work.

602
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,480
You gotta hit that note just right.

603
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,000
And even so, what then?

604
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,980
What happens when the human being is bonded with a mushroom?

605
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,080
Where do we go from there?

606
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,540
Mushroom god!

607
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:09,600
Horseshit!

608
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:10,860
Horseshit!

609
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,940
Sounds good to me.

610
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,720
But that's the thing I'm trying to encourage.

611
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:20,180
We've got to get in there on a cellular level and disengage this thing.

612
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:20,560
So you can do a little bit of a countdown.

613
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:20,560


614
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:20,560


615
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:20,560


616
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:20,560


617
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:20,560


618
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:20,560


619
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:20,560


620
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:20,560


621
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:24,780
Now, I know, I sound like a crank up here.

622
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,800
Don't believe me, do your own experiments, keep your eyes open.

623
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:36,420
But I tell ya, I'd rather be a big crank than a little cocky. Thank you.

624
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,680
Say Barnes-Lerner, dear friend!

625
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:52,660
I'm a frog watcher. I'm gonna be the number one frog watcher around here.

626
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:58,440
You must be one of the hierarchy, I've heard of them, they're the famous subgeniuses.

627
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,320
Are they naked yet? I heard they were deformed.

628
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,640
Where are the frogs for me to watch? I'm a frog watcher, like Dr. Lagoon said.

629
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:22,460
Oh, oh, oh, oh, there's not much ammunition for a frog watcher here, Jesus.

630
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,140
There's nothing but naked, ugly men.

631
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:31,960
Go ahead. Be spectacled, naked men.

632
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,300
Bless the frog watchers.

633
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:34,300


634
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,680
I pray that he may someday become a tadpole.

635
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:41,740
Bless the pornographer.

636
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,000
Bless the bootleg pornographer.

637
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,360
Bless the pervert.

638
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,820
You are all unclean.

639
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,700
I'm not touching you without protective garments.

640
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:03,060
In the presence of the Lord, Reverend Ivan Stang himself, and Ed Strange the Baptist.

641
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:13,540
You are here to be cleansed of your sins, so that you may sin more.

642
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:19,720
Reverend John, have you been unclean? Have you sinned against man, God, and nature?

643
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,500
Of course.

644
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,800
Are you okay with that?

645
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,260
Yes.

646
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:22,940
Praise God.

647
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,780
Are you prepared for the preachers to wash away all the sins of the world?

648
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,600
I am.

649
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,160
Do you reject the spares seen all these away?

650
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,020
Absolutely.

651
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:38,500


652
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,380
.

653
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,140
.

654
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,180
.

655
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:44,740
.

656
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,060
.

657
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:45,100
.

658
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:45,100


659
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:45,100


660
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:45,100


661
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:45,120
.

662
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,540
.

663
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,000
.

664
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,040
.

665
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,040


666
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,160
.

667
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:46,180
.

668
00:33:59,160 --> 00:33:59,800
.

669
00:33:59,800 --> 00:33:59,800


670
00:33:59,800 --> 00:33:59,880
.

671
00:33:59,880 --> 00:33:59,880


672
00:33:59,880 --> 00:33:59,880


673
00:33:59,880 --> 00:33:59,880


674
00:33:59,880 --> 00:33:59,880


675
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,300
.

676
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,180
.

677
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,660
.

678
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:15,960
.

679
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,400
.

680
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:16,420
.

681
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:16,520
.

682
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,640
.

683
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:25,020
papers that I'd read. I thought of Arnold Palmer and his bleeding head. I thought of all my

684
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:31,820
brethren and France that they'd shared. I thought of all these things and wondered if I cared.

685
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:40,020
I pondered for a while. I pondered through the night. By the next morning, I decided they were

686
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,920
right. We got France elections in a white array.

687
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:06,140
I felt so relieved. It really was a rush. I am so happy that I'm a subgenius.

688
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:12,600
I'm tired of playing normal and following the herd. I awoke the next day.

689
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:18,880
To go and spread the word. The people that I talked to, they acted all afraid.

690
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:25,680
They won't even listen unless they're getting paid. I really do hate them,

691
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:31,800
these things of which I speak. They pointed and they laughed. They said I was a freak.

692
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:40,980
This is I, so socialize. Open up your ears and clean out your eyes.

693
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,680
Who's in the world? Do you want to?

694
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,060
Fight. It's against the system. We should unite.

695
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,340
Fight, fight, fight, fight.

696
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,440
Fight, fight, fight, fight.

697
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:57,520
Now I sit here thinking about everything I've said. I really am a folly. My face is turning red.

698
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:06,140
I thought I was finished. I wondered what to do. Ready to give it up. I didn't have a clue.

699
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,360
Then it all came to me. I really should have known.

700
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,760
There are so many like me.

701
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,480
I'm really not alone.

702
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:18,880
I found others like me with whom I could convert.

703
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,840
One thing that's so genius will rule this universe.

704
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,120
No!

705
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:36,160
Yes, I am a body. I don't care if it's true.

706
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:40,360
Yes, I am a body. There's nothing you can do.

707
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,800
I don't care if you like me.

708
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,640
It means nothing to me.

709
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,800
Bodies are here to stay and someday you will be.

710
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:53,240
I spent my thirty bucks. I got my medicine card.

711
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,640
My husband's a nephar and it wasn't all that hard.

712
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:01,840
I'll start my own ministry and it will be the first.

713
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:06,180
Bodies are not so bad. We really are not cursed.

714
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,620
I'm a genius. I'm a genius. I'm a genius.

715
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,560
I'm a genius.

716
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:19,020
So now you know my story. There's nothing I've left out.

717
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:23,140
I've tried to tell the truth of what it's all about.

718
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,480
Yes, I am a body and proud to say it's so.

719
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:31,800
Yes, I am a body and a black of dynamo.

720
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:36,140
I am a true yeti and yes, it makes me proud.

721
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,380
I am a so genius and I'll say it out loud.

722
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,640
I don't care much for pink and the things that they say.

723
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:48,940
The Church of the Genius will soon have its day.

724
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:00,060
Evangelop, how was your ex day in general?

725
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:04,760
I mean, considering the fact that our religion is once again shot down,

726
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,920
proved to be a bunch of malarkey, a false prophecy.

727
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,520
A sham.

728
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,540
A sham of two paradiddles of a squam.

729
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,880
An old stinky haddock of a religion.

730
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,060
And you had a good time anyway?

731
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:23,180
A dried, greasy fried old fish that's been on the line for some twenty, twenty twenties.

732
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,780
We met this sketchy guy on the way home.

733
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,140
Yeah.

734
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:33,260
Our first contact, our last contact with people outside of Brushwood before we got to Brushwood was a policeman who pulled us over.

735
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:39,480
And then our first contact with people outside of Brushwood after we left was this guy.

736
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:44,740
In the back of, he was in this car that was very expensive and he had a cigarette and he said,

737
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,720
Can I please have a light?

738
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,100
And he said it in the most hushed voice he could possibly use.

739
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,160
And he goes, can I have a light?

740
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,180
And I'm like, okay, hold on a second.

741
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,040
I went to get him a light and we were wearing our cute little nineteen year old, twenty two year old clothes.

742
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,580
And he was gonna kill us.

743
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,880
How exciting for me.

744
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,560
He was probably from the Blue Heron Festival.

745
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:08,000
He said it so hushed in a low, low voice that, and then he said, and then he said to us, um,

746
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,820
Do you want to come to a hotel?

747
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,980
Because I'm going with the man in the car next to me.

748
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,020
Oh, he was trying to get you to go to a hotel.

749
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:18,860
And Dan too.

750
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,560
Young, young, innocent looking Dan and you.

751
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,280
I think in his head he wanted us to be the two young kids in the corner watching.

752
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,960
Ah, but only in his head.

753
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,600
You don't understand.

754
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:36,720
His head is such a small place and your car and the motel room and the whole arena is such a huge place.

755
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,980
I'm kind of surprised you didn't know that.

756
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:37,980


757
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,760
You didn't go with him and then kill him and suck his brains out.

758
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,100
Yeah.

759
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,820
And rob him and send us the money.

760
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,940
What kind of a subgenius are you?

761
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,900
Or eat the money and send us the brains for crying out loud.

762
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,800
A very, very frightened one.

763
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,000
There were two of you.

764
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:54,360
I want to love you ever since the baby died frightened.

765
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,740
Well, just so long as Dan did not soil his panties from fright as he saw.

766
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,580
Dan, the baby died frightened.

767
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,920
Dan was just sort of like chill and very cool with the situation.

768
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,720
The dead baby in the sink.

769
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,360
Ah.

770
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,240
My mama says that the baby is not dead.

771
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:21,320
But I think my mama is just listening to the Jesus man on the radio who sells my mom, sells my mom, sells my mom all the things.

772
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,680
She starts talking about the Jesus man on the radio and the dead baby in the sink.

773
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,600
Ah, I see.

774
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:30,020
Lone cow babe, don't you know what they're doing to yourself?

775
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,400

We were on the road

812
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,560
And there was this strange sound

813
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:27,440
It sounded like

814
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:30,520
All this

815
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:33,120
Breaking glass

816
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:36,400
That's it

817
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,440

00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,520
