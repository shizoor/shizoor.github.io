1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,660
I am seeking information about Bob. Let us see what is on the radio.

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,960
You're listening to PR News.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,000
No, I don't think I can accept that program.

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,100
Nor that one.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,820
The subgenius. Power of...

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,780
Slack.

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,860
Hey, what's going on?

8
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:44,480
Along with Bob, the pursuit of Slack, and a conspiracy of pinks, the subgenius theology includes a vision of the apocalypse.

9
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:54,300
According to church doctrine, on July 5th, 1998, when the television signal of Amos and Andy reaches the men from Planet X,

10
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,800
the aliens will arrive.

11
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,640
They will unleash their wrath upon the Earth.

12
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:03,020
And the men from Planet X are going to come down and take over Earth. They're going to...

13
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:13,460
They will put us out of our misery unless Bob can explain to them in ways that they can understand that there is something on Earth worth saving.

14
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:24,680
And only the subgenii, the dues-paying, book-buying, receipt-in-the-pocket-paid-in-full-to-the-church subgenii, have the tiniest prayer of survival.

15
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,960
The rest of them?

16
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,720
It's a tough world, Jack.

17
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,380
That's right, friends.

18
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,760
A red-letter day is coming.

19
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:40,240
And it is July 5th, year 2001.

20
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:53,640
And there the gigantic flying saucers come down out of the blue sky to pick up the happy-go-lucky subgeniuses and their pets.

21
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,060
Bluebirds.

22
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,360
And all their worldly goods.

23
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:57,660
And swallows.

24
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,360
Because, friends, you can take it with you when you're a subgenius, sure.

25
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,260
A throne of gold can be yours.

26
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:09,300
You can take off and get it on with Ba-ah-ba-ah.

27
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,600
And Dave here, who will be your driver throughout Earth space.

28
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,020
Step in. Step in, please.

29
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,040
Stand clear of the closing door.

30
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,140
Step in, please.

31
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,480
Stand clear of the closing door.

32
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,700
Red line, please, only.

33
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,220
Blue line to the left.

34
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,360
Red line to the right.

35
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:26,960
Hey, hey.

36
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:33,360
Welcome, and we'll be embarking for, well, wherever these escape vessels escape to.

37
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,600
No one's ever asked, and we're not telling.

38
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,180
What's gonna happen to your children?

39
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,720
What's gonna happen to your children?

40
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:50,780
What's gonna happen to you when this society we've created, when this society we've created, air conditioners, air conditioners, station wagons with wooden sides, station wagons with wooden sides,

41
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,440
cautious indeed, a retired actor, orange hair, orange hair, orange hair,

42
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,000
What happens when that collapses?

43
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,340
What happens when your diary was a damn well?

44
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,820
What happens when your diary was a damn well?

45
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,720
That's when the man from Planet X-9, when the man from Planet X-9,

46
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm down to save the members of the subgenius jerk.

47
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,760
I'm down to save the members of the subgenius jerk.

48
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:16,520
But until that day, the power and wisdom of Bob can help us break their mind control by activating that mutant gland that we all have within us.

49
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,640
I don't know what I feel.

50
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:20,760
I don't know what I feel.

51
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,340
I don't know what I feel this way.

52
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:28,040
I don't know if it's right or wrong to laugh at misfortune.

53
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,660
Darkness can never last too long.

54
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:43,760
Every time I think I'm falling and there's nobody around to hold me up and it seems like the world has come to an end.

55
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,180
I look up for my husband, now the face is friendly.

56
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,640
And suddenly a photo comes up in the ground.

57
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,980
The bottom of the pool is a raging fire.

58
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,220
I try to jump above it but there's no way.

59
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,760
The next thing I know, I'm going down.

60
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,780
Does it hurt?

61
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,380
Oh, it really doesn't matter.

62
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,240
Does it burn?

63
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,740
Oh, I don't feel a thing.

64
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,680
Does it stink?

65
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,260
Oh yeah, it really doesn't matter.

66
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,040
Does it hurt?

67
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,660
Oh, I don't give a damn.

68
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:19,900
When I find myself falling and I hit the bottom, it only makes me laugh.

69
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,480
It only makes me laugh.

70
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,920
When I go down the pool and I hit the bottom.

71
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:31,740
The last time that I fell in love, the love was milk and honey but the milk turned sour.

72
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:38,580
The woman became a monster and everyone I knew had become a stranger.

73
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,020
And the room went black and my luck was spent.

74
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,340
The floor opened up, down I went.

75
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,340
Does it hurt?

76
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,920
Oh, it really doesn't matter.

77
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,720
Does it burn?

78
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,240
Oh, I don't feel a thing.

79
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,140
Does it stink?

80
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,740
Oh yeah, it really doesn't matter.

81
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,560
Does it hurt?

82
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,200
Oh, I don't give a damn.

83
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,280
When I find myself falling and I hit the bottom, it only makes me laugh.

84
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,900
It only makes me laugh.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,120
When I go down the hole and I hit the bottom, it only makes me laugh.

86
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,940
It only makes me laugh.

87
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,700
It only makes me laugh.

88
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,980
It's coming at me like, it's coming at me like.

89
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,300
Just kick it out, kick it out.

90
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,940
Oh, and the ground doesn't hurt.

91
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,540
Oh, it really doesn't matter.

92
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,360
Does it burn?

93
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,920
Oh, I don't feel a thing.

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,220
I don't mind.

95
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,740
Just a little pain.

96
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,480
Oh yeah.

97
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,620
Oh.

98
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:47,180
I remember when I was a young man how everything seemed to turn against me.

99
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,460
I didn't know a soul was an alien place

100
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,700
The sun was coming by a dark cloud

101
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,940
No, I tried, I couldn't find a way to escape

102
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,960
The only way to go

103
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,560
Straight down

104
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,240
Does it hurt? Oh

105
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,880
Really doesn't matter, does it burn? Oh

106
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,240
I don't feel a thing, does it sting? Oh yeah

107
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,500
Really doesn't matter, does it hurt? Oh

108
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,080
Don't give a damn when I find myself falling

109
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,920
And I hit the bottom

110
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,660
It only makes me laugh

111
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,200
It only makes me laugh

112
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,600
When I go down the hole and I hit the bottom

113
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,460
It only makes me laugh

114
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,200
It only makes me laugh

115
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,880
It only makes me laugh

116
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,460
It only makes me laugh

117
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:36,500
I don't know why I feel this way

118
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,620
I don't know if it's right or wrong

119
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,380
To laugh in this orchard

120
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,060
Darkness can never be

121
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,820
Never last too long

122
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,300
When you laugh in this space

123
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,860
Oh yeah

124
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,860
When you laugh in this space

125
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,180
When you laugh in this space

126
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,320
I don't know why I feel this way

127
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,540
I don't know if it's right or wrong

128
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,240
To laugh in this orchard

129
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,740
Darkness can never last too long

130
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,180
When you laugh in this space

131
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,460
It only makes me laugh

132
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,240
It only makes me laugh

133
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,360
Then I combined memory with life

134
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,040
When I floor the Himalayas

135
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,660
This student said

136
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,880
My future dream is to have friends

137
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:39,880


138
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:39,880


139
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:39,880


140
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:39,880


141
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,620
Or sakthi

142
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,720
Or last night wanted to try

143
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,600
prison for harboring PR News in Washington. PR News, Washington. The alleged mastermind is still

144
00:07:51,600 --> 00:08:00,880
at large. Oh yes, dear friends, thanks Lemur for news and titles. Praise good old Danny Elfman for

145
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:08,300
that song, Only Makes Me Laugh, and praise Pope of all New York, David N. Meyer, and Professor

146
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:16,480
Chaz Smith and Lonesome Cowboy Dave and G. Gordon Gordon for that media barrage set of clips there

147
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:26,880
about X-Day. Lots more of that old media barrage-y stuff to come. We recorded hours of fun at 23 X-Day,

148
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:35,220
or more properly the 25th X-Day drill, day in and day out for a week, because we were meeting

149
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,040
virtually for our end-of-the-world ritual.

150
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:48,440
party using the Zoom app, and the sound is weird and spotty and requires a lot of editing.

151
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,540
A lot of editing. In fact, it's kind of hard to imagine getting through it all.

152
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:04,480
But we tended to get strangely informal and maybe too inside. I've removed some tedious

153
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,060
and or interesting lecturing.

154
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,980
But I'm putting it elsewhere for internet-only download.

155
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:23,100
Buddy? I don't know if you can hear Buddy barking, but this music in the background is from Captain

156
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:32,000
Blackout. Cassie Overdose, he called her. We did some kind of controlled show type things with the

157
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,180
old guard early in 23 X-Day, but much more of it was open.

158
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,440
And we're gonna get into some of those things in a little bit.

159
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:42,940
And I think that it's going to be a lot of fun.

160
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:49,400
And we'll get into those recordings soon. But for now, it's the calm old guy stuff with Dr. Howell,

161
00:09:49,440 --> 00:10:01,100
Uncle Onan Canabite, Dr. Philodrumond, Piss Baptist John Shirley, Moda Mack, and host Professor Pressure.

162
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:08,280
I've never seen that behavior before but that's always why I went to X-Day, you know? I always went there.

163
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,960
see people do this. I've never seen that

164
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,160
before. That's why I went

165
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,760
to X Day.

166
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,460
So now I can say

167
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,580
this was the X Day that I

168
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,920
saw Johnny. When I was a young boy

169
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,880
they said you should go to X Day

170
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,300
if you want to see that stuff.

171
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,120
Hey, did you ever hear about the Stark Fist?

172
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,020
Well, I got

173
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,040
something to tell you.

174
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,300
Yes.

175
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,380
Milo's granddad

176
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,240
told him all about subgenius.

177
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,740
The lush fist.

178
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,140
Look him out behind the woodshed.

179
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,360
The nice fist of approval.

180
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,540
Yeah.

181
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,220
The nice open palm of approval.

182
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,520
Which you cross

183
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,400
with silver.

184
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,220
And then you have to show to

185
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,240
buy and sell in the marketplace.

186
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,680
For the first time I realized

187
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,560
what the meat I had seen below

188
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,300
might be.

189
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,480
What else could it be?

190
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,400
Frightening as the thought may be,

191
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,080
it could happen.

192
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,620
The sun will become dark.

193
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,800
The moon blood red.

194
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,740
The stars of the heavens will fall.

195
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,320
There'll be two major earthquakes

196
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,520
that are going to be coming.

197
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,480
The islands and the mountains are shaken

198
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,460
out of their sockets.

199
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,240
And the second one, no island,

200
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,600
no mountain was found in the face of the earth.

201
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,640
It's all coming.

202
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,920
Yes, I'm ready now.

203
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,120
Then close your eyes and tap your heels together three times.

204
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,020
And think to yourself,

205
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,220
there's no place like Bob.

206
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,540
And in that ship there was a Bob.

207
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,700
A rare Bob, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

208
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,060
Woo!

209
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,580
Woo!

210
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,460
Woo!

211
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,300
Woo!

212
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:16,520
Woo!

213
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:16,840


214
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,300
Bob!

215
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:17,740
Bob!

216
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:17,920
Bob!

217
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:17,940
Bob!

218
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,440
With a bob on the ship, and the ship in the air,

219
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,220
and the air through the smoke, and the smoke from the prop,

220
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,120
and the frop in the pipe, and the pipe in the grin,

221
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,040
and the grin in the Bob.

222
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,820
Bob Dobbs in the Sosaro!

223
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:27,800
Woo!

224
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,280
Woo!

225
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:28,500
Woo!

226
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:28,920
Woo!

227
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,460
Plan is to invade, to infest key men in government

228
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,740
and industry with some alien force from outer space

229
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,040
that

230
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,460
that seeps into the human body and takes over.

231
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,080
Is that more ancient literature of subgenius?

232
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,360
Yeah.

233
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,780
Yes.

234
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,720
Yeah, the only catalog.

235
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,620
Yep.

236
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,180
From a time when subgeniuses had to worry about who was eating

237
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,420
and who was being eaten.

238
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,680
It's always one or the other.

239
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,440
Eat or be eaten.

240
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,560
Our ancestors told us this truth.

241
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,020
Only the most advanced life forms get off that particular...

242
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,020
They unchained from the food chain.

243
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:07,540
Mm-hmm.

244
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,460
That's right.

245
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,160
I know who did before us were the giant cave bears,

246
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,740
who were far more intelligent than today's bears.

247
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,600
Oh, yes.

248
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,600
And some of them, it seems, died of natural causes,

249
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,620
so-called, peacefully surrounded by their loved ones.

250
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,440
Didn't get eaten at all.

251
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,020
Mm-hmm.

252
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,900
And they were the first to achieve this.

253
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,080
Just four hours ago, I murdered two lesser creatures,

254
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,600
and we ate them for lunch, lobsters.

255
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,260
We boiled them alive.

256
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,560
Oh, my God.

257
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,600
I hate that practice.

258
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,580
Mm-hmm.

259
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:43,700
They're known to be relatively intelligent and socially, you know, evolved.

260
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,440
They're also quite delicious with butter.

261
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,200
But you're going to terrify the kids on the kitchen floor.

262
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,620
Then you boil them alive.

263
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,460
But first...

264
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,440
Bobbies are delicious, but that's another story.

265
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,020
Yeah.

266
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,520
What if there is a form of life in space,

267
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,260
not on some planet, but just drifting?

268
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,580
Not life as we know it, with intelligence, yes,

269
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,140
but pure energy with no organic structure,

270
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:07,840
invisible.

271
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,380
Invisible?

272
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,000
Now, the rocket passed through its path.

273
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,200
It entered the rocket.

274
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,440
It found living specimens of our form of life.

275
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,700
Cell organisms, human.

276
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,360
Exactly.

277
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,160
Now, if even by accident it could enter one of those structures,

278
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,640
what a way to invade the Earth.

279
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,540
Now, look, sir, I'm not over-intelligent, but will you...

280
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,800
You saw the film, you know what happened.

281
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,180
Only God knows where and how far that rocket traveled.

282
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,680
Something got into that rocket, and it's found other forms of life.

283
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,000
The cactus.

284
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:36,920
Good.

285
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:37,520
Great.

286
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,720
You mean Kurozik?

287
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,400
The cactus.

288
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,020
He's now in the shell of a man being transformed.

289
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,060
If one of these cactus plants were subject to the same mutation,

290
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,080
there could be an affinity, a union between plant and animal,

291
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,420
with the ability to destroy,

292
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,420
and possess,

293
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,940
and multiply.

294
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,020
An alien cannot invade a dead man.

295
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,060
We're merely using this corpse for demonstration of placement.

296
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,620
From PR News in Washington,

297
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,280
I'm trying to murder former housing secretaries in several states,

298
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,420
and in Arizona, retiring Senator Paul Sarbanes plummeted to Earth.

299
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,620
Wall Street down 4 off 9.

300
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,060
This is PR News.

301
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:25,480
President Bush is calling on voters to intensify their resistance against the United States

302
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,500
after an unclaimed black-backberry pack spoke to PR News in Washington.

303
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,900
The Earth is a black hole.

304
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,780
The Earth is a black hole.

305
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,100
The Earth is a black hole.

306
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,500
America goes down

307
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,140
Here we are on X

308
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,780
Motherfucking eggs!!!

309
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,120
Eggs!

310
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,340
Eggs!!!

311
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,200
X LOL

312
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,500
※ bid é

313
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,660
EXPL passou

314
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:03,860
I don't think you want to record us but if you do want to,

315
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,860
I could bring my...

316
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,780
What should I call it?

317
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,340
Trisand.

318
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,820
I'm happy with not recording us.

319
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,060
Let's just audio record.

320
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,280
We can be seen by the people on Zoom.

321
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,960
We can be seen by the people on Zoom.

322
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,860
They can see us.

323
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,700
We can see them.

324
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,560
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

325
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,100
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

326
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,320
Happy X Day.

327
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,100
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy.

328
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,820
Happy X Day, motherfuckers.

329
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,820
Happy X Day, subgenius.

330
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,860
Are you a subgenius?

331
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,760
Are you really?

332
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,320
Are you really?

333
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,460
Did you pay your dues this year?

334
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:36,920
So.

335
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:37,740
I want to know.

336
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,140
Got to pay that entry fee.

337
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,680
Got to pay that entry fee to the salsa ship.

338
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,600
To the salsa ship.

339
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,320
The salsa ship that's taking us away.

340
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,220
Taking us away.

341
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,860
Take me away.

342
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,140
Ha, ha.

343
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,720
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

344
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,140
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

345
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,600
Ever-important.

346
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,680
Ya put these together.

347
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:23,680


348
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:23,680


349
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,600
And the preachyоС axes won't just tell you

350
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:24,600


351
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:24,640
I'll get you with it.

352
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:24,640


353
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:24,640


354
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:24,640


355
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,060
I was meant to say hello

356
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,060


357
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,280
like of class Boston.

358
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:25,600
I miss SSA.

359
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,040
Well, it was really good to do it with him.

360
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:29,720
You're welcome.

361
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:29,720


362
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:29,720


363
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:29,720


364
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:29,720


365
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,120
You love me.

366
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,120


367
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,120


368
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,720
I don't have one.

369
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,020
Speaker and budget.

370
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,460
meantime

371
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,160
in the meantime

372
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,020
we're gonna

373
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:45,720
rock out

374
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,760
until that

375
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,620
salsa ship

376
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,200
comes

377
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,820
and takes

378
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,740
us away

379
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,520
oh you can't

380
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,380
imagine how it

381
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:10,960
makes my old

382
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,860
ticker sore

383
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,780
like a hawk

384
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,820
to hear young

385
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,880
doctors doing

386
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,560
doctor music

387
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,340
like me and

388
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,020
Philo and our

389
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,660
buddies did

390
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,220
back in the

391
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:18,700
days of

392
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,860
Doctors for

393
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,500
Rotan

394
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,580
which was

395
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,660
inspired by

396
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,780
Doctors for

397
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,580
Bob in

398
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,240
Little Rock

399
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,560
where you just

400
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,380
turn on the

401
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,140
recorder and

402
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:28,640
go nuts

403
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,680
that was the

404
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,600
Sub G

405
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,240
Kids

406
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,080
the Sub G

407
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,440
Kids

408
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,220
my favorite

409
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,080
new doctor band

410
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,260
which is saying

411
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:37,980
something because

412
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,500
I normally

413
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,300
hate doctor

414
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:39,640
bands

415
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,200
we'll hear

416
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,900
lots more

417
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,800
new doctors

418
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,040
in the future

419
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,420
but for now

420
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,200
we must make

421
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,740
do with the

422
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,420
old doctors

423
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,620
still in the

424
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,360
first hour

425
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:50,900
of the first

426
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,380
day of the

427
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,300
first Zoom

428
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,940
X day on

429
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,220
July 1st

430
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:55,720
of the so

431
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,080
called

432
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,080
2020

433
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,280
wherein we

434
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,140
refer to the

435
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,960
video things

436
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,880
that are

437
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,160
beloved radio

438
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,460
audience cannot

439
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,100
see

440
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,880
this scene in

441
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,260
the background

442
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,180
behind me now

443
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,200
is the way

444
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,740
real X days

445
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:12,400
are

446
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,560
is that it

447
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:13,860
does

448
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,720
I love how

449
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,100
you can

450
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,140
like you can

451
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,760
move the

452
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,520
image like a

453
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:17,940
curtain

454
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,080
it is a

455
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,460
curtain

456
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,520
either robot

457
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,200
in the center

458
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,100
can come out

459
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,720
from inside

460
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,480
the image

461
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:24,840
I love that

462
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,660
look at that

463
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,180
that's a great

464
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:26,720
effect by

465
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,060
itself

466
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,140
it's just so

467
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:28,740
simple and

468
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,280
obvious and

469
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:29,680
I'm sure it

470
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,520
beyond the

471
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:30,900
veil

472
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,520
on the veil

473
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,480
days in the

474
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,240
past that

475
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,020
looked a lot

476
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,660
like that

477
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,980
as I recall

478
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,040
yeah

479
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,480
now this

480
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,080
way it's

481
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,240
going to

482
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:41,580
look next

483
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:41,920
year

484
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,620
now of

485
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,080
course the

486
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,000
people listening

487
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,720
to this on

488
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,160
the radio

489
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,840
don't know

490
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,360
what next

491
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,160
year this

492
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,700
is the last

493
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,080
year

494
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,280
I was saying

495
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,240
earlier that

496
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,600
that contextually

497
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,260
this is so

498
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:54,960
apocalyptic

499
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,000
Al this

500
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,860
year that

501
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,340
this could

502
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:57,960
be the

503
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,800
year except

504
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,320
the problem

505
00:20:59,320 --> 00:20:59,740
is the

506
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,760
saucers

507
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,440
will go to

508
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:01,980
the place

509
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,180
and you know

510
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:03,960
and we won't

511
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,340
be there

512
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,480
and so I've

513
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,160
left a message

514
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,440
for them to

515
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:08,680
they're going

516
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,320
to pick us

517
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,100
up with by

518
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,540
pincers which

519
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,140
will pull us

520
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:12,620
upward like

521
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,020
this

522
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:14,220
oh

523
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,840
and it will

524
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,340
be a little

525
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,120
painful but

526
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,680
it will be

527
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,180
worth it

528
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,180
greatens your

529
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,180
spine right

530
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:20,520
out

531
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,060
I just

532
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:22,840
heard it

533
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,360
make it

534
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,120
clear the

535
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,600
last terrestrial

536
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,580
year because

537
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:27,900
just like space

538
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,500
travelers

539
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,580
pretend for

540
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,520
days and

541
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,440
simulate

542
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,120
Earth's

543
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,500
wake and sleep

544
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,120
but periods

545
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,760
will have the

546
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,440
great solar

547
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:35,900
year

548
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,140
it'll actually

549
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,700
be the year

550
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,720
one yes

551
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:39,840
down here

552
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,760
this could be

553
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,220
the last

554
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:41,920
year in

555
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,060
fact and

556
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:43,940
truly is

557
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,140
the last

558
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:45,880
year of

559
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,340
man on

560
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:47,760
Earth

561
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,500
will there be

562
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:49,540
taxes

563
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,700
on the pleasure

564
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,260
saucers

565
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,420
there won't even

566
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,040
be in Texas

567
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,900
well I don't

568
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,040
know if

569
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,720
there might

570
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,240
be that

571
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,340
but it

572
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,380
depends on

573
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,560
how you

574
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,260
want to pay

575
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:02,660
and your

576
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,300
ability to

577
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:03,520
pay

578
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,640
yeah yeah

579
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:06,500
how you

580
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,500
organize the

581
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,380
things in the

582
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,080
pleasure saucers

583
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,700
but if they're

584
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,440
truly pleasure

585
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,200
saucers no

586
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,880
tax would be

587
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,220
necessary

588
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,340
there would be

589
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:13,740
you to

590
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,400
innately

591
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,100
utopian

592
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,120
effortlessly

593
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,560
there's a

594
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:18,860
heavy tax

595
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,840
there's a

596
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,380
heavy tax

597
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,040
for everyone

598
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,680
who wants

599
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,040
to pay

600
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,280
it

601
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:23,740
totally

602
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:24,740
voluntary

603
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,140
they have a

604
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:26,780
cussing jar

605
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,960
but if you're

606
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,440
hanging with

607
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,240
subgeniuses

608
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:29,780
you may find

609
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,420
it taxing

610
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,200
if you want

611
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,740
to hang up

612
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,260
a bob head

613
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:37,720
you have to

614
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,160
use tax

615
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,460
that's a

616
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,000
good point

617
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:42,980
yes

618
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,080
that's a

619
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:45,700
good point

620
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,440
Gatorade

621
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,160
there Philo

622
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:47,780
or is it

623
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,700
something else

624
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,620
yeah she

625
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,600
mysteriously

626
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,320
appeared and

627
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:53,840
vanished

628
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,320
it could be

629
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:55,960
a bottle of

630
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,680
green pea

631
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,260
or something

632
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,180
but I think

633
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,060
it is Gatorade

634
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,220
but I think

635
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,440
it's a

636
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:01,460
it's a

637
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:01,480
it's a

638
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:01,480


639
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:01,480


640
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:01,480


641
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,140
like a ghostly

642
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:03,740
apparition

643
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,240
endangered

644
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:04,620
species

645
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,080
oh

646
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,080
hey I did

647
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,300
want to

648
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:06,820
point out

649
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,600
if everyone

650
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,120
looks up

651
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,600
in the right

652
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,380
in the left

653
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:09,920
hand corner

654
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,440
there's a

655
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:10,720
little

656
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,740
icon that

657
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,380
says recording

658
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,580
and it's

659
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:13,800
red

660
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,580
so

661
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,400
if you see

662
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:16,860
that that

663
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,360
means that

664
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:17,860
the whole

665
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,260
thing is

666
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:18,900
being recorded

667
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,180
by them

668
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,600
of course

669
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,220

670
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:22,780

00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,420
managed by

674
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,120
a corporation

675
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,380
it could

676
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,060
well be

00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,820

and each

730
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,080
of those

731
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,620
in turn

732
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,580
have five

736
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,140
that

737
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,500
how many

738
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:10,880
people

739
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,480

here

742
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,080
so that

743
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,480
means

744
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,520
the mystery

745
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:17,880
of the

746
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,420
beehive

747
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,460
exactly

748
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,180
so

749
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:21,960
the

00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,880

pyramid

753
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,700
is usually

754
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,100
accurately

755
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,700
portrayed

756
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,280
inverted

757
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:28,860
because the

00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,520
subgenius

759
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,320

bottom

761
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,060

00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,700
controlling

763
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,540
all of these

764
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,040
conspiracy

765
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,700
agents

766
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,120
by what

767
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,500
we say

768
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:35,920
and do

769
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,260
you mean

770
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:37,460
the

771
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,580
is actually

772
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,800
representing

773
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,380
the church

774
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:41,600

subgenius

776
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:42,580
it might

777
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:42,900
be

778
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,860

1132
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:32,420
I'd like to make a point that these are the best kind of pretzels.

1133
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,140
These are good pretzels.

1134
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,420
Pretzels, eh?

1135
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,640
Pretzels are good.

1136
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:43,660
They're in the form of monks praying, but before that they were the pharaohic arms,

1137
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,380
when the pharaoh would be laid to rest.

1138
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,760
Oh, and now you can scare a vampire with them.

1139
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,160
They're Egyptian.

1140
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,740
This is Dobbshead.

1141
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,220
This is Dobbshead.

1142
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,800
Carrying the crook in flail.

1143
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,420
Dobbshead made out of Dobbsheads.

1144
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,940
No, it's made out of photographs of X-Day.

1145
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,420
Oh my God.

1146
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,620
Potter Nostril Divination.

1147
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:08,960
I have a picture of this.

1148
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,640
Unfortunately, it's not high res enough to be poster size.

1149
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:20,720
But it's actually made of tiny photographs of X-Day made into a Dobbshead.

1150
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,560
That was a wonderful thing.

1151
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,300
What's the program he did that with?

1152
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,420
I don't know.

1153
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,280
You'd have to ask him.

1154
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,660
Now, here's the funny thing.

1155
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:35,500
In the other room, I have a Dobbshead about as big as that one made by Potter Nostril

1156
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:41,740
from snapshots from the 1990s X-Days that he took.

1157
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:48,780
They're cut out and put together manually, not by computer.

1158
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,600
And it's huge.

1159
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,260
It's the size of that thing.

1160
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,580
It's from the early X-Days.

1161
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,220
I have a different wife in those pictures.

1162
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,080
I see you've got an original Knight of Slack poster back there.

1163
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,020
Yeah. Yeah.

1164
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,980
I don't know if it's there, but I needed something to hide that mail-out table.

1165
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,880
It was kind of unsightly.

1166
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,220
I don't always have the Bob masks on top of that.

1167
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,280
Usually it's just boxes full of buttons and little...

1168
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,840
People don't like looking at other people's mail stuff.

1169
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,260
No.

1170
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,240
I don't care about your mail stuff.

1171
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:27,740
No.

1172
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:33,640
People don't want to see an inbox or an envelope or a stamp or anything like that.

1173
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,300
I want to put my mail.

1174
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,520
I want to put my mail in your inbox.

1175
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,740
Make sure you put a stamp on it first.

1176
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,140
Don't stamp on my mail!

1177
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,300
Too late.

1178
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,440
Oof.

1179
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:52,580
I have this urge to cross my legs right now.

1180
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:59,200
So is it 4.03 p.m. in Ohio?

1181
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,380
Yes, Eastern Standard Time.

1182
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:06,460
On the coast of Coromandel where the mangoes grow?

1183
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,200
It's 4.03 all up and down the East Coast.

1184
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,560
There's a...

1185
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,680
We had an Australian guy...

1186
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,660
Now it is 4.04.

1187
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,400
It's exactly half of 8.08.

1188
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,420
An Australian.

1189
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,900
8.08 might be here later.

1190
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,520
I know Giggle Puss was interested.

1191
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,740
I've heard from dozens of people who asked me...

1192
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:30,680
I mean, I'd say at least 50 people asked me for the passwords to this thing.

1193
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,260
Did you give it up?

1194
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,820
Some of them have jobs at this time of day.

1195
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,500
Not safe for work.

1196
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,180
Not safe for work.

1197
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:42,240
There was a suggestion about jobs that I read in this pamphlet.

1198
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,440
Jobs, jobs, jobs.

1199
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,080
Well, this is...

1200
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,620
I'm actually doing my job right now.

1201
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:50,660
Yes.

1202
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,860
This is the first edition pamphlet.

1203
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,400
Oh, someone needs a pamphlet.

1204
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,220
Well, I'll pull one of those out.

1205
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,540
Oh, they need pamphlet number two also.

1206
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,260
There's pamphlet number two.

1207
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:02,360
Oh, there's pamphlet number two.

1208
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,260
What you need is a permanent link to the...

1209
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,240
What you need is a permanent link to the...

1210
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,320
...to your store, Stang.

1211
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:09,560
...to your store, Stang.

1212
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,680
Since there's no sacred swag shack here,

1213
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,280
you need a way for anybody to click on your links

1214
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:14,500
and buy stuff.

1215
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,000
It looked like you devolved into a pig man or something.

1216
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:21,620
It looked like you devolved into a pig man or something.

1217
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,340
I beg your pardon?

1218
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,840
I'm talking to Philo.

1219
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,220
He devolved into a pig man.

1220
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,540
There's nothing so tricky you can do with these things.

1221
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,780
I know pig man.

1222
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,660
You've just given me memories of this young adult novel

1223
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,720
You've just given me memories of this young adult novel

1224
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,200
that I read back in high school.

1225
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,700
I think it was called The Pig Man.

1226
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,560
The Pig Man?

1227
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,320
Yes.

1228
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:44,840
It was one of those young adult growing up type of novels.

1229
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,440
It was one of those young adult growing up type of novels.

1230
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,900
Essentially about a teenager and girl and boy

1231
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,100
Essentially about a teenager and girl and boy

1232
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:51,620
who ended up...

1233
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:55,680
Who ended up taking care of this older man

1234
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,340
Who ended up taking care of this older man

1235
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,760
who had this obsession with the pig.

1236
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,920
who had this obsession with the pig.

1237
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,720
I mean ceramic pigs, model pigs, and so forth.

1238
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,120
I mean ceramic pigs, model pigs, and so forth.

1239
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,100
A lot of people do that.

1240
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,500
They are to be pitied.

1241
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,720
William Hope Hodgson Howell would have something to say about that.

1242
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:12,940
William Hope Hodgson Howell would have something to say about that.

1243
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,960
The House of the Borderland warned us about the pig people.

1244
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:16,880
No kidding, man.

1245
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,240
That was one of the first books I ever read.

1246
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,940
I was about 10 years old.

1247
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,560
A terrifying book.

1248
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,860
That blew my mind.

1249
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:28,000
It's a mind blowing cosmic horror beyond cosmic horror.

1250
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,040
Did you read The Boatman?

1251
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,960
I read Love, The Land, and Everything.

1252
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,200
I just stumbled upon House of the Borderland.

1253
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,120
I've only read his Carnacki book also.

1254
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,540
How about The Night Land?

1255
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,040
The Night Land I found the prose unreadable.

1256
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:46,740
I'm one of those people who cannot bear that stilted, fake old English he's using in that particular book.

1257
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:50,320
Too bad because there are great monsters in that stilted, fake old English.

1258
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:50,540
Too bad because there are great monsters in that stilted, fake old English.

1259
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,820
I know it must be there.

1260
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:55,860
I just wish he had written it in some other way that was not such a conceit.

1261
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,580
I just wish he had written it in some other way that was not such a conceit.

1262
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,540
Well it's supposed to be from some reincarnated book.

1263
00:37:59,560 --> 00:37:59,700
I know.

1264
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,520
I know it is.

1265
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,460
I know it is.

1266
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,240
But it's...

1267
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,540
What about The Boats of the Glencarrig though?

1268
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,380
I haven't read it.

1269
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,740
I understand it's very...

1270
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:15,940
Terrifying marine voyage with ghastly things coming out of the ocean.

1271
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:16,360


1272
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:16,580
Terrifying marine voyage with ghastly things coming out of the ocean.

1273
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:20,720
What about The Map of Time and The Map of Space?

1274
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:20,980


1275
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,300
I don't remember the author's name but they're...

1276
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,700
Can you hear me?

1277
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,920
As if H.G. Wells...

1278
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,060
Whoever said...

1279
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,460
Can you hear me? Yes.

1280
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:34,920
...invisible man and an invasion from outer space and time travelers.

1281
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,740
...invisible man and an invasion from outer space and time travelers.

1282
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,140
And it's written in this

1283
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:38,700
attempted,

1284
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,760
florid, kind of quasi-Victorian...

1285
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:42,740


1286
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,940
H.G. Wells himself was pretty straightforward.

1287
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,740
But this thing is written in this...

1288
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,000
But this thing is written in this...

1289
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,920
forced, fucking,

1290
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,180
painful, fake Victorian way.

1291
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,560
painful, fake Victorian way.

1292
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,180
I'm surprised, John, that you haven't encountered them

1293
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,880
just because they're so bad.

1294
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,400
It's a modern writer, writes in his old style.

1295
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,980
It's a modern writer, writes in his old style.

1296
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,140
A modern writer pretending to write in

1297
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,240
1890s.

1298
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,920
You've got to watch out because the slightest usage

1299
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,120
You've got to watch out because the slightest usage

1300
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,220
can trip you up.

1301
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:16,040
It's always going to be threaded with anachronisms.

1302
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,600
Not always, if you're a very careful creator.

1303
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,060
Not always, if you're a very careful creator.

1304
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:20,740
A few people are.

1305
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:25,440
In television, when they have historical things,

1306
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,640
they're always having anachronistic terms.

1307
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,160
They're always having anachronistic terms.

1308
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,560
They're always having anachronistic terms.

1309
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,500
They're always having anachronistic terms.

1310
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:35,660
Robin Hood gets his arrow in the right place,

1311
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:35,860
Robin Hood gets his arrow in the right place,

1312
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,760
shoots the apple and goes,

1313
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,600
Yes!

1314
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,560
Yeah, exactly, stuff like that.

1315
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,980
That was awesome, Robin Hood.

1316
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,980
Yeah, that was awesome.

1317
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,720
That's the kind of thing that you see in...

1318
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,320
The story of Abraham sucks!

1319
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,320
The story of Abraham sucks!

1320
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,180
The story of Abraham sucks!

1321
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:53,840
Awesome.

1322
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,820
No, they don't research these things.

1323
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,060
It sucks donkey.

1324
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:02,280
You had that Kevin Costner Robin Hood movie

1325
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,000
where they brought in gunpowder

1326
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,220
so they could have explosions.

1327
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,260
Anyway,

1328
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:08,880
the

1329
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,600
Robin Hood

1330
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,680
legend is

1331
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:14,880
permanent.

1332
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:16,760
Yeah!

1333
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:20,140
It's embedded in my mind in some form.

1334
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,720
It is

1335
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,440
impressed on me as a child

1336
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,420
and it will never go.

1337
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,840
And Errol Flynn is Robin Hood forever.

1338
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,220
And so is Daffy Duck.

1339
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,820
We will always remember Robin Hood Daffy.

1340
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:33,680
We will always remember Robin Hood Daffy.

1341
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,420
Yes, that was also a Warner Brothers presentation

1342
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,080
which included footage from the Errol Flynn movie

1343
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:39,340
which included footage from the Errol Flynn movie

1344
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,880
in the cartoon with Daffy.

1345
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:47,700
I love that movie.

1346
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,720
Yikes! And away!

1347
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:50,900
Wham!

1348
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,360
Yikes! And away!

1349
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,620
Wham!

1350
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,380
I remember that now.

1351
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,140
That's interesting.

1352
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:29,940
Bonus what?

1353
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,360
Thank you for taking the time to watch.

1354
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:46,620
Thank you for taking the time to watch.

1355
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,500
Please take a look on the screen next.

1356
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,980
If you are wondering why,

1357
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:50,820
well,

1358
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:51,400
in Japan,

1359
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,020
the stream looks like this one.

1360
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:52,020


1361
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:52,220
from our normal levels of living.

1362
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:52,280
But still,

1363
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,400
classic Boron hymn

1364
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:55,400


1365
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:55,400


1366
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,680
The Psychoskeletons

1367
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,420
Who else? A piece called

1368
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,640
Keep Current

1369
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,340
But now, we must

1370
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,480
lift off with

1371
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,080
Chaz

1372
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,500
Knowing her fate, Atlantis sent out

1373
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,220
ships to all corners of the Earth

1374
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,100
On board were the Twelve

1375
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,240
The poet

1376
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,620
The physician, the farmer

1377
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,080
The scientist, the magician

1378
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,000
And the other so-called gods

1379
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,920
of our legends

1380
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,780
Though gods they were

1381
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,820
And as the elders of our time

1382
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,100
choose to remain blind

1383
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:43,200
Let us rejoice and let us

1384
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,220
sing and dance

1385
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,960
And there was much rejoicing and singing at X-Day

1386
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,020
But we'll have to wait another year

1387
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:50,680
Hail Atlantis

1388
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,820
Hail the sex goddesses

1389
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,800
Because they

1390
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,140
They did show up at X-Day

1391
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,460
A new day

1392
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,040
Yeah, we went over the rainbow

1393
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,500
Into the mitochondrial yeti DNA

1394
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:03,720
Level C

1395
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,020
Well, we're gonna have to go north and south

1396
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,420
And east and west

1397
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,420
And we gotta wait another year, yeah, but

1398
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,460
But we're gonna fill up a new pipe

1399
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,660
We're gonna wait for the sun to shine

1400
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,480
We're gonna turn around and take our time

1401
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:21,680
We're gonna break the seal to the other side

1402
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:23,520
You know

1403
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,740
From the valley

1404
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,900
I hear the muffled cry

1405
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,660
Of all them poor sheeple

1406
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,380
That we left behind

1407
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:35,200
And we're gonna take that next evolutionary step

1408
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,060
Yeah, we're gonna climb on those rocket ships

1409
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,280
We're gonna build the vessels if we have to

1410
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,320
We're already testing the engines

1411
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,740
We're already testing the systems needed for this trip

1412
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:47,360
We're on the ride, yeah

1413
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,700
Mitochondrial Eve

1414
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,260
Thanks for the ride

1415
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:52,140
We'll take it from here

1416
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,140
Be part of the rally

1417
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,600
She made it

1418
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,000
To Nike

1419
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:57,680
Lou's

1420
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,020
Subtitles shot on Tuesday.

1421
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:23,020
Please pikat to Kimber at Mexico City

1422
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:46,080
I was riding down Main Street in my car, a 41 underslung coupe.

1423
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,300
I was all decked out in my blue suede shoes and my hair was covered with goo.

1424
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:58,060
I was listening to my radio and waving to all the chicks when the music stopped and the newsman said...

1425
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:02,420
We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin.

1426
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:07,440
They destroyed the world, the entire Los Angeles area.

1427
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,940
Already hospital facilities have begun to crack under the strain.

1428
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:15,360
And civil defense authorities state that the situation is much the same across the entire country.

1429
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:18,040
Martial law is now nationwide.

1430
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,120
Our fellow countrymen are dying.

1431
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:26,400
The very foundations of civilization are beginning to crumble under the dread assault of that horror long feared.

1432
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:26,900
Mom?

1433
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,060
Colorado Channel, this is a class one emergency.

1434
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,080
All civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways.

1435
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,600
Stay in your homes. Stay in your homes.

1436
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,320
I got exactly what I wanted!

1437
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:41,360
I got exactly what I wanted!

1438
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:48,400
X day shall come sooner or later.

1439
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,280
That X is nothing but...

1440
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:54,120
A cross that's fallen over on its side and somebody jumped on it.

1441
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,240
Banged it up.

1442
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,760
There is hope. There shall be hope.

1443
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:04,040
You know, we sit and worry, oh gosh, if only the X's had come.

1444
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:10,600
We could have had a new government where Bob was the leader and since he's never around there'd be no laws and we can do anything we want.

1445
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:18,400
We could have had a new church where instead of having to get up with a hangover on Sunday and watch boring crap...

1446
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,020
You'd go to church Saturday.

1447
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,120
And get drunk!

1448
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,820
Drunk, my friend!

1449
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,720
Oh, we could have had our own coolness where we invented the coolness, blah blah blah blah blah.

1450
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,240
Friends, what are we waiting for?

1451
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,900
Are we really waiting on some invisible monsters in the sky?

1452
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,720
Or some space things?

1453
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:40,200
Or some pipe smoking salesman with a good line?

1454
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,820
Friends, I say, quit waiting, do it yourself!

1455
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,400
Make your own slack!

1456
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,560
Bob is not the answer.

1457
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,280
And neither is anything else.

1458
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:55,580
You must learn to think for yourself, but only Bob can show you how.

1459
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,840
Question authority or else!

1460
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:02,500
And fuck them if they can't take a joke!

1461
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,220
Praise fucking Bob!

1462
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,360
Oh, those were the days, friends.

1463
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:13,980
Oh, listen to that energy.

1464
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:18,620
And nowadays I'm too old and beat to edit anymore for this episode.

1465
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,260
So I'll end it with this one.

1466
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:28,400
This is edited by some utterly mysterious, probably much younger person or persons from the Cleveland area.

1467
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:31,740
Going by the name of Sheridan.

1468
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,540
Sheridan sent us stuff.

1469
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:37,660
This is some.

1470
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:45,160
It's a very laid back long collage piece called Adrift.

1471
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,780
Even if you're driving right now.

1472
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:50,260
Closed.

1473
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:50,260


1474
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,600
Close your eyes and slack off.

1475
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:20,920
I'm coming.

1476
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:23,620
I'll be right there.

1477
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:23,620


1478
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:24,940
Get some rest.

1479
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:24,940


1480
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:24,960
Go.

1481
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:28,220
Go.

1482
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:35,400
Take care, sir.

1483
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:35,400


1484
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:35,400


1485
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:35,400


1486
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:35,400


1487
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:35,400


1488
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:35,400


1489
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:36,960
Good morning, senor.

1490
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:37,680
Welcome aboard.

1491
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:38,880
We've been expecting you.

1492
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,240
You greet me with 11 gond.

1493
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,460
The correct salute for El Supremo Capitan is 23 gond.

1494
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,980
The king himself receives only 21.

1495
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,020
That is why I always have 23.

1496
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,740
Uh-oh.

1497
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:50,260
I'll be right back.

1498
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:50,260


1499
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,940
20 minutes later, they stood on our deck.

1500
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:22,180
Dark, ugly men with a great show of arrogance.

1501
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,320
Just listen to this stomach of mine.

1502
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,600
I mean the way it keeps growling and squealing, the way it sounds, you'd think I had a hyena

1503
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,220
inside of me.

1504
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,760
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this, but I'm going to do it.

1505
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:48,920
I'm going to do it.

1506
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:48,920


1507
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:48,920


1508
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:48,920


1509
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:48,920


1510
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:48,920


1511
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:48,920


1512
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:48,920


1513
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:15,520
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its

1514
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:15,980
creed.

1515
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,900
We hold these truths to ourselves.

1516
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:18,900


1517
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:22,740
We want to be self-evident that all men are created equal.

1518
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:42,500
His kindness, his gentle wisdom, his humor, everything about him is so right.

1519
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,840
We can never leave!

1520
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,320
Isn't it wonderful?

1521
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:08,220
We can never leave!

1522
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:08,220


1523
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:08,220


1524
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:18,900
We can never leave!

1525
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,080
Yada, yada, yada.

1526
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,360
Well, miss, so far so good.

1527
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:04,820
Can two women really be so distracting, Captain?

1528
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:06,940
May I remind you, ma'am,

1529
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:11,660
that my men have been continually at sea for more than seven months.

1530
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,600
And you, sir, how long have you been at sea?

1531
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,040
I was... I...

1532
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:18,160
Ah!

1533
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:36,460
I shan't complain, Mr. Ornott.

1534
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:38,620
We have much to be thankful for.

1535
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:39,780
Yeah, that's a fact, miss.

1536
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:43,380
It's like they say, it ain't never so bad that it can't be worse.

1537
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,140
Thank you.

1538
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:46,980
Thank you.

1539
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,220
Thank you.

1540
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:00,560
His kindness, his gentle wisdom, his humor,

1541
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,100
everything about him is so right.

1542
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,800
I still have a dream.

1543
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,580
Thank you.

1544
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,040
Thank you.

1545
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:23,620
Thank you.

1546
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,260
Thank you.

1547
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:19,880
Thank you.

1548
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:56,020
I still have a dream.

1549
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:43,120
I still have a dream.

1550
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,880
I still have a dream.

1551
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:48,540
I still have a dream.

1552
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,320
I still have a dream.

1553
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:30,600
I still have a dream.

1554
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:18,900
I still have a dream.

1555
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,000
I still have a dream.

1556
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:22,560
You.

1557
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:44,400
We're going to cut out their living guts

1558
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,620
and use them to crease the treads of our tank.

1559
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,060
Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser.

1560
01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:01,940
That's why Americans have never lost and will never lose a war.

1561
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:21,360
So, Dr. Knudsen, I take it that everybody's now on the same page and they all agree

1562
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:26,240
on something about climate change. It's all finished. The shouting's over, right?

1563
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:31,380
No, hardly. Based on the panel discussion that we had

1564
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:31,920
yesterday, I think it's all over.

1565
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:36,160
In New Orleans, there's still quite a bit of disagreement on this issue.

1566
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,740
Why is it such a hard issue to resolve?

1567
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,440
Well, we're...

1568
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:57,500
See it at all?

1569
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:29,780
We're not going to resolve it.

1570
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:30,420
We're not going to resolve it.

1571
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,160
We're not going to resolve it.

1572
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:33,160


1573
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:33,160


1574
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:33,160


1575
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:33,160


1576
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:39,100
That was the broadcast version.

1577
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,780
This is the internet version.

1578
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:44,340
So, an hour can really be two hours.

1579
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:49,100
And I've got some news.

1580
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:53,340
Lonesome Cowboy Dave is sick.

1581
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:59,020
And he was in the hospital for a week.

1582
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:10,500
he's in rehab now not the covid but his um i guess his congestive heart failure problem

1583
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:15,660
kind of came back and well

1584
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:29,360
he could use help the one of the best things you as a poor broke subgenius could do

1585
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:36,260
would be to write dave a letter write dave a letter about how you think he's real funny and

1586
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:44,620
clever and you always liked his hour of slack stuff dave's not on the internet by choice

1587
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:52,460
i think he is afraid of it he's really old he's in his 70s um

1588
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:59,660
i'm so glad that we have had him and we

1589
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:07,640
will hopefully continue to but really this is a good time to send him a fan letter he doesn't get

1590
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:14,500
the kind of feedback that the rest of us on the internet do so if you write him a letter you can

1591
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:25,340
email it to me stang subgenius.com look at subgenius.com all the contact information stuff is

1592
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:29,400
there um you can

1593
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:35,820
text it to some of our facebook pages and i'll probably see it but tell dave

1594
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:48,500
that you appreciate him he really could use the moral support right now and if you want to hit the

1595
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:58,400
donation button on subgenius.com or go to the hour of slack section and you'll find the gofundme link

1596
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,420
for dave

1597
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:09,920
uh that would be great i i i'll forward anything you send me for him we're real old friends you know

1598
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:20,740
um i want to do what i can friends uh thank you now what else was

1599
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:27,200
oh yeah yeah um

1600
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:34,600
this is the internet show it's the we can make it as long as we want who cares

1601
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:43,840
uh and we recorded a lot of stuff in that first zoom show and it was maybe a lot

1602
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:52,260
inside subgenius history and a little bit too much paleontology that not everybody in the world

1603
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:53,520
would be interested in

1604
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:59,760
uh my co-spouters were dr houston to demi Mun phrase uh he just said you know many magic hands

1605
01:05:59,760 --> 01:05:59,760


1606
01:05:59,760 --> 01:05:59,760


1607
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:07,200
and John Shirley and other junior scientists and so I ended up talking about

1608
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:19,160
rudists and how the first pamphlet number one and media well actually the

1609
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:24,860
entire membership pack subgenius membership was first laid out in one

1610
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:33,880
night back in the day subgenius history 101 I've got his brother yes Bob said

1611
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:41,840
scar this is the original wow oh my god oh yeah this one looks a lot darker it's

1612
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:49,060
receding cafe press can screw these things up the Bob on the other side is

1613
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:54,260
rather swarthy also this is a

1614
01:06:54,860 --> 01:07:01,500
the first pamphlet I got you'll notice it's brown it's not on white paper it's

1615
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:10,540
on brown paper yeah we made those out of those are paper sacks little Chinese

1616
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:16,880
kids stitch those together here's a little piece that's not printed anymore

1617
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:22,800
right in the in the gutter there's a line all about that guy who's a madman

1618
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:24,680
cookie and

1619
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:31,480
I like drumming first degree we're here yep that's not there any more dedicated

1620
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,460
to mammy there's a dedication of my mother in there and there's a thanks to

1621
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:43,020
a guy named Wade left which you snuck me into the D magazine office after hours

1622
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:48,300
where I did all of the typesetting in the everything in the membership pack

1623
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:51,400
and all the bumper stickers in one night

1624
01:07:54,860 --> 01:08:00,440
the pan's nuclear beer the what the hell do you think you're doing then the

1625
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:07,580
forbidden sciences all the bumper stickers the card everything was typeset

1626
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:14,920
in one night and I wasn't on speed you were spewing in a grand admission that

1627
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:15,080
we

1628
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:23,780
50 words a minute then that's the moment that you release it you see學沒 it it

1629
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:23,780


1630
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:24,840
the moment that you release it you see know it was it was a that was like your

1631
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:24,840


1632
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:24,840


1633
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:24,840


1634
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:32,160
a prepared there was a rough done on a typewriter so i knew what size things had to be because you

1635
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:36,280
had to make those decisions right then and there i wasn't going to have a chance to do it over again

1636
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:41,780
and uh wasn't any of this expanding and contracting like the sissy boys have now

1637
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:49,560
but i wouldn't get another chance to get into that office all night again it was in between

1638
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:58,260
computers and the demise of uh of hot hot hot pants hot toddies in between you know the uh

1639
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:06,320
computer um computer graphics and uh and hot type setting oh yes they called it cold type

1640
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:16,100
cold type composition i had to learn how to do that type setting in that same night

1641
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:19,240
earlier subgeniuses just had to use those

1642
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:25,700
press on letters one at a time and if you run out then you have to start making up words and that's where

1643
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:29,800
abafrop zipulops came from that's just those were the letters that were left

1644
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:35,100
there's a subgenius on the screen oh god i remember those i worked in underground newspapers and i

1645
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:42,660
remember those letters zipitone oh yeah that's tight zipitone is a transfer screen

1646
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:49,080
yeah we used it didn't they also offset press letters mimeographs it's called

1647
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:49,420
press

1648
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:57,180
type celio tech transfer lettering press type i remember the hand crank one that we used to

1649
01:09:57,180 --> 01:10:02,260
that we used to made back during elementary school i think that was my first experience

1650
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:08,840
huffing the liquid that they used to uh adhere the ink to the papers when you hand crank those

1651
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:15,100
copies out weren't they fragrant though nunca fragrant and uh yeah we used them

1652
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:18,280
uh to make i've used them to make my first underground newspaper

1653
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:19,540
and when always i reducing tvan op.au we're gonna go to this…?

1654
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:25,360
was 12 and distributed it at the middle school and got into trouble instantly.

1655
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:31,700
The 12 year olds had their own drug experiences. If you remember Robert

1656
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:36,500
Williams painting of a kid dreaming as he puts together a model airplane and

1657
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:40,320
he's huffing glue and the glue is all over the airplane and all over him but

1658
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:44,940
in the thought balloon there's the deadly dog fight he's experienced.

1659
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:53,520
And we've all been there I think. The glue, the toluene rushes up into

1660
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,100
the sinuses and into the brain.

1661
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:58,760
Dr. Howell I have a question for you real quick.

1662
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:02,420
You see that this painting seen behind me?

1663
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:07,460
I do. It looks like titanoboa is it not?

1664
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:14,920
Well those things and also the barrels in the back there.

1665
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:14,920


1666
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:14,920


1667
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:14,920


1668
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:14,920


1669
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:19,780
background are rudists, like nudists but with an R.

1670
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:22,280
Are you familiar with rudists?

1671
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:28,640
They were a type of marine animal that lived,

1672
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:34,360
they're kind of like a cross between coral and mollusks.

1673
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,020
They had tentacles.

1674
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:38,300
No, no, those,

1675
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:41,100
I see.

1676
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,820
They're more like a clam, they're two pieces.

1677
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:46,320
They can swing open,

1678
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:48,880
there's probably little tiny tentacles

1679
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,800
at the openings there at the joint.

1680
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:53,060
Yeah, when you're swimming underwater,

1681
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:54,720
don't touch anything.

1682
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,320
Don't stand on the bottom,

1683
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:02,700
don't touch anything that you see is a good way to go.

1684
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:07,760
Well, my driveway is made of those things.

1685
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:09,140
Of rudists?

1686
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:10,420
Rudists, yes.

1687
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:13,560
Wow, so you have like a,

1688
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:17,240
you can walk from ring to ring down the driveway?

1689
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:21,600
No, unfortunately the driveway was made of pulverized

1690
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,020
rudists from a quarry.

1691
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,360
Rudists during the Cretaceous,

1692
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:28,160
the reason they're not better known is

1693
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,900
they were only around during the Cretaceous,

1694
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:32,100
which was a long time,

1695
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:34,980
but they were, and some in the Jurassic,

1696
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:37,420
but they were not around after the Cretaceous.

1697
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,360
They went out with the dinosaurs pretty much,

1698
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:43,320
but they were very common during that period in shallow,

1699
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:43,820
shallow oceans.

1700
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:46,200
And they grew in reefs.

1701
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:50,700
There was apparently a quarry nearby here

1702
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:53,160
that was basically just a big rudist reef.

1703
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:56,100
And that's where our driveway gravel came from.

1704
01:12:56,540 --> 01:13:00,680
Now, did any of them make it out in whole and in one piece?

1705
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:03,080
I'm sure somewhere there are some,

1706
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:04,960
and I've seen some at the University of Texas

1707
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:05,640
that are really,

1708
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:11,120
and I have two really good examples of them downstairs.

1709
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,300
I could actually show you.

1710
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,060
Ah, you got the good ones.

1711
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:16,260
How, how big are they?

1712
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:17,480
They're boring creatures.

1713
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:19,400
It's like all the fossils around here,

1714
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:23,280
they're sea life that mostly hasn't changed much

1715
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,360
from the ones you find on the seashore now.

1716
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:27,880
They're just made of stone

1717
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,720
because they're old versions of them.

1718
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,260
But the rudists are different.

1719
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:34,080
And Princess Wee and I kept finding these,

1720
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:38,460
these curved things with a peculiar color to them.

1721
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,420
And we just couldn't figure it out.

1722
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:43,280
And it took me two years of, you know,

1723
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:43,280


1724
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:43,280


1725
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:46,060
of studying fossil, Texas fossil books

1726
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:50,080
and going to museums until we finally,

1727
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:54,620
and quizzing paleontologists who were often stumped.

1728
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:56,940
But I've been able to prove that our driveway

1729
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:59,320
is in fact made of these rudest things,

1730
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:01,660
they're curved, they're really only about this big.

1731
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:03,920
At the large, never very big.

1732
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:07,160
So your driveway is made out of crushed creatures

1733
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:08,260
from the Paleolithic?

1734
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:09,800
Yeah.

1735
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:11,220
From the Cretaceous.

1736
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,700
From the Cretaceous.

1737
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:14,140
Yeah.

1738
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:15,920
Yeah, it is.

1739
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:19,520
There's a lot of other little crinkly.

1740
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:23,100
How is that any better than a golden toilet?

1741
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:25,940
You may have been thinking Paleozoic.

1742
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:27,800
In a different world,

1743
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:31,300
rudists would be as valuable as diamonds or gold.

1744
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,540
It's because they're rare.

1745
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:34,640
I've fooled around in Reverend Stang's screen.

1746
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,300
What about Stang's screen?

1747
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:41,480
Anyway, I'm gonna.

1748
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:43,280
You're reaching, you're trying to reach.

1749
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,120
Trying to get invisible hand.

1750
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:46,780
And the rudest creep.

1751
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:50,580
The invisible hand is going into Modak's ear right now.

1752
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:53,140
It's on my screen, it looks like you're trying

1753
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:54,420
to fist John Shirley.

1754
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:58,060
Yeah, okay, everybody has them in different order.

1755
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:58,580
That's right.

1756
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:03,840
Yeah, it's like the Hollywood Squares

1757
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,540
or the Brady Bunch here.

1758
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:10,600
It's possible to have it in one band across the top

1759
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:12,100
if I only knew how to do that.

1760
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,460
Oh yeah, that's probably true.

1761
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:15,520
I don't know.

1762
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,540
I kind of want to go back to seeing you fist John Shirley.

1763
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:20,540
That was pretty interesting.

1764
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:22,840
Enter full screen.

1765
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:28,080
Oh, is that a picture of a Cretaceous thing?

1766
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:29,260
Yeah.

1767
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,820
I believe in miracles you Cretaceous thing.

1768
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:33,780
That's what rudists look like in life.

1769
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,800
Oh wow, that's a great monster, Philo.

1770
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:42,700
When this becomes a radio show, is this a radio show now?

1771
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:47,020
No, it's a TV show now.

1772
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,780
I'm recording audio.

1773
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:50,240
I don't know if anybody's recording.

1774
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:53,860
It may become a radio show and the people will have to look

1775
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:55,980
at the eidetic imagery in their own brains.

1776
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:58,840
Look at this, it's the rudest fossil, is it not?

1777
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:02,540
Yeah, maybe I should just get rid of the background

1778
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,740
because that green screen messes with stuff.

1779
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:06,660
No.

1780
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:10,220
Back to reality channel.

1781
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:15,760
First we found these things, these curves, these strange curves.

1782
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:20,000
And every now and then we'd find a tip.

1783
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:25,180
Of course, one could lie and say, dinosaur teeth,

1784
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:27,000
but no, they're rudest tips.

1785
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:30,480
Then that, that's a good one.

1786
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:34,540
That's half a rudest, that's pretty.

1787
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,460
That is half.

1788
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:39,480
It does superficially resemble a dinosaur.

1789
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:41,460
A dinosaur phalangeal claw.

1790
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:43,520
Yeah, it's not though.

1791
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:44,160
It's not.

1792
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,880
Then I found one, this is my favorite.

1793
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:48,760
I think this is one.

1794
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:49,700
Wow.

1795
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:50,800
An ammonite.

1796
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:54,460
It's mounted on a little platform and everything.

1797
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:56,180
Is it an ammonite?

1798
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:59,440
No, no, no, totally different.

1799
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,900
It's a half of a rudest again?

1800
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:06,300
Half a rudest, yeah, which is more like a combination between a clam

1801
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:08,780
and a coral because they would grow.

1802
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:11,260
They would grow close together and form reefs.

1803
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:14,220
It's a shell, you know, with something soft inside.

1804
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:16,440
Like a Christmas tree?

1805
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:17,660
A mollusk.

1806
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:23,320
It's basically a mollusk, but yeah, they're not like anything nowadays.

1807
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:28,040
They were their own kind of critter and they're not well known

1808
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:29,220
and now you know about them.

1809
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:31,880
Now we know about them.

1810
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:32,060
Yeah.

1811
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:33,280
Did they have a bob?

1812
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:38,120
It would be hard for us to distinguish it.

1813
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:39,460
The very rude bob.

1814
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:41,580
He was the rudest of them all.

1815
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:44,020
Yes, yes, absolutely.

1816
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:46,040
Not PC.

1817
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:47,400
That was slack for them.

1818
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:52,500
Remember, they're not decadent creatures living after the extinction

1819
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,100
of dangerous life forms.

1820
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:57,860
They're in the thick of it all the time with everybody trying to eat you

1821
01:17:57,860 --> 01:17:59,120
and get you.
