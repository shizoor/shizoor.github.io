1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
From PR News in Washington, I'm distributed through the internet and viewed by thousands of Russian police.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,280
And now PR's founder has fled the country. He was fired for refusing.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,900
He said he refused to do PR News.

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,900
And now the number of Americans falling sharply in March.

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:24,920
Dow is 3, 16, 5, 5, 10, 22, 22, 14 and a half, 41, 7, 84, 39.

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,600
The Supreme Court says this is PR News.

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:34,160
And now PR reports reports and dust toughens the lungs and closes lung holes.

8
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,080
Those lung holes are now closed.

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,280
The new lung was slashed in half.

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,980
The old lung did respond to fraudulent criticism of PR News.

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,820
They say federal law limits how much money can be recovered by victims of PR News.

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,120
I feel like I'm watching Mondo Connie.

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,280
Hey, look, lemur scat. We must be getting close.

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,800
Looks like Bob's.

15
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,820
Listen to this music.

16
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:11,940
Bob, isn't it true that unless you have found your field in life, the thing that you want to do,

17
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,400
isn't it true that you frequently think of what you are best suited for?

18
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,760
And if you could only find out what he's best suited for, he would work 18 hours a day, I assure you.

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,900
He would study. He would self-discipline himself.

20
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,240
He'd stop fooling around.

21
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,580
I'm not saying that you are. I'm just using that as an example.

22
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,580
I'll tell you what you're best suited for.

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,440
How do you like that?

24
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,500
Now, Bob, if you could ever believe this, you'd just jump out of your skin.

25
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,680
I guess you're jumping now, aren't you?

26
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,900
Bob, you are best fitted for anything you want to do.

27
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,600
Anything. I don't care about your past education. I don't care a thing of your past.

28
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,840
You're best fitted for anything.

29
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,240
You know this theory that's been known since the beginning of time.

30
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,900
That we are what we think.

31
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,380
I'm Bob.

32
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,480
This theory is my play.

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,320
Excellent.

34
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,300
Nice.

35
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,580
Ooh, you wanna kill him?

36
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,220
I don't think that's a wise thing.

37
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,100
Not a wise thing to do.

38
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,420
Do you really think that you can't even see him?

39
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,480
You will feel him.

40
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:37,520
And if you're dreaming that you can take him, I don't think that's a very wise thing to do.

41
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,460
Uh-oh. You know who that is?

42
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:56,240
That's right. It's your pal, Bobo the Clown. Yay!

43
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,260
Bobo the Clown

44
00:02:59,260 --> 00:02:59,360
Bobo the Clown

45
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,060
Bobo the Clown

46
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,200
Hey, Bobo. Wanna play a game?

47
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,780
Okay. Look up. Look down. Now look at Mr. Frying Pan.

48
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,020
Uh-oh. Bobo, fall down. Go boom.

49
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:15,840
Oh.

50
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,240
Wake up.

51
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,560
Oh, Bob.

52
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,840
Wake up.

53
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,500
Oh.

54
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:27,660


55
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:28,400


56
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:28,400


57
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:28,400


58
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:28,400


59
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:28,400


60
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:28,400


61
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:28,400


62
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:28,400


63
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh.

64
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,580
Bobo the Clown

65
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:33,960
Bobo, Bobo.

66
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,780
Joseph's drip back.

67
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,140
Fuck.

68
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,140
Walt Disney quarterback, Mary Jane Monsieur,

69
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,160
Amyράy Popo,

70
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,220
Larissa Adetano.

71
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:58,400


72
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,380
It's on every station

73
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,780
Get a trace on that signal, now

74
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,460
Let's roll

75
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,040
The other officers quickly take up the slack

76
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,480
That's how big it was

77
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,700
It could be seen for miles and miles around

78
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,380
Here's the king's command

79
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,880
I'm going to command all these musicians

80
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,840
To start playing their musical instruments

81
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,580
And as soon as they start playing the music

82
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,700
You are to fall down and bow down

83
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,500
In front of that great image, 90 feet high

84
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,640
And pray to it

85
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,240
I'm not giving in

86
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,920
To a smile or a grin

87
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,640
On a face I might never see again

88
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,560
I'm not gonna fly

89
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,860
Inside the sky

90
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,180
Of a big, bony sky

91
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,660
On a life that I know

92
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,740
Just can't win

93
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,120
Yes, Bob, you rang?

94
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,620
Am I a lousy flicker?

95
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,060
Whatever

96
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,580
I analyze it and assess it thoroughly

97
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,480
And then I make my prediction on the air

98
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,940
And I pick the opposite

99
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,800
Now there's a guy who knows how to get his point across

100
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,440
I stand on my record

101
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,760
I'm a drunk

102
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,600
I don't know nothing about how I do anything

103
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,620
One thing I shared with you this afternoon

104
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,120
Is that Bobby didn't listen to me

105
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,400
And I'm thankful now that he didn't

106
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,860
And hopefully if you've got a negative spouse

107
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,040
You're not listening to them either

108
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,300
Because he didn't listen to me

109
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,020
And he went about and built the business

110
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,660
Because he saw something in it

111
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,660
A friend of his or an acquaintance of his

112
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,920
Had shown him the plan

113
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,820
And I won't flush his bubble

114
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,820
That's just part of the story

115
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:54,860
But let us look to the next paragraph of prophecy

116
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,060
Which says

117
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,720
Dateline

118
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,460
Predominance

119
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,400
1991

120
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,720
First paragraph

121
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,820
And I quote

122
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,460
World War III

123
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,140
Church of the subgenius

124
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,200
Shifts into Operation Removal

125
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,880
End quote

126
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,500
Now admittedly, dear friends

127
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,160
That leaves open some room for interpretation

128
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,800
And just what is Operation Removal

129
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,000
Designated to remove?

130
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,440
Well now

131
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,120
Knowing Bob

132
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,940
He'd want to remove

133
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,840
The very concept

134
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,580
Of removal

135
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,920
And Ivan was seen

136
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,920
Leaving shortly thereafter

137
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,860
With this gentleman

138
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,360
We observe Ivan

139
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,540
And this gentleman again

140
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,860
Travel to a country western bar

141
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,160
Bob's country bunker

142
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,400
He said he was going out

143
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,340
Two-stepping with Lisa

144
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,300
Unless his name's Lisa

145
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,580
Doesn't look like a Lisa, I know

146
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,880
We observe Ivan

147
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,220
And this gentleman

148
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,260
As they're walking

149
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,260
Basically fondling one another

150
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,040
On the street

151
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,700
Oh my God

152
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,880
Here we are

153
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,260
Bob's country bunker

154
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:02,860
We see him

155
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,780
All right, let's go

156
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,840
Well, Mr. Stang

157
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,760
No, we're dead

158
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,320
You've been doing drugs again, Ivan?

159
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,560
Do you know what Jenkins is?

160
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,120
Now there's our

161
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,140
Food, food plant

162
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,880
Hey

163
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,640
If you only have one left

164
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,560
Is it still your left nut?

165
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,360
We shouldn't go there

166
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,620
No

167
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,880
I suppose Bob told you

168
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,100
That his plan is going to prove

169
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,660
Hi, I'm Bob

170
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,220
Hi

171
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,100
Are you famous?

172
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:23,680
Yeah

173
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,240
See, I saw this program

174
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,520
That I'm talking about tonight

175
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,680
Some seven years ago

176
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,300
Seven years ago

177
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,260
When I saw this program

178
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,260
I folded my arms

179
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,100
Across my chest

180
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,620
I crossed my legs

181
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,000
And then I looked at that guy

182
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,400
That was talking about this program

183
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,420
And I said, no way

184
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,660
Whoever this joker is

185
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,440
Whoever's up there

186
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,360
He's always grinning

187
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,100
I thought, why was he always grinning?

188
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,400
It never dawned on me

189
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,120
Because he is so doggone rich

190
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,500
Being broke's not a good deal

191
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,180
But he looked at me

192
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,340
And he says, Al

193
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,500
Whatever you do

194
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,040
You're going to like Area 3

195
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,060
He says, as a matter of fact

196
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,700
Judging from the first two areas

197
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,680
You'll probably want to be involved

198
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,380
In Area 3

199
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,640
And I was committed and convinced

200
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,940
That Area 3 looked good

201
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,340
And then he spelled it out to me

202
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,200
D-E-A-D

203
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,020
Dead

204
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,200
Fantastic

205
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,360
I'll talk like this

206
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,480
Bob's your uncle, mate

207
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,060
That really doesn't help, Bob

208
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,440
You get the slack in the heart

209
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,360
You get the back slip

210
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,800
Well, that would have to have been

211
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,700
Last Fourth of July

212
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,600
It was very hot out

213
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,260
Oh, so hot

214
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,460
It was just blazing

215
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,960
And I was at the youth group picnic

216
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,020
Minister Bob was there

217
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,020
In his Bermuda pants

218
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,960
They cover more legs

219
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,600
Than his Bermuda shorts, you see

220
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,460
And they're just a little bit tighter

221
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:54,980
In the back

222
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,320
They just hug as buns

223
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,040
In the cutest way

224
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,400
But anyway

225
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,100
I was slicing

226
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,640
Some Rice Krispie squares

227
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,440
I had made

228
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,100
And Minister Bob

229
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,040
Was filling cups

230
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,660
Of the punch bowl

231
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,440
With his ladle

232
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,940
It was the biggest ladle

233
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,740
I'd ever seen

234
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,300
I wanted to touch it

235
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,180
But I was afraid to

236
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,800
Because it was so abnormally large

237
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,380
And as I watched him

238
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:19,960
With that ladle

239
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,740
He kept dipping it

240
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,220
Into the bowl

241
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:21,940
And pouring punch

242
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,200
And dipping

243
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,060
And pouring

244
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,700
And dipping

245
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,340
And pouring

246
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:25,960
And dipping

247
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,020
Until I saw him

248
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,120
All the cups were filled

249
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,900
And it didn't take long

250
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,520
Because that was

251
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,760
Some big ladle

252
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,380
And then suddenly

253
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:32,920
Violently

254
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,760
There was a shudder

255
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,620
My buttocks were tingling

256
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,100
I was alone

257
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,840
Lost in space

258
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,960
I saw him toss that ladle aside

259
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,780
His arm exhausted

260
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,720
I must have passed out

261
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,520
Because that's all I remember

262
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,560
So you won't talk to me, huh?

263
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,340
Where'd you get the diamond bracelet, Miss Porter?

264
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,720
You may call me Connie

265
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,120
You did what was doing the storm, remember?

266
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,580
You said, all right, Connie

267
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,000
We might as well go down the street

268
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,000


269
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,280
Down together

270
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,520
I liked the way you said, Connie

271
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,820
It was like a punch in the door

272
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,300
Tell me about the bracelet

273
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,720
That's a dead giveaway

274
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,040
You're wanting us to die together like that

275
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,540
Dying together

276
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,740
Even more personal

277
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,580
Living together

278
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,240
What'd you pay for the bracelet?

279
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,020
Nothing

280
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:13,880
Pardon?

281
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,920
You're a low person, darling

282
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,500
Obviously out of the gutter

283
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,940
Maybe that's why I'm attracted to you

284
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,700
And maybe that's why you're attracted to me

285
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,860
Now what's gonna happen?

286
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,020
Do you know that's breaking

287
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,360
The second commandment?

288
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:26,980
Because

289
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,300
Because

290
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,220
Babylon was the head of witchcraft

291
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,060
Sorcery

292
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,700
Horseshell

293
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,520
Notice that

294
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,700
When the music starts playing

295
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,400
You're to bow down and worship

296
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:34,960
Babylon

297
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,740
Like the beat, beat, beat, beat, beat

298
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,860
Of the tom-tom

299
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:42,760
When the jungle shadow falls

300
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,240
Like the tick, tick, tock

301
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,500
Of my old grandfather's clock

302
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,860
As it stands up straight against the wall

303
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,820
Like the drip, drip, drop

304
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,120
Drip, drop of the raindrop

305
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,860
When the summer shower is through

306
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,840
So a voice within me

307
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,340
Keeps repeating you

308
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,880
Just you

309
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,600
It's only you

310
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,600
Holy smokes, he exploded

311
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,040
And I won't tell you

312
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,100
I jumped in with both feet

313
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,220
And started listening to tapes

314
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:22,820
And reading books

315
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,620
Because I didn't

316
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,960
I had to read lots of books

317
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,160
Lots and lots of books

318
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,960
And sometimes you're gonna

319
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,160
to pick up a book in the beginning and you're going to read it and you're going to think,

320
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,780
I can't finish this. This book is too heavy. And you're going to put it down and a couple

321
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,200
of years later, a couple of months later, you're going to pick up that book and all

322
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,600
of a sudden it's going to slap you in the face.

323
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,120
Ow!

324
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,000
Hello, Connie.

325
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,400
Bob! I'm so glad.

326
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,900
You're glad? How do you think I feel? And you're just as good as new again.

327
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,440
Oh, oh!

328
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:55,400
In high society, I just ain't the type. Folks all look so surprised when I light my pipe.

329
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:55,740
Yes!

330
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,060
Oh, yeah.

331
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,320
You smoke a pipe, too?

332
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,580
Oh, don't be coy. I like it, too.

333
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:10,300
What's it going to get you, Connie? All this business of filling my pipe, pouring my drinks,

334
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,320
corned beef and cabbage?

335
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,620
I suppose I should pretend that I don't know what you mean by that, but I won't.

336
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,580
Connie, look, for the past three days, all you've done is...

337
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,460
All I've done is what?

338
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,620
Put down that pipe and get my pipe up.

339
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,160
No!

340
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,760
A partner in sin. Sometimes there is a mood that just... We don't know why.

341
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,800
You wouldn't kid a pal, would you, Connie?

342
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,920
Who are you kidding?

343
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:35,920
Oh, yourself, maybe.

344
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,360
No!

345
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,600
I don't know yet, Bob.

346
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,240
It's great. Just great.

347
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,740
Hello, children.

348
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,800
Well, here we are, Doc. The two lovebirds, all ready for the wedding. Sit down.

349
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,120
Are we healthy enough to get married?

350
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,500
Yeah, both as solid as a new dollar.

351
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:56,780
What's that?

352
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:56,940


353
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:56,940


354
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:56,940


355
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:56,940


356
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:56,940


357
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:56,940


358
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:56,940


359
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:56,940


360
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:56,940


361
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:56,940


362
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:56,940


363
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:56,940


364
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:56,940


365
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:56,940


366
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,240
This baby didn't hurt you a bit.

367
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,280
You can have a dozen more if you want to.

368
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,760
And, Bob, you'll be pleased to know that there's no trace of your old V.D.

369
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,820
One hundred percent cured.

370
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,740
What did you say about our first baby?

371
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,300
You've been married before?

372
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,380
Doctor, what did you call it?

373
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,620
V.D.?

374
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,020
You mean to say that Bob has actually had one of those horrible diseases?

375
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,000
That isn't true, Doctor.

376
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,180
Is that true, Bob?

377
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,440
All right, if you must know, I did have it.

378
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,860
But it's no worse than having an illegitimate child.

379
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,160
I think it is.

380
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,980
Why, I'd sooner marry a leper.

381
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,720
Thank you for letting me know about this in time, Dr. West.

382
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,320
And now I'm going out into the clean, fresh air.

383
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,500
Well, there went my happy wedding right out the door.

384
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,180
I'm terribly sorry, Bob.

385
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,080
Ah, dear Donald.

386
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,920
Just grabbed by the scalp shaker up and down a bit and choked.

387
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:56,920


388
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,720
Chub off the slack.

389
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,660
Come on.

390
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,520
Down this streaking out pit, we'll finally blame it on God.

391
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,500
And there'll be some kind of church started called the Streaker's Church.

392
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,260
And boy, they'll just, they'll fall and try to make it religious.

393
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:15,760
But I want to tell you it's abominable and it's filthy and it's rotten.

394
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,920
And men ought to stand up against it.

395
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,180
Say amen even more so.

396
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,760
The pipes, we need a jolly light, jolly light.

397
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,360
We're free from every demonstrate.

398
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,280
We drink the best of what we drink.

399
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,420
The best of what we drink.

400
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:30,800
The best of what we drink.

401
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,020
I'm glad that this gay life is mine.

402
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:40,060
Fear the name of fingers, waters, dirty birdie, Holland, no sterling beef or chemist.

403
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:46,600
Fear the name of mystic Myron, Tucker, Tolan, Baddus, Sol Ringin, no Georgie III.

404
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,180
Oh, smiling.

405
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,400
No, Nate Bob.

406
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,880
If you understand that we have all had a partner in sin,

407
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,340
you really didn't do anything wrong.

408
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,020
You didn't do it by yourself.

409
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,520
There was an influence there.

410
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,160
Thank you, Bob.

411
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,280
Thank you, Bob.

412
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,380
Thank you, Bob.

413
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,320
Now we shop at Neiman Marcus instead of K. Martin Sears.

414
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,820
We go to Neiman Marcus and as soon as they spotted us, they said,

415
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,940
Hi, Bob and Bonnie.

416
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,460
Connie.

417
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:09,940
Ha!

418
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,260
They remembered us.

419
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,320
And so on the back, they take you in the back and they have drinks for you.

420
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,980
Whatever it is, scotch, whiskey, whatever you want.

421
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,360
And I ask for the usual.

422
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,920
Dinkum, dinkum, dinkum.

423
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,060
No, sir.

424
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,340
No, sirree.

425
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,560
Bob, Bob, Bob.

426
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,800
Bob, Bob, Bob.

427
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,860
If you drink five gallons of Gatorade, you're going to spend five gallons of Gatorade somewhere

428
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,980
in one of these restaurants.

429
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,880
Good-bye there, right?

430
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,580
Frankly, either way it's .

431
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:43,720
Hey.

432
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,380
Turns out Connie had a secret of her own.

433
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,320
We went and did some crazy things and I could tell you, in the end, that it was just a

434
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:56,320


435
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:56,320


436
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:56,320


437
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:56,320


438
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:56,320


439
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:56,320


440
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:56,320


441
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:56,320


442
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,820
I can remember standing up on stage and putting the microphone up and nothing came out.

443
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,660
They're crying out loud.

444
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,880
And I went, oh my god.

445
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,880
No Connie, no!

446
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,200
I blew a five foot flame out of my butt.

447
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,780
It really isn't all that bad.

448
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:20,360
Hope you understand that there's nothing more liberating than being able to pee and poop your own diaper.

449
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,140
I love a bob.

450
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,400
Yeah! Yeah!

451
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,420
Come on.

452
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,200
Yeah, what's the matter with that? It's disgusting.

453
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,760
Don't ever ask me to do that again.

454
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,920
You just have to be careful.

455
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,380
You always think about, you know, getting poop on the finger, you know.

456
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,140
And I remember the first time it happened.

457
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,580
I couldn't believe it.

458
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,300
I mean, it's like, oh my god.

459
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,980
I've got poop on my finger.

460
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,180
And then I started thinking to myself, it could be worse.

461
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,880
I could have a job.

462
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:01,900
I can't even do it anymore.

463
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,180
I don't think I can.

464
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,460
I just can't do it.

465
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,280
And I said, Bobby, please don't ever make me do that again.

466
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:05,580
John!

467
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,780
Don't call me Bobby.

468
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,760
No Connie, no!

469
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,860
Call me Connie, dear.

470
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,740
I've loved you, loved you so.

471
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,000
Call me Connie, dear.

472
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,420
Don't ever, ever go

473
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:29,420
You're my guiding light

474
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,220
Each and every night

475
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,460
You're the one that I adore

476
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,060
For now and evermore

477
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,020
Connie dear

478
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:48,740
Connie, Connie dear

479
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,760
Oh, Connie, no!

480
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,060
Hey!

481
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,320
From PR News in Washington, I'm unexpected.

482
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,200
In the coming hour, President Obama will end the U.S.

483
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,520
and effectively end more than a decade of PR's reports by the end of this year.

484
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,060
But less than 48 hours after making an unannounced president,

485
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,980
the Obama argue that Obama should be shielded from liability.

486
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,360
According to a senior administration official,

487
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,260
the official says,

488
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,040
says the U.S. will continue a military terrorism operation.

489
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,660
Much like PR News.

490
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,760
Technocrat politicians posed Modi's.

491
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,180
Modi said violence and terrorism must be brought to PR News.

492
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,740
Down is 6266667.

493
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,960
Godzilla drops to second place ahead of the amazing PR News.

494
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,200
Secret protesters say for secret police say

495
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,940
this is an estimated $111 million in domestic.

496
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,900
PR News in Washington.

497
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,120
Oh, yes, dear friends.

498
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,320
That PR News, of course, comes from Leimert.

499
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,560
Fernanda Nendi, Leimert.

500
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:13,660
And everything else we heard just about was from Reverend Susie the Fluesy's show

501
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,380
from WREK Atlanta.

502
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,240
The show called...

503
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,900
Bob's Slack Time Funhouse.

504
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,900
And I think that's an oldie collage of hers.

505
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,460
Really intense.

506
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,460
Nobody else does what Susie does.

507
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:34,660
Ever.

508
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,180
That's for sure.

509
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,300
They never did before and they never will again.

510
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,720
And if they do, they will probably be arrested.

511
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,940
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.

512
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,120
And friends, we have a new microphone in the station tonight.

513
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:48,240


514
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:48,240


515
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:48,240


516
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:48,240


517
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:48,800
Exciting.

518
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,860
We should try to think of a name for it.

519
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,180
It's really sleek and shiny and futuristic.

520
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,820
It's silvery and reflective

521
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:05,960
and doesn't have the big black foam wind screen on it.

522
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,580
No.

523
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,780
It has a little modern day flat disc of a wind screen

524
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:16,620
to make the pops, those pops not sound so bad.

525
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,240
And it has an exquisiteness.

526
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:22,240
It has a geometric sort of artistic balance thing

527
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,460
that holds it just so.

528
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,360
Speaking of artistic bounce,

529
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,920
Lonesome Cowboy Dave should be calling in any minute.

530
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,640
You know, I shouldn't say that

531
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,060
because that would cause some smart aleck to beat him

532
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,920
and call in instead.

533
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,520
You know how they are.

534
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,340
Yes, I know how they are.

535
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,540
You know how the listeners are.

536
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,020
Yes.

537
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,180
Now see, this is probably not Dave.

538
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,480
This is probably some listener.

539
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,180
Our listener.

540
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,620
Do you think that's one of the listeners?

541
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,680
Do I think what?

542
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,140
No, I didn't think it was.

543
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:53,540
No.

544
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,160
No, it is Dave.

545
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:54,800
Okay, good.

546
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,580
It's our Dave.

547
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,620
It's our Dave.

548
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:01,480
Yeah, we had just mistakenly set up someone besides you

549
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,020
to call line one, but now that can't happen.

550
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,280
But that crapped out?

551
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,100
No.

552
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,980
It's okay.

553
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,120
Everything's fine.

554
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,640
Sure it is.

555
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,100
Thankfully, it's you.

556
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,100
I'm sorry, Dave.

557
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,220
I didn't mean you personally.

558
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:22,340
Actually, when we came in, our previous DJ, Charleston, said,

559
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:23,940
everything's good.

560
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,840
It's all good.

561
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,500
It's all good.

562
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,320
Yeah, it's all good.

563
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:27,480
It's all good.

564
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,460
And I know what he means.

565
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:34,140
I know what he means, but I still kind of, as sweet a guy as he is,

566
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,260
I still wanted to punch him, too.

567
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,780
I always want to punch everybody who says it's all good.

568
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,900
I can't help it.

569
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,760
I'm the proof that it's not all good.

570
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,420
I'm not all good.

571
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,860
I'm kind of good bad.

572
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,360
Yeah.

573
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,980
What I usually feel at first when I'm confronted with that is like,

574
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,980
yeah, maybe you're right.

575
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,480
Then I feel real guilty because why would I feel like nothing's good?

576
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,960
And then I want to strangle him.

577
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,480
I don't want to punch anybody because my hands are too artistic.

578
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:14,280
At least the flab handler parts of them, the old ones with the tattoos,

579
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,600
those are, oh, man.

580
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,240
Long story short.

581
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,580
It's not worth doing.

582
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,520
So kids, don't tattoo weird buttock designs on your hands,

583
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,160
especially the part of your palms of your hands,

584
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:31,280
especially since they tell you to never have a tattoo on the palm of your hand

585
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,080
because it's not only ridiculously painful, it can be dangerous.

586
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,860
Just don't.

587
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,600
Is that true?

588
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:40,320
I've come to think of it, I can't remember seeing any palm tattoos.

589
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,580
No, you wouldn't want to have those little needles going in there.

590
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,740
But I've seen it.

591
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,060
But think of all the other places that people,

592
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,380
get tattooed.

593
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,480
You know?

594
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,200
That would kind of hurt.

595
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,240
You know?

596
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:58,140
That are even more sensitive, especially because that's what they're made for, yeah?

597
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,200
Yeah.

598
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:05,600
I don't know why the abjuration would be so strong to avoid the palms of your hands.

599
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,740
Then perhaps it's something religious, you know, for all I could tell.

600
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,460
Dave, you're so old that you don't even have any tattoos, right?

601
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:15,780
Oh, no.

602
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,040
Only the very, very old and the very old.

603
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,660
Very, very young are tattoo-less now.

604
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,640
Well, the very, very old, some of them have gone through various tattoo phases.

605
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,300
This would probably be my third tattoo phase

606
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,020
because, you know, in the days of punk rock,

607
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,760
a lot of people used to wear tattoos and stuff.

608
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,440
And then there was the second wave of tattoos.

609
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,920
And now there's the, it's very common.

610
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:46,480
In fact, it's so common, it's like, remember the illustrated man?

611
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,040
Oh, right.

612
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,340
Dr. Legume, yeah, I know him personally.

613
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,860
You know, he's not really illustrated from the waist down, I don't think.

614
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,460
No, he just draws on himself with a big old ink crayon.

615
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,200
Oh, boy, is he fully illustrated from the waist up.

616
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:02,600
Whoo!

617
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:12,760
But see, I think if I had a, I don't know, I just don't know.

618
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,820
I don't know because I'm old.

619
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,940
I hate it.

620
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,520
Why do you?

621
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:21,560
You know, I'll never wear my, and here's another thing.

622
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,620
I try not to be cool, right?

623
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,320
I mean, my hair is real, real long.

624
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,600
That's the least cool thing you can do with your hair

625
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,780
if you're a man or a woman these days.

626
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:39,060
Yeah, I mean, I try not to be cool, but, you know, I don't have any tattoos.

627
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,460
But every now and then I accidentally do something

628
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,960
that makes it seem like either I'm cool,

629
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,060
or I'm trying to be cool, or something.

630
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,680
Just the fact that I even brought this up is probably a good example.

631
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,640
I'm ashamed of myself now.

632
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,740
I'm going to shut my mouth for two seconds.

633
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:00,960
Time's up.

634
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,280
Okay, I can talk again now.

635
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,360
What a bizarre sidebar.

636
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:12,260
Reminds me of like, hey, did you ever see those ramen-style pool noodles?

637
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,320
They're usually not strangled with little orphans and so forth.

638
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,520
Ramen-style pool noodles?

639
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,040
Ramen-style pool noodles?

640
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,440
That's a joke.

641
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,040
Oh.

642
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,020
Where am I?

643
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:31,220
I feel as if there was an ark filled with every type of human two by two,

644
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:38,860
just like on the North Ark back so many thousands of years ago,

645
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:47,740
that I would not let you come on my ship unless you did it by following me.

646
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:02,960
I can't read the rest of it for you because I don't have it in front of me.

647
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:12,320
You can read it behind you if you change the dialectical approach.

648
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,700
Okay.

649
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,640
You're talking about the ark?

650
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,540
Dave's ark?

651
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,600
As opposed to Noah's ark?

652
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:27,940
Yeah, Dave's ark would be very profuse with wildebeest and all the hairy children of the jungle

653
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:33,440
would be there arguing their catapulted songs together, you know, and it would be like yo-ho-ho.

654
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,980
Oh, like a WCSB station meeting.

655
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:41,540
No, more like a WC Fields irrationality complex.

656
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,380
WC Fields and WCSB.

657
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,820
What is the connection?

658
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,060
Yeah.

659
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,720
It's halfway there.

660
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,900
We almost know.

661
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,280
WC Fields B radio.

662
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,020
The tension lies somewhere in the middle.

663
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,600
Seeing how many dynamic subs diffuse K-5 from that on a pre-cellular level.

664
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:16,500
You just go down each level and there's like WC Fields and it's like an anagram for CW Sledfire or something like that.

665
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:16,680
Yeah.

666
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,040
And then you know that's the same.

667
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,620
And then you know that's the same part where the, you know, that bar they destroyed down

668
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,960
the flats because the insane people were.

669
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,480
Did you hear about that?

670
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,260
A bar down in the flats destroyed by insane people?

671
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,040
That one had the last, the last subgenius devival.

672
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,400
That's why we don't do those anymore.

673
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:39,740
I think that's where it was held and it has kind of a reputation for allowing insane people

674
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,400
to express themselves freely.

675
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:47,500
And there was some show and somebody, a stink bomb or something in the place.

676
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,780
And started shouting fire in the crowded auditorium.

677
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,760
The police had to come because people were divided into two camps.

678
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,480
There were the elderberries and then there were the stone heads.

679
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,080
And they, I don't know.

680
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,860
I would join the stone heads.

681
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,420
Well, no, they're not like stoners or heads or anything like that.

682
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,640
No, I know they would be hard, more hard headed.

683
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:11,940
Well, yeah.

684
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:16,800
You'd be able to use them as battering rams to escape from the non-existent fire in the club.

685
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,480
So.

686
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,260
So this was local.

687
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,620
Was this local news that you're referring to?

688
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,140
Yeah, I guess some of them are neoliberals or whatever they call it nowadays and stuff.

689
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:31,360
When they, you know, if you don't wear the right uniform, I guess you're, you're arrogant.

690
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,640
Neocoms.

691
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,640
Neocoms.

692
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,820
That means neocommies.

693
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,780
Well, I heard that.

694
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:41,620
Disguised as Republicans, disguised as Christians, disguised as humans.

695
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:46,800
I want to hear an interesting funny little anecdote about what you just said, which is

696
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,460
actually true.

697
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,180
Sure.

698
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:52,340
And I heard it on a genuine news source, not the lie I just made up there.

699
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:52,960
Yeah, man.

700
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,980
Get onto my cloud.

701
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:01,060
One of the Koch brothers went to Russia under Stalin there and made millions and millions

702
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,280
of dollars rebuilding the Soviet economy.

703
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:09,860
Then he comes back and starts all these anti-communist organizations like everybody in the world

704
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,440
who is a communist or some or is a Stalinist or something.

705
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,240
Now, wait a minute.

706
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,300
How could the Koch brothers be working for Stalin?

707
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:21,600
That was Stalin died a long time ago, probably before those guys were born.

708
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,340
No, Pappy.

709
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,880
It's like, you know, Pappy Bush.

710
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:24,880
Oh, Pappy Koch.

711
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,640
Pappy Koch.

712
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,460
Pappy Koch.

713
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:28,860
Pappy Koch.

714
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,160
Pappy Koch.

715
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:29,480
Right.

716
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,100
We're talking about those brothers.

717
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,660
That's how you pronounce their name, right?

718
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,320
It's not?

719
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,100
Pappy Koch and Pappy Bush.

720
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,040
So, I don't know.

721
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,080
You got a point there.

722
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,900
Those two go together, don't they?

723
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,460
Oh, well.

724
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,040
Pappy.

725
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:47,280
Pappy.

726
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:47,280


727
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:47,280


728
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:47,280


729
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:47,280


730
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:47,280


731
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:47,280


732
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:47,280


733
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,140
Pappy Koch and Pappy Bush.

734
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,540
Yeah, we don't need to dwell on that, I don't think.

735
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,600
Yeah, I didn't know if I got it yet.

736
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,060
I'm sorry.

737
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,600
Now, back to WC.

738
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,220
Back to WC.

739
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,740
WC is also known as a water closet in England, which is a bathroom.

740
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,400
Yep.

741
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,460
That is also a very important part of the clue.

742
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,020
Yes.

743
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,480
Right there.

744
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,540
The WC clue.

745
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,520
If you don't like it-

746
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,560
Water closet SB in Cleveland.

747
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,280
Now, who are we just that figure out?

748
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:17,280


749
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:17,280


750
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,540
We just figure out what SB stands for.

751
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:19,960
Some bitch.

752
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,360
That's it.

753
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,360
You can say that, right?

754
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,880
Because S-U-M-B-I-T-C-H, that's not a word.

755
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,920
So, you can say it.

756
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,780
If it's not a word, you can say it on the radio, right?

757
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:30,520
Oh.

758
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,600
Galacondale.

759
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:32,540
Galafondale.

760
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,080
Pan-ca-ta-ra-pa-da-da-da-da-da.

761
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,260
Talafondale.

762
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:39,760
Pashna.

763
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,040
Kal-tin-ki.

764
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,660
Sim-pan-de-f-o-na-ya.

765
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:47,100
Gal-e-s-ma-ta-la-man-gen-ya-o-b-ra-ta-ka-na-s.

766
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,760
So, back to the subject of Africanized killer deer.

767
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:02,500
Have you had any trouble with those in Ashtabula?

768
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:08,920
Well, just as out in the lovely metro parks of Cleveland, out here in the sticks, yes,

769
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,460
they had a deer kill, I think it was last Sunday.

770
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,140
Maybe it wasn't a couple weeks ago.

771
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:16,940
Is that what they call a-

772
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,080
Was it a-

773
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:17,900
A public hunt.

774
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:18,860
A public hunt.

775
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,360
Can't say that.

776
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,560
Yeah, don't say that fast.

777
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,800
A public hunt.

778
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:26,640
No, they're not having a deer problem of any kind because the winter apparently killed

779
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,840
a whole lot of everything.

780
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:28,900
Yeah.

781
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,920
There's articles about the many things that was killed and various new-

782
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:40,340
Oh, they find old hobo skeletons wrapped up around deer skeletons all mummified and-

783
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,580
Trying to get warm.

784
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,420
What a way to go.

785
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:42,460
... shooing on twigs.

786
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:42,700
Yeah.

787
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,480
Having to hug a deer to get a little-

788
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,580
A dead deer.

789
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:46,900
A dead deer.

790
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,380
A deer that starved to death.

791
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,080
Well, wait a minute.

792
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,900
Why didn't he just eat the deer?

793
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:56,780
See, you made me think of that now, and that is not a very pretty picture to paint.

794
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,040
I have a talent for that, don't I?

795
00:31:59,320 --> 00:31:59,740
No, it is not.

796
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,740
I visualize things and then I share them with people.

797
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,420
And then they feel sicky, sicky in the-

798
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,480
And then all the listeners need buckets, yes.

799
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:08,660
Yes.

800
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,960
I can see this humor now.

801
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:17,080
If you were to literally take the dead deer and put it up on your body, kind of a-

802
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,080


803
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,080


804
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,080


805
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,080


806
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:23,460
Kind of so like the horns and the head were up above your head, maybe perhaps like a mentally

807
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,520
ill native of some tribe that we've never heard of before.

808
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,640
Right.

809
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,460
That was standard procedure, dance around with a deer skull or a bear skull on your

810
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:39,840
head and represent the spirit of the deer or the bear or the kangaroo or the-

811
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,260
Right, right.

812
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,080
... hobo or whatever.

813
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:41,620
Yeah.

814
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,100
Yeah.

815
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,840
The spirit guide.

816
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,100
And see, I always mistook that for like the and these other tribes and stuff

817
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:53,720
like that who were like cargo cults and used to wear like the underwear of Westerners on

818
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,200
their head, like boxer shorts and-

819
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,880
The subgenius tribes would wear the skull of a golfer.

820
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:08,260
The shamans would wear a witch doctor outfit that had the skull of a World Cup golfer over

821
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:13,740
their skull, which wasn't hard to do because subgeniuses often have tiny little heads.

822
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,920
Pressing company excluded unfortunately.

823
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,720
Yes, unfortunately.

824
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:26,200
Unfortunately, some are microcephalic and others just macrocephalic and we're in the macro realm.

825
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,040
Our heads are too big for our feet.

826
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:28,940
That's right.

827
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,940
Like an old blues song.

828
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:30,840
Top heavy.

829
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,660
Lord, my head's too big for my feet.

830
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,400
Mm-hmm.

831
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:34,880
Mm-hmm.

832
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,120
Lord, Lord, Lord.

833
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,820
That's the part I was just like, I'm not saying it's like I'm not.

834
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:43,820


835
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:43,820


836
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:43,820


837
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:43,820


838
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:43,820


839
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:43,820


840
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,740
and little turnarounds and stuff like that.

841
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:50,660
The guy would take his encrusted claw that I can

842
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:54,340
and dab it into the interior parts of the round hole guitar.

843
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,720
Sometimes if there was an infall,

844
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:59,560
it had to be like kind of a kung fu

845
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,280
or some sort of martial arts move.

846
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,320
He usually brought the house down.

847
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,440
Of course, there was construction going on next door

848
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,060
and explosives in the basement.

849
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,860
Who knows how far it really went.

850
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,320
I feel so sorry for the listeners.

851
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,320
Half of them are trying to listen to what,

852
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,980
trying to translate Dave,

853
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,420
and the other half are listening to the elevator music

854
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,680
Rolling Stones in the background.

855
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,080
The Rokeville Orchestra performs the hits of the Rolling Stones

856
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,200
is what's in the background.

857
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,420
It's something, it was a CD that little Pope S. Pantiera

858
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:39,260
didn't want anymore and donated to the church,

859
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,220
and here it is.

860
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,620
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

861
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,020
But I can't even hear what song was playing.

862
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,440
Angie.

863
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,000
Angie.

864
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,080
Angie.

865
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:50,380
Angie.

866
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,660
Yes, there it is.

867
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,520
There it is.

868
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,060
Manger.

869
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,320
I need to give you a bath.

870
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,360
Manger.

871
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,220
I think it was Jagger.

872
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:08,980
It was Jagger.

873
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,460
You're scratching.

874
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,340
Dandruff.

875
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,400
You shouldn't do that.

876
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,920
It is the entropy of Boris now.

877
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,680
It's like when he goes on the next tour,

878
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,080
he's going to be angina.

879
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:30,520
We started the show with the Muzak version

880
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,640
of Sympathy for the Devil in the background,

881
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,440
and that caused me to remember when

882
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,100
Einstein's Secret Orchestra used to play

883
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,340
Sympathy with the Devil.

884
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,640
Only Dave would invent completely new,

885
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,180
new lyrics.

886
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,420
Oh, please.

887
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,500
You know, like a chorus.

888
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,800
Everybody else would be going,

889
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,300
woo, woo, woo, woo,

890
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,500
and Dave would be coming up with all new things

891
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,200
you didn't know about the devil.

892
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,380
If only we could have understood things.

893
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:58,960
Yes.

894
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,280
Yeah, and if I could have, too,

895
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,200
I mean, I could have capitalized it

896
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,240
and been on Fox News or something like that

897
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,260
and got a couple availabilities every month

898
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,260
and stuff like that

899
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,860
and moved into the socket.

900
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,620
And then got my check every once in a while

901
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,320
from Root Baby.

902
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,140
That's what we call them here at Fox Central.

903
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,280
We call them Root Baby.

904
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,720
You know, Dave, if you changed your stick,

905
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:26,340
you could probably be on Fox News

906
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:31,240
and other Foxy shows, I guess.

907
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,580
You could kind of neocon it a little bit.

908
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,320
Well, maybe, or I don't know.

909
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,280
You could be, they would have,

910
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,220
they'd have like a conservative

911
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:40,220


912
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,360
and a liberal,

913
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,740
and then they'd have you.

914
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,880
A surrealist.

915
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,520
It's a really great and wonderful place,

916
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:50,020
and America should really remain true to its ideals

917
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,600
of greed and envy,

918
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,640
and especially of malicious warfare.

919
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,040
And that's the main thing about America,

920
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,040
and I like the way the flag day there.

921
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,040
Of course, I'm not a citizen,

922
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,860
but my voice makes you believe me.

923
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,880
Or something like that.

924
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,280
Yeah, only that wasn't a very American-sounding accent, man.

925
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,960
No, man, I was trying to...

926
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,220
You're supposed to sound...

927
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:10,840
You're supposed to sound...

928
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,280
You're supposed to sound more like an American.

929
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,380
You know, say...

930
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:14,560
Okay.

931
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,560
And you have to learn to pronounce the word

932
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,200
narcissistic like this.

933
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,200
Narcissistic.

934
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,400
You gotta say it like that real fast.

935
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:25,760
Me!

936
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,780
Because you know who's...

937
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,420
Everybody knows about Obama.

938
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,480
Yeah, there you go, like that.

939
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,380
Wow.

940
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,260
Wow.

941
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,220
How would they know that, though?

942
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,600
How would they know if Obama is narcissistic or not?

943
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,780
Unless they were high...

944
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,920
Under his bed sometimes

945
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,860
to see if he was looking at himself in the...

946
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,900
I mean, you know.

947
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,200
Oh, he just looks that way.

948
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,440
I was telling Pappy,

949
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,400
I was telling Pappy,

950
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,040
I don't know if I want to move back to Texas.

951
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,780
More than 50% of people there

952
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:58,280
think Obama's a Muslim from Kenya,

953
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,120
and he said,

954
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,200
well, I think he is Muslim.

955
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,700
I said, why?

956
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,480
He says, it just seems like one.

957
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,900
On the other hand,

958
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,380
I saw a comment yesterday,

959
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,880
you know, that...

960
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:09,740
that...

961
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,080
that...

962
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:10,280
the...

963
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:10,680
the...

964
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,280
the traitorous superhero

965
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,880
that we traded the...

966
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,800
the...

967
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,440
the other superheroes for.

968
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,980
We traded five superheroes

969
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:21,040
for one traitorous, cowardly superhero.

970
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,180
Well, his parents, right?

971
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,180
Looked like...

972
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,220
kind of like old hippies.

973
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:25,300
Yeah.

974
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,140
Well, the mom's kind of hot

975
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:27,980
for an old gal.

976
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,400
And the dad has a long red beard.

977
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,840
I saw some guy comment,

978
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,400
he looks...

979
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,120
see that beard?

980
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,720
He looks like a Muslim to me.

981
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:36,720
And I thought,

982
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,680
well, what does that say about Duck Dynasty?

983
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:38,980
Duck Dynasty.

984
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,580
That reveals it.

985
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,340
They're Muslims.

986
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,840
That's why they have those beards.

987
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,260
It's not because they're hillbillies.

988
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,660
It's not because that's how

989
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:48,220
the super cool people in Arkansas look.

990
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,060
No.

991
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:49,960
It's because...

992
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,080
Byron.

993
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,640
Fundamental.

994
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:51,960
No.

995
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,800
It's because they're Muslims.

996
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,640
With a rifle in the back.

997
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,020
They're Muslimics, man.

998
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,000
Copy of the holy book in the car.

999
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,580
That's right.

1000
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,700
Duck Dynasty.

1001
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,100
And ZZ Top.

1002
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,360
They're Muslims, too.

1003
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,640
I guess so.

1004
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,460
They got that beard.

1005
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,220
They got the beard.

1006
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,220
And funny hats.

1007
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:06,720
Right.

1008
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,200
Sometimes they have a funny hat.

1009
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,520
Hey, I'm not wearing my funny hat right now.

1010
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,000
I'm no good.

1011
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,600
I was afraid I didn't want to get shot.

1012
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,300
It's really sick,

1013
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,240
especially if you're a Sikh,

1014
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,940
which isn't Muslimic in any way, shape, or form,

1015
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,220
but they wear kind of a turban.

1016
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,260
So they're fair game for mean old redneck ladies

1017
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,240
with handguns.

1018
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,600
Well, mean old redneck ladies

1019
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,260
especially like to blame Christian Arabs

1020
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,880
who are right in the middle of everything like that.

1021
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,280
Those are the ones you have to...

1022
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:38,560
I don't know.

1023
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:40,580
Yeah.

1024
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,940
Yeah, it's sad.

1025
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,240
And then there's the poor Nazi, communist, socialist,

1026
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,760
pagan Masons

1027
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,400
that everybody puts them down,

1028
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,760
especially if they're gay.

1029
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,720
Well, remember, it is only a social club

1030
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,460
and you don't have to wear your party pin

1031
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,980
at every meeting and stuff like that.

1032
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,580
What, the Masons?

1033
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,060
The Masons?

1034
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,300
Oh, they've got you so full.

1035
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,780
Is that true with the pointed hats

1036
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,720
and stuff like that

1037
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,040
or is that just kind of like...

1038
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,380
Well, they wear those fez.

1039
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,200
Hey, there's another thing.

1040
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,220
They wear fez like people in Morocco.

1041
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,580
You know who lives in Morocco?

1042
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:18,960
Muslims.

1043
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,540
Islam, yep.

1044
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,280
Islam.

1045
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:21,980
Islam.

1046
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:27,080
Oh, man.

1047
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,780
Mary had a little Islam.

1048
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,060
It fleeced us in the know.

1049
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,100
Well put, well put.

1050
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,580
Yes.

1051
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,540
And every time I ate some beans,

1052
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,800
I suddenly had to go.

1053
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,080
Okay, you're ruining it there.

1054
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,340
Okay, I'm sorry.

1055
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,760
You're like really deep, man.

1056
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,720
I predicted that somebody would say the phrase

1057
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,580
I'm sorry during this show.

1058
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,260
However, I think I picked the wrong person.

1059
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,380
Well, what does the term political paucity mean?

1060
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:05,060
I can't put paucity and political together.

1061
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,620
Political paucity?

1062
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,920
Give me an example.

1063
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:14,180
The political paucity of the paupers,

1064
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,020
of the nimbobs.

1065
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,620
Oh, God, I've got a terrible headache now.

1066
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,240
Oh, my neck.

1067
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:30,800
It's called the sound of a right-wing radio.

1068
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,880
Oh, my God.

1069
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,340
I can't stop.

1070
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:34,820
Oh, my God.

1071
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,360
Oh, getting those jowls shaking.

1072
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,760
I don't have that much jowl.

1073
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,980
And so I have to shake my head really violently.

1074
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,060
And now I'm kind of dizzy.

1075
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,640
Yes, the poor listeners didn't get to see the performance

1076
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,440
that I get to see in this radio station.

1077
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:59,060
Reverend Stagg makes his voice go like this.

1078
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,560
Oh, you don't do it.

1079
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:00,860
It'll hurt.

1080
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,940
You don't have anywhere near enough cheeks to do that with.

1081
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,360
You have to have a big old saggy jowl.

1082
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,300
So you can...

1083
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,400
It's good to wear like a short sleeve shirt as well

1084
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,440
and have like the arms.

1085
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:16,940
They go...

1086
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,660
Right along with it.

1087
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,680
Hey, I heard a bunch of cats make the subgenie sound

1088
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,500
like when they see bugs in mine doors.

1089
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,880
Not exactly.

1090
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,820
It's not like...

1091
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,900
I'm sorry.

1092
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,960
You need to change the subject.

1093
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:34,860
No, that's okay.

1094
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,360
It can be the funny noise show.

1095
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,260
Yeah.

1096
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:38,880
Yeah.

1097
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,240
I'm out of funny noises.

1098
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,040
I've...

1099
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,240
In my head...

1100
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,060
No, no.

1101
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,760
There's no such thing as being out of funny noises, Stagg.

1102
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:48,760
Not at all.

1103
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,540
Sit down and put your feet up on the huff and just relax.

1104
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,900
We're going to teach you how funny noises influence our lives

1105
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,900
everywhere and every day.

1106
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,340
We hear these sounds and many more every day in our lives.

1107
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:12,860
On the way home from school or uptown, it's always...

1108
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:23,720
And all these wonderful noises have meanings

1109
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:27,920
that only the inner ear and the open eye and the third nostril can...

1110
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:44,780
This show's really going downhill.

1111
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:50,580
I'm sure the last few stations that still play this show are probably getting second thoughts.

1112
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,980
Hey, Stagg used to edit these things a lot tighter.

1113
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:59,720
Now it seems like he's just trying to get a show done every week.

1114
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,380
Yeah, what gives?

1115
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,660
He's not spending a week and a half on each show like he used to.

1116
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,780
Yeah, what's his emphasis on...

1117
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,840
salivary glands and the endocrine

1118
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,220
system.

1119
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,440
That's what I want to know.

1120
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:14,700
Well, they are

1121
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,540
sloppily done now.

1122
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,900
It's because, you know why?

1123
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,300
You've just said hell with it all.

1124
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,540
You've got that right.

1125
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,220
That happened

1126
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,580
the last pledge drive at WCSB.

1127
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,960
That was when I finally said,

1128
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:28,820
that's it, had enough.

1129
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,360
I care exactly as much about

1130
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,360
those listeners as they care about this

1131
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,200
show. However,

1132
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,860
outside of the WCSB

1133
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:40,720
pledge drives, the Hour of Slack

1134
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,560
does occasionally

1135
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:43,800
get a donation.

1136
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,440
And?

1137
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,480
Although there haven't been many of those lately,

1138
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,940
when they do come in,

1139
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,620
that helps me get out of bed.

1140
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,500
I feel like I can

1141
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,740
afford to get out of bed

1142
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:57,360
once a week or so.

1143
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,260
Two very burly gentlemen

1144
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,820
from Kingston that

1145
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,500
you claim you

1146
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,980
met some time ago.

1147
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,680
Yeah, that was Dr. Drummond

1148
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,860
and his son, Byron.

1149
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:12,580
Byron?

1150
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:13,520
From Kingston.

1151
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,760
So he was the famous poet?

1152
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,840
Right, Lord Percy Shelley, Lord Byron.

1153
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,500
He was married to

1154
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,580
Frankenstein's daughter.

1155
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:22,960
Oh.

1156
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,100
Mary Shelley Stein.

1157
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,800
Mary Shelley Stein.

1158
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,580
Did you ever see the movie?

1159
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,200
I'm sorry.

1160
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:34,400
Two? I'm sorry so far.

1161
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,400
Sorry, go to three.

1162
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,080
Okay, go ahead.

1163
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,600
You know, I just wondered

1164
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,900
about the Lord Byron

1165
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,560
thing there, if you've ever seen

1166
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,300
the movie Dead Man by Jim Jarmusch.

1167
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,180
Yes, I have.

1168
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,780
That's right, there's...

1169
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,800
Did he think he was Byron

1170
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,140
or Coleridge or something?

1171
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:57,060
I wasn't caring about either one.

1172
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,580
What about Dead Man?

1173
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,320
What about Jim Jarmusch?

1174
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,460
That was a great movie.

1175
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,200
Well, the hero,

1176
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,340
the Indian guy,

1177
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:06,680
thought that the...

1178
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,540
the guy who had been wounded

1179
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,520
and was traveling around

1180
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,160
trying to die and stuff like that,

1181
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,660
he said his name was Byron

1182
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,000
or Wordsworth or Coleridge.

1183
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:15,840
Oh, no, William Blake.

1184
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:17,560
Blake, yes.

1185
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,360
Yeah, William Blake.

1186
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:22,140
The Indian was a big fan of the poet.

1187
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,040
No, not William, whatever, Blake.

1188
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,440
Yeah.

1189
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,060
And Johnny Depp

1190
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:31,700
just happened to have that name.

1191
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,900
It was funny because

1192
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,120
Johnny Depp's character

1193
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,760
originally came from the movie.

1194
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,040
He's from Cleveland in that movie.

1195
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:38,980
He goes out west

1196
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:40,320
and has a terrible time

1197
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,120
and he's dying.

1198
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,520
And the Indian says to him,

1199
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:47,000
Blake, you are about to go

1200
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,820
where the souls go

1201
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,960
when their life is done.

1202
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:52,280
And Johnny Depp goes,

1203
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:53,900
Cleveland?

1204
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:01,360
That was a very atmospheric

1205
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,120
black and white western,

1206
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,220
I believe made in 1999,

1207
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:06,160
maybe?

1208
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,360
With a beautiful soundtrack

1209
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,000
done by, of all people,

1210
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,740
Neil Young on a silver-toned guitar

1211
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,340
and a silver-toned amp

1212
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,480
from the late 1950s.

1213
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,040
Was it Neil Young?

1214
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,020
I thought it was Ry Cooter.

1215
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,340
No, that's Little Big Man, I think.

1216
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:19,620
Yes.

1217
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:20,080
Right.

1218
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,960
It was Neil Young.

1219
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,080
Okay, yeah, that was a really good,

1220
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,380
that had a great score.

1221
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,960
And there's a wonderful scene

1222
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,020
where Johnny Depp falls in

1223
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:35,180
with three cross-dressing bandits.

1224
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:35,620
Bandits.

1225
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,720
Or, you know, it's like

1226
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,700
Billy Bob Thornton, Iggy Pop,

1227
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,420
and some, who's the other actor?

1228
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,000
I can't remember.

1229
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,340
And they get all gay over,

1230
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,700
Billy Bob Thornton's going,

1231
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,100
how do you get your hair like that?

1232
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,880
I just can't do anything with my hair.

1233
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,320
He's just feeling of Johnny Depp's hair.

1234
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,080
He's wearing this stupid wig

1235
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,200
and a gingham dress.

1236
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:01,420
I just can't do nothing with my hair.

1237
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,300
Did you know it was also

1238
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,100
Robert Mitchum?

1239
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:05,840
Was it Mitchum's last movie?

1240
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:08,420
It was.

1241
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:09,680
Yeah.

1242
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,720
But just seeing Iggy and...

1243
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1244
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,620
Now I can't even remember.

1245
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,080
I didn't know.

1246
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,780
He was the mean pappy.

1247
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,320
He was the mean pappy

1248
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,000
who sent for Johnny Depp

1249
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,940
and then he screwed him

1250
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,320
and Johnny Depp...

1251
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,340
Oh, that's right, yeah.

1252
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,400
The mean boss man.

1253
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,480
Who hires,

1254
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,020
just like your jobs, Dave,

1255
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,320
where you go all the way

1256
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,120
across the country

1257
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:34,440
and he goes,

1258
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:34,960
well, it's going to be,

1259
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:36,020
you know, $2 an hour

1260
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:37,080
and somebody...

1261
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,140
We already gave the job

1262
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:38,880
to somebody else.

1263
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:39,560
You're going to have to turn around

1264
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,300
and go back to Cleveland.

1265
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:42,320
God.

1266
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,440
And that crazy actor guy

1267
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,320
that's Steve Siddick's buddy.

1268
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,440
What's his name?

1269
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:52,320
Crispin Glover.

1270
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:53,260
Yeah, yeah.

1271
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,160
George McFly.

1272
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:55,440
Crispin Glover

1273
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,620
had a creepy thing

1274
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:58,560
at the beginning of it.

1275
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,460
He's like the coal shoveler

1276
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:01,020
of the train,

1277
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:02,360
so he's in blackface.

1278
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:02,900
Yes.

1279
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,380
And he says,

1280
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:05,560
this is where you're going.

1281
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,680
Nobody ever comes back from there.

1282
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,200
Something like that.

1283
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:12,880
That's a great movie.

1284
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:14,300
I think that was shown at X Day.

1285
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,140
I think.

1286
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:16,960
I think it was awesome.

1287
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,280
I think Dr. Dark showed that at X Day

1288
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,400
and the drive-in.

1289
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,700
You know, we have a drive-in

1290
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,220
at X Day festivals

1291
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,700
when the world's about to end.

1292
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:25,760
For some reason,

1293
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,020
at a campground,

1294
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:27,820
people decide,

1295
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:30,000
oh no, let's watch DVDs.

1296
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:31,740
World's about to end.

1297
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,980
We're at a beautiful campground.

1298
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:33,880
Let's watch TV.

1299
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,660
And although it is,

1300
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,960
I got to watch Big Man Japan

1301
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,740
laying on the stage.

1302
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,060
Watch, you know,

1303
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,860
with the screen

1304
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,480
gigantically huge in front of me.

1305
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,040
That was great.

1306
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,700
It really is pretty groovy.

1307
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,920
And we'll have the drive-ins this year.

1308
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,720
I think Dr. Dark's planning to be there.

1309
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,440
And if he doesn't,

1310
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,100
which is unthinkable,

1311
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,520
hell, I will.

1312
00:49:59,180 --> 00:49:59,660
Somehow.

1313
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,980
Even if I have to do finger puppet,

1314
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,120
shadow puppets on the screen.

1315
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:06,140
We're subgeniuses.

1316
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:06,760
We can do that.

1317
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,660
I'll do the finger puppets

1318
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:10,000
and Hal can do the voices.

1319
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,060
And if you can,

1320
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,880
if we can get you there somehow,

1321
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,160
then you can do the strip tease.

1322
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,100
Yeah, Dave, and the pole dance.

1323
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:22,060
I could do like a punching Judy thing

1324
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,480
with doing all three parts.

1325
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,120
Dave can be the pole

1326
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,360
and I'll be the pole dancer.

1327
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,580
Can you imagine that?

1328
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,220
I would look so sleek

1329
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,740
in little underwear

1330
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:32,920
like they wear

1331
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:33,720
in those,

1332
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,680
those shows.

1333
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,200
And Dave would be so upright

1334
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:36,920
and stiff.

1335
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,940
And I would just slink around him

1336
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,240
and climb up and down him

1337
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:41,960
like a snake.

1338
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,460
Princess Wee seems to think

1339
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,220
this is a funny thing to envision,

1340
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:48,860
but you can see things like that

1341
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:51,180
at X-Day and at Starwood.

1342
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:51,940
They have,

1343
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:52,880
Princess Wee,

1344
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:53,760
don't laugh into the mic.

1345
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,620
Oh, I'm sorry.

1346
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:55,320
There is a,

1347
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,800
isn't there a pole dancing thing

1348
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:58,140
at Starwood?

1349
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:58,420
That's the fourth.

1350
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,520
I'm sorry, by the way.

1351
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,380
There have been pole dancing

1352
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,220
events at X,

1353
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:04,480
at Starwood Festival.

1354
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:05,160
Absolutely.

1355
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,140
Yes.

1356
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,380
Well, see, normally

1357
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,880
when we think of pole dancing,

1358
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:14,140
we think of polkas

1359
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:14,860
and mazurkas

1360
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:17,420
and real fast dance music

1361
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:18,340
like that and stuff.

1362
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:20,540
Oh, yeah.

1363
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:21,420
They changed everything.

1364
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,380
It's all different now.

1365
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:23,760
Yeah.

1366
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,340
One of the most popular dances now

1367
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,400
is called the puppy dog.

1368
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,360
Think about that.

1369
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:30,780
Well, what does that involve?

1370
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:33,100
Well, you use your hands,

1371
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:33,200
you use your hands,

1372
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,900
like little paws up on the door

1373
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,520
as you're trying to get into the house

1374
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,240
as you're dancing.

1375
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:37,980
Are you serious?

1376
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,460
Yes, it's the puppy dog.

1377
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:40,920
I guess I haven't been watching

1378
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,600
my YouTube enough lately.

1379
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,820
I guess cultural decline

1380
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:46,540
has reached the LCD

1381
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:47,920
in every way possible.

1382
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,660
I've seen the puppy dog.

1383
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,340
So what is twerking, Princess Wee?

1384
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,740
Can you demonstrate that for me?

1385
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:55,340
No, not right here and now,

1386
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,280
Reverend Stang.

1387
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,480
I don't think that it would be

1388
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,940
appropriate at this juncture.

1389
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,540
I feel like such an idiot.

1390
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,540
I've never seen,

1391
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:03,120
believe me,

1392
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:03,440
believe it or not,

1393
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
I've never...

1394
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:05,760
I laughed at him.

1395
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,940
I've never even seen

1396
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:08,680
child pornography.

1397
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:10,500
Honest to grobs,

1398
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:11,900
I've never laid eyes

1399
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,000
on child porno.

1400
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,020
I've been cruising the internet

1401
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:18,020
for nigh on to 94.

1402
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,920
And yet I still...

1403
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,840
In fact, the closest thing

1404
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,700
I ever saw was something

1405
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:24,820
my son showed me.

1406
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,080
He said,

1407
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:28,140
my buddy got this off

1408
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,080
his dad's computer.

1409
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,200
His dad's a cop.

1410
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,100
Oh, Princess Wee.

1411
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:33,680
Princess Wee was just

1412
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,660
kind of twerking.

1413
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:35,660
You were twerking?

1414
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:36,280
Yes.

1415
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,620
Well, what is twerking?

1416
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:39,760
Is it just like somebody

1417
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,160
talking and they can't

1418
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:41,900
pronounce it right?

1419
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:43,760
I don't know if I can

1420
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,220
describe what I just saw.

1421
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:46,300
It's not normal.

1422
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,240
It's not something

1423
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,240
I see very often.

1424
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:49,500
You twist someone's underwear,

1425
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:49,920
right?

1426
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:50,960
You grab their underwear

1427
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,540
from behind.

1428
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:52,420
You twist it?

1429
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:53,820
No, no, no.

1430
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:54,800
Now, that's a wedgie.

1431
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,120
That's a wedgie.

1432
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,240
Yeah, twerking is a dance

1433
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,000
thing that old people

1434
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:02,160
do to make young people laugh.

1435
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:04,940
Isn't there like a

1436
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,920
Hillary Clinton twerking YouTube?

1437
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:09,340
John McCain twerking

1438
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:11,580
and all that kind of

1439
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:12,900
whatever twerking means.

1440
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,760
Well, Miley entered it

1441
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,240
into our vocabularies,

1442
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:17,500
you see.

1443
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:18,180
Who's Miley?

1444
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,080
Miss Cyrus.

1445
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,420
It started with the Chinese

1446
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,720
Communist Party Central Committee.

1447
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:23,700
Huh?

1448
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,000
Princess Wee's talking about

1449
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,040
modern day youth stars and stuff.

1450
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:31,800
So anyway, we're talking

1451
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,380
about that movie

1452
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:33,080
that came out in the 90s.

1453
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:33,720
It just came out.

1454
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:34,320
Dead Man.

1455
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,620
Hey, have you seen

1456
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:39,460
the new Godzilla?

1457
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,620
Godzilla versus

1458
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:41,760
the Smog Monster?

1459
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,340
It's subgenius time control.

1460
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,640
Yeah, exactly right.

1461
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,160
You even get to walk

1462
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:49,780
in the theater

1463
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:51,640
and it only costs $7.

1464
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:55,920
Actually, yeah.

1465
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,420
What did we pay?

1466
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,320
We went to a movie theater

1467
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,440
this year, didn't we?

1468
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:02,320
I believe it was more

1469
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,020
like $11.

1470
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:03,400
$11.

1471
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:04,000
Yeah.

1472
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:05,100
Oh, well.

1473
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,920
And that wasn't the 3D style.

1474
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,480
No, that was the cheaper version.

1475
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:10,700
Yeah.

1476
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,360
Because now you can get

1477
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,100
a movie like,

1478
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:14,380
how can you get it?

1479
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:17,920
Normal, flat, 3D,

1480
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:19,100
animal style,

1481
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:20,600
Christmas style,

1482
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,420
and what, smothered,

1483
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,440
smashed, battered.

1484
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,200
They have as many kinds

1485
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,540
of movie formats now

1486
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:30,200
as Waffle House has

1487
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,300
of hash browns.

1488
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,100
And you don't even need

1489
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:32,860
the special glasses.

1490
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,280
But they're really expensive.

1491
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:34,980
Yeah.

1492
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:37,420
They have the movies

1493
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:38,520
that you don't need

1494
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,640
the special glasses for.

1495
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,940
You have to cross your eyes.

1496
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:41,700
Oh.

1497
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,120
Hey, it's five minutes

1498
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,040
until the end of the show

1499
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,140
and I have a five-minute

1500
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,680
Susie thing I'm going to play.

1501
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,780
So that's the end.

1502
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,640
That's the end.

1503
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,600
Well, I'll just go

1504
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,740
across my eyes

1505
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,100
and see everything in 3D

1506
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,700
for as long as I possibly can.

1507
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,740
That's how the kids do it.

1508
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:59,640
That's how the kids do it, Dave.

1509
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,800
Dave, I think we've been cut off.

1510
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,080
Reverend Stang is cut off.

1511
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:03,680
He's cutting us off.

1512
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:04,580
No, not yet,

1513
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:05,520
but I'm about to.

1514
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:07,120
Suddenly.

1515
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,340
I don't feel bruised,

1516
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,600
but I do feel used.

1517
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:16,940
Welcome, welcome, my friend.

1518
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:23,040
On and off the road for fun

1519
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:29,200
We forgot why we came here

1520
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,880
We have quit all

1521
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,360
All of our jobs

1522
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,140
Like a headlight

1523
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:41,220
Friday, dear

1524
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:47,100
He has lit the sacred pipe

1525
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:53,600
And he's smiling at us now

1526
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:58,040
On and off the road

1527
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,840
He's gone

1528
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,680
He's gone

1529
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:03,060
He's gone

1530
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,360
He's gone

1531
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:08,120
We are his town

1532
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:13,540
That hurt, Bob.

1533
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:14,760
Bob, where are you?

1534
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:16,120
Where are you?

1535
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,560
Friend of Bob's.

1536
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,240
He pointed to an unobtrusive object

1537
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,240
the size of a radio.

1538
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,500
It had Bob's fingerprints all over it.

1539
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:26,480
I found my fingerprints and not yours.

1540
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:27,860
He and I both agreed

1541
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:29,060
that Bob's not a nice person.

1542
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,580
It's funny because it's true.

1543
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,000
That was enough for them.

1544
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:39,560
Oh, but you know, you can write for free information from the source itself.

1545
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:47,040
Oh, the memberships have finally notched up to 35 bucks.

1546
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:54,200
You haven't been well-worn for the past couple years, but hey, what price off-planet survival anyway?

1547
00:56:55,500 --> 00:57:01,140
But if you're craving enough to be sniffing around for some free information,

1548
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,420
grab your pencil.

1549
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,020
Just write to Bob.

1550
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:21,860
He's waiting to hear from you at the Subgenius Foundation at P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1551
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:26,400
Or he's as close as your keyboard at subgenius.com.

1552
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,940
And hey, admit the truth to yourself now.

1553
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,080
You know you'll be coined.

1554
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:37,160
You're going your way to the head of the line to buy a membership when the atomic heat rays are so close they're welding your butt cheeks together.

1555
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,960
Oh, but don't come crying to me.

1556
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,560
I can't wait for X-Day.

1557
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:45,240
I love the taste of human flesh.

1558
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,760
I just haven't had it cooked yet.

1559
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:56,320
We get down and dirty in this church because religion happens to be a dirty, dirty business.

1560
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,960
This church is a lot like an old car sometimes.

1561
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:01,020
Isn't it?

1562
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:04,220
But it's the dirt that's the only thing that's holding it all together.

1563
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:10,660
And Bob, Bob is the bondo that keeps our sagging bumpers up.

1564
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:16,380
Isn't that the one thing that we're here for after all, sneakers?

1565
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:18,800
The dirt.

1566
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:23,940
Oh, so let's dig in and dish it up.

1567
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,740
It's crammed packed with minerals, too.

1568
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,100
So don't settle for the poop du jour.

1569
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:37,840
Excremeditate your troubles away with the armor-piercing slack of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1570
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,660
God almighty, I'm full of it.

1571
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,160
But I'm going to let it go.

1572
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,440
And you've got to let it go.

1573
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:57,720
Dear friends, just as sure as you can bet it, one of those two greatest guys up there is going to let go just as you is letting go.

1574
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,700
Bob, what's Miss Presky's heat?

1575
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:01,260
So far.

1576
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,120
Right, Jack?

1577
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:05,460
Yes.

1578
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,360
Well, how do you feel, Miss Presky?

1579
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,200
Sick.

1580
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,340
Oh, well, you can afford it now, love.

1581
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:19,500
But like the good book says, there are bigger deals to come.

1582
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:20,700
Oh, Christ.

1583
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:49,900
OK, thank you, Max.

1584
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:50,640
Oh, come on, now in a brilliant condition.

1585
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:50,640


1586
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:50,640


1587
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:50,740
Look, I have about 22.

1588
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:50,780
That big one of thoseLast somebody brought their little ladies Forbes recently.

1589
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:50,780


1590
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:50,960
AW citizen.

1591
00:59:50,960 --> 01:00:00,680
AW citizen.

1592
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:16,500
I hope things work out the way you want them to.

1593
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:18,200
Thanks, Bob.

1594
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:19,860
I'm hoping, too.

1595
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:21,880
No, Connie, no!

1596
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,120
Oh, crap!

1597
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:25,200
It's on fire!

1598
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:25,720
Great.

1599
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:26,820
Now what?

1600
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:29,220
Good night, Seekers.

1601
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:37,060
Oh, sire, there is no more money.

1602
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,520
We gotta get some money.

1603
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,740
That dirty, purgish, hark-a-back, flackin' wharton,

1604
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:45,040
fill-a-bunker-burton, purk-a-loom-a-burton,

1605
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,300
durk-a-bustin'-a-law!

1606
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:51,260
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show,

1607
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,780
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough

1608
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:57,560
to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1609
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:59,400
And not just this show,

1610
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,680
but some genius people,

1611
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,640
and all the other archive sites.

1612
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:06,120
But if you truly love Bob,

1613
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:09,700
and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1614
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:13,720
you should go to subgenius.com front page,

1615
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,200
or especially the radio page,

1616
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,220
or the catalog store pages,

1617
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,540
and help out financially as best you can.

1618
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:24,880
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1619
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:28,520
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1620
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,200
But some of you,

1621
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:31,500
still have jobs.

1622
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:34,820
Even five bucks makes a big difference,

1623
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,800
even if it's only once a month,

1624
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,360
from enough of you.

1625
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,740
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1626
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,100
All we're saying is that,

1627
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:47,780
blowjobs could go the way of stevejobs,

1628
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,540
if you don't pay Dobbs.

1629
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:53,140
We also take checks and money orders to,

1630
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,080
Subgenius Foundation.

Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1637
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,800
