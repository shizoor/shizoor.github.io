1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
You know, so Reverend Stank, I didn't know Reverend Stank here is an ordained minister.

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,820
You can actually imagine.

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,940
Yeah, I'm not just, well now, even if I was only ordained in Church of the Sepp Genis,

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,540
as far as I'm concerned, that would be perfectly legit.

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,160
I don't know if you've ever looked at a marriage certificate, but they don't ask what religion

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,200
or denomination the preacher is on most of them.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:31,020
But, just to cover myself, I did get ordained in the Universal Life Church.

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,660
Yeah, my friend, I think it happened to him too.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,760
Yeah, he's married out a few of my friends.

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:36,580
Universal.

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:37,700
Yeah.

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,920
They'll ordain anybody.

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:40,820
For free.

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:41,640
Yeah.

15
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,700
For free?

16
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,080
Yeah.

17
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,420
Man, free sounds good.

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,680
That whole lot in this life you can get for free, right?

19
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,960
The boss is cussing.

20
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,180
In order to become tenuous.

21
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,560
Tax exempt, you have to follow a lot of strict rules.

22
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,480
And that's the part we Sepp Genis' don't do.

23
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,420
We're not tax exempt.

24
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,340
Okay.

25
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,440
In fact, technically we're what you call a novelty sales company.

26
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,420
I know.

27
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,200
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

28
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,140
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

29
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,500
No trouble.

30
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,440
A human.

31
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:19,940
Recording.

32
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,300
Everything's going fine.

33
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,160
No trouble.

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,660
And now you are ready for the final 200,000 mile voyage to the moon.

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,840
Stop right there.

36
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,800
Intensifying our prospects' desires.

37
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,920
That's when the wheels of action begin to move.

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,820
Sorry for jumping in, doctors.

39
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,440
Go on.

40
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,520
Dr. Dobbs is known worldwide as a foremost spokesman for Christian and family values.

41
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,200
He has a plan to attend this rare personal appearance of Dr. Dobbs.

42
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,440
It's his second in the past four years.

43
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,260
He wants to make a top10 proud concretely hits who has them at Work and Ecosyne.

44
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:04,240
Even if you never intend to write your name again, one sure way to impress folks is to stay a little over their heads.

45
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,220
Because it was better than looking stupid.

46
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,260
It's natural that we followed this circle.

47
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:14,500
Around and around and around, helping to create a nice round world of confusion and misunderstanding.

48
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,440
Resist the temptation to feed your ego.

49
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:24,180
Well we take our initiates and we string a little tendon between their heels and drag them three times around the temple.

50
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,180


51
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,180


52
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,420
the radio station before beginning.

53
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,000
Then we dip them in the sacred water of the slot.

54
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,100
And what exactly does this do for them?

55
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,380
Well, it causes them to forget everything they've learned

56
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,200
and it prepares their mind for the slate-like impression,

57
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,080
the imprinting of the true subgenius.

58
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:44,080
Welcome, dear friends, to the subgenius hour of Slack.

59
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:53,380
Slack, Slack, Slack, Slack, Slack, Slack, Slack, Slack, Slack, Slack, Slack, Slack, Slack,

60
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,260
Slack, Slack, Slack, Slack, Slack, Slack, Slack, Slack, Slack,

61
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,200
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind

62
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,920
every time you say, see, hear, or think

63
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,620
that's your key phrase,

64
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,900
It will,

65
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,900
Ticker the entire message without your being aware of it.

66
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,720
Repent. Quit your job. Slack off.

67
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:39,000
Driven to the brink of false sanity by the conspiracy's false reality

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,500
and the pressure of a crumbling world?

69
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,700
Then this may be for you.

70
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,600
Eternal salvation.

71
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,180
Or triple your money back.

72
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,500
The Church of the Subgenius

73
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,620
bring you another 33 minutes of condensed,

74
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:09,120
uraglic functions over the quality audio-visual techniques

75
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:15,500
exacerbated and complicated by The Church of the Subgenius.

76
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,100
Is it possible that the end of the world will come in July 1999?

77
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,160
Perhaps in the form of an atomic holocaust?

78
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,560
Such a forewarning of ultimate doom could generally be dismissed out of hand.

79
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,560
The White House will confirm an order to use the atom bomb.

80
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,120
And our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.

81
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,040
Those missiles have all gone off.

82
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,620
They pushed all apart!

83
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,580
You know what that means, don't you?

84
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,420
Either we fired first and they're going to try to hit what's left,

85
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,520
or they fired first and we just got our missiles out of the ground in time.

86
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,760
Either way, we're going to get hit.

87
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,560
So what are we still standing around here for?

88
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,160
Of course, since all human life has been under the surface,

89
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,580
of Earth for 16 years,

90
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,200
there was no actual loss of life in the sense we know it.

91
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,260
What you see or what you get?

92
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,900
What the hell do you expect?

93
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,680
Pretty red roses.

94
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,620
White puppy noses.

95
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,420
Mammoth proper hoses in his small naked.

96
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,540
The strange worshippers pull at their faces.

97
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,480
Despite himself, a strangled cry escapes Brent.

98
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,100
As he sees the ghastly heritage of atomically,

99
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:24,640
and creatively getsawaying T- reaviation.

100
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,200
Hey, Tony, let's have some.

101
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:33,860
I mean, hell, this turned the other cheap,

102
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,360
saying he'd been carried a bit too far, you know.

103
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,500
Hey, neighbor, let me give you some advice...

104
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,880
The Russians are about to pulverize us

105
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,040
if I sleep tonight.

106
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,260
That is, if the crazy Arab persist Please do not sleep tonight.

107
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:46,280
unpowerfully

108
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:46,280


109
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,180
Don't get up first, and the fire will rain down from the sky.

110
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,040
The fire will rain down from the sky.

111
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,620
People die, people die, people die, people die

112
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,560
I love you

113
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,300
All the flying saucers are my friends

114
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,300
Cause they're so nice

115
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,680
I'm gonna see them again and again

116
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,500
Is that before or after the bob pills?

117
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,720
Lock your door

118
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,820
Turn off all the lights

119
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,280
Turn off your radio

120
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,520
Turn off your TV

121
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,780
Well, no, don't turn...

122
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,880
We do not have everything under control

123
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,000
Don't turn your radio off just yet.

124
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,920
That would be overreacting.

125
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,020
We do not have everything under control

126
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,840
We need radio now as never before.

127
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,920
As never before.

128
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,580
The saucers are coming.

129
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:00,320
In this emergency, listen carefully to your radio to know what to do.

130
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,280
We're shouting.

131
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:24,680
That's good.

132
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,260
Who was shouting?

133
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,140
Welcome to the program.

134
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,860
The governor, the soon to be governor of Ohio, Rottenheart.

135
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,960
Of Sportsland.

136
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,880
Well, no, he really did run for Senator.

137
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,980
He hasn't given up his political career.

138
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,480
He was a squiggly Rottenheart.

139
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,260
He actually got 22 votes and he was a write-in candidate.

140
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,400
He wasn't even on the ballot and he got 22 votes and he doesn't even have 22 friends.

141
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,400
Right.

142
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,140
Even on Facebook.

143
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:50,920
Doesn't explain anything.

144
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,260
At least in his congressional district.

145
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,700
It just doesn't pay attention.

146
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:59,020
It's just a picture of him and his name and it doesn't say what he stands for or believes

147
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,400
in.

148
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:04,560
See, he's the only candidate then who is not trying to pull any kind of BS on anyone.

149
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,520
He just doesn't say anything.

150
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,400
Yeah, he's pulling the wool over his own eyes.

151
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,920
He manages to be the only politician who doesn't lie by not saying anything.

152
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:19,300
He told me his dream was to roller skate past Barney Frank in the halls of...

153
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,720
Well, he'd better get a move on.

154
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,280
Yeah, he's running out of time.

155
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,340
Barney's retiring.

156
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:23,680


157
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,420
He's running out of time.

158
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,680
When you're supposed to mention your platform, in his case, it would be like put in here or

159
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,860
fill in here or brief description here for the person to fill in.

160
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,920
That's why he has the wheels.

161
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,140
He needs to go faster.

162
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:41,780
He's a warm, mellow, yellow fascist from Norway, weighing 345 pounds, equipped with a Gouda

163
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,600
cheese hat and a heart full of soul.

164
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,240
You know Rottenheart.

165
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,300
Oh, heart full of soul.

166
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:46,560
Yeah.

167
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,600
I didn't realize that you two had met.

168
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,660
That's a pretty good description of him.

169
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,640
Not in a flesh.

170
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,040
Especially the Gouda cheese hat.

171
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,440
Yeah.

172
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:53,680
Yeah.

173
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,820
I mean, the first time I met him, he was wearing a stained bathrobe and a pair of tidy

174
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,640
white Ascent, was eating a pork chop on a stick.

175
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,280
It was good enough for Rottenheart and it's good enough for me.

176
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,340
I said, this is a man who knows how to live.

177
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,500
And a big can of ALA.

178
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,920
A big cheese in a small pond.

179
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,060
Yeah, he wants to be both for me and I'll be the big cheese, see?

180
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,580
So take another caller here.

181
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,460
You're on the air.

182
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,160
Hello.

183
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,040
Thoughts on the end of the world, No Money Mark.

184
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,340
Hello there, caller.

185
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,360
Hi, caller.

186
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,020
This is the legendary No Money Mark.

187
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,960
Yeah, I'm glad you're going on early tonight because I had a whole bunch of stuff

188
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,160
to bring up with you.

189
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,600
Okay, first-

190
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,220
We'll take it as seriously as we possibly can right now.

191
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,100
Okay, I'll try and get through this stuff quickly.

192
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,200
Okay, first, this Colorado Springs thing.

193
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:47,880
Okay, every time there's a natural disaster, the strike says that God is punishing the

194
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,640
city for something like Orlando.

195
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,720
Well, Colorado Springs is the Republican part of Colorado.

196
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,360
That's right.

197
00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:01,740
They're the headquarters of the Air Force Academy and folks on the families.

198
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,440
Only what they did to piss God off.

199
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,380
One can only wonder.

200
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:13,600
Actually, I made a little mashup for Colorado today, if you heard earlier in the program.

201
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:13,840
I heard it.

202
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:13,960
It's great.

203
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:21,920
By the way, between this and the heat wave, who's going to say now that there's no global

204
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,300
warming?

205
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,960
The same people that always said that.

206
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:31,300
The same people who are being paid well, to say it, from America's extraction industries.

207
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:31,940
What?

208
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,380
Yeah, like Philodrum and-

209
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,360
Yes, like Philodrum and-

210
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:35,800
He's taking pay, a lot.

211
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,220
He's in the dental industry.

212
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,440
Yep, they support him and they're going to send him back to college.

213
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,620
Yeah, you might as well work for the dark side.

214
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,340
...hose that men wear once they reach the age of 43.

215
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,460
His youthful hose well shrunk.

216
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,280
He saved for his son.

217
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:52,280


218
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,200
Skinny shank.

219
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,280
You're not talking about temple vestments or anything.

220
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,140
...right down to size.

221
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,320
Leader hose.

222
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,800
...more scaring the children.

223
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,820
The mystery of lost and mismatched socks.

224
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,780
Speaking of socks, that was a great book.

225
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,420
It spans generations.

226
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:05,980
Who wrote that?

227
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,500
Who wrote that?

228
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:06,780
Thanks.

229
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,000
That was Dr. Perditas Pedali.

230
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,680
But of course-

231
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,540
That name sounds fake.

232
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,480
I edited it.

233
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:12,600
It does.

234
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,120
It really sounds fake.

235
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,600
Well, it means lost.

236
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,060
Perditas means the lost one.

237
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,000
It means lost sock, as a matter of fact.

238
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,320
He is a lost sock, Dr. Pedali, because his wife Edith left him with a pair of socks.

239
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,520
Anyway, guys, see your children.

240
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,280
We're going to bring them home.

241
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:22,280


242
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,760
I read recently that I found legitimately appalling-

243
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,700
He was red recently?

244
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,500
Well, I guess we can still entertain his opinions.

245
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,080
Something legitimately appalling.

246
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,220
Patriotic as we are.

247
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,300
Red is better than pink.

248
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,840
Red, white, and blue hair.

249
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,560
I'd rather be red than pink.

250
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,540
I'd rather be red-faced than-

251
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,540
The pinks are about to get theirs.

252
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,980
I'd rather be pink than red.

253
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,740
Now, wait.

254
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,140
Guys, the world is coming to an end, and No Money Mark just wants to tell us what's important

255
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,020
now that the world is ending.

256
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,700
Okay, right.

257
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,000
What is?

258
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,260
You know, a case-

259
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:58,040
You know, Kayla Allen, one of the kids who was killed by her own father at that shooting

260
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,940
at the restaurant a couple months ago?

261
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,700
Oh, at the Cracker Barrel in Brooklyn?

262
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:05,980
Yes.

263
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,260
Okay.

264
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:15,080
So, they read this poem that's supposed to be comforting and reassuring at her funeral,

265
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,780
and this is how it ends.

266
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,980
A golden heart stops beating.

267
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,940
Hard-working hands at rest.

268
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,140
Get this.

269
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:27,240
God broke our hearts to prove to us he only takes the best.

270
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,400
Aww.

271
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,500
Well, that's one way to look at it.

272
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,180
Yeah, that's not the way the Christians believe.

273
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:39,600
They believe the worthless bums will be left behind to suffer the wrath of God while all

274
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,000
the Bible thumpers get lifted up into the middle air.

275
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,000
Let us be grateful to God for allowing us to witness such wondrous bloodshed.

276
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,480
Yeah, and not only that.

277
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,260
At the end of the reign of a thousand years of peace comes in, and we get to see the bloodshed.

278
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:52,260


279
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:52,600
I get it.

280
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,800
And not those self-righteous characters who've already been whisked up to heaven.

281
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,060
A one-thousand-year rite.

282
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,040
Yeah, I just have a couple things to say to this, which is...

283
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,080
Thousands of years to come.

284
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:05,860
I'm sorry.

285
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:12,880
Okay, first, God takes everybody sooner or later, and second, okay, this poem makes

286
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,580
it sound like God will a little girl die, you know, just because he feels like it.

287
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,260
I mean...

288
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,240
Isn't that the whole point of being God, is you get to kill people whenever you want?

289
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,240


290
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,460
Yeah.

291
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,060
Yeah.

292
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,680
Yeah.

293
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:23,860
Yes.

294
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,340
The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.

295
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,240
Yep.

296
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,960
And Cotton Mather, a great minister, said that...

297
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,840
You get to stand up there in heaven and say, dance, my little monkeys, dance.

298
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,620
Cotton Mather said that it was only through the grace of God that you didn't, this

299
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,840
instant, fall down into hell, which could happen to you at any time.

300
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:47,200
If God decided to take his support away, whoosh, down you would go into the lake of fire.

301
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,640
And these are the people who started this country.

302
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,640
Sinners in the hands of an angry God.

303
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,020
Wait, that was Winthrop, wasn't it?

304
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,220
I said that.

305
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,160
That's a sadistic God.

306
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:53,960
Yes, it's true.

307
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,580
People like Cotton Mather and those Puritan types were the ones who created this mess.

308
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:57,920
Governor Winthrop.

309
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,400
I don't cotton to that kind of stuff.

310
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,400
Well, you're just not purified.

311
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,080
He just named a bowl evil.

312
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,500
I'm sorry.

313
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,660
A bowl of evil.

314
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:07,720
Okay, I'll make this puzzle.

315
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,980
You know, let's calm down.

316
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,580
I eat a bowl of evil for breakfast every day.

317
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,340
We're all friends here.

318
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,200
It's what keeps me strong.

319
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,340
Okay, I have just one more thing for the night.

320
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,260
I keep hearing that...

321
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,000
So they all say.

322
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,440
... that Morsi is now the president of Egypt.

323
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,220
I guess...

324
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:22,220


325
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:22,220


326
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:22,220


327
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,820
The singer from The Smiths?

328
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,000
It's Morpheus.

329
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,700
He's the sleeper.

330
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,080
I am the president of Egypt now.

331
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,540
Yes, Egypt.

332
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,280
I know it's not the guy's name, but every time they say it, that's who I think of.

333
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,120
From the Muslim Brotherhood.

334
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,040
We heard it when the Muslim Brotherhood's successful.

335
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,260
Okay, you guys, you have a good night.

336
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,320
You too, Mark.

337
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,200
Thank you for your attention.

338
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,200


339
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,200


340
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,200


341
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,200


342
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,200


343
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,200


344
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,200


345
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,200


346
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,200


347
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,200


348
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,200


349
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,200


350
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,200


351
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,200


352
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,200


353
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,200


354
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,200


355
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,200


356
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,200


357
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,160
Thank you for watching.

358
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,180
And here's hoping the saucers will take you with us.

359
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,140
Yes, flying saucers from outer space.

360
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,320
The pleasure saucers will be taking us to Planet X, of course.

361
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:10,140
I know you'll think this untoward, General, but on my way to the project, my wife and

362
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,960
I saw what appeared to be a flying saucer.

363
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,140
Yeah, it sure did.

364
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,680
Nuts and bolts and everything.

365
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,200
See, the flying saucers are actually part of the same little tea set.

366
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,120
That Bertrand Russell's teapot.

367
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,440
They fly, but how well do they land?

368
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,940
It's circling the sun, you just can't see it.

369
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,000
The tales of the teapot and the saucers have been passed down through generations.

370
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,540
Survivors of a disintegrated solar system.

371
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,400
And they want to land and take over.

372
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,600
And they appear to be realists.

373
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,180
And speaking of Martian interchange with Terrans, that's a familiar theme as well on

374
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:58,220
X-1 and Zero Hour and these things people were thinking of pre-Twilight Zone and so forth

375
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,800
back in the late 40s and even into the late 30s.

376
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:09,280
Well, Playhouse 90 gets some sci-fi things if you want to go back to archaic TV.

377
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:16,200
Back in the days of early broadcast television, they still had science fiction teleplays,

378
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,680
which occasionally were shown.

379
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,200
Back then when they were still using the analog signals, when the tinfoil hats came out, they

380
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,320
could actually still protect you.

381
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,340
The Germans had it first.

382
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,100
X is fairly even-sang about it in the radio.

383
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,880
Quite right. The Nazis had TV shows.

384
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:40,560
And it was their fun-filled days of non-recorded all-live programming too.

385
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,500
Of course, somewhat ideologically tainted.

386
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,180
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Deutschland's favorite first family, Adolf and Edo.

387
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,420
Well, in that movie, Contact,

388
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,620
they get the first signals from outer space,

389
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,880
and it's our own television signals beamed back at us,

390
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,140
and it's Hitler giving a speech.

391
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,720
At the Olympics in 1936, wasn't it?

392
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,120
Yeah. The first television signals to leave the planet were Adolf Hitler.

393
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:10,720
And you know what's funny? That song, Interfurer's Face, by Spike Jonze,

394
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:15,340
got a whole new meaning because of some of Hitler's medical finals that were released recently.

395
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,120
Apparently, the man farted constantly, so there he was.

396
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:18,760
So he was like,

397
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:19,620
HALT!

398
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,300
Interfurer's face!

399
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:21,820
Yeah.

400
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,180
Dr. Durbin says,

401
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,200
We is the master race.

402
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,420
Be HALT! HALT!

403
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,100
Right in the Fuhrer's face.

404
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,020
It's a little snore.

405
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,480
Not to love the Fuhrer, he's the big disgrace.

406
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,580
So we HALT! HALT!

407
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,320
Right in the Fuhrer's face.

408
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,780
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.

409
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,700
Is this not the master race?

410
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,340
Yeah, this is the master race.

411
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,560
Is this not the Fuhrer's face?

412
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:52,980
Yeah.

413
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:54,800
Anyway.

414
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,700
That was the earlier Spike Jonze. Not to be confused with the modern day movie.

415
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,760
Movie director, no.

416
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,660
Spike Lee Jonze.

417
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,020
Don't they spell it the third?

418
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,280
Get it all confused and scrambled again.

419
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,440
Doesn't the director spell it differently?

420
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,340
I want the director's cut. Right now.

421
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,420
You're gonna get it right in your face, buddy boy.

422
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,180
I'll cut the director.

423
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,700
You're on the dotted line.

424
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,640
Oh, we are now.

425
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,200
You're changing the environment with your mind.

426
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,720
I need an aspirin.

427
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,960
There's plenty of aspirin where you're going, pal.

428
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,700
You're going straight to the chair.

429
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,640
It'll be a relief to sit down at last.

430
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,500
Stay above your head.

431
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,700
Stupid, a flight in line.

432
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,520
Don't slash these pant legs. I just bought them at Target.

433
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,100
Oh my god.

434
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,400
That's Tarzan, Tim.

435
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,280
Speaking of which...

436
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,520
Now they're a-shaven my head.

437
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,500
Here's how seriously I take the upcoming end of the world.

438
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:50,980
Very good.

439
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,960
I went out and got a haircut.

440
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,140
A professional haircut.

441
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,820
It's the first time I've done that since my daughter was married.

442
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,040
You won't be offended if I tell you I didn't notice.

443
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,240
No, not at all. You're a guy. Why would you notice?

444
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:11,420
I also bought new shoes exactly like the previous shoes.

445
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,000
Same ones I always buy.

446
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,340
Because I'm going to be officiating at two weddings.

447
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,080
So I want to have two really shiny sets of $19 Walmart sneakers with the Velcro straps.

448
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,860
And I bought a new pair of pants.

449
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,280
Just because they happen to be in my size.

450
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,800
That is so rare that even though I didn't need pants...

451
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,280
It's very peculiar. It is so bourgeois. You bought them in stinker, in impulse.

452
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,440
Nobody really needs pants.

453
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:42,420
My waist is four times the length of the legs.

454
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:46,120
Well, a waist is a terrible thing to mind.

455
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,000
...who has only two pair of pants.

456
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,260
You know at a glance by the two pair of pants...

457
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,900
I wear a pair on each leg, pal.

458
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,540
I do not put my pants on one leg at a time.

459
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,760
No, sir, no how.

460
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,080
Well, what does this have to do with Der Fuhrer's television show? I don't know.

461
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:11,180
Well, I don't know. You know, you could get those Nazi kinescopes by ordering it from the back of World War II magazine.

462
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:11,960
And, uh...

463
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,220
I don't know. I never ordered them.

464
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,300
They're on YouTube now.

465
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:17,900
They are?

466
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,420
I'm sure. Why not?

467
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:23,220
Wow. The Gestapo Hour is on YouTube now?

468
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,180
Is there anything that's not on YouTube, is the question.

469
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,220
It's hard to find, uh...

470
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,060
You cannot see the suicide of Bud Dwyer on YouTube.

471
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,780
Not on YouTube. That was taken off.

472
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,480
And you cannot see the hanging of Saddam Hussein on YouTube either.

473
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,980
And it used to be there?

474
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,760
I think it was there briefly. I don't know. It might be there now.

475
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,260
Well, they were worried because Saddam was so well hung, you know.

476
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,600
So it's on Vimeo instead, or Pintube, or RedTube, or something.

477
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:58,040
I broke up with the Internet, and the views and opinions expressed on this program are not necessarily those of WCSB or Cleveland State University.

478
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,400
This is Steve Chen.

479
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,000
I don't even recall expressing any opinions.

480
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,840
He says that all the time, but I don't think he believes it.

481
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,580
These are not opinions. These are facts.

482
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,020
But I think that he does believe it.

483
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,160
I do believe it.

484
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,380
For those of you just tuning in, my guests in the studio are the one and only Dr. Howell.

485
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:13,940
Hi.

486
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:19,640
And we've got Reverend Ivan Stang and Princess We Are Doe and Lonesome Cowboy Dave on the line.

487
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,360
And you can join this circus, too.

488
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,600
Believe me, the bar is not set that high.

489
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:30,940
All you gotta do is pick up your phone and call 216-687-3515.

490
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:38,260
Can you put screwdrivers all the way in through your ear and then all the way back out without any harm?

491
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,260
Harm your brain?

492
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,120
I don't think so.

493
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,440
I can't.

494
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,320
And I can't even stand to watch.

495
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,460
You don't even have ears anymore, darling.

496
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,160
No, I don't.

497
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,000
Look at what the world's done to you. Look out the window.

498
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,260
Those aren't ships coming. Those are giant locusts.

499
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,120
It's the end of everything.

500
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,340
The beginning of the end.

501
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,100
A Bert and I Gordon production.

502
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,180
The Ohio River will turn to blood.

503
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:11,760
And there will be darkness across the land and weeping and gnashing of mandibles.

504
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,460
The firstborn sons in Parkersburg will all have one of their teeth taken away.

505
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,580
And it will be the only tooth that they had.

506
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,780
So it will be tragedy.

507
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,240
By a tooth heterosexual.

508
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,800
These are the curses that will rain upon the Ohio Valley when the saucers come.

509
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,080
All right, basically.

510
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,400
Unforgivable pinkness.

511
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,160
I'm interested to hear from many viewers.

512
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,480
Viewers who can tell us about driving conditions.

513
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,960
The Jenkin fermentation chambers will explode.

514
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,780
What are the driving conditions out there?

515
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,740
Is there still driving rain, for example?

516
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:46,880
No.

517
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:53,260
Brief, there was right where I am about 48 to 59, 7, 11 miles from there.

518
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,960
There was a like a mini storm.

519
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,780
It happened for about three and a half minutes.

520
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,900
And now the sky is clear.

521
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,720
It's very odd.

522
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,800
It left about three raindrops and moved on.

523
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:04,800
Well, you know.

524
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:12,660
The storm that went through last Friday was considered to did more damage than Hurricane Ike did three years ago.

525
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,280
Goodness.

526
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,160
That's really true.

527
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,620
Ohio really has been declared a disaster area.

528
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,240
Southern Central Ohio.

529
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:24,060
Well, it was previously declared mentally unfit for service.

530
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,520
And that's where we're going.

531
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,720
Our car is packed up and we're ready to drive straight into the heart of the hurricane.

532
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,620
Into the very butt of the tornado.

533
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,740
Will you minister to those stricken people staying?

534
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:38,820
No.

535
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,540
Will you bring them boxes of slack?

536
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,820
We will minister to these poor souls in their time of need.

537
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,480
Yes, if they have a buck.

538
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,520
Come on, boys.

539
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,640
Let's all lift this tree off the road together.

540
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,360
We're going to get to Exeter and save the life of the poor.

541
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,720
I did learn there is in fact a tree in the road on the way to Exeter.

542
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,360
What route did you plan on taking?

543
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,360
I had a horrible, horrible time last year trying to find my way there.

544
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,600
Well, I was going to go to the other side.

545
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,180
We did this two months ago.

546
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:13,580
You go down 77 and then you take 70 west toward Columbus.

547
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:21,200
But you turn off at Zanesville and go south through some very, very depressed but quaint small towns.

548
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,740
So is this quicker than taking 77 all the way to Marietta and then taking 7 the rest of the way?

549
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,360
It's probably six, one half dozen of the other.

550
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,620
The GPS said to go the Zanesville route.

551
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:36,180
And MapQuest says to go down to Marietta and Parkersburg.

552
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,620
Yeah, I'm not going through West Virginia again.

553
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,720
That was really scary.

554
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,620
No, no.

555
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,500
What happened?

556
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,920
I guess you're not from Texas, are you?

557
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,140
No, I'm from Cleveland and I'm scared.

558
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,180
Downtown Parkersburg on a hot summer night, man.

559
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,640
Like all these people were walking.

560
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,280
It looked like a great place to buy meth.

561
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,300
Well, I'm sure it is.

562
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,880
And a great place to get a lap dance too.

563
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,140
But I don't know.

564
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,380
The locals just had this look in their eyes.

565
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,600
They'll drive 80 miles an hour up the speed limit too.

566
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,260
And they go through the hills with these speeds.

567
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,120
Like they do in Northern California or Central California.

568
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,700
They drive through these huge mountainous areas like 90 miles an hour.

569
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:28,100
While we lakey people, we beach land people are crawling slowly like,

570
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,920
here comes another turn. We're going down the hill now.

571
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:35,040
That's why we're still alive to tell of it, Dave.

572
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,480
A slight amount of caution is salutary.

573
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,060
I could tell you're from out of town, buddy.

574
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,920
You creeped up off that hill going 20 miles an hour.

575
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,860
What's wrong with you?

576
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,520
You can make that 90, 90 miles an hour.

577
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,500
Who's in such a hurry?

578
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,760
I had a truck come up behind me on curvy roads in Tennessee at night.

579
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:57,880
Where's the fire?

580
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:05,040
It came up on me so fast that had I not been lucky enough to notice a side road,

581
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,720
he definitely would have rammed into me.

582
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,740
I almost rolled my car getting out of his way.

583
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,140
And I was lucky to be able to get out of his way.

584
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:20,860
I have no idea what that guy had in mind aside from pushing me at 90 miles an hour

585
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,280
the rest of the way at this curvy Tennessee hill road.

586
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,120
That was rude.

587
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,060
He was a bit drunken.

588
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:27,620
Yeah.

589
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,640
Well, I don't know.

590
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:34,300
He might have been one of those redneck cannibals that our GPS is always trying to send us into nests of.

591
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:39,720
Yeah, I heard all about those redneck anthropophagists that we've been having.

592
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:44,840
Just face the fact that they're going to be one kind of people and one kind of people only.

593
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,220
And you can't tell me it has anything to do with bath salts.

594
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,140
That's the real lost cause, Roger.

595
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:57,160
That's got a cover story stench to it that set me off the moment I sniffed it.

596
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,540
Kelgon, take me away.

597
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:03,120
Did you use the instrument?

598
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,080
What?

599
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,280
The Klingon bath oil beads?

600
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:11,040
Everybody knows what makes you eat face is toad licking.

601
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,100
You lick a toad and then you eat somebody's face off.

602
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,940
Pure propaganda from non-Batrachians.

603
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,260
That's the whole reason for licking toads is so you can go eat somebody's face off of them.

604
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,660
Why else would you eat somebody's face?

605
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:30,680
And why else would you go to Exeter other than to have some good old fashioned face eating, some face biting going on?

606
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,180
How are you?

607
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:38,760
Some cheek chomping, some nose gripping, some ear sucking.

608
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,560
The apocalypse is nigh.

609
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,360
Pucker your lips for the apocalypse.

610
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,440
It won't be so bad.

611
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,440
And kiss your ass goodbye.

612
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,400
Just calm down. It's going to be alright.

613
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,660
Particularly if you have tithed.

614
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,500
But of course we're not allowed to...

615
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,080
to mention that any more than generally.

616
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:00,480
But if you want to be saved, if you want your bacon to be saved...

617
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,040
Salvation has its price. We just can't say what it is.

618
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:08,340
If you want to live forever in eternal pleasure...

619
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,740
You know, that's not for everyone.

620
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,020
We're not trying to force this on people.

621
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:18,580
You may rather suffer for eternity or a few minutes or something.

622
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,060
Yes, it's entirely up to you whether you wish to...

623
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,040
Bob, I'll make your mind up for you.

624
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,400
...get royal with the rest of the pinks or escape on the...

625
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,320
He ain't gonna tell you what to think. He'll just tell you how to think.

626
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,040
...be given a spacious stateroom on the pleasure saucers of the sex goddesses.

627
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:37,660
But it may or may not be true that your brain is just humming away to the distant sound of all this music

628
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,700
and your body is left down here in a rubble, in the rubble, in the rubble.

629
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,300
What's the difference?

630
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:48,840
Each pleasure saucer is equipped with a greenhouse in which they grow actual Havafrop zippulops.

631
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,820
Yes, they imported the droppings of Tibetan holy men.

632
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,760
For that purpose.

633
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:57,960
But if you don't got a body, how you gonna smoke the Havsaparapilipilop?

634
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:03,360
What you'll have is more real and more concrete than your present body.

635
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:14,180
Your present body is a ghostly affair compared to the solid body that you will have in the next phase of your development as a subgenius.

636
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,420
When the third nostril opens, it can never be closed again.

637
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,480
Yes.

638
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,680
However, it can be poked out with a stick.

639
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,080
Even so.

640
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,900
It can be plugged up with a cork, but who would be so ungrateful?

641
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,920
Well, that's how you get high.

642
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,580
When you put that stick in there.

643
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,000
How do you get the water out?

644
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:33,760
When you put that stick in there, it can trigger the kind of sneeze that is the sort of thing that whole galaxies can be born from.

645
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,460
You can sneeze down to your knees.

646
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,860
And that's what we're all looking for.

647
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,360
You know, when I started my spiritual career, it was something like about 75, 85 years ago,

648
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,660
the first thing I learned was to poke out that third eye, or I mean that third eye, sorry, sorry, that's a different religion entirely.

649
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,420
Poke out that third eye.

650
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,220
Wipe the crud out of your third eye.

651
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,400
And push it, push it very, very hard.

652
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:55,760
And be a man.

653
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,780
Yes. Face it. You're going to have to do it some day or another.

654
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,820
And now is the best time.

655
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,620
Oh, they talk about your third nostril and your third eye and all that.

656
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,860
What about the third mouth? What about your third ear?

657
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,000
I guess nobody cares about that.

658
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,840
I guess it's just not important.

659
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,540
Third ear? No, that just sounds silly.

660
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,180
I could squirt ectoplasm from my third nipple.

661
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,620
It's ridiculous compared to something elevated like a third nostril or a third eyeball.

662
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:30,620
Well, you know, Reverend Stang, it makes them uncomfortable if you describe the necessary morphogenesis that they will have to undergo.

663
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:35,880
Well, I've got seven butt cheeks. I've been butt hurt so many times I had to grow that many extra spans.

664
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:46,380
Well, we pioneers have already adapted to our new configurations, but they may be slightly conservative and wish to retain their former human habiliments.

665
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:51,400
From a sociological viewpoint, it's clear and it's quite clear that the human human hability is not the same as the human human hability.

666
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:51,400


667
00:30:51,400 --> 00:31:04,140
It's quite obvious that growing more than one organ can be very, very effective and helpful in many, many situations that the young or old XEs, the travelers, so to speak, might encounter as they leave this area.

668
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,720
Call in a backup system.

669
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:15,380
Those of you who live with the condition of having seven butt cheeks, you may have encountered social isolation in the past.

670
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:21,380
As a result of this, you may not find public accommodations to be suited to your demands.

671
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:28,820
But in the end, in the end, and the two saucers, you will find the commodes to be very well equipped.

672
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,620
Commodious, in other words. And accommodating.

673
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,400
The seven seats are the right hand of Bob to hold those who've been butt hurt seven times.

674
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,720
And have the seven sheets...

675
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,440
And what a delicious feeling it is to be butt hurt by Bob.

676
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,200
The seven sheets of the sacred scribe.

677
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,600
On my way to the...

678
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,720
Far off, oh Lord.

679
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,300
On my way to the Appalachian...

680
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:51,380
Far off, oh Lord.

681
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,420
Peaks, I met a man with seven cheeks.

682
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,980
Every cheek had seven boils.

683
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,060
But every boil oozed seven oils.

684
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:05,900
And every oil zoomed large and wide throughout the entire Himalayan countryside.

685
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,020
My mouth, he got my mouth watering now.

686
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,060
I'm ready for a...

687
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,640
Now that cheek.

688
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,140
I'm ready for a Shonis.

689
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,140
After hearing about all that oiling.

690
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,480
Mouth, no mouth, here's the best discus, discus, no wish.

691
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,760
There's a number to call if you'd like to get in on this conversation.

692
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,480
Please don't be afraid.

693
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,140
Disgusting.

694
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:22,720
We won't eat you.

695
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,180
We do not eat humans.

696
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,180
No.

697
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,120
Such as beneath us.

698
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,000
Not unduly.

699
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:27,200
We're not unduly.

700
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,260
Very, very afraid.

701
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:37,280
Actually, Dr. Sinister in the X-Day program book, there is a diagram of the...

702
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,480
All animals have the same parts.

703
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:44,200
It shows a human with the leg, feet, there you can see...

704
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,040
The various portions, the edible portions of the anatomy.

705
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,320
You'll notice it leaves the head out.

706
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,920
Most people don't eat the chorizo.

707
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,420
The chorizo.

708
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,080
Yes.

709
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,260
The human chorizo.

710
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,260
That's that famous...

711
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,020
Pamela Anderson.

712
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,760
Pam Anderson.

713
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,000
Yeah, that's who it is.

714
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,280
Yep.

715
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,100
And you could, as if you're going to be eating her part.

716
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:02,360
You know what?

717
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:02,980
We can.

718
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:03,960
We can.

719
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,340
Whichever one of us gets to her first.

720
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,160
I got dibs.

721
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,440
I got dibs on Pamela Anderson.

722
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,860
I'm going to cut her up just like this Dr. Leggian picture here.

723
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,460
I got her.

724
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,460
She's probably already full of some certain embalming agents.

725
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,300
I mean, you can eat human parts.

726
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,160
But it's kind of like eating Twinkies, you know.

727
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,580
Not everybody likes it.

728
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,360
You can't live on that.

729
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,880
You could call it long-term.

730
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,620
It's just a little bit of a treat every now and then.

731
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,580
I generally require higher quality.

732
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:28,940
I suppose.

733
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,840
I mean...

734
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,520
I eat Exists.

735
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,540
Yeah, there you go.

736
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:35,340
Well, now that may cause an incident, an interplanetary incident.

737
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,640
Oh, they give me their cast-offs.

738
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,140
Well, we might be quite tasty for these extraterrestrial beings.

739
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,080
I mean, not might.

740
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,180
I mean, that is a fear of...

741
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:45,220
You are.

742
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:48,180
They actually taught me how to eat Exists.

743
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,280
One of them I've never eaten.

744
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,080
One of them was actually eating himself.

745
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:50,480
How can we eat Exists?

746
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,080
They're so delicious.

747
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,100
He was gnawing on his own arm.

748
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,440
Oh, man.

749
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,120
An Exist for breakfast.

750
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,480
See, and I have to have Shoney's once again.

751
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,880
We're going to have to hit that Shoney's.

752
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,300
I guess.

753
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,240
I do not like green Exists and ham.

754
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,340
Well, never say never.

755
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,900
We can't be conservative in our eating habits.

756
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:16,800
Would you?

757
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,380
Could you?

758
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,200
On a boat?

759
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:18,700
Would you?

760
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,160
Could you?

761
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:19,260
I mean, I'm not sure.

762
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:19,260


763
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:19,260


764
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:19,260


765
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:19,260


766
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:19,260


767
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:19,260


768
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:19,660
I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to eat it.

769
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:19,660


770
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:19,660


771
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:19,660


772
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:19,660


773
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:19,880
I'm going to have to eat something with a goat.

774
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,380
Wild goat.

775
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:26,480
It's so synchronistic, it kind of makes you almost want to fall asleep and barf, and

776
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,780
then not be able to wake up because you've swallowed it.

777
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:30,980
Well, not necessarily.

778
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,700
It is synchronistic, though.

779
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,020
Yeah, okay, I'll bite.

780
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:41,160
But surely there's an antidote for this unpleasant trope.

781
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,680
The Antidote Pudding.

782
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,540
It's tasty and it's delicious.

783
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,440
How do I get me some of that stuff?

784
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,240
As G. Gordon Gordon said, give me the antidote or go to hell.

785
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:49,720
kill me.

786
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,180
That's what you've got to do.

787
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,280
Well, that's going to solve the problem one way or the other.

788
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,440
G. Gordon Gordon will be at the judgment.

789
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,440
He will.

790
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,000
Yes, in fact, he may be at Wisteria right now.

791
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,600
I'm telling you, people have said,

792
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:05,000
why should I go to this particular X day?

793
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,760
And I'll tell you the reason right now.

794
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,940
What we've got is better than a hundred dancing girls

795
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,220
and fire-breathing clowns.

796
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,620
What we've got is elder subgeniuses.

797
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:20,040
Yes, the elder subgenius cadre

798
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:24,820
is going to be there to impart their musty age-old wisdom

799
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,020
onto the young ones.

800
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,000
You must wear a gas mask.

801
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:33,760
Yes, we're going to mold the spirits of those youthful subgeniuses.

802
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,700
With real mold.

803
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,540
And make them ask.

804
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,800
So what happens is actually some elder subgenie

805
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,500
get to a certain point where they're able to actually rejuvenate themselves.

806
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,420
And this is...

807
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,520
Just like Sally.

808
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,560
And spend a long time...

809
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,260
This is where the younger subgenie come from, actually.

810
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,160
...saying things like...

811
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:59,720
Dr. Leguin and G. Gordon Gordon both have been...

812
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,700
Rather than rejuvenating themselves organically,

813
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,520
they've done it mechanically.

814
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,000
And they've also visited the pond across the water.

815
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,740
More machine than man.

816
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,260
Perverted science.

817
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,560
Twisted and evil.

818
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,080
Crucially bionic.

819
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,700
But it is true that they have both visited the pond across the water and returned.

820
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,520
To tell you that it's not much...

821
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,120
I don't know what they told us, but...

822
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,600
Well, they returned.

823
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,600
That's the point.

824
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:21,860
They just returned.

825
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,020
You know, actions speak louder than words.

826
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,340
And I suppose if you're confronted with

827
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,840
either being frozen stiff for a couple thousand years

828
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,000
in a cryogenic laboratory,

829
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,420
or a spaceship with babes crawling all over you,

830
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,840
I mean, what's the choice, you know?

831
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,620
I mean, it's obvious.

832
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,280
Well, you'd think it was.

833
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,660
But, of course, people are free to make their own decisions.

834
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,460
Well, that's the thing.

835
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:50,680
People have this stereotype vision of the pleasure saucers and the exes

836
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,200
as this literal flying saucers and big bedrooms

837
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,720
with babes or studs or whatever and so forth.

838
00:36:59,020 --> 00:36:59,360
And it's...

839
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,040
Well, you said it was.

840
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,600
That is so limited.

841
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:07,360
In fact, the big worry that most people should be concerned with

842
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:11,400
is that their imagination won't give them what they could get.

843
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:16,220
In fact, a lot of people after X-Day,

844
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:20,240
because all they could envision was their shabby apartment

845
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,100
and their crappy job,

846
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:26,240
that's the way their escape planet will be.

847
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,120
It will be identical to what they're used to

848
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,960
because they can't imagine anything.

849
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,900
You've got to think big.

850
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,620
Or maybe they'll imagine some corny Playboy mansion type thing.

851
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:40,320
But, really, you should be ready to envision

852
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,760
and thus create an entire planet

853
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,160
on a latent planet.

854
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,300
Can't be helped, Jacob.

855
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,760
By whatever you would like it to be populated by.

856
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,780
It will have no shape.

857
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,120
It will have no dimension.

858
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,100
You've got to pick a red-haired dame with long, long gams

859
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,960
and giant wing cases.

860
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,080
Such things would be limitations.

861
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,180
And giant wing cases, yes.

862
00:37:59,260 --> 00:37:59,800
Well...

863
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,440
As Bob said, watch two girls making it.

864
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,040
I'd rather be two girls making it.

865
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,240
Well, this will be your chance.

866
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,220
It is so.

867
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:16,220
And remember, you will mate with the sex goddesses.

868
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:19,660
That doesn't mean that they satisfy your present image

869
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:23,240
of what an appealing partner might be.

870
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,400
It's all chemical once you get to that level.

871
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,300
And these chemicals will cause you to follow certain tropisms,

872
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,880
certain behavior, which, involuntary though it may be,

873
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:40,660
will unite you in what must serve you from then on.

874
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,220
A self-contained zygote giving birth to itself

875
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,320
like the Bodhidharma.

876
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,280
I mean...

877
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,060
I think what Dr. Howell means is you'll get used to it.

878
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,000
That's right. You will get used to it.

879
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,740
You may puke a few times at first.

880
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,960
It's like, you know, trying heroin or something.

881
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,320
But after a while, you not only get used to it...

882
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:00,800
I never puked.

883
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,860
Well, I never tried heroin, so I wouldn't know.

884
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,240
I didn't try Oxycontin one time.

885
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,960
It made me feel like Rush Limbaugh for about half an hour,

886
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,180
and then I puked and puked and puked.

887
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,620
And the same thing happened to my friend who took the other half.

888
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:18,380
We both felt like Rush Limbaugh for half an hour, and then...

889
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,540
I actually felt my hearing going.

890
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,560
Hmm.

891
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,620
I actually felt my sternum was filled with flab.

892
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:29,400
Well, I can hear my hearing going all the time.

893
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,980
That's about half of what I hear.

894
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,900
You're supposed to focus on that sound, Stang,

895
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,200
and make it do what you want to.

896
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,960
Like if you wanted to hear something from afar, perhaps.

897
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,820
That's the technique they use.

898
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,160
You could rob banks, or you could fly,

899
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,580
or skyscrapers and stuff like that.

900
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,700
But you have to tune into it instead of avoid it.

901
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,120
Oh, I do tune in.

902
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,860
I hear the cicadas of my childhood all the time,

903
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,040
even on snowy days in northern Ohio.

904
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:00,880
You just gotta focus on the locus and get some traction on the action.

905
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,040
Back to the plagues of Egypt.

906
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:09,020
The same sound effects that they played to indicate Florida in TV shows,

907
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,360
that's just cicada noise.

908
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,000
That's what I hear all the time.

909
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,960
That scratchy sound.

910
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,600
I'm hearing it right now.

911
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:14,600


912
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:18,880
Oh, I can hear music way, way, way in the background.

913
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,460
It kind of sounds like...

914
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,840
This music crept by me on the water.

915
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:29,340
It sounds like the cry of nature, tooth and claw, red as a hammer.

916
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,020
The cry of the rabid baboon.

917
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,140
Tis nature's voice I hear, and I obey,

918
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:38,040
brother to Jove and master of the sea.

919
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,560
Oh yes, I will be able to create planets on my own,

920
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,860
to create worlds.

921
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:47,120
To create worlds of sycophants and to enjoy them.

922
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,120
All this will be mine.

923
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,980
You know what, the way Philo described it,

924
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:56,980
I think it was on one of the Puzzling Evidence shows I was on with you guys.

925
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,160
What him say?

926
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,920
He said, when X Day finally really happens,

927
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,700
he goes, the three of us are going to have the best comic book collections in the world,

928
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,540
all of a sudden.

929
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,900
But you know what, they'll all be the same comics.

930
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:10,660
Hmm.

931
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,480
Ooh.

932
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:18,360
He left Puzzling Evidence out, because Puzzling is not as much of a comic book.

933
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:18,620
He doesn't care about comics, no.

934
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,020
He's not really a comic nerd.

935
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,120
He's a war nerd.

936
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:27,740
What it would be terrible if it was like the third Archie or something like that.

937
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,780
It would be, because that would be, you'd have been cheated.

938
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,560
Instead of getting good comic book, you would have gotten an Archie of some kind.

939
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,720
And not even original, not first edition, just the third one,

940
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,600
of which there were 29 million.

941
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,880
You couldn't even take it to the local X's store,

942
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,800
the collectible guy with the funny hat and the long nose.

943
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,480
The commissary.

944
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:53,740
And say, check this out, man, this could be worth some, well, what's the use of money,

945
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,680
but it could be worth something.

946
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,040
With some creds.

947
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:57,980
Oh, that's an Archie number three.

948
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:04,320
I just, I can see three Archie characters in the room in front of me.

949
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,360
I'm not one of them.

950
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,740
Oh, well, really, I just don't know what to say about that.

951
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:12,960
Well, Dr. Howell looks a lot like the principal in the Archie comics.

952
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,220
You mean Mr. Weatherby?

953
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,440
He's actually the hero of those things.

954
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,560
He has a little Bob Hope nose like yours.

955
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,420
Hmm, old ski nose, eh?

956
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,580
I'll file that in.

957
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,360
Betty, Princess Wee looks like Betty, the nice blonde.

958
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,880
Yeah, but Archie married Veronica.

959
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:28,360
And Jughead.

960
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,980
I knew you were going to call me Jughead.

961
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,740
Yeah, Jughead over at the control panel.

962
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,080
I don't know why.

963
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,480
Well, Jughead was the cool one.

964
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,140
He's like Gilligan on Gilligan's Island.

965
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,320
But Archie married Veronica, you know.

966
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,860
Well, I understand that, but that leaves him as being Veronica.

967
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:44,660
Recently, Archie married Veronica and broke Betty's heart.

968
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,600
So what about that?

969
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,600
Oh, God.

970
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:51,680
Thank the Lord and Dobbs both that I don't keep up with that kind of crap.

971
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,140
Ah, yes.

972
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,160
Well, you know that he...

973
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,720
Yeah, I heard something horrible about Superman and also Green Lantern recently.

974
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,280
Green Lantern is gay.

975
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,660
Yeah, he came out of the closet.

976
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,120
Yeah, Superman, well, Superman had to redo everything.

977
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,620
Frankly, I think all of those guys are gay.

978
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,300
Including the living room.

979
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:12,140
I think that's the whole point of costume superheroes.

980
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,900
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

981
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,320
That's exactly why the Comics Code Authority was created.

982
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:18,700
Yes.

983
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,140
Because the superheroes are all gay.

984
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,960
The sitcom means of persuasion.

985
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,580
The uniform.

986
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,080
The Comics Code Authority.

987
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,300
The seduction of the innocent.

988
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:33,980
Was created to put EC Comics out of business and to ensure that only superhero comics could prevail after that.

989
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:34,560
Right.

990
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:34,980
Yeah.

991
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,320
And then there would only be ubermensch and untermensch.

992
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:43,160
They made monsters illegal and men in leotards mandatory.

993
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:53,920
One could not show the law defeated, the inside of a thigh, drinking alcohol, a whole list of things that were forbidden by the Comics Code.

994
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,100
And look what happened.

995
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,000
And Red Sox is torn there, Superman.

996
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:01,160
Look what happens when you tell somebody they can't do something.

997
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,640
Same with the superhero comics.

998
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,660
Next thing you know, it's Zap Comics.

999
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:12,660
And, uh, which is why I'm sitting here right now, probably.

1000
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,240
Zap Comics.

1001
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,920
Well, one of the reasons you're sitting here.

1002
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:18,980
Yeah, there's a few, but that's one of them.

1003
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:22,480
It's directly the reason that I know Dr. Howell.

1004
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,120
What about the ECs, though?

1005
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:25,920
Those surely were...

1006
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,620
Well, that was actually before my time.

1007
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,740
They had outlawed that stuff before I had the right to read.

1008
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,900
Someone has taken an overview from the Vestiges.

1009
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,640
Hello, you're on the air.

1010
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:34,640


1011
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,140
Did you see before the Comics Code?

1012
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,480
It was indeed. It was not allowed to join the Comics Code.

1013
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,940
They were trying to put them out of business.

1014
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,040
Hello, you are on the air.

1015
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:47,160
Just to give you one quick verification on the Green Lantern thing.

1016
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:53,980
The Green Lantern they have as gay was the Alan Scott Green Lantern from back in the 40s.

1017
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:54,520
Okay?

1018
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,560
The blonde-haired one. Not the Hal Jordan that they used in the movie last year.

1019
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:02,820
He's blonde and he's gay and he's a Nazi. I got it.

1020
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:03,780
Sorry.

1021
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:09,820
No, he's a member of the Green Lanterns. They are interplanetary peacekeepers.

1022
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,800
And they are known to have large orgies amongst themselves as well.

1023
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,220
I guess they'd have to call him Pink Lantern now or something.

1024
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:24,620
Here it goes. See, now I have to put a bleep in the hour slide.

1025
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,640
Why? Because you said Pink Lantern?

1026
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,340
He was going to get married to a guy. They were getting married.

1027
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:32,060
I said they had orgies.

1028
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,600
On an elevated train.

1029
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,740
On an elevated train. And the train went and blew up and killed his lover.

1030
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:39,500
I guess there's supposed to be a moral to the story that way.

1031
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,300
The moral is always check your ticket.

1032
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,240
Yep.

1033
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:52,720
Well, I don't know folks. These are just stories. Stories, that's all. They're parables told by our Lord.

1034
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:59,020
Some people believe that our American superheroes are homosexuals, deviants, and communists.

1035
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,180
This is all the time presented to you by the Moscow Life.

1036
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:04,260
I had a gay wedding in Marple last month.

1037
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:04,880
I'm a homosexual.

1038
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:10,960
That's right. North Star married, uh, it's worse than gay marriage. It was a mutant and non-mutant marriage.

1039
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:11,520
Mutant?

1040
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:11,900
Yeah.

1041
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,800
Oh, well, many marriages are like that.

1042
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:26,240
The revelations to the fountain learned, rose before us, and its prophets burned, are all but stories, which arose from sleep, they told their comrades, and to sleep returned.

1043
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,160
But don't worry. Everything's going to be all right.

1044
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:45,440
Because we tell you so. You can believe it. You can take it to the bank. Whatever happens in the next week, however horrible it may seem, you will be okay.

1045
00:46:45,500 --> 00:47:00,540
Because you're listening to our words now. That little bit will preserve you from the ruck of destruction, the juggernaut of doom rumbling toward you and everyone else this moment.

1046
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,480
Great talk.

1047
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:01,940
Actually...

1048
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:08,160
Actually, I lean more toward the, uh, Zap comics, the one with Captain Fiskums and his pervert pirates.

1049
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:12,260
What about them? You think they're historically accurate?

1050
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,420
Shooter Me Timbers.

1051
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:18,180
He got a number one. He got the one, not the Zap 2, I think it was, uh, Mr. P.

1052
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,460
Yeah, it's not in Zap number one, that's true.

1053
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:24,140
I've got the Zaps, but they're all reprint issues. Not the originals, but I got reprint issues of the Zaps.

1054
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,640
That's all right. You got them.

1055
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,500
Yeah. Yeah.

1056
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:31,880
You can view them. You can look at them, whether, in fact, you can bend the covers back if they're just reprinted.

1057
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,040
For that?

1058
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,840
For that matter, I got a copy of Bob's favorite comics.

1059
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,940
Wow, that's rare, all right.

1060
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:37,560
That is rare.

1061
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,120
Well, we got two issues of that.

1062
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,560
Only one, I fear.

1063
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:50,180
No, we, uh, believe me, Ripoff Press and I both tried. I'm sure Dr. Howell even put in his two cents worth, but, uh...

1064
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,780
Oh, they don't consult me.

1065
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:55,620
Lies was the editor, and he was rather a perfectionist about it.

1066
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:00,480
He refused to do a second issue and mess with perfection.

1067
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,340
Ugh.

1068
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:01,720
Yeah.

1069
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,440
Whatever.

1070
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:03,380
Uh...

1071
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,160
I didn't think it was that perfect myself.

1072
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:13,620
Well, it did have the story One God Too Many, and, you know, I had some pieces in there, and, uh, it had its, its moments, surely.

1073
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:30,460
But, unfortunately, you may not know the story. Almost all the copies of the print run, which was not large to begin with, were destroyed when an illegal Chinese fireworks factory exploded, and a huge fire consumed all those stories.

1074
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:30,460


1075
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:31,480
And, uh, the story was, uh, a little bit of a surprise.

1076
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,000
I didn't know that.

1077
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:32,960
That is true.

1078
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,480
That's an exciting tale.

1079
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:37,680
So, those comics are rare indeed.

1080
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:47,600
Yeah, Bob's Favorite Comics was banned in Canada and New Zealand because of the story that I wrote and Paul McFreedy's illustrated.

1081
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,160
Care Dog Meets Bee Bear.

1082
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,820
Yeah, because they were concerned that children...

1083
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:59,440
And it looked, it did look just like a kid's comic. It even had the, uh, the three My Little Ponies of the Apocalypse.

1084
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:00,160
Uh...

1085
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:06,540
And, uh, and it, uh, the problem was that it had a really depressing ending.

1086
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:07,380
That's true.

1087
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:12,680
And they were afraid that children would buy this pleasant-looking comic book and then be traumatized.

1088
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:17,260
But the cover was certainly not, uh, designed to appeal to children of any stripe.

1089
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,360
They will not be nearly as traumatized as they would be by listening to this program, which...

1090
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:21,560
Yeah.

1091
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:22,660
...is synesthesia.

1092
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:26,920
...portions of the following broadcast will be objectionable to some members of the audience, which is why we advise listener discretion.

1093
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,440
The views and opinions expressed on this program are not necessarily those of WCSB or Cleveland Public Broadcasting.

1094
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,660
We are happy to assist in any way we can to help to support the program.

1095
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:32,660


1096
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:32,660


1097
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:32,660


1098
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:32,660


1099
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:32,660


1100
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:32,660


1101
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:32,660


1102
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:32,660


1103
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:36,220
And, uh, I think now might be a good time to just take a very short break to, uh, change discs at least.

1104
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:36,540
Yeah.

1105
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,120
Yeah.

1106
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:37,540
And, uh...

1107
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,840
Don't say anything funny, anybody.

1108
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:39,680
Don't think anything.

1109
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,100
Oh, my aching discs.

1110
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,120
Dave, did you want to hold on, or...?

1111
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,280
Uh, should I call back, or...?

1112
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:45,920
Whichever you prefer.

1113
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,260
Whatever's easiest for you.

1114
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:47,620
Call back.

1115
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,360
Call back.

1116
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:48,960


1117
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,180
In another five minutes?

1118
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,520
Uh, is 7-12 at 9 again?

1119
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,980
Five minutes sounds just about right.

1120
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:53,860
What is it?

1121
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,500
Five minutes sounds just peachy.

1122
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:55,780
Hey, big five.

1123
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,280
Five?

1124
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:56,620
Five?

1125
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:57,940
All right, then I'll let you go.

1126
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:58,080
Shoot.

1127
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:58,200
Okay.

1128
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:00,600
Okay.

1129
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:01,960
Okay.

1130
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:03,060
Okay.

1131
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:04,680


1132
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:05,780
Okay.

1133
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,140
Okay.

1134
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:10,140
Okay.

1135
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:11,420
Okay.

1136
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:11,540


1137
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:11,540


1138
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:11,540


1139
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:11,540


1140
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:11,540


1141
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:11,540


1142
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:13,800
Okay.

1143
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:27,360
Okay.

1144
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:32,260
Okay.

1145
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:32,700
And we are back.

1146
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,280
Yes.

1147
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,320
Synesthesia on WCSB Cleveland and, uh, two ones out.

1148
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:39,140
No valve viewers in the vest.

1149
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,140
The ESC-SCS, let me know if you'd like to get on the air?

1150
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:42,400
Sounds like Starwood...

1151
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,200
Got an all-star lineup here.

1152
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:45,900
If you're listening to Hour of Sache, this is Starwood.

1153
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:45,900


1154
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,580
Slack, that phone number is...

1155
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:56,880
Yes, make sure it's scrambled so they cannot trace the information.

1156
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:03,740
Well, I don't want some poor old lady in Atlanta listening to, you know, to get a bunch of calls from WREK listeners.

1157
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,840
Well, that's why we put the area code in there.

1158
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,660
It's been known to happen.

1159
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,280
We said 216, not 404.

1160
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:11,680
Well, you know, just in case.

1161
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:20,640
And also, I don't want people calling up some other WCSB DJ and thinking it's the middle of an hour of slack or something.

1162
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,780
Well, that's part of the fun.

1163
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,400
Getting calls for the wrong shows up here.

1164
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,740
Happens all the time.

1165
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,080
People would call up and ask, like, hey, is DJ A there?

1166
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:35,360
See, that never happens to me because I pretty much let everybody know that we only let Dave talk on the show.

1167
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:39,880
We've got somebody else here who is not Dave right now on the air.

1168
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:40,860
People calling up.

1169
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:41,800
One caller show.

1170
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:42,380
Hello.

1171
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:45,120
Demand that you play some tune.

1172
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,240
Hey.

1173
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,080
Hey.

1174
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,260
Drunk Mike.

1175
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:50,420
Drunk Mike.

1176
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,280
It is such a pleasure to hear from you.

1177
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,880
You picked a good night to call in.

1178
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:55,860
How you doing, brother?

1179
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:57,560
Good to hear from you.

1180
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,280
Let's bring our lonesome cowboy Dave on as well here.

1181
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:01,740
Welcome.

1182
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:02,520
You are on the air.

1183
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:05,200
Does Bob look fat in these pants?

1184
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:10,500
P-H-A-T.

1185
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:11,680
Yes, he looks cool.

1186
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,180
He looks very fat.

1187
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,840
What's the new word for cool?

1188
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,220
So, Mike, what are you going to do with the end of the world coming this week?

1189
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:19,000
Cool?

1190
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:20,940
What am I going to do?

1191
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,000
I'm going to bottle my erasure.

1192
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,680
I'm going to sing songs, epithets to the wind.

1193
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,320
Sing in the sunshine.

1194
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,060
I'm going to cry out in the night.

1195
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,200
Yes.

1196
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,060
What are you going to do?

1197
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,880
We're going to prepare ourselves for...

1198
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,300
I'm putting the question to Drunk Mike.

1199
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:37,160
What will you do when the world ends this week?

1200
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,780
Well, I'm going to sit.

1201
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:40,760
I'm going to sit.

1202
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:40,840


1203
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:40,840


1204
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:46,900
I'm going to sit on a porch, drink my natty-datty, and sit back and say...

1205
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,460
That's pretty much what we have in mind.

1206
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:56,760
If anybody could find a way to make do with the burnt-out husk of a shell this planet will become, I think it would be you.

1207
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,380
I ain't worried about nothing, man.

1208
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:04,620
I got a sledgehammer and a natty-datty, and I'm good.

1209
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:09,320
What are you going to do with the sledgehammer when the world ends?

1210
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:10,720
Well, the hammer...

1211
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:11,800
For the zombies.

1212
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,380
Oh, okay.

1213
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,040
I thought you were going to beat the world up.

1214
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,400
No, that's for the zombies.

1215
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,300
The world will beat itself up.

1216
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,220
Yes, that's what's happening.

1217
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,740
The world's kicking its own butt.

1218
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,040
Too hard, too long.

1219
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:27,980
It has a fever.

1220
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:29,040
It takes a lot of flexibility.

1221
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:29,760
It does.

1222
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:32,680
It takes yogic flexibility to make that happen.

1223
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:36,480
I might ride my bike around naked and drinking natty-datty.

1224
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,460
Now you're talking.

1225
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:39,660
Now that's living.

1226
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:40,600
Yeah.

1227
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,080
But what about the face-eating?

1228
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,180
Everybody leaves out the face-eating.

1229
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:47,740
That seems to be a big fad these days.

1230
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:48,860
It's just the last I might need.

1231
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:51,020
I thought that was just for chimps, not chumps.

1232
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:54,480
Chimp on Prozac.

1233
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:55,880
That's another good band name.

1234
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:00,200
I might watch episodes of A Facts of Life and drink.

1235
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,920
There was a great series on called The Nature of Sex

1236
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,160
that was about how animals do it of all kinds.

1237
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,420
And I must say, the thing about fruit bats

1238
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:15,940
was one of the most disgusting things I've ever seen committed to film.

1239
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:17,720
Well, that's because you don't like bats.

1240
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:20,300
I think the best is the California condor.

1241
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,800
You ever see them in the act?

1242
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,400
It is so majestic.

1243
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:27,840
These are like the baneful birds that you're talking about.

1244
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:33,820
Why would California condors be any different from...

1245
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,560
Because they've got a huge wingspan.

1246
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,820
And the male will walk up and spread his wingspan out like,

1247
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:39,060
Hey!

1248
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:40,640
What do you think of this?

1249
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:44,560
And then eventually he'll circle the female a couple of times

1250
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,900
and then he'll get on her back and be flapping with each...

1251
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:48,840
Smell what I've been rolling in.

1252
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,260
Flapping the wings with each thrust.

1253
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,360
Take a whiff of my bald head.

1254
00:54:53,420 --> 00:55:00,400
The California condor is a living relative of the extinct prehistoric teratornus,

1255
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:04,380
which may have been the largest flying bird that ever existed.

1256
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,320
As opposed to flying pterosaurs?

1257
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:11,020
Well, pterosaurs may have gotten bigger.

1258
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:11,500
And griffins.

1259
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:16,880
But the teratornus was as large as a pteranodon, certainly.

1260
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:21,000
It was quite big for a thing with feathers.

1261
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,340
Took up a lot of teratornus.

1262
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:25,700
Teratori.

1263
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:27,660
Teratorian-ness.

1264
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:30,200
They have them on Skull Island, actually.

1265
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,380
Once again, I'm talking about King Kong 1933.

1266
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:37,500
You see it feasting on the knocked down and dying,

1267
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:38,360
but still basically...

1268
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:40,700
He's reliving Tyrannosaurus in the movie.

1269
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:41,840
He didn't even say goodbye.

1270
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:42,960
No, no.

1271
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,140
You start talking about...

1272
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:45,460
Well, I'm just happy he finally called it.

1273
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,160
Mike, why should he say goodbye to him?

1274
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,040
Some people never can say goodbye, reasonably.

1275
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,880
Subgeniuses never say goodbye.

1276
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:55,340
I have windscreen Mike in front of me.

1277
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:57,660
Being a subgenius means never having to say goodbye.

1278
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,380
Or you're sorry.

1279
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,200
That is the problem, though.

1280
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,260
If you think of it, eschatological, not eschatological.

1281
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,240
Eschatological.

1282
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:06,900
Subgenius.

1283
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:07,360
Eschatology.

1284
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,040
Subgenius means never saying goodbye.

1285
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:11,100
Never having to say, here's that money I owe you.

1286
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:15,740
It means never having to say goodbye to earthly pleasures,

1287
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,420
but an increase in earthly pleasures.

1288
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:20,440
It's quite a different thing than most going around.

1289
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:21,960
The world is suffering, of course.

1290
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:22,540
Well, that's the promise.

1291
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:23,780
Which we all may or may not accept.

1292
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,740
But the end is suffering in a physical body of some kind

1293
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:30,120
with all the rewards that you could reap from that.

1294
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:33,840
I mean, all the material and physical rewards you could reap from that.

1295
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:35,740
I mean, who gets promised that?

1296
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,920
Only those who have those bodies.

1297
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:42,720
So sensuously avid to continue these sensations.

1298
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,160
But this is just a...

1299
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:47,440
I don't even know if I should say this, but it's a come on.

1300
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:48,880
An advertising come on.

1301
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:51,180
You have to get the people to do it.

1302
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:55,380
No, when you move on, your new body isn't going to want the same sensations

1303
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:58,940
as your primitive, old, earthly body.

1304
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:04,300
Why, that would be sort of, you know, retarded or differently abled,

1305
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,160
as we'll say in the new world.

1306
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:07,200
It'd be a waste.

1307
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:08,000
Yeah.

1308
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,040
You'd be able to appreciate it.

1309
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:14,120
You'd be able to appreciate some much more bizarre, weird, twisted pleasures.

1310
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:20,700
Indeed, you may feel far greater levels of pain than you could ever feel in this life,

1311
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:21,780
and as a matter of course.

1312
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:26,740
But you won't mind, because you will be a more advanced being.

1313
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:27,900
Oh, you'll pay extra.

1314
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,260
Yes, you'll like it.

1315
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,560
The unimaginable.

1316
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,020
Dance the dance of tears and pain.

1317
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:37,220
Loud lightnings shall lash upon your limbs

1318
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,900
as you turn the whirlwinds.

1319
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:41,360
Loose upon your anvils.

1320
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:45,320
Now, in exchange for otherworldly levels of pain,

1321
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,220
you also get to experience otherworldly orgasms as well,

1322
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:49,740
which is a fair deal.

1323
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:50,600
It's a fair trade at the end.

1324
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:54,080
Some are indifferent to these and have called them either orgasms.

1325
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,280
And if you see somebody running around in flames screaming,

1326
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,620
that doesn't mean that they're actually in pain.

1327
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:06,180
No, that means you somehow accidentally got to burning instead of wisteria.

1328
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,880
Screaming in pleasure in many cases.

1329
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:09,760
You're on the air.

1330
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,360
Flesh and grips from their bodies.

1331
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,980
Hello, is this WCSB?

1332
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,020
Yes, it is.

1333
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,520
This is Doc Zeronius.

1334
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:20,100
Well, what do you know?

1335
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,660
I just wanted to say goodbye.

1336
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:28,600
I understand that I might be the first subgenius to say goodbye,

1337
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:30,760
so I didn't want to miss that opportunity.

1338
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:34,480
Oh, I'm sorry that we couldn't say goodbye to you in person.

1339
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:34,920
Yeah.

1340
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:38,820
We were really hoping you and tawdry milk toast would be able to make it.

1341
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,560
Oh, yeah.

1342
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,220
Well, I'm not in Kansas.

1343
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:44,480
Right.

1344
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:50,940
And the excess will get to you, what, three hours later than Tuesday is the new thing.

1345
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:51,580
Now, I guess.

1346
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:52,640
Yes.

1347
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:54,240
Exist Tuesday.

1348
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:58,340
All of my excess in Texas lasts 24 hours.

1349
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:07,480
It starts in the middle of the Pacific at the beginning of the time zone near Samoa and or Togo.

1350
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:08,500
Actually.

1351
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:11,340
And it's and then it's the earth.

1352
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:14,540
The saucers just line up and let the earth turn under it.

1353
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,880
They're geosynchronous.

1354
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:17,240
Right.

1355
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:28,340
So we would we should be able to watch, say, for instance, the world ending in Australia on our TVs in Ohio.

1356
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:38,000
By the same token, Zeronius and tawdry in Portland would be able to watch New York burn, for instance.

1357
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:38,420
Right.

1358
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:39,580
And Ohio, of course.

1359
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:40,000
Yeah.

1360
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:41,440
Before it gets to them.

1361
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:41,780
Right.

1362
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,460
It's the party of the millennium.

1363
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,960
And by the way, New York will burn.

1364
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:47,540
It'll burn, friends.

1365
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:48,300
It'll burn.

1366
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,420
Sire, there is no more money.

1367
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,880
We gotta get some money.

1368
00:59:55,140 --> 01:00:01,300
That dirty, Turkish, hark-a-back, flackin' wharton, Philip Bunker Burton, Perkaluma Burton, Thurton Buston.

1369
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:01,860
I don't want.

1370
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,180
B-O-B.

1371
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,620
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show.

1372
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,260
And we're even more glad that we're here.

1373
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:08,380
We're even more glad that we're here.

1374
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:08,400
We're even more glad that we're here.

1375
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,400
I know that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple

1376
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:12,940
of months.

1377
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:17,960
Not just this show, but Subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1378
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:25,920
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you, you should

1379
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:32,520
go to Subgenius.com front page or especially the radio page or the catalog store pages

1380
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:35,860
and help out financially as best you can.

1381
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:38,380
Now, we know what it's like to be a member of the subgenius.com community.

1382
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:38,760
I'm Bob Bunker, and I hope that's something that you're excited to do.

1383
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:38,760


1384
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:38,760


1385
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:38,760


1386
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:38,760


1387
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,900
There's a lot of people that have been on the brink of total poverty, and we don't

1388
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:43,880
want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1389
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:46,960
But some of you still have jobs.

1390
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,000
Some of you still have jobs.

1391
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:53,760
Even $5 makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1392
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,160
$50 makes an even bigger difference.
