1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,900
Where you can believe, Mr. Picker.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,340
My name is Pick.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,040
Or you could accept the fact that this city is headed for a disaster of biblical proportion.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,740
What do you mean, biblical?

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,340
What he means is Old Testament, Mr. Mayor.

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,480
Real wrath of God type stuff.

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:14,800
Exactly.

8
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,980
Fire and brimstone coming down from the skies.

9
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,480
Rivers and seas boiling.

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,740
Forty years of darkness, earthquakes, volcanoes.

11
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,400
The dead rising from the grave.

12
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,580
Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together.

13
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,820
Mass hysteria.

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,120
Enough, I get the point.

15
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,480
But what if you're wrong?

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,520
If I'm wrong, nothing happens.

17
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,400
We go to jail.

18
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:40,420
But if I'm right, you will have saved the lives of millions of registered voters.

19
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,980
I don't believe you're seriously considering listening to

20
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,760
The Self Genius Hour of Slack.

21
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,600
Get him out of here.

22
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,020
Raise your hand and recite after me.

23
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,940
Raise your hand and recite after me.

24
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,100
I will promote divisions and wars among nons of genie.

25
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,980
I will promote divisions and wars among nons of genie.

26
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,300
I will work to cast out the false prophets.

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,460
I will work to cast out the false prophets.

28
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,040
I will work to erase the conforming instinct.

29
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,560
I will work to erase the conforming instinct.

30
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,300
I will work for time control in my own life.

31
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,920
I will work for time control in my own life.

32
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,660
I will work to become an overman.

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,740
I will work to become an overman.

34
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,460
I will work for my own sake to preserve this planet from destruction except for the proper reasons.

35
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,920
I will work for my own sake to preserve this planet from destruction except for the proper reasons.

36
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,960
I will work to unmask the conspiracy and install strict anarchy or formal chaos.

37
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,880
I will work to unmask the conspiracy and install strict anarchy or formal chaos.

38
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,600
I will work to placate the stark fist of removal.

39
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,680
I will work to placate the stark fist of removal.

40
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,320
I will work to extend subgenius endurance by indulging in excesses of every kind.

41
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,740
I will work to extend subgenius endurance by indulging in excesses of every kind.

42
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,420
I will work to prevent humanity from ever acting with a common will.

43
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,780
I will work to prevent humanity from ever acting with a common will.

44
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,820
I will work to grip the reins of evolution.

45
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,620
I will work to grip the reins of evolution.

46
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,680
I will work to welcome and exploit the angelic host from planet X.

47
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,140
I will work to welcome and exploit the angelic host from planet X.

48
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,300
I will work to meet the needs of subgenius everywhere whenever ever I may.

49
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:31,120
profits myself. I will work to meet the needs of subgeniuses everywhere whenever I promise myself.

50
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:41,040
I will give all my money to me. Well, that's always where it sort of falls apart, ain't it,

51
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:52,460
dear friends? This is your host and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang, and, you know,

52
00:02:52,460 --> 00:03:00,020
the power of Bob, the power of Bob's left me. I'm tired. I've been working too hard,

53
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:07,780
way too hard. I don't have a script. I don't have a plan for this show.

54
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:15,380
There isn't going to be any creativity on this show tonight. And, you know, if you think this

55
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:22,440
following show is bad as comedy, just to think how bad the religion it's all been,

56
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:29,960
all about must be. Tired, tired, tired. Well, the fist will be in the mail tomorrow. It

57
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:36,720
really will. Has to be. And the Arise video copies aren't here yet, but they will be this

58
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,180
week. And we'll, yeah, every six minutes we'll do something.

59
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,120
More, more.

60
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:41,680
Every time I sit down on my kingdom's throne and reach out for the good book that will

61
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,260
save my soul.

62
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,900
Save me from the lodges of conspiracy.

63
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,880
Save me from the chains of time.

64
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,580
Save me

65
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,620
From the men in black

66
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,260
It's never subgenius

67
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,660
Must have slack

68
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,780
Praise Bob

69
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,060
Praise Bob

70
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,900
Praise Bob

71
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,880
Praise Bob

72
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,540
Praise Bob

73
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,340
Praise Bob

74
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,980
So relax

75
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,280
In your own delusion

76
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,120
Find a place to hide

77
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,640
And reach your confusion

78
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,800
Save me

79
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,880
From the clutches of conspiracy

80
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,720
Save me

81
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,960
From the chains of time

82
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,400
Save me

83
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,740
From the men in black

84
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,160
It's never subgenius

85
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,800
Must have slack

86
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Praise Bob

87
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,040
Praise Bob

88
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,960
Praise Bob

89
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,900
Praise Bob

90
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,780
Praise Bob

91
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,640
Praise Bob

92
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,440
Yes, dear friend, I'm sorry.

93
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:22,440


94
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:22,440


95
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:27,020
It's true that, as the walk-ins say here,

96
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,760
every subgenius must have slack.

97
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,920
Unfortunately, that's not always...

98
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,880
I mean, they must...

99
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,900
Oh, we must, yet we cannot.

100
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,040
We must, yet we cannot,

101
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,040
as the hero of Robot Monster

102
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,320
had to say over and over again.

103
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,460
He had to kill the girl,

104
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,880
but he could not.

105
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,560
And he didn't.

106
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,440
And he shouldn't.

107
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:52,700
He shouldn't have,

108
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,740
because he got in big trouble

109
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,200
for not killing that Earth girl.

110
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,540
Shut up!

111
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,540
There.

112
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,060
Oh, no.

113
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,640
Now another one starts up.

114
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,440
There's no escape from the subgenius bands.

115
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,320
Actually, this one in the background is

116
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,920
Monty Canson,

117
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,780
the Neoist song.

118
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,600
Well, let's just listen to it.

119
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,600
Every six minutes

120
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,820
We need superheroes

121
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,020
Every six minutes

122
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,800
Is a nuclear war

123
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,540
More, more

124
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,720
Crucifixions

125
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,160
More, more

126
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,700
Fashion shows

127
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,700
More, more

128
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,280
Video games

129
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,280
More, more

130
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,080
Every six minutes

131
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,000
Must be a new orgasm

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,500
Every six minutes

133
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,320
Must be total joy

134
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,920
Every six minutes

135
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,720
Must bring new miracles

136
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,300
Every six minutes

137
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,120
We need more and more

138
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,840
More, more

139
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,860
Crucifixions

140
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,940
Crucifixions

141
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,280
More, more

142
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,940
Passion shows

143
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,960
More, more

144
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,300
Video games

145
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,160
More, more

146
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:17,460
Yeah, well, as much as I agree with Monty Canson,

147
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,080
who can't sin, you know,

148
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:28,820
I'm gonna, uh, we, you know, we can't let you actually start to enjoy anything on this show.

149
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,940
We have to, we have to cut it off just as you're really getting into it.

150
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,640
That way, that way, you know, it's the old leave them wanting more philosophy.

151
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,800
Somebody told me that worked and I was gonna do it.

152
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,160
However, since I've been using all my creativity for money

153
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,500
and this show isn't,

154
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,760
I'm gonna use a tape of a time when I did have creativity.

155
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,520
Even though this is, I don't know, some of you probably heard all this stuff before,

156
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:09,440
but it's, this is a tape of a typical radio interview with the sacred scribe of the Church of the Subgenius,

157
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,800
which happened to be me at that time and has been since.

158
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,440
But, and probably always will be, you know, you laugh, Will.

159
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,460
You say, thanks, Will.

160
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:20,480
You say, thanks, Will.

161
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,980
Will here thinks that he's next and he's gonna, he's just waiting for me to keel over dead from overwork.

162
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,900
I know what you think.

163
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,900
I know, I've seen, I've been, I've seen what you're doing out there.

164
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,060
Anyway, here, here's, uh, for those who don't know anything about the church,

165
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,020
here's a tape that was pretty much done that way.

166
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,340
Thank you.

167
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,080
That glint of insanity is what the church is based on.

168
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,380
Now, why would any clear thinking,

169
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,120
human being follow such a man?

170
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,960
Well, the other question is, why not?

171
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,480
Uh, I mean, everybody has to follow something, I suppose,

172
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,680
except for subgeniuses.

173
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,220
The subgeniuses don't have to follow anything,

174
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:13,420
but they choose to follow Bob because he provides slack.

175
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,920
Slack is, is the one mystic, uh, uh, element in,

176
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,140
in this cult that all other mind control religions lack.

177
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,300
And slack is just, I mean, as in the expression, cut me some slack.

178
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,560
Right. Cut me some slack.

179
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,340
Um, well, it's a lot like luck, really.

180
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,500
Uh, as Bob said, I'd rather be lucky than good any day.

181
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,180
Uh, Bob Dobbs is not smart.

182
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,800
He's not a smart, uh, the, the word subgenius seems to throw people off.

183
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,100
Right.

184
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,360
The first thing they lock onto is the word genius, but really,

185
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,400
a subgenius could include anybody who's sent $20 to the foundation here in Dallas.

186
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,980
Uh, anybody who's less than a genius,

187
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,320
and that can go all the way down to an amoeba.

188
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:12,280
Uh, Bob has preached to the slackless that you should pull the wool over your own eyes

189
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:17,860
and learn to, uh, relax in the safety of your own delusions.

190
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,940
I, I think in, in, in the very short time that I've had to do any research,

191
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,920
I think my, my favorite quote of, of Bob's is,

192
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,460
I don't practice what I preach because I'm not the kind of person I'm preaching to.

193
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,200
Praise Bob.

194
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,120
No, no kidding.

195
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,280
I hadn't had to get to that quote yet.

196
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,120
I was waiting for your, your callers to, uh, start harassing me,

197
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,240
and then I was gonna, gonna spring that one on them.

198
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,780
But that really is the basis of the, of the religion.

199
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:49,200
Um, obviously any religion is supplying people,

200
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,500
with something to, that, that they're being forced to believe in somehow.

201
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,340
And they want to.

202
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,560
And that's fine.

203
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,840
That's fine with us.

204
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,840
But, uh, in the case of the, of Bob's church,

205
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,360
we'd prefer that you just believe in anything you want to,

206
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,480
as it's convenient to you at the time.

207
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,860
Short and durper saves.

208
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,480
Right.

209
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,240
Short, short duration personal saviors.

210
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,880
Bob does not pretend to, um, be like Jesus.

211
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,340
Right.

212
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:19,520
For instance.

213
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,320
He's, he's not a messiah.

214
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,580
He's not that well connected.

215
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,780
But he, he, whereas he cannot offer forgiveness,

216
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,240
he can offer an excuse.

217
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,480
And which one would you rather have, dear friend?

218
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,240
On a practical basis, I think you're absolutely right.

219
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,060
A forgiveness or an excuse.

220
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,880
We're gonna take a short break and we'll be right back.

221
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,140
We are talking about the Church of the Subgenius

222
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,900
with Pope Jimbo here in Cleveland and, uh, out in somewhere.

223
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,020
The Holy Scribe of the Church of the Subgenius, Ivan Stang.

224
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,680
Back in a moment.

225
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,700
Getting to the Church of the Subgenius

226
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,580
with the Holy Scribe of the Church, Ivan Stang,

227
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,280
uh, who's on the, uh, telephone with us from parts unknown.

228
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,740
And, uh, locally, Pope Jimbo has joined us in the studio

229
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,980
to try to explain all of this.

230
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,080
And we will eventually get around to explaining

231
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,560
why people were calling this program

232
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,340
and saying it all has to do with the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

233
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,980
I think we ought to save that for last.

234
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,980
It's called a tease.

235
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,380
Ivan, you understand that?

236
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,440
Uh, sure.

237
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,100
I agree with you completely.

238
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,340
I agree with you.

239
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:19,340


240
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:19,900
I agree with you completely on that point.

241
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,020
I mean, let's not give him anything

242
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,040
until we can maybe make a buck off of it, right?

243
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:23,720
Exactly.

244
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,500
Hey, Ivan, if I could, uh, just butt in here for a minute.

245
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,700
I was really happy to read in the latest Star-Fist

246
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,140
how Bob, uh, ran very well in a couple of races

247
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,600
down in Texas there in the House of Representatives.

248
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,180
I think he finished a high third or something.

249
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,000
And I wanted to take the opportunity to mention

250
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,080
that, uh, Bob is running for the mayoral race here in town,

251
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,360
uh, naturally on the write-in ballot.

252
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,260
But, uh, and any other, any other race

253
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,340
that happens to be going on.

254
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,020
I think Bob's going to be the mayoral race.

255
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,020


256
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,020


257
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,020


258
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,640
All right, friends, vote Bob for everything.

259
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,160
Correct.

260
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:52,760
Correct.

261
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,560
Well, either county clerk or everything.

262
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,300
Sure.

263
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,260
One or the other.

264
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,160
Yeah.

265
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,440
Let's go to the phones.

266
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,500
Hi, Scott, you're on 3WE.

267
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,440
Hi, Bob, how you doing?

268
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:02,780
Okay.

269
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,240
Okay, I got two questions for you.

270
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:05,520
Yeah.

271
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,080
Okay, the first one is, um, you said that you were out of Dallas,

272
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,320
the Church of the Subgenius?

273
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:12,800
Right.

274
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,680
Yeah, well, how would we get in touch, you know,

275
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,840
to find more information about this?

276
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,980
Oh, I'd love to give the, the, uh, sacred post office box.

277
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,400
Go ahead.

278
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,180
Are you allowed to?

279
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,240
Yes, especially to you, dear.

280
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,600
Uh, let me, uh, give that post office box, dear friends,

281
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,980
if you have your pencils ready.

282
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:31,800
I got them ready.

283
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,880
This is for free information.

284
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,960
If you want to send a dollar, you'll get more.

285
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,140
Uh, but, uh, the address, just write to Bob

286
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,840
at box 140306.

287
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:44,800
Okay.

288
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,800
Dallas, Texas, 75214.

289
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,160
Thank you.

290
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:56,000
And I would point out that, uh, contributions are not tax deductible.

291
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,200
Okay, I got another question for you.

292
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,540
Yeah.

293
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,780
How does Norzark fit into all this?

294
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:02,580
Scribe?

295
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,600
You know, that's a good question.

296
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,740
Uh, we've often wondered, uh, you know,

297
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,260
just what, how wonderful the species must have been

298
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,980
before they had to interbreed like they did.

299
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,840
You know, when there were only two left of each one.

300
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,140
Mm.

301
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,040
Uh, left on Mount Ararat there.

302
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:21,820
Mm.

303
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,800
Uh, I mean, everything having to start from scratch

304
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,020
with only two sets of gene pools.

305
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,440
Ah, yeah.

306
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:32,600
Just think what magnificent animals and humans, I guess,

307
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,480
must have existed before then.

308
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,340
Close my mind.

309
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,640
Well, we've got the answers to that in the book of The Subgenius,

310
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,320
which you can buy.

311
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,000
Yeah, and, uh, but we can't, uh...

312
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,960
Yeah, I'm not supposed to...

313
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,380
...run labs, exactly.

314
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,220
I believe in the power of the imagination to change the world.

315
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,660
Yeah, that's what it's all about.

316
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,560
To release all the prisoners and the Polish all-oppressing systems

317
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,960
for whom the most frightening idea is freedom!

318
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,880
Praise Bob.

319
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,700
I believe in the vision of a new revolution,

320
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,880
in millions of people dancing in the streets,

321
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,820
holding flaming steam irons in their hands,

322
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,300
and singing the international anthem of Neoism.

323
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,620
I believe in the lunatics of impossible utopias,

324
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,960
in the creators of the Himalaya, in time travelers,

325
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,100
plastic soldiers, immortal superheroes,

326
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,360
Dracula, Frankenstein, Monty Genshin.

327
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,840
I believe in Bob and in the church of the subgenius,

328
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,020
in the 14 secret masters of the universe,

329
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,820
in the Rivington School, in computer graphics conspiracy,

330
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,200
in any underground and fictional organizations.

331
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,220
I believe in the beginnings, in Mondays,

332
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,860
in January 1st, in midnight.

333
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,240
I believe in the architecture of bridges,

334
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,600
spaceships and swimming pools.

335
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,740
I believe in the ecstasy of aliens.

336
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,260
I believe in the beauty of flowing floods,

337
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,740
in the reality of fleeting in a disco club in Transylvania.

338
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,460
I believe in my own gold bust,

339
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,600
made from chocolate, bread, and all kinds of vegetables.

340
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,300
I believe in number six,

341
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,220
in six o'clock, in the six-figure club,

342
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,840
in the sixth ladder of Neoism.

343
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,920
N-E-O-I-S-M!

344
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,880
Every six minutes,

345
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,040
we must try,

346
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,080
a new head.

347
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,260
Every six minutes,

348
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,160
we must change our soul.

349
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,700
Every six minutes,

350
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,700
we have to build a bunker.

351
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,140
Every six minutes,

352
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,000
we must destroy a wall.

353
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,760
More, more,

354
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,840
crucifixions.

355
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,220
More, more,

356
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,780
passion shows.

357
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,640
More, more,

358
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,240
we did it again.

359
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,020
More, more,

360
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,240
every six minutes,

361
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,020
must have another meaning.

362
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,660
Every six minutes,

363
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:21,180
we must be born again.

364
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,100
More, more, crucifixions.

365
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,020
More, more, passion shows.

366
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,640
More, more, we did it again.

367
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,200
More, more.

368
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,500
I believe in an empty room,

369
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,880
filled with a million minds,

370
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,020


371
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,020


372
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,020


373
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,020


374
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,020


375
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,020


376
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,080
and the incongruous cultures,

377
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,640
of Venus!

378
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,900
And I'm sure,

379
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,520
we all do.

380
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,120
Dear friends,

381
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,960
that was Istvan Kantor.

382
00:18:59,020 --> 00:18:59,500
Monty Kan...

383
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,540
The Istvan Kantor version of Monty Canson,

384
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:02,880
anyway,

385
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,540
in his...

386
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,260
From his album,

387
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,980
Aura Neoismus.

388
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,060
And,

389
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,420
uh...

390
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:20,660
Thank you, dear friends. Stay tuned after this brief message for a long message from Father Joe Mama. Thank you.

391
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:33,500
We're just outside an auditorium on the second floor of a large university class building where right now a history class is being taught.

392
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,480
Greg, class enrollment is up this quarter and there are 317 students in there.

393
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,420
I see you've chosen as your weapon the M16 on loan from the U.S. Army.

394
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,600
Remember, folks, join the people who join the Army.

395
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,780
And now, Greg, tell us why you picked this particular firearm.

396
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,280
Well, I like the high rate of fire and the penetration.

397
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,640
All right, Greg, you have 10 seconds to prepare yourself.

398
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,960
And when the buzzer sounds, your dream will come true.

399
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,100
The Open医cket

400
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:35,620
The Open医cket

401
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,340
Greg, are judges counting?

402
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,080
Only 16 people left alive.

403
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,060
Oh, did I miss some? I'm sorry.

404
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,000
Oh, stop!

405
00:20:52,400 --> 00:21:04,260
Well, you got them all that time, Greg,

406
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,920
and our judges award you a $500 bonus.

407
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,960
Greg, your dream has come true.

408
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,180
Tell us how you feel.

409
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,180
Well, I feel just great, except for one thing.

410
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,820
What's that, Greg?

411
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,800
I can't figure out how I'm going to carve 317 notches on my gun.

412
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,740
Well, I'll get by.

413
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,580
We know you will, Greg.

414
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,660
And thank you for joining us on Your Dream Comes True.

415
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,400
Thank you.

416
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:38,460
And...

417
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,580
And remember...

418
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,440
Hello, friends, and welcome.

419
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,500
Tonight's sermon is entitled,

420
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,480
How Stupid Do You Think God Is Anyway?

421
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,660
That's right, friends.

422
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,200
Tonight we're calling the question,

423
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:08,140
the question that has plagued intellectuals for time immortal,

424
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,580
not how many angels can sit on the end of a pen.

425
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,220
The clergy that worry about that have obviously got something up their ends

426
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,740
that they're sitting on because, friends,

427
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,920
God hasn't got eternity to waste on such nonsense.

428
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,960
What do you think he is, anyway?

429
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,160
Some sort of stupid idiot?

430
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,960
Well, he ain't.

431
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,140
God's the white, most intelligent, most creative idiot

432
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,640
in the entire universe.

433
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,820
It's true, friends.

434
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,500
God is the most clever comedian of all time.

435
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,760
He is the most fanatic of fools,

436
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,760
the most penultimate of pranksters,

437
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,120
the jester with the most jokes.

438
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,820
Now, I can hear a few of the self-righteous subgenies out there

439
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,400
who say,

440
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,220
Father Jemima, God is serious,

441
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:57,520
so serious that he let his only regarded salesman suffer assassination.

442
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,400
And you know, that's the joke of it.

443
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,920
Don't you see?

444
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:07,400
Who else but J.R. Bob Dobbs would take getting shot to death,

445
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,820
and then find it funny?

446
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,240
Little wonder he was selected for the job.

447
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:16,040
Little wonder he sitteth on the ticklish side of our silly savior.

448
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,940
Well, that old son of a gunner.

449
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,540
Who but J.R. Bob Dobbs could appreciate the comic genius of the cosmos?

450
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,460
Now, I can hear the stiff necks of the subhumans out there

451
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,240
swaying back and forth,

452
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,560
and they shake their big heads and puny little minds in disagreement.

453
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,640
Nay, nay, sayeth the sheep.

454
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,480
There is nothing funny about God.

455
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:37,800
There is nothing funny about God Almighty.

456
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,020
Well, let me tell you something.

457
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,360
These folks wouldn't know a funny joke if I looked them in the face,

458
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,140
which it does every morning when they brush their teeth,

459
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,280
if they so bother.

460
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:45,960
Ha!

461
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,420
These are some of God's funniest jokes,

462
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,380
and some of the best jokes on the planet.

463
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,180
They live together, they grow together,

464
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,960
and yes, they even breed together,

465
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,380
and yet they still don't get it.

466
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,280
Blasphemy!

467
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,720
I just hope some of them will listen tonight, friends,

468
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,760
so they'll know how ridiculous they are,

469
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,280
and how much they make God and the rest of us laugh.

470
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,700
Not with the mic.

471
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,420
But,

472
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:07,820
at them.

473
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,920
Oh, how they do provide us with endless hours of mirth.

474
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,480
Their self-righteous morals,

475
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,400
their politics,

476
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,760
their appointed leaders,

477
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,980
and I do use quotation marks,

478
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,240
their pop culture,

479
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,880
their bad taste in art,

480
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,960
and above all,

481
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:23,240
their conformity to the lowest possible common denominator.

482
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,200
Oh, but let us not forget the ultimate and satirical irony, friends.

483
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,640
Their false prophets,

484
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,680
and hilarious,

485
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,020
holy hierarchy.

486
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,580
And, all the while,

487
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,400
their straight-faced,

488
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,940
deadpan condemnation

489
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,880
of the only true

490
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,480
and correct religious doctrine,

491
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,200
the Bob-inspired,

492
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,280
Bob-sanctioned,

493
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,760
and Bob-approved

494
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,020
church-to-the-top genius,

495
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,760
Barabo Barombo!

496
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,960
Who among us could possibly be upset about that?

497
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,020
It's like watching your dog walk through the glass sliding door for the umpteenth time.

498
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,680
They're just too stupid to learn.

499
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,660
And, you know,

500
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,740
the more he does it, the funnier it gets.

501
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,300
That's right, friends.

502
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,980
It's becoming a running gag.

503
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,040
And we love it.

504
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,940
Don't stop, no, please.

505
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,840
It's killing us, really.

506
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,240
Ha ha!

507
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,340
In fact, we'd enjoy another refrain of fire and brimstones.

508
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,580
There's no time when he gets a chance.

509
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,280
You know, that's becoming a cult favorite.

510
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,840
Just thinking of it makes me giddy.

511
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,060
We're going to hell,

512
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,380
and you're going to heaven.

513
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,460
And God's going to spend eternity with you?

514
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,040
Ha ha!

515
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,920
Well, at the risk of spoiling the punchline, friends,

516
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,500
who do you think God's going to want to spend eternity with?

517
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,200
I mean, really.

518
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,480
The ones who laugh at his jokes?

519
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,420
Or the ones who are his jokes?

520
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,900
And just a preview of heaven and hell while we're on the topic, if you don't mind.

521
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,160
By your own definition,

522
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,680
heaven is going to be a place where you all stuck together,

523
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,580
forever and ever,

524
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,360
and the same conspiracy religion rules apply.

525
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,120
That's right, friends.

526
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,420
No cursing, no cheating, no fighting, no thinking dirty thoughts,

527
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,020
and no doing dirty deeds.

528
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,360
And that means no sex, no drugs, no rock and roll,

529
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,100
just eternal holding of hands and singing a praise.

530
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:54,040
Well, friends, if you want to call that heaven,

531
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,700
you go right ahead.

532
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,280
Keep on calling it that.

533
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:57,900
And who knows?

534
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,420
You know, you may even enjoy it for a few million years.

535
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,660
But, friends, if you really think God thinks that's heaven,

536
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,320
and God's going to enjoy listening to you and that,

537
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,660
and Betty singing out of key hymns forever and ever,

538
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:12,960
well, friends, just how stupid do you think God is anyway?

539
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,160
Here endeth the twelfth lesson.

540
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:15,880
Praise Baba.

541
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,180
Amen.

542
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:51,940
.

543
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,420
No, no, no, that's a different show.

544
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,940
A show called the whatever it is now.

545
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,800
Oh, the Galingi Hour.

546
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:02,940
Yeah, right.

547
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,720
Well, we thought that the public was ready for Galingi,

548
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,720
and his friends, his little dog, his girlfriend,

549
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,740
his kindly old lovable uncle.

550
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,320
.

551
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,980
And now, look, incredible spin-offs, cartoon shows,

552
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,600
the Broadway musical still running, the movie,

553
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,540
the clubhouses, the franchises, the restaurants,

554
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:28,020
all from the one inspiration of Teenage Mutant Ninja Galingis.

555
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,320
Yeah, amazing.

556
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,720
Teenage unwed mutant turtles.

557
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,460
Yeah.

558
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,400
Teenage unwed, I can't say it, teenage unwed pregnant mutant turtles.

559
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,700
Yeah, you just did, and look what happened.

560
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:37,960
It is.

561
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,380
You weaken our reality that way.

562
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,880
And look, even the callers are responding.

563
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,480
You've hit someone's sore spot all right, mister.

564
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,840
I sure hope so.

565
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,300
I hope you're happy.

566
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,140
I poked at him long enough with this stick.

567
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,300
Yeah, hit his tennis elbow, his funny bone.

568
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,920
Listen to that pained laughter.

569
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:57,180
I hear the toad croaking at the bottom of the sound well.

570
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,100
It's still connected.

571
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,640
We've got a problem here on the air.

572
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,980
The toad, the power mower caught, chewed and clipped at the leg

573
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,380
with a kind of hobbling hop his gun to the guard.

574
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:05,380


575
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:14,400
And there that chopped up toad cries his heart out.

576
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,960
How many cries?

577
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,360
Because there's a lot of toad there.

578
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,900
Does it croak, grunt, or vogue?

579
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:24,560
The rare and original heart's blood flows flat on the earth when you hide.

580
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,420
I used to have some flowing, flat toad here.

581
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,920
The branch kept my anus, Barry.

582
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,680
That's the same old, Aunt Bertha always did that.

583
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,360
Till his batrachian eye turns towards the sky.

584
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,640
And there's some mystic monotone.

585
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,720
Toward mistant and ebullient seas.

586
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,320
Why do my frogs no longer sing?

587
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,360
And cooling shores.

588
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,860
Toward lost amphibious emperies.

589
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,360
Look, there's my nude.

590
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,280
Really, how's that work?

591
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,560
What are the plans for these ten guys?

592
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:55,640
The laughing toad of Burma and Malaysia inhabits the tropical forest.

593
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:01,980
Yes, it's only another nine minutes until the eggy, the Smith eggy descends upon us all.

594
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,720
Yes, old father time is gimping toward his car.

595
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,060
And it's only 26 minutes till showtime.

596
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,480
Aw, come on, it's not like that.

597
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,020
A collar?

598
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,000
There's a collar.

599
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,000
I have the collar down.

600
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,940
Are you giving up?

601
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:20,440
You don't want to helm the show anymore, Commander Spock?

602
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:28,060
This is where Dr. Howell and Gary BoFam and Puzzling Evidence all start arguing over the headphones.

603
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,900
And doing sort of inside routines about...

604
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,740
The show mechanism?

605
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,440
What?

606
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:41,340
No, none of us are going to operate the show mechanism because it's about time for me to flip my tape.

607
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:50,360
Friends, this is the end of side one of your subgenius radio ministry cassette live on the air tape show.

608
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,760
You may now flip over the cassette to play a side two.

609
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,860
Both sides of the story.

610
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,320
I wouldn't want to be me if I were you.

611
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,700
But the loss of love has made this mild matter.

612
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,060
I'm going to turn this mad man into a maniac.

613
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,500
A maniac who wants to make you a plaything.

614
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:14,000
And the fear awesome fact is, he knows how to do it.

615
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,880
The world that the child in each of us knows.

616
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,720
All he has to do is ask you to praise Bob.

617
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,300
A baby doll, take a bubble bath in a coffee can.

618
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,060
What are you talking about?

619
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,480
Feel the fantastic fear of living in a normal world.

620
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:53,360
That's right friends, the fear of living in a normal world and watching a baby take a bubble bath in a tin can.

621
00:30:54,420 --> 00:31:01,680
And that's what you can learn from the church of the subgenius simply by calling the station here.

622
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,900
Or by sending...

623
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:13,700
For free information from Bob at the box number which we will give at the end of the broadcast in only half an hour.

624
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,180
Thank you.

625
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,100
I'm sorry doctor.

626
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,940
Three generations of unfit are enough.

627
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,540
Patricia not allowed.

628
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,920
She's not like the rest of the family.

629
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,060
She's a good girl, Judge.

630
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:23,520
I'm...

631
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,360
Oh, Dr. Brooks.

632
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,360
Are they going to make me go through with this?

633
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,400
Can't you get him to wait till tomorrow?

634
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,800
You're the only one who could help me now.

635
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,280
Please do.

636
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,980
You've just got to.

637
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,440
What is he looking for?

638
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,860
We're looking for a guy that's been peddling dope to school kids.

639
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,400
I'm going to take you on a sleigh ride with some snowbirds.

640
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,640
Sleigh rides? Snowbirds? In the summer?

641
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,980
Gosh, you are dumb.

642
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,620
I assume you will meet Jane Bradford.

643
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,700
What's the matter? Got a headache?

644
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,500
She's a young and innocent cocktail waitress.

645
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,780
Jane Bradford is about to lose that innocence.

646
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,280
When she meets J.R. Bob Dobbs.

647
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,600
Jane? Headache medicine.

648
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,780
Have some pills, Jane?

649
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,320
I feel better already.

650
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,820
We knew you would.

651
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,920
...sink ever deeper into a flat mile of moral decay.

652
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,020
The Church of the Subgenius.

653
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,860
You used to be sweet and clean.

654
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,180
I gotta have dope. I'm a hothead.

655
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:28,780
These departments are entirely too linear with these vicious exhibitions of sex.

656
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,460
You're entirely right, Henry.

657
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,360
But...

658
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,200
I still see what's happening to our government today.

659
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,460
But there's absolutely nothing illegal about running a church of the subgenius.

660
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:40,560
That is madness takes you behind the scenes.

661
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:46,300
Subgenius madness takes you behind the scenes where you will learn the story of young and innocent guerilla sins.

662
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:51,280
...and you will see it all.

663
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,840
No, you won't.

664
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,900
Not tonight, you won't.

665
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,300
Because...

666
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,480
Well, I don't know why exactly.

667
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,180
In fact, I'm...

668
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,880
I'm quite confused here.

669
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,880
Let's see if, uh...

670
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:10,020
Let's just tune over to the Berkley Show and see whether they've quit arguing over the headphones yet, shall we? Eh?

671
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,220
Oh, you're on the air.

672
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:11,920
Oh, no, you're not.

673
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,460
I don't know who's on the air.

674
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,260
Oh, no, I think we're on the air, but soon it's Emmet.

675
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,300
Yes, Emmet all over everything.

676
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:21,320
But, you know, go to the Emmet, thou sluggard, and be wise.

677
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,480
Observe the Pismire on his anthill.

678
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,020
Watch him lift things several times his size.

679
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,400
Don't you wish you could or will?

680
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,300
Emmet real or Emmet...

681
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,080
Memorex Emmet Powell.

682
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,100
Emmet...

683
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,180
Exploring the Grand Canyon.

684
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,680
Emmet, friends, just because these guys refer to Emmet a lot on their tapes.

685
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:42,640
He's the guy who follows the Subgenius Show in Berkley.

686
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:51,200
It happens to be a nice Christian broadcast on early Saturday mornings, which follows the Subgenius Show.

687
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:59,140
You can imagine sometimes when Emmet's a little bit late, just what terrible advantage these boys have been known to take.

688
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,260
And I was there once.

689
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,640
In fact, I'm going to be there next show, next KPFA show.

690
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,960
I'll be on the show.

691
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:09,240
And here's Emmet Powell driving his seven-story Cadillac through his own town.

692
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,720
And look.

693
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,600
That's funny, really funny.

694
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,700
So funny I could kill myself.

695
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,720
They're dying.

696
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,880
You're killing him.

697
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,320
No, look.

698
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,420
Look, here comes 4,000 people who are willing to vote for Emmet.

699
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,380
Oh, my God.

700
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:23,800
It's so funny.

701
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,720
It's so funny.

702
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,200
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

703
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,040
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

704
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,740
But seriously, let's consider the problem.

705
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:38,880
Here are 16,000 angry citizens wanting to impeach Emmet as President of the United States.

706
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,000
They look pretty happy to me.

707
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,900
But let's go over that.

708
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,500
They show their anger in strange ways now.

709
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,520
Let's go over that again.

710
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,320
You say you thought you saw some sort of show.

711
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,780
Well, I'm fast-forwarding that show there.

712
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,140
Let's see.

713
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:00,840
Well, just for a moment, just for a moment now.

714
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:05,840
If you'd come to the Hello Robin show, sorry, our show is over for this week, but we'll

715
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,540
be asking you to return next week.

716
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,340
Two callers.

717
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,200
Two callers.

718
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,160
Well, let's see if we can talk to them.

719
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,760
How about the fellow you're on the air?

720
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,640
No, you're not.

721
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,000
And the fellow you're on the air.

722
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,000
I can't squeeze these callers in before the victory round.

723
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,140
Caller, if you have anything to say, this is your last chance to say it.

724
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:25,320
As I've confirmed to the wide range of artistic talent, you must understand, to various creative

725
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,120
elements, to hours and hours of work, to hours and hours of work, to hours and hours of work,

726
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:27,120


727
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,400
to hours and hours of weekly programming, the unexpected, the sense of timing.

728
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,260
You forgot serendipity and synchronicity.

729
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,260
And also the dark areas of pattern set off.

730
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,320
Yes, the dark side of the force.

731
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:44,240
We were seduced by the dark side of the show long ago.

732
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,820
Keep in play.

733
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,440
Wishful thinking.

734
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,300
Until next time, join us.

735
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,500
Squishful thinking.

736
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,340
Yes, it's a squirting universe, my friend.

737
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,340
But have you any concrete addendum to the program?

738
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,400
Uh, no, not at this moment.

739
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,000
Well, why are you occupying the airwaves then?

740
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,460
But while you chew that one over, hold on just a moment.

741
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,800
Oh my goodness.

742
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,040
Hello, you're on the air.

743
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,640
Arise from sleep, you helpless sheep, you rotted milling pack.

744
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,220
Go brush your teeth beyond the reef and pat me on the back.

745
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,320
I'd love to do that thing, but you are really out of line.

746
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:21,940
Hey, look.

747
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,580
Hey, this is my phone call now, guy.

748
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,740
You're going to have to hang up.

749
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,360
No, no, no.

750
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,320
I don't even know how to turn this off.

751
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:26,320


752
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,940
You know, I don't, I'm not sure what to do.

753
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,580
Here comes Emmett.

754
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,880
Now we're all in trouble.

755
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,620
Emmett, Emmett, Emmett, Emmett, Emmett.

756
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,380
What can we do?

757
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,380
We're in big trouble now.

758
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,720
You guys are going to have to bring the radio station back here.

759
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,560
Here comes Emmett.

760
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,580
That was a little bit exhausting and exasperating.

761
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,820
I apologize to our listeners.

762
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:43,780
That was an, uh...

763
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,860
He's going to be really mad when he gets here and finds out the station's been sold

764
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,780
to the street people.

765
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:54,720
I'm, I've got to, friends, I'm, I'm ashamed of the way this show is turning out.

766
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,320
Listen closely to this.

767
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:56,320


768
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,820
I'm going to have to end this message and we'll see you next week when everything's

769
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,320
all better.

770
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:00,860
I'll tell you.

771
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:01,540
Aloha.

772
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,720
And, um, bye.

773
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,340
All right, will you?

774
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,700
Oh, is that how the show, what a terrible way to end their show.

775
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,980
It just sort of peters off into the distance.

776
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,460
It, it just...

777
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,520
I'd be happy to.

778
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:22,800
I would too, but, uh, you know, they, they, uh, I mean, the way, the way you end a subgenius

779
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,300
show theoretically is to flop in a little cassette like this that has an, uh, an audio

780
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,020
track, uh, an inspiring song about Bob Dobbs and, you know, after you get really worked

781
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:34,820
up about how great Bob is, then you, uh, kill him.

782
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:41,960
Uh, because, you know, after all, as history has proven time and time again, a dead messiah

783
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,140
can get you a lot more mileage than a live one.

784
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,240
Praise, Bob, Bob is dead.

785
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,120
Long live Bob.

786
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,980
Uh, Bob sold it.

787
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,780
I smoked it.

788
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,700
That settles it.

789
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,120
Uh, yes.

790
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:56,300
Uh, Bob.

791
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:56,300


792
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:56,300


793
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:56,300


794
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:56,660
Yes.

795
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:05,120
That, that great saint of sales, that living avatar of slack, J.R. Bob Dobbs is available

796
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,220
even to you, dear friend.

797
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:12,760
I know you feel you're worthless or maybe you feel you're greater than everybody else,

798
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:18,880
but either way, you're, you feel alone and, uh, and you're not.

799
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:25,880
It would be so easy for you to step out of that glass cage, break out of that glass cage,

800
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:30,980
and, uh, write to J.R. Bob Dobbs at the post office number we'll give at the end of the

801
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,320
broadcast.

802
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:31,980
Thank you.

803
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:48,500
In his dead, new denny-ah-heh, the Dread Dobbs lies smokin' in his gray, t-z-shell.

804
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,480
The Dread Dobbs lies smokin'.

805
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,320
Piss your money away.

806
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:55,860
The Dread Dobbs lies smokin'.

807
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:55,860


808
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:55,860


809
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,980
There won't be no rainy day

810
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:02,700
If I will sell you all the sun

811
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,680
He's unlike with your Lord

812
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,860
But he ain't no man, he ain't no God

813
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:13,440
I don't wanna walk the path I've tried

814
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,040
He ain't no man, he ain't no God

815
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:23,520
I don't wanna walk the path I've tried

816
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:33,480
At his desk in Dallas

817
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,080
When Dreadops is smoking

818
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:41,000
Your mind is mirrored with the horse

819
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,220
When Dreadops is smoking

820
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:47,500
Light up your pipe, let go the smoke

821
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:51,180
This is slack, it ain't no joke

822
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,760
Brace me to bob, lift up your chain

823
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,860
And you will see

824
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,380
You will pay to know what you think

825
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:02,100
But he ain't no man, he ain't no God

826
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,760
I don't wanna walk the path I've tried

827
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,380
He ain't no man, he ain't no God

828
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:15,840
I don't wanna walk the path I've tried

829
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,960
He ain't no man, he ain't no

830
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,980
God engineering

831
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,140
Stainless steel

832
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:48,300
I do not read recommend A murderer

833
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:55,840
How would you tell me You're no man compared to Paul?

834
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:55,840


835
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:55,840


836
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,280
Oh, I'm a little dumb, so do I

837
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,780
He ain't no man, he ain't no God

838
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:05,280
I don't wanna walk the path of my child

839
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,120
He ain't no man, he ain't no God

840
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:15,680
I don't wanna walk the path of my child

841
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:55,820
I don't wanna walk the path of my child

842
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:18,160
I don't wanna walk the path of my child

843
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:54,480
I don't wanna walk the path of my child

844
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:25,820
I don't wanna walk the path of my child

845
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:55,820
I don't wanna walk the path of my child

846
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:19,180
I don't wanna walk the path of my child

847
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,720
I don't wanna walk the path of my child

848
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,820
I don't wanna walk the path of my child

849
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:55,820
I don't wanna walk the path of my child

850
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:25,820
I don't wanna walk the path of my child

851
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:54,880
I don't wanna walk the path of my child

852
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:24,440
I don't wanna walk the path of my child

853
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:55,820
I don't wanna walk the path of my child

854
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:25,560
I don't wanna walk the path of my child

855
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:50,460
I don't wanna walk the path of my child

856
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:25,820
I don't wanna walk the path of my child

857
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:52,720
I don't wanna walk the path of my child

858
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:59,160
139.5, something like that.

859
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:03,020
I think the genius IQ is measured at 140.

860
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:11,460
If you pay any attention to IQ tests, you are not a genius, period, or anywhere close.

861
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:19,800
Chances are, since you seem to recognize a little bit of that fact, then you're okay.

862
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:29,520
As far as coolness goes, obviously, you can't define cool in any given time.

863
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:37,520
Cool is defined by, say, quarter to quarter according to television seasons.

864
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:42,980
And it really has nothing to do with real human behavior.

865
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:48,280
Well, it would seem to me that cool would actually be a conspiracy plot

866
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,640
to keep people from living.

867
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,820
They're at their fullest potential.

868
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:51,580
Oh, exactly.

869
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:58,340
The conspiracy tells some people they're cool if they smoke crack, for instance.

870
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,840
It would tell other people they're cool if they make a lot of money.

871
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:08,720
The average subgenius does not worry about being cool at all.

872
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,120
They sometimes have to worry about being beat up.

873
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:17,360
But they're not trying to worry about being cool, no.

874
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:19,400
No, I'm confused.

875
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:19,780
I'm confused.

876
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:22,200
I worry, Ivan, about the term the average subgenius.

877
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,220
How can you average that which cannot be totaled?

878
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,660
I'm glad you brought that up.

879
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:30,160
There is no, by definition, there cannot be an average subgenius.

880
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:34,200
In fact, if there was one, we would kill that person.

881
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:35,560
Praise Bob.

882
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,620
On the air, preferably.

883
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:37,500
On the air.

884
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:43,940
I wish we could take your calls and we would kill you on the air right now, tonight.

885
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:45,820
We would indeed.

886
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,920
But, you know, that statement about coolness.

887
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,040
It's got me thinking, rather than play what I was going to play next,

888
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,560
I'm going to play what I'm going to play next.

889
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:56,040
Michael Pepe.

890
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:56,920
Got a problem?

891
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,660
Bring it to the friendly people.

892
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,860
People touching people.

893
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:04,240
People running against people.

894
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:09,860
People developing the nuclear first strike capability to incinerate people.

895
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,400
Sound like a flash in the pan?

896
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:14,320
It's got to be.

897
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,440
You don't settle for less.

898
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:18,320
You don't have to.

899
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:19,860
You're you.

900
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:26,360
And you've got needs bigger and more earth-shaking than your grandfather could have dreamed.

901
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:31,440
How do we keep bringing them to you, year after year, bigger and better?

902
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:36,380
By using the technology of tomorrow on the consumers of today.

903
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,020
The now people.

904
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,500
People on the go.

905
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:45,660
Going from smart shopper to new low value in the time it takes to dial our number.

906
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,100
Call now, won't you?

907
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:51,340
For more of what you've come to expect from us.

908
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:53,180
Style.

909
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:54,900
Mood.

910
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,440
A certain dependable kind of image.

911
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,280
An image of the way you'd like people to be.

912
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:03,280
Passive.

913
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:04,640
Pretty.

914
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:06,620
White.

915
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,520
As white as the complexion of our finest women.

916
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,720
Grown right here by our special process.

917
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,880
As white as the hair of God.

918
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:17,660
White as it was in life.

919
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:23,360
As white as the blank sheet on which we write your mind.

920
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:25,340
Who are we?

921
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,160
We're the happy people.

922
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,180
Happy to live in a world of images.

923
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,060
Images of war.

924
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:34,500
Family.

925
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:36,200
Crime.

926
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:44,320
Fun images that help rinse away unsightly self-images so you can get away from the privacy of your own home.

927
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,300
After all, aren't you what everything is?

928
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,020
You're what everything is here for.

929
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,940
You're what we're here for.

930
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:04,660
And we're so glad to be here, dear friends.

931
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,040
But we can't be here much longer, nay nay.

932
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:13,540
We've got to saddle up and ride on out of here.

933
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:17,760
Because Miss Kathy is coming in to do her show.

934
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:21,600
Or whoever is coming in to do whatever show in whatever town.

935
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:27,480
And this tape has to be heard in or bootlegged away to or sold to.

936
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,120
Or gosh.

937
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:35,440
All I can think is praise Bob and I'm going to go home and go to bed.

938
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,840
I'm going to shut out the lights.

939
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,760
I'm just going to dream about the slack to come.

940
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:45,280
Oh yes.

941
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,280
Next week at this same time.

942
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,600
And same Bob time, same Bob channel.

943
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:53,900
Thank you.

944
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:56,800
.

945
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:56,800


946
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,100
.

947
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:17,580
.

948
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:21,200
.

949
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:30,440
.

950
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:30,460
.

951
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:31,980
.

952
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:32,000
.

953
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:32,020
.

954
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:32,040
.

955
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:32,060
.

956
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:32,080
.

957
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:32,140
.

958
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:44,360
.

959
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:48,700
There's no place to hide

960
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,560
Oh yeah

961
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:54,160
Let's burn the night in some day

962
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,100
Let's start a fire with a landing way

963
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:03,740
Let's all go crazy by the time

964
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,960
And let's all bring it to a time

965
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,240
Don't you be trusted

966
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:11,500
Let the lights go out

967
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,780
People act crazy

968
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,220
People start to shout

969
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:18,500
People huddle together

970
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,760
Try hard to feel

971
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,680
People party down but they

972
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,040
Don't know where they

973
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,520
Don't know where they're at

974
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,080
Gonna run outside

975
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,420
But stare to see

976
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:35,780
Just one big shoulder to me

977
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,900
Comfort me, Nancy

978
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:40,240
Comfort me, Nancy

979
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,480
Comfort me, Nancy

980
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:41,800
There's no place to hide

981
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,580
Oh yeah

982
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:47,560
Let's burn the night in some day

983
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:52,320
Let's start a fire with a landing way

984
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,740
Let's all go crazy by the time

985
00:56:56,740 --> 00:57:01,420
And let's all bring it to a time

986
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:02,140
guitar solo

987
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:03,600
drum solo

988
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,320
Thank you.

989
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:38,840
Hey, let's turn the night into day.

990
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:43,420
Let's start a fire on the night away.

991

Let's all get crazy by night.

992
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:52,580
And let's all play with cat's eye.

993
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:02,420
Hey, let's turn the night into day.

994
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,840
Let's start a fire on the night away.

995
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,240
Let's all get crazy by night.

996
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,920
And let's all play with cat's eye.

997
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,780
Hey, let's turn the night into day.

998

Oh yeah.

1004
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:42,700
Let's start created by lights.

1005
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:45,020
All right.

1006
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,280
But today we're having our Aiders American show.

1007
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:56,240
