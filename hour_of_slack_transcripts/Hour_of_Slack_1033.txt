Hello?
Hello, hello, Bob.
This is The Self Genius Hour of Sack.
I know all about it.
I've been trying to get you.
Have you any idea where they are?
Yeah, they're right here with me.
Well, say, if you're going to do anything about it, you'd better hurry.
Oh, thanks, Bob.
And I remember the delight with which I devoured it.
Now that I have been reading over all the letters which he wrote to me laboriously with his own hand after the fashion of those days,
I feel that I did not at the time appreciate how much he thought and cared for the
Self Genius Hour of Sack.
Watch it!
You might sit over there on a Monday morning and talk about how Bob got the money,
but I guarantee you Bob's going to get it.
Bob's going to pay his bill and then get you to go over and lick your sores on Bob.
And I can guarantee you if we said that at one of our radio stations,
the FCC would come down and pull the plug.
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.
So let's get to it.
Okay, boys.
Go and get up.
Indian wolf call.
Freeze!
Everybody clap your hands.
Come on, y'all.
How low can you go?
Warning.
You are about to enter the
sex program.
Warning.
He is a serial killer.
Sex program.
Sex program.
Serial killers and kidnappers and pedophiles.
He literally wrote the book.
The most confusing thing about a condom.
Looking into the eyes of a serial killer.
Serial killers and kidnappers and pedophiles.
He literally wrote the book on
one serial killer by the name of
G. Gordon Liddy.
Mass murderers and pedophiles and kidnappers.
G-Man.
Predators.
G. Gordon Liddy.
Murder and pedophilia.
Oral, anal, and vaginal.
And erect penis.
I get the same thing, by the way, because, you know,
on the penis.
In the Catholic Church.
G. Gordon Liddy.
Pedophile.
There are bad people in many different organizations.
The Catholic Church is bad child.
G. Gordon Liddy.
Abuse.
Sex with Starbucks.
Uh, uh, criminal, criminal, criminal, criminal, criminal.
Past, past, past, past.
Predators and predators and predators in the world of pedophilia.
I don't know, I don't know.
G. Gordon Liddy.
Serial killer and it actually gave me nightmares.
G. Gordon Liddy.
Does dig deep, does dig deep inside.
Thanks, I hope we can do it again.
And we'll do it again to everybody.
Only this time, we'll do it in Bob's Church.
And with G. Gordon Gordon instead of G. Gordon Liddy.
Anyway, dear friends, Norrell Preff, Reverend Norrell Preff did that.
Uh, and the openings were by Mr. Fernandinendi Lee Moore,
as well as the Department of Transmutation.
Uh, but you know, friends, not everybody hates it.
Bob, they don't all even hate Bob out at KPFA Berkeley.
Uh, on the sub-genius show of puzzling evidence, Dr. Howell, Dr. Philo Drummond, Michael Pepe,
Gary the Broke Friend, and as you'll see here, the caller's son.
I love y'all, though.
No, y'all my poppers.
That would cost you, I should say.
Y'all my poppers.
Y'all my daddies.
Yeah, no, we don't do poppers, sir, on the show.
No.
Not anymore as much.
Thank God for y'all.
God bless.
Yeah, there were whippets and everything.
There was a lot of evidence in last night's show.
That's right.
Praise you.
Church air, you mean.
There was church air being passed about.
What kind of, what kind of a show business is this, you people doing San Francisco?
This is a show business fuel.
Yeah, using those evil little soul-filled canisters.
I brought up my baby to be.
Oh, I wish we were sacred.
And giving away the little souls as if they meant nothing.
My little baby.
Something great about being in love with a carrot.
It's just.
Daddy gave her nitrous oxide.
Nitrous oxide.
Walrose wine.
It's 7 o'clock in the morning.
It's 7 o'clock in the morning.
Take a number.
It's 7 o'clock in the morning.

Hey, it's 17 degrees in Cleveland.
Wow.
Wow.
And there's, they're supposed to get 10 inches of snow today.
What the hell you think we're out here, baby?
No kidding, daddy.
Does that mean you have to put your shoes on?
That's why.
Bob's promise rings true.
The second we set off for the airport, it started snowing for the first time this season.
It's now in the middle of a blizzard.
There you go.
The day we get back, it is prophesied to be 53 degrees and raining.
What further work do you need?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know either.
Slack abides with those that send in their $30.
That's right.
Well, you know the-
Slack abides with-
I don't-
With two to five.
My money ain't right, but I'm gonna bring food to y'all.
I'm gonna be right.
Slack is my bride.
I'm married to Slack.
I'm gonna make it.
Slack is my bride.
Slack is my-
In the form of Princess We Are Doe, which is very Slack-
She is herself Slack.
She is.
She glows with the power of Slack.
But the Lord is not Slack concerning his-
No.
I'm a goat.
No.
I'm a goat.


Nay.
Nay.
The Lord is not Slack.
As men reckon Slackness.
Nay.
Nenoninana, nenoninana, nenoninana, nenoninana,
Sepolvaa and persuadevaa, sepovaa and persuadevaa.
Sepolvedaa, persuajaa, and manipulaa.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

Now at best, we'll all keep paying.
You tell them, squirrely whirling.
This is the happiest moment of my life.
Signal Oil Company has asked me to remind you that there's an easy way we can all help to make this holiday season happier for ourselves and others.
Be courteous and obey the subscription of Slack.
It may save a life, possibly Bob.
The subscription of Slack is entirely fictional and all characters are coincidental.
Any similarity of names or resemblance to Bob is purely fictional.
Well, that was only a gag, officer.
You see, you got a queer sense of humor.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Hello?
Hello.
So I pick up the phone when it rang and I said,
Uh...
And she said,
Uh...
Uh...
And I said,
And I said,
And I said,
And I said,

And I said,
And I said,

And I said,





And that's why I love her, friends.
Those cut-ups were by...
Lee Murr.
And that song, that sweet, romantic, surrealist duet by Princess Wiardo and myself,
that's a cover, a perverse cover, sort of, inspired by the spasmutations of a Romanian pop song
widely known as the Numa Numa song, which became an internet fad when various nerds, fat guys, and gays,
started lip syncing to it.
In fact, you can look up the Numa Numa song.
Yes, that is the name of it.
The Numa Numa song on Google.
And you'll see.
Uh, Google Video.
Look at Google Videos of the Numa Numa song.
It's truly spasm-y-sy.
Uh, meanwhile, friends,
let us hie back to Berkeley for the ongoing live subgenius meeting.
You're like calling from, like, Santa.
Santa Cruz or something.
Okay, is that a quorum?
You never go right through.
I would say that is a quorum.
Yeah, it's a quorum.
Oh, man, that is not a quorum.
Let's just say it is and get...
We've only got a little while left to finish up all this business.
Okay, all in favor say,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Pass.
Okay, that's it for the business.
Let's get on with the strippers.
No, no, no, that's just part one of the business.
Bring in the babes.
Where's the paint strippers?
Oh, now we have to...
We've got to redecorate the...
Yeah, we've got to fix this.
Oh, man, this is the part I hate.
Oh, my God.
Smoking jazz gun.
Fire up the grease gun.
And here we go.
We're whooping on the...
Oh, we're breaking the windows down.
So, we're going to decide.
We decide on anything.
It looks like Hal had too much show.
We didn't have any business.
No.
You know, Stan keeps all the money and that's it.
I know, and I think you should...
Yeah, but I got a seat at the children's table at Stan's giving,
so I'm moving on.
Oh.
Actually, technically, Ratnar keeps all the money.
Oh, Ratnar Corp?
Oh, no, is he the new secretary of the party?
Ratnar is the new treasurer.
He takes care of all the money.
Oh, okay.
We figured he works at a horse race track, betting track.
Oh, good.
So, we figured he had a lot of experience with that sort of thing.
Yeah.
Hey, I'm looking at Revelation X, Reverend Stane.
He can count.
He's real good at counting.
Try to see if we can't...
I'm looking at Amazon.com,
and I see that you have...
You can buy Revelation X for $51.39, the cheapest one.
Give me two.
How much?
$51.39.
You know, I bought one for 26 bucks about two months ago,
and the next time I looked, it was 49.
Oh.
So, friends...
Do you think that's okay?
You better buy your Revelation X while you still can.
Whatever that is.
It's $150 now that we've mentioned it on the radio.
There's two copies.
There's two copies out there right now.
One is $51.39, and the other is $82.
The like-new version is 82 bucks, Reverend Stane.
Those are chimpanzees.
Psalm 51.6, the book says,
More than all else, Lord, you desire a couple of CDs.
So, he was just drawn like iron filings into a belt.
He had been wanting my parts.
According to the Bible,
God created the Philippine islands.
Handmade, crude.
The hand belongs to New York City,
a tiny rural community in Maine.
Gift of love to a son named Bob.
And he moved an entire community back into the Dark Ages,
just by using a bomb.
Find the duck with a wrench.
From PR News in Washington,
I'm far broader than previously reported.
According to the American Automobile Association,
an unmanned Russian spaceship took its course
at the advantage of PR News to gouge customers in Washington.
Leaper did it, friends!
And now, the Roto-Rooter Good Time Christmas Band.
You called this momentặt
粉 dude
Of a franchise hit
What a surprise
To see him
Go home
Suntomed
5, 6, 7, 8
5, 6, 7, 8
Oh, that was the Roto-Rooter Good Time Christmas Band.
And now, back to the Subgenius Executive Conference.
Oh.
Ancient knowledge in modern times.
The Sasquatch in literature, myth, and fiction.
The experiments don't often work out for the best.
Sometimes it's sad.
A life of misery.
Are you talking about subgenius?
Yes, yes.
And victims.
Oh, right.
Trekkies.
Trekkies.
Sci-fi geeks.
Gamers.
Usenet geeks.
Michael Pepe.
Charles Manson.
Michael Pepe.
Lieutenant Calley.
Michael Pepe.
Minority.
Yeah.
Unspoken for.
60 new and used Book of the Subgenius, starting as low as $4.95.
Well, that's understandable.
You can get those from subgenius.com.
That's what mine cost.
Not for $4.95.
Not for $4.95.
Hell no.
No, there's 60.
It's $15.95.
But, they're autographed.
Oh.
Great.
You can't get a Philodrumon by a rubber stamp.
I just want to say.
Wow.
Philodrumon?
The Dr. Philodrumon.
In 1980, when I got my subgenius book of the subgenius, I think it was $9.95.
Yes.
Yeah.
Souls were cheaper.
Life was cheaper then.
So, now we're talking, it was $98.
Yeah.


$98.
Right.
Now, for a new copy.
Because of the year number.
Right.
And half an hour ago, it was only $56.
But, it's gone up because we mentioned it.
Because it's readers.
The second we mentioned that, RevelationX at Amazon.com, the price went up $100.
That's right.
Because people were listening on the net.
That's right.
Well, maybe we need to find it.
It just went up another $13.
That's on eBay.
The people are thirsting for the book.












$13.
That was on eBay.
Yeah.
It's about confidence.
You know, people had no more confidence.
If they didn't have confidence involved, the market would crash.
The readers demand the subgenius revealed wisdom.
They thirst for this knowledge.
Yes.
You have to have an informed population.
How are we going to satisfy this burning need for the subgenius gospel?
Well, you just have to constantly pump out information.
I guess we'll just have to pray for a miracle.
Even the parish people decided.
They're going to pray alive.
And stay alive.
And stay glued to their electronic devices.
Maybe somebody up there will make it possible for us to come out with a new edition of our
second book, the Descended New Testicle of the Church of the Subgenius, RevelationX,
the Bob Apocryphi.
Read the book.
Read the book.
Yeah, it's too bad you can't get it without just buying it used.
Of course, if the demand was to increase and we got enough, you know, requests, we could
probably buy it.
We could probably figure out some way to reprint it.
Actually, lads, you might be interested to know that in the last month we acquired a
new literary agent, as we call them nowadays.
Yes, the good Reverend Haight.
Unfortunately, he was also a subgenius.
Like the original sainted late Jane Brown, this new agent is likewise a true saint.
True subgenius.
One who gazed upon the face of Bob and instantly knew.
In fact, our new agent once played in a band in Houston behind the apostate, Janer, I can't
pronounce his name here.
Oh, I remember.
Yeah.
Our new agent once backed up Janer in Houston when he was a kid.
Is this the imputed inventor of the launching of the new movie?
The head of Arnold Palmer?
Well, actually, what I was talking about was our new agent, and I dare not say his name
or the name of the agency on this particular show or in public.
Because talk about shaking up the market.
This could devastate publishing as we know it if we were to allow insider trading or
something like that to start.
Oh, yeah.
The price of Revelation X, which is now up to $6,000.
Yeah, almost, not quite $6,000.
Now the real business.
Now the real business.
I gave away all my money.
I'm going to start a new church.
Friends, you can get in on the ground floor of a lucrative new cult now while rates are
moderately low compared to the next few minutes.
I'm going to start a new church.


You are making such a mistake.
It's pretty bad, isn't it?
Oh, I know it's pretty bad.
It's pretty bad.




It's funny.
I never really wanted to be beautiful.
Thank you, nurse.
I'll be down later.
This happens to be the Twilight Zone.
King Kong now playing.
Now what, doctor?
Move into a special area.
You're talking about a ghetto, aren't you?
A ghetto designed for freaks.
Now you know you can't expect to live any kind of a life among normal people.
This fate is not God.
I feel the night out there.
I feel the air.
I can smell the flowers.
They got me!
Let me go.
Let me go.
Please.
Please let me go.
Let me go.
Please.
Oh, please.
Please let me go.
Please, please, let me go.
Big trouble.
Yeah.
There is an affordable solution.
Listen very carefully.
Call now.
A twisted lump of flesh.
Why must we feel that way?
Why shouldn't people be allowed to be different?
Why?
Well, under certain circumstances, the state does provide for the extermination of undesirables.
However, there are many factors to be considered in the decision.
A single virtue, a single morality, a single thing will happen.
Ugliness is the norm and beauty the deviation.
I want an ugly girl who loves nobody but me.
I want an ugly girl who's got no need to be free.
I want an ugly girl who loves nobody but me.

Who thinks that's the way to be?
I want an ugly girl.
I'll make you jealous just when you see.
Ugly girls must be lonely.
An ugly girl would love you only.
Ugly girls may not win many hearts.
But ugly girls have got just as many hearts.
I want an ugly girl.
Who's not scared not to paint her face.
I want an ugly girl.
Who'll move back to a primitive race.
I want an ugly girl.
Who'll make me proud to be at her disgrace.
I want an ugly girl.
Show her off all over the place.
Ugly girls deserve happiness too.
An ugly girl would make the world a view.
Ugly girls may be easy.
But ugly girls don't have energy.
I want an ugly girl.
Who can tell you how to be happy.
All about pain.
I want an ugly girl.
Who's been driven almost insane.
I want an ugly.
Who looks down like a pig.
I want an ugly girl.
Take her out and it starts to rain.
You done good thing.
Save them tribe.
Bring them back.
Keep big squirrel.
Work like you're aắcwa.
Now you win them bride.
Ministlogger.

you're still here.
And keep mind the


Take this woman is on her way.

Look.
But the king of the country yellartin.
Thou scary as hell.
Even him.
It's supposed.
Then,
I want an ugly girl by Little Theodore.
Friends, from his new CD, the very best of Little Theodore's greatest hits.
That's the name of it.
You can see littletheodore.com.
His name is spelled F-Y-O-D-O-R.
F-Y-O-D-O-R.
Fyodor, you might say.
LittleTheodore.com.
And before that, we heard some Noral Pref, who's also available from NoralPref.com.
Well, we're packing it in here.
Packing it in.
I'm packed and content.
I'm packing.
We're packing them.
A mean load, friends.
A mean load of slack.
We're riding hard over a herd of...
All humans seem to return to the state of...
We're going to pack it up your exit wound, my friend.
We're going to force you to love slack.
We will force you to love Bob.
As the child prophet said, if you don't love Bob, he'll bob you out.
Do you hear that?
If you don't love Bob, he'll bob you out.
He will.
Literally.
Bob, you out.
Uncle Dr. Onan Canobite actually still channels Bob more regularly and more purely than almost any other subgenial.
And better than most, too.
Well, my sermons are about one...
A third to one half Onanisms, you might say, yes.
No, I use Onan as he was meant to be used.
Bob put him here as a tool.
Onan is one single tool of Bob used by the sacred scribe as a sort of a peen.
And we have used the peen of Onan to inscribe the word of God into the ears of the listeners.
That's what he is.
That's what he is.







And we are filling them with a syrup of love and feelings and slack.
Guaranteed inertness.
So what about this Texas UFO sex death cult?
Well, that's, you know, that's what the conspiracy likes to call us and what we like the conspiracy to call us because it helps create interest in the church.
Kids like to think that they're going to get free sex with some weirdo.
And they will.
They will.
That's the crazy thing.
For a long time, sure, it was a boys club.
But build it and they will come, so to speak.
We started saying, well, it's crazy mutant sex.
Good sex for mutants.
Come next day, you'll meet your true love.
And by gobs, it worked.
It came to pass.
Bob's promise rings true.
He kicks you in the scrote with love.
Have they ever been...
Thousands.
There is an overpopulation of squalling little yeti, yetinsani, subgenius children.
Yes, it's beautiful.
And matings between subgeniuses and...
And, you know, we bring in young boys and girls from fringe cults like the pagans, the wiccans and so forth.
The...
The astrologists, the new agers and the frustrated Christian boys.
The Amish.
We'll get...
We'll bring in people from these other religions and they'll meet a subgenius.
They'll take their clothes off.
They'll have a sort of an intercourse, a sexual intercourse.
They'll mate and have children.
Sometimes they even get married under Bob and Connie's authority.
And dominion.
Because Bob and Connie remain...
And dominion over you.
Over the couple.
You do it when they tell you to do it.
I know.
And I heard...
You look at your Bob and Connie almanac.
All the other groups...
And you find out when's the best time to have your child.
On your Bob.
Just don't...
You can use a human, but don't fertilize one.
And don't let a human fertilize you, boys and girls.
I want you to think about that.
You can use a human, but don't let...
Don't fertilize.
Don't fertilize.
Don't create a mixed, miscegenated thing.
A half human, half subgenius thing.
Because that's what we are.
That's what we all are.
We just don't want to make it for our people.
Hey, speak for yourself, Stag.
Yeah, that's right.
I am at least...
I feel so sorry for the human.
I feel so sorry for the half-breed.
I'm at least 30 to 40 percent...
I would say I'm at least 60 percent...

I feel sorry for the one-penis.
I would say I'm 60 percent yeti and two-thirds subgenius mongreloid.
I like two-thirds pizza and one-third subgenius.
Well, no, I'm two-thirds pizza and 60 percent yeti.
If it would have been a pizza station, I would have made it with pizza.
Well, the bottom line is the sum of the total is greater than 100 percent.
Where about that?
That's right, because I'm taking away four percent right now.
Off the top, because that's the way you are.
You're just a four-percenter guy.
I'm a four-percenter and, you know, I wanted to be a ten-percenter, but I'm not ten percent, Gary.
Well, you get four percent before you tell anybody what the amount is.
Macaroni for ten more.
It's about $96 a square foot in the kitchen.
Very well.
But I wouldn't put it into that.
But why are your feet square?
What did you do to them to make them that way?
We added more toast.
He added more toast.

He added more toast.
Or was there a little thing with which you managed to save them?
You know, a lot of toast.
Perhaps we were buying the way the domain had to be counted out a bit.
And thus, newsstand publications create a market.
We're down here at the beach right now.
Hardcore pornography.
You can't believe it.
Everyone's naked at the beach now, and it's raining, and it's dark, and we can't see each other's birthmarks or anything.
So it's really fun.
We can't see our stretch marks, our birthmarks.
We can't see our caesarean marks.
I can see your caesarean scar.
Well, from the inside, maybe.
The inside of this bag that you put me in.
It must be awful dark if you can see my caesarean scar.
Only in this bag you put me in, along with these body parts.
That's not a bag.
You said you wanted a young girl.
I just wanted to see Bob's smiling face forever and ever.
Well, I wanted to see it, too, but unfortunately I ran out of gas somewhere around three months, so now I have to see it.
I'm in this deep pit.
I ran out of gas about three o'clock.
Hey, it looks like it's starting.
Yeah, that's why we called it four.
We were hoping to get a word in edgewise.
Well, we're wedging it in, and it hurts.
The most insidious single group of publications.
More lubricant and more corn starch.
Named after General Sherman.
General Sherman?
Didn't he invent the cigarette that caused Sherman's disease?
No, Sherman, New York.
Home of famous Brushwood and X-Day.
You can't brush that off, too.
Sherman, New York.
Home of Brushwood, dear friends, and home of the X-Day drills held every July 5th until the World Praise Bob ends.
And now, from Lemur, today's space-time forecast.
Forecast.
For tonight, our weekend will start to shift around to a more subtly weekend.
And into this upcoming weekend, we'll be looking at the world.
This will increase our night because of the Earth.
For Sunday, however, our Monday looks like a Saturday.
I've killed probably a couple hundred living and whole human beings.
Did I just commit mass murder?
No, because each of these human beings is nothing more than a part of a larger me.
Now, what's great about that is that people tend not to want living human beings.
To put that in even clearer terms...
So what do you think God is like?
A fly.
No, but he's've got a real shitty 윤.
We dont even know that word for fish.
Did you find guided dreams?

And what do I plan on doing with thoseほど us back?
Way to simple, isn't it?
All noticed that you large lump of filtered blood was that of an animal.
It's big business.
Curiosity and dreams all lead to something very special.
Very clean.
Corporations have to be big business.

everybody makes a mistake once in a while.
Well.

Wait a minute.
Red tape.
Oh, it does get a little complicated.
Limited liability.
Look.
Now that corporation operates legally as an individual person.
It is under the law a legal entity.
Well, limited risk to the individual owners.
Corporations can make large quantities of meat.
Ownership.
It's fun.

Friends, the conspiracy is real.
And so are you.
But the church is more real.
Bob told you to become a minister.
And you must do it.
I know you.
You're sitting there.
Then you're gonna wait till you can't do it today.
There don't.
Not gone.
So fight your doctor right away if you have ever had tuberculosis or serious tuberculosis.
From PR News in Washington, I'm retaining fluid because of PR News.
PR is bad.
Meanwhile, over the weekend, Christians called for a tyranny that targets Iraq's foot problems.
On Wall Street, 7 to 10-9-6-7-3-3-9.
According to a new study,

slammed into a concrete PR News in Washington.
Mighty fine guy.
Great big too slim guy.

If you know a man,

Right you are, Slim.
So, so, so, so, so,

It's quick.
It's easy.
It's the Cowboy Way.
Listen, boys, this is me.
Listen, boys.
This man's life has lost its zest.
Who cares?
For him, the kick's gone out of living.
Sports.
You're mean.
No interest at home or at the office either.
Why get in the sweat over a lot of busy work?
Hugh couldn't care less.
Good excuse to leave.
Is he depressed about anything?
The verdict?
Boredom.
Boredom.
Not a psychiatrist.
Yes, a psychiatrist.
Dr. Bogart.
Boredom's an emotional state.
Well, why make a federal case out of it?
Doesn't bother me any.
Well, it does me.

Inner conflict for Anne.
Stupidity.
Boredom.
Hard, hot, and even little girls can bite.
Just a little.
Hatred of authority.

He taught him all about tools.
Loneliness was even worse.
It's a conflict situation.

Being left here all the time with Kenny.
Deeper into boredom.
And yet there's still is hope for him.
For out of the day's events, a dim awareness is growing in him.
A vague realization that perhaps the road he's on isn't quite the one he wants to travel.
Bleak Cows by Norrell Preff, dear friends.

Background music for this whole show, for the credits that I've been doing.
This in the background is the amino acids from their album,
Destroy the Warming Sun.
And now, let's go to one of my very favorite Little Theodore songs, friends,
from his very best of Greatest Hits album, Tried.
I tried to be good, but all I liked was bad.
I tried to be joyful, and it made me far more sad.
I tried to be fair, but I knew I'd just be loud.
I tried to use my reason, and it showed me that I'm bad.
I tried to be smart, but I didn't want to faint.
I tried to be clean, but I much preferred to stink.
I wanted to soar, but can't do that thing that stinks.
I tried to be in control, and it drove me to the plane.
I tried to be warm, but I despised all others.
I tried to be strong, but I hated all the colors.
I tried philanthropy, but I couldn't think of others.
I tried to be eloquent, and I reduced the sickness to life.
I tried to be good, but I didn't want to faint.
I tried to be strong, but I didn't want to faint.
I tried to be strong, but I didn't want to faint.
I tried to be strong, but I didn't want to faint.
I tried to be strong, but I didn't want to faint.
I tried to be strong, but I didn't want to faint.
I tried to be authentic.
I tried to be holistic.
I tried to be authentansas.



I couldn't be positional.

This is a church that does not play games.
The other churches talk about love and things.
We will give you love.
The other churches do not talk about money.
They take your money.
We'll give you love.
We'll sell you love.
Some people don't appreciate love unless it's sold to them.
They won't like it if it's given away free.
We're saints.
We're monks of Buldada.
We have no use.
We have no, yeah, we're like Bob.
We're already rich in slack.
I feel the slack showering down over me.
It's the tribulation money.
It's sprinkling down from the sausage.
Oh, yes, Bob.
Oh, yes, Bob.
Come on up behind me, Bob.
Oh, yes.
Oh, woo, woo.
Yeehaw.
Slow down there and tomorrow morning.
Take that coffee away from him.
Computer God.
That's it, baby.
That's it.
That is what computer God slavery is.
You can be there now with Bob.
You can be friend.
You can be alone with Bob.
You first.
Long time.
Release the tigers.
Release the tigers.
Okay, if you could go to heaven with Jesus and Hitler and all you had was a gun with one bullet on it, which one would you shoot?
I might shoot blank.
Oh.
That's what they tell me.
I'm poor enough to answer that.
Round and face.
Too late.
I gave it all away.
What if it was Hitler and Bush?
Which one would you shoot?
G. Gordon.
What's the difference, man?
What?
What?
What?
What's the difference?
You mean between the Bush and Hitler?
That makes me feel better.
Hitler and Bush.
Hitler and Bush.
Hitler and Bush.
They say that Hitler is much smarter.
Right, at least Hitler actually fought in the army.
Hitler really did serve.
Hitler really wrote his own book.
Yes.
Hitler could paint.
Unfortunately, he accomplished his objective.
What?

Reverend Stang, in Germany,
we are very concerned about this fascism in America.
It was a creepy thing to hear, actually.
No kid, that would be creepy.
I had to say, well, then come and liberate us.
You must free us from the tyrant.
A panzer battalion in the right place

Come on, Potter, we're on the air.
Through my open window I will climb
To your living quarters I will wander
There beneath your flowers I will find
Your ladder to climb
Across your dusty carpet I will fall
Crawling like a baby down your hallway
To the place where you and I first met

Thank you.
The Billy Nair Show, friends, from Return to Brigadoon.
See BillyNair.com for more on them.
They'll be at X-Day, by the way.
Thanks to the amino acids there for the background noise.
And now, an updated space-time forecast.
Thank y'all.
Speaking of Wednesday, overnight Wednesday night,
right around Thursday, coming through on Friday,
the mix of Saturday and Sunday,
with an overnight Monday through the weekend.
Seattle is slow in South North.
Seattle bus barn out Southeast to Northeast State Route 167.
Now, is there magnesium?
Yes, magnesium.
Extra magnesium with a little magnesium.
The only way to do this is to carry each module of the slack off
and carefully into the next room.
What about the remake of Heaven's Gate?
You know, the black Nike.
The black Nike.
The black Nike.











Well, we've made, we've got contracts with Reebok.
And you may have seen evidence of that lately in some of their advertisements.
That's a very important one.
And we're preparing for X-Day 9.
We will have, if we can get over 900 people.
As always, our policy has been, until we have 900 people,
we're not going to try to do Jonestown 4.
Because, as we were saying earlier,
in the show, look how Jonestown 2 and 3 just were watered down imitations,
token mass suicides.
Olivia Newton and Jonestown is what.
Right.
So, we're not going to, X-Day is not going to become a mockery like that.
Yeah, of itself.
Until we have numbers to make it worth it.
Yeah.
So.
900, that's all you need.
Until then, the Kool-Aid is just Kool-Aid.
Well, all right.
But what about the applesauce and the Nikes?
Yes, we did.
And.
But, but that's not, you know,
the important thing about Bob's religion is not how they find the bodies
and talk about it on CNN someday.
The important thing is finding slack now.
Right.
In your own heart.
Exactly.
And you must reach down your throat.
Grope around until you find what slack is for you.
That's right.
Yank it up and look at it.
And then.
Right.
And then.
Classify.
Act upon what you've learned.
Go out into the world.
Fight the conspiracy.
As best you can.
Which may be simply by freeloading.
Living off the man.
Stealing.
Perhaps what they call stealing.
Or it may be becoming a brain surgeon.
Like the great Jethro Clampett.
You can be what you want.
As Dr. Philodrum and the Overman said.
You don't need a degree, but you can get a degree if you want very easily.
Merely by deciding to.
Barely by saying you have done so.
In Bob's eyes.
Once you've rendered unto Bob that which is Bob.
Once you have gone to that catalog page at subgenius.com.
Once you have done what it instructs you to do.
Once you have soaked in the word of Bob for a few minutes.
And then ordered some more.
At that point the scales will fall from your eyes.
And you will be more a font of slackfulness.
Yes.
Than a sponge.
A sponge of slackfulness.
You will be pouring slack out.
Rather than desperately trying to suck more in.
You'll have more slack than you know what to do with.
You'll have too much slack.
Yes, there is such a thing as too much slack.
That's when it runs over.
It builds up.
It comes up to the top of your throat.
And it comes heaving out.
Heaving out into the world.
Into the path of love.
You can't handle that much slack.
You can be like a little baby.
Heaving up.
Spinning up onto its daddy.
You can just let go baby.
You can let go because Bob said to.
He said you have an excuse.
You have the justification.
You're justified.
You are justified in Bob.
For anything.
That's a good decision there.
Will everything turn out okay?
I mean I'm giving up everything.
Too late.
It doesn't matter how it turns out for you.
Oh.
It will turn out the way Bob wants it to be.
No matter what.
And you should just be glad you're part of his plan.
I know.
Be glad you were used by him.
Be glad it was him and not the Ayatollah Khomeini.
Or the Osama Bin Laden.
Or the George Bush.
Just be glad it wasn't the boss man.
Or Mr. Moneybags that used you.
Be glad that you were used.
Be glad that you were used.
Be glad.
So there.
Just melt away.
Just like the people I know.
Just diffuse yourself into the...
Ew. Look at that.
You're the smoke.
He's smoking you now.
Man is but a vapor.
He's smoking you.
Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upwards.

He knows.
Born to die.
And melt all my parts.
Oh this is the moment.
It's very painful.
I have to cut the cord now.
And launch ourselves into the great unknown.

I'm serious.
Cosmic.
Moments from now you'll hear no more Michael Pippen.
No more Ivan Stang.
No more.
No show.
Price bomb.
Price bomb.
Does that mean we'll die?
It's coming to an end.
Wait.
Am I going to die?
And you have to hold your breath.
We're all going to die but you're going to die now.
Dot dot dot.
The publisher.
On the show.
Calm calm calm.
Of the worst material.
Serene and calm.
Seen here.
And out there.
Are you saying that even the show dies?
Yes.
Even the poor show.
Never dies.
It's when I remember to bring the show straighteners.
I remember when the show never died.
And my desk drawer seems to be stuck.
Has anybody seen my sweater?
The show is on.
We are the first non-faxed 24 hours a day.
Yeah I'm getting ready now.
We're the first industrial church.
Oh tell Helen to hold all my calls.
And we're not disputing any of your belief systems or.
Cos we believe in just about every one of them anyway.
Where did these locals come from?
No.
They die.
Gas.
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.








I remember when the show was on all day and all night.
And the evening and the morning were the first.
Line up on the.
So long from Over the Edge.
This is the happiest moment of my life.
Hey we'll see you next time.
