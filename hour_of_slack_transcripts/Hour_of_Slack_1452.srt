1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,220
Oh man, look at this place!

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,200
Oh, I can't get over there where the good stuff is.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,000
Hell, I can't even reach the bad stuff. Oh man.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,240
I am going to have to clean up the fun house.

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,360
Ow! Damn it!

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,240
Ah! Oh hey, my old audio cassette.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,380
Hazel Adkins. Hey, this gives me an idea.

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,740
Go ahead and have me in your cell.

9
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:47,940
We interrupt this program to explain that for this Hour of Slack, we proudly present a recent episode of Bob's Slacktime Fun House.

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:56,140
A true masterpiece by Reverend Susie the Floozy, entitled Evil Susie's Yard Sale.

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:56,220
I know.

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,140
Evil Susie's Yard Sale of Secrets.

13
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:05,200
This was originally broadcast on the great WREK Atlanta, the radio station of Georgia Tech.

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,000
Tell everything.

15
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,940

00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,800

Well, look here.

20
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,580
Now if you come back to me, honey.

21
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,580
After I have you in your cell.

22
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,480
You won't have nobody to come back to.

23
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,980
And I know if you come back.

24
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,120
You come back.

25
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,780
It's only me.

26
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,440
Gonna have me in your cell.

27
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,320
Gonna tell the truck.

28
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:12,860
TV.

29
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,460
TV.

30
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,420
Radio.

31
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,240
Everything.

32
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,000
Everything you got.

33
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,300
So if you come back.

34
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,220
You won't have nothing left to come back to.

35
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,680
Yes, I know if you come back, baby.

36
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,480
You come back.

37
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,520
You come back to me.

38
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,720
I'm gonna have me in your cell.

39
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,720
When I get done.

40
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,400
Everybody's gonna say, well, look at him.

41
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,360
Sell everything you got.

42
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,780
Gonna have me in your cell.

43
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,960
Sell everything.

44
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,460
Everything you got.

45
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,340
So if you come back, honey.

46
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,000
You gonna come back.

47
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,520
Just only me.

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,480
Whoa.

49
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,720
Oh, why did I have to schedule the yard sale on a weekend when I have to work on the show?

50
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,440
I'll just pull up.

51
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:44,440


52
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,740
I'll just pull some piece of crap out of my butt.

53
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,100
Ah.

54
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,580
Welcome.

55
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,200
Welcome, seekers, to.

56
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,200
To.

57
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:09,920
Welcome, seekers, to that crusty leaking out house we call Bob's Slack Time Fun House.

58
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,580
Oh, no.

59
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,420
I've used that one way too many times.

60
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:14,420


61
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:14,940
I've used that one way too many times already.

62
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,620
Ah, hell.

63
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,740
I'll think up something in time.

64
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,420
I always do.

65
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,460
Hi, Polly.

66
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,820
I love it when you do that.

67
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,740
Oh, Abel, Susie.

68
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,740
Oh, I didn't hear the devil's beauty.

69
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,080
Well, not again.

70
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,900
It conked out on me on the way up the hill.

71
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:51,780
But I slammed it into reverse and turned around real fast and let the downward momentum carry me up the hill to our place.

72
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,500
I love the way you defy the laws of physics.

73
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,400
I just like defying laws.

74
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,820
Oh, I sure do.

75
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,680
So, uh, how's the yard sale coming along?

76
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,300
Okay.

77
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,420
Uh.

78
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,620
Uh.

79
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,480
Um.

80
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,900
Hey, nice job setting up these rickety-ass tables, Flooz.

81
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,680
Um.

82
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,420
Oh.

83
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,600
Oh.

84
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,280
Oh.

85
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:27,960
Oh.

86
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,100
You know, the fact that it's midnight might be the reason nobody's showing up, Bimbo Breath.

87
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:34,620
Oh.

88
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:35,800
Oh.

89
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,260
Oh.

90
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,480
Oh.

91
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:40,760


92
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:40,820


93
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:40,920


94
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,300
I mean you've done worse than usual.

95
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,480
What's a problem?

96
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,300
Uh—huh.

97
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,860
Oh, I mean, I bet you're annéesorama's but it's login possibility might have possible

98
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,700
Better be like the ghosts of the mansion, just with the

99
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,080
Oh Bob Killamy not this again.

100
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,660
Why am I always the one Maybe not the help of including you in the

101
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:03,660


102
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:03,660


103
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,440
I'm sorry you draw that detail every week, Flooz.

104
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,680
I guess if you were staring somewhere I could have done a better job.

105
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,420
Yeah.

106
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,140
And poor football I'll be trying to take it weirdifficantly

107
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:10,900
Well, problems with this cake is eventually turning you the opposite

108
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,660
shows before?

109
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,820
Well, when I do a

110
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,300
show, it's something

111
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,180
special.

112
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,780
You know, it's like a...

113
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,860
It's like a...

114
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,520
It's like a flying dog.

115
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,600
It shouldn't be able to do it,

116
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,820
but it does it.

117
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,640
What are you gonna do?

118
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,940
So, what are you gonna do?

119
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:33,220
Oh!

120
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,820
Let me do my part.

121
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,200
I thought a little sock in the jaw

122
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,120
would perk you up.

123
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,720
See what you mean?

124
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,400
Hell, couldn't hurt.

125
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,780
Yeah, it's a show.

126
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,980
It's good to be like having a major

127
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,060
brain hemorrhage every week.

128
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,040
Ah, this will create a curse again.

129
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,520
Look!

130
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,820
Hell if you ain't, girl.

131
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,320
You got a great big blood blister

132
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,120
right where you used to part your hair.

133
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,100
I still part it

134
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,060
in the same place.

135
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,580
Uh, well, there's not enough

136
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,360
hair left on it to really call it

137
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,420
apart or anything.

138
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,120
This thing's huge.

139
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,880
Geez, what are you doing?

140
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,280
Ow!

141
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,200
You want I should pop it?

142
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,160
The hell no!

143
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,400
What if it's full of brain fluid or something?

144
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,840
Oh, as if there's a chance of that.

145
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,780
Come on, flus.

146
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,180
You know I haven't been happy since your back cleared up.

147
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,120
Oh, let me at it.

148
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,040
Come on. Come on, let me at it.

149
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,620
Oh, wait, I don't know.

150
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,880
Oh, this is awful.

151
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:34,760
Oh, no.

152
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,760
Oh, no, it'd be no problem at all.

153
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,540
I'd love to help you out.

154
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,900
Look at me.

155
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,020
Well, okay, but...

156
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,280
Bingo!

157
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,180
Do it fast.

158
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,060
Come here, stay still.

159
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,320
Don't worry, I'm a doctor.

160
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,800
Stop squirming.

161
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,060
You're not helping things.

162
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,580
This is a delicate operation.

163
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,300
Flus?

164
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,060
Are you strangling it?

165
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,300
Sharpening your nails or something.

166
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,160
They are filed to points.

167
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,840
Oh, that's a terrible thing.

168
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:08,840
Oh, no!

169
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:08,880
Damn.

170
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,860
I got some leathery skin, sister.

171
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,080
Oh, evil Susie.

172
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,720
Mm-hmm.

173
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,860
I've just been feeling this yearning.

174
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh, what's the matter now?

175
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,160
It involves to go back to my roots.

176
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,540
So get a touch of my hair.

177
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,600
Oh, no.

178
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,280
Look, I know you got yearnings for home.

179
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,040
I put some wheels up against your friggin' house.

180
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,580
What more do you want out of me, damn it?

181
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,160
Oh, it just ain't the same.

182
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,360
It's just...

183
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,180
Ah, flus.

184
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,700
Oh.

185
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,360
I mean, putting wheels on a brick house

186
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,420
just don't make it a mobile home.

187
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm just in one of my moods.

188
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,620
Oh, great.

189
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,940
Your freakin' moods swing like Charo

190
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,220
at a pipe fitters convention.

191
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,000
Who?

192
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,080
Ah, never mind.

193
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,960
Hey, I know you think I waste all my time down at the bar,

194
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,020
but hey, last night I was telling Olaf

195
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,820
about your damn moods, and you know what?

196
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,960
We came up with a new treatment

197
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,220
for your continuous boring depression.

198
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,520
Uh, I don't know about that.

199
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,680
Come on, trust me.

200
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,420
We spent hours sitting in the back booth

201
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,360
with our heads together figuring this thing out.

202
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:21,760
Uh-huh.

203
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,480
We even got it all diagrammed out here,

204
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,020
nice and scientific on beer coasters.

205
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:27,420
See?

206
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,620
I don't know.

207
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,060
This looks like some drunk's football play chart

208
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,360
mapped out in ketchup.

209
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,600
Oh, yeah.

210
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,280
Uh, duh.

211
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,540
I'll help you with it.

212
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,780
Uh, what's that one supposed to be?

213
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,660
Uh, that's you.

214
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,580
And that one?

215
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,860
And that's me.

216
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,400
And this up here?

217
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,220
Uh, oh.

218
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,940
That's a booger.

219
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,560
Ew.

220
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,560
And that?

221
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,500
Oh, that's that dirty old 10 gallon plastic grout tub

222
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,380
full of stagnant rainwater over there.

223
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,000
I don't think that's rainwater.

224
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,640
I think it's...

225
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,100
Yeah, whatever.

226
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,980
It doesn't matter as long as it's liquid.

227
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,420
Uh-huh.

228
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,160
Anyhow, we got it figured out.

229
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,800
All you have to do is...

230
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,380
Stick your head in the bucket three times.

231
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:07,900
Uh-huh.

232
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:08,920
Three.

233
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,740
Uh-huh.

234
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,120
Three.

235
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,280
And you pull it out twice.

236
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,020
Uh...

237
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,780
Two...

238
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,800
Yeah.

239
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,140
Uh...

240
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,480
Duh...

241
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,280
I don't know how I could possibly make it any more simple than that.

242
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,260
Uh...

243
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,720
It can't fail.

244
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,380
I don't know about that.

245
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,100
I mean, it sounds good, but...

246
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,780
This time, Flooz, I still...

247
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,260
I swear it's a surefire thing.

248
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,600
How do I know this guy is an expert at treating depression?

249
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,780
Olaf Suranovsky is a freaking brain trust man.

250
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,020
Okay, I'll do it.

251
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,480
Oh, good girl.

252
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,180
But you gotta pay me off.

253
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,380
Oh, I want to hear some King Yusnevich and his Yusnevich tones while I'm getting the

254
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:56,780
treatment.

255
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,720
Sure you can.

256
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,300
Uh-huh.

257
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,320
Oh, I just can't get enough King Yusnevich, you know.

258
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,100
Oh, yeah, nobody can.

259
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:11,060
They're like an intoxicating high-colonic in musical form, aren't they?

260
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,920
That clogs me up for a whole week.

261
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,920
That trademark sound of theirs can crack your chakras like a whip.

262
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,840
Whatever cranks your tractor, Flooz.

263
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,200
Ah, here it is.

264
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,540
Twistin' and Bowlin' with King Yusnevich and his Yusnevich Tones, Volume 2.

265
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,000
Bob, kill me.

266
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:28,860
Just kill me.

267
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,140
Listen to that divine discordance.

268
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,600
Oh, the tinkling of the fairies.

269
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
Bottoms up.

270
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,740
I love my job.

271
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,400
Hey!

272
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,300
Everybody wants Kung Fu Patti.

273
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,220
We can't let me.

274
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,120
Everybody wants Kung Fu Patti.

275
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,180
We can't let me.

276
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,580
But they were dancing on a

277
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:03,580


278
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:03,580


279
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:03,580


280
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,960
They were discoing down.

281
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,940
They were partying down.

282
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,920
They were jumping around.

283
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,440
They was conging one and throwing the other.

284
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,240
They were dancing around with one another.

285
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:24,540
It sure was pounding.

286
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,540
They were discoing down.

287
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,580
They were doing the hustle.

288
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,540
They were doing the bump.

289
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,880
Oogie, oogie, oogie, oogie.

290
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,660
They were partying down with Oogie and you.

291
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,100
They was talking.

292
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,320
They was booing.

293
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,680
They was doing it too.

294
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,040
Everybody was going to party.

295
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:48,700
We got it.

296
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,400
Everybody was going to party.

297
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,520
Yeah, it sure was pounding.

298
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,700
Everybody was going to party.

299
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,780
The party was great.

300
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,540
And they were really poco nerdy.

301
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:21,800
We did it there.

302
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:21,800


303
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:21,800


304
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,440
I don't have a talk show, do I?

305
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,820
But it was a lot of fun.

306
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:29,820


307
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:30,540


308
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:30,980
Right.

309
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:31,320


310
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,620
Those boys always deliver.

311
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,380
Oh, the record album.

312
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,120
Huh?

313
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:38,960
Uh.

314
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:39,600
Huh?

315
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,640
I've got some bad news.

316
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,300
Oh.

317
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,240
I was lighting a cigarette.

318
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,200
Oh, no, no.

319
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:52,920
Yeah, and I accidentally set the flamethrower face down on the turntable.

320
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,240
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

321
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,260
Oh, my Usnevich album.

322
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,380
It's a charred blob.

323
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,200
Blobs.

324
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,500
I don't know how these things keep happening.

325
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,320
Oh, you don't know how sorry I am about that.

326
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:16,780
Especially after that unfortunate mishap with your Danger Woman tape and the hydraulic punch press.

327
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,120
I mean, was that a freak accident or what?

328
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,300
Well, at least I got to play the hell out of it.

329
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,340
Oh, when I think of all the pain I've inflicted with this charred blob.

330
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:32,900
I mean, after all, WREK Atlanta is a...

331
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,800
Uh, it's a 40-watt radio station.

332
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,060
Yeah, a 40-watt radio station.

333
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,640
And that means we got a broadcast radius of a...

334
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,880
Yards.

335
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,200
Quite a few yards, actually.

336
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,060
Whoa, so that means we've got...

337
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,220
What the hell?

338
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,660
At least a dozen listeners.

339
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,020
Right?

340
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,240
Well, at least.

341
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,200
At least.

342
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:58,820
At least.

343
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,700
With a wind at our backs.

344
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,380
No wonder we let this go to our heads.

345
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:14,220
Hey, uh...

346
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:15,960
Flues?

347
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:16,780
Mm-hmm.

348
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,960
Yeah, I...

349
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,460
I know we're not...

350
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,160
Like, real close or anything, but, uh...

351
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,040
That's not true.

352
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,220
That...

353
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:32,920
Uh...

354
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,660
I was...

355
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,320
Huh?

356
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,420
Wondering if you could...

357
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:39,920
Hmm?

358
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,380
Give me a little advice.

359
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,840
What?

360
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,440
You?

361
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,780
Need advice?

362
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,500
From me?

363
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
Yeah, you're...

364
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,220
Kind of my only choice here, so, uh...

365
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,860
Wow, that's kind of nice you got confidence in me.

366
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,900
Yeah, yeah.

367
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,020
I don't know.

368
00:15:59,180 --> 00:15:59,900
I don't know.

369
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,560
It's...

370
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,020
It's just that something's stupid, so...

371
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,840
I thought, what the hell?

372
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,260
It might be your particular area of expertise.

373
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,820
Oh, okay.

374
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,300
It's worth a shot.

375
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,960
So, uh...

376
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,080
Yeah.

377
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,360
And...

378
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,740
What?

379
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,260
Well...

380
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,600
It's...

381
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,300
It's like...

382
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,020
Mm-hmm.

383
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,140
Uh...

384
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,520
You can talk to me.

385
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,240
The hell?

386
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,180
Well...

387
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:27,500
Eh...

388
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,500
Come on, Evil Susie.

389
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,000
I've got a thick old hide.

390
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,800
I'm totally unsurprisable.

391
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,480
Oh...

392
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,080
The...

393
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,640
Well...

394
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,320
Lose?

395
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:39,920
Uh-huh.

396
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,280
How can you tell...

397
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:45,740
Yeah?

398
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,240
If a boy likes you?

399
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,600
Oh, is that all?

400
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,060
For a moment, I thought you...

401
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,740
Huh?

402
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,520
Please!

403
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,100
Selfish whore!

404
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,160
You always pass out when I need you.

405
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:58,760
Damn it!

406
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,800
UFO Shield

407
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,680
Here I go, falling down down down

408
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,600
My mind is a blank

409
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,400
My head is spinning

410
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:09,960
станов

411
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:09,960


412
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,900
...

413
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:19,380
In such a crazy, crazy,

414
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,260
When I get weak in the knees

415
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:22,880
When I get weak underneath

416
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,340
My poor old head is a-rea-ling

417
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,120
As I go deep into the funnel of love

418
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:28,140
As I go deep into the funnel of love

419
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,260
It's time to get you some.

420
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,600
As for freaking Asian...

421
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,820
Oh, so you're surfacing from one of your drunken stupors.

422
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,860
About damn time I asked you a question.

423
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,000
Oh, man, I must be drunk.

424
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,780
I thought you asked me some love-lorn teeny-bopper thing like,

425
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,500
how can I tell if a boy likes me?

426
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,720
Not again!

427
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:29,680
Ow!

428
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,820
Damn it, you're impossible to carry on a conversation with.

429
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,800
Evil Susie, is that you?

430
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,900
Oh, crap, what, did I beat you blind?

431
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,020
No, I really mean it.

432
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,360
Is that you in that steel bustier?

433
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,260
Yeah, it's all three of me in it.

434
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,540
But I think there's room for one more.

435
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,780
Evil Susie, what the hell?

436
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,280
What the hell?

437
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,340
Oh, who is it?

438
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,360
It's Olaf down at the bar.

439
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,120
Oh, you mean that drunken lunatic who writes a pornography

440
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,000
with Janet Reno doing Janet Napolitano?

441
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,000
Mm-hmm.

442
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,720
Oh, no, not that barfly who comes up with pyramid scams

443
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,520
involving kidnapped orphans and scratch-off games.

444
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,220
Oh, yeah.

445
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,680
The dude you met in a dumpster?

446
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,200
Yeah.

447
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:17,840
Olaf?

448
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,300
Yeah.

449
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,540
Olaf and I have a lot in common.

450
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,100
Oh, well, there's one similarity I can see.

451
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,400
He's imaginary.

452
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,200
Oh?

453
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,540
Oh, you think so?

454
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,140
Yeah.

455
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,120
Hmm.

456
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,440
Hmm.

457
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,560
Hey, actually, that's kind of good.

458
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,740
Because if he's imaginary, that means I can't knock him up.

459
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,280
Hey, this is getting better and better.

460
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,260
Oh, yeah, better and better for who?

461
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:53,160
Where am I supposed to go when you and Olaf are bumping uglies?

462
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:53,500
Ooh.

463
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,020
Ha, ha, ha.

464
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,320
Just tune you out like I'm a...

465
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,660
Violet Hilton or something?

466
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,220
Ah, you mean Daisy Hilton, dumbass.

467
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,820
What difference does it make?

468
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,300
They were Siamese twins joined at the hip.

469
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:03,560
Duh.

470
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,420
Yeah.

471
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,940
Look, Flooz, all I know is that for the first time in my life,

472
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,720
not involving money or jury tampering,

473
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,860
I have this one chance at happiness.

474
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,840
Oh, but...

475
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,760
And this is your chance to make it up to me

476
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,500
for all those times that you've let me ruin

477
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,200
every chance of happiness that you've ever had.

478
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,320
Uh, but I didn't...

479
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:25,600
Me?

480
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:25,900
Yeah.

481
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,800
Every single chance.

482
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,360
Oh.

483
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:28,940
Yeah.

484
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,580
You owe it to me.

485
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,220
Yeah, you got a point.

486
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:32,820
Yeah.

487
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,140
Hey, wait a minute.

488
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,600
Oh, here we go again.

489
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,840
Wait a damn minute.

490
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,900
What a twat waffle.

491
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,960
Do you know what I owe you, Evil Susie?

492
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,060
You have no idea.

493
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,520
Do you know what I freaking owe you?

494
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,940
Well, there's a time you just let me take your car

495
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,260
and run it right into the...

496
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:48,640
My ass!

497
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,120
Ah!

498
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,340
That's what I owe you.

499
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:51,520
Oh.

500
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,260
And I owe myself the delicious pleasure of effing you up.

501
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:55,360
Oh, I know.

502
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:55,360


503
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:55,360


504
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:55,360


505
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:55,580
Come on, you're gonna pull me up for a

506
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:55,980
change.

507
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,140
Wheeel.

508
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,480
And I know

509
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,340
just the thing that'll do it too.

510
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,580
Oh, yeah.

511
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,680
Ha-ha-ha.

Oh, yeah, that sounds like me.

549
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,480
Red hair and wavy eyes.

550
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:55,320
Yeah, it doesn't really matter to me you don't have brain function.

551

Aw, that's real charitable of you.

00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,140
Hey.

553
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,980
It's perfect for my plans.

Uh, what plans?

555
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,320
Oh, um, hey, why don't you show me some of this crap you have for sale here?

Oh, uh, yeah, sure.

557

Okay.

558

Check it out.

559
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,520
Oh, wow, a four-track tape player.

560
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,220
Yeah.

561
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,780
Big leap in technology.

562
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,040
I'll say, they were like three times as good as the two-tracks.

563
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:24,640
Uh-huh.

564
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,420
What?

565
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,060
Yeah.

566
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,280
Ah, never mind.

567
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,140
I even have a tape to go with it.

568
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,260
Oh, I wish I could hang on to it, but I need the money, damn it.

569
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:42,280
You got sentimental panties over Bill Carlisle croons the country trucker hits of 1970.

570
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:51,440
Oh, it says it's Bill Carlisle on the label, but I can really tell it's Dr. Tater Gumphreys using a sly stage name.

571
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,620
Oh, yeah, I know Tater.

572
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,140
How can you tell it's him, though?

573
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,660
Well, this guy talks just like Tater.

574
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,380
Ah, yeah.

575
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,760
And there's a possum reference in the first verse.

576
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,360
Good enough for me.

577
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,520
Strap it on.

578
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,520
You mean slap it in?

579
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,200
Eh, whatever.

580
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,440
Okay, I'll get the straps.

581
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,080
Now, me and Liz was on our first date.

582
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
We was a set with this red light.

583
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,260
I have it the way.

584
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:31,500
And this old boy walked up with a big possum grin, and he just opened the cargo and crawled right in.

585
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,140
And I thought, what kind of deal is this?

586
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,340
You know, the thing that was getting me the most was the way this old boy seemed to feel his own.

587
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,840
Man, he was really getting under.

588
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,240
I got to wondering about this friend of Liz.

589
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,660
But I figured in a minute she'll tell me who he is.

590
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:06,740
But as we drove along, I thought, man, old man, because me and him and Liz was all free of holding hands.

591
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,780
Oh, what kind of deal is this?

592
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,780
Now, I ain't too smart, but I could still see.

593
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,520
This whole deal looked all fouled up to me.

594
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,820
So I thought I'd better stop it, man.

595
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,880
It's going too far, because she was hugging me, and he was hugging her.

596
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,480
And I thought, what kind of deal is this?

597
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,840
Well, I knew it wasn't right.

598
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,340
But what could I say?

599
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,360
I thought I'd just kind of let it go along that way.

600
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,340
But pretty soon I seen I was out on a limb.

601
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,520
I couldn't kiss her without kissing him.

602
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,800
And I thought, what kind?

603
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,440
What kind of deal is this?

604
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:47,320
So I stopped the car, and I said, look here, Liz.

605
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,380
You better tell me who this guy is.

606
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,360
She said, I don't know him.

607
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,880
I thought he was your friend.

608
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,420
I said, well, if you don't know him, what's he doing here?

609
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,380
Then I thought, what kind of deal is this?

610
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,820
So I grabbed him by the collar, and I jerked him out of the car.

611
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,720
I said, buddy, I ain't never seen nobody like you are.

612
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,800
How come you pull these kinds?

613
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,160
I said, well, I'm not a joke.

614
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:16,620
He said, well, sometimes it works, sometimes it don't.

615
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,280
And I thought, what kind of deal is this?

616
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,500
Well, I drew back my fist to hit him in the face.

617
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,740
He broke loose and outrun a snake.

618
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,460
So now here I stand just looking at Liz.

619
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,520
And both of us are wondering who this guy is.

620
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,900
Now, what kind of deal do you think this is?

621
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,340
If you find out, I wish you'd let me know.

622
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,900
Man, it's tore me up like a sow's bed.

623
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,720
You ain't never been tore up.

624
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,520
You been tore up like a sow's bed.

625
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,100
You ain't never been tore up like a sow's bed.

626
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:45,640
You ain't never been tore up like a sow's bed.

627
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,020
See, what did I tell you?

628
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,960
A tater puts a bump in bumpkin, I'll give him that.

629
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,100
That's tater all over.

630
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:53,780
Yeah.

631
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,960
Hey, looky here.

632
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,220
If nobody buys these canned goods, you're certainly welcome to them.

633
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,400
Nice selection.

634
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,280
Ooh, tripe with extra suet.

635
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,240
My favorite.

636
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:04,540
Yeah.

637
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,920
But the cans don't sit flat.

638
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,560
Yeah, they're just a little swollen.

639
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:12,620
Just don't put them in a high cabinet so they don't roll out and bonk you on the head.

640
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,580
Yeah, good tip.

641
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,120
Mm, yeah.

642
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,740
Oh, I remember these.

643
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,300
The hottest Christmas gift idea for 1984.

644
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,000
I forgot I had that.

645
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,300
The Ronco tampon removal system kit.

646
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:32,120
I scored 50 cases of them at a discount and I was going to be rich beyond my mildest dreams.

647
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,020
Ah, yeah.

648
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,680
Until those damn product liability lawsuits killed a major money-making scheme.

649
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,080
Damn whiny butt cry babies.

650
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,860
Hell, mine grew back.

651
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,980
Speak for yourself.

652
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,320
Ah, yeah.

653
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,260
Too many moving parts.

654
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,860
That was the problem.

655
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,260
With you and the kids.

656
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,920
Oh, what's the matter now?

657
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:01,880
Oh, it's just not enough for me anymore, Evil Susie.

658
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,580
Uh, what?

659
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,500
Hurting the seekers, I mean.

660
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,140
Oh.

661
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,500
Oh, it used to give me such a cheery glow to whip until the musk flowed.

662
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,060
Ah, yeah.

663
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,060


664
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,060


665
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,060


666
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,060


667
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,060


668
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,060


669
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,060


670
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,060


671
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,060


672
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,060


673
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,060


674
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,060


675
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,060


676
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,060


677
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:14,220
But, King Yusnevich, Danger Woman.

678
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,300
Oh, yeah.

679
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,780
It's painful, all right.

680
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:22,120
Oh, but even increasing the pain levels doesn't give me that old kick anymore.

681
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,220
Ah, tell me about it.

682
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:29,360
They used to scream like gig frogs, but lately it's just rolling off them like crap off a

683
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:29,660
goose.

684
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:30,580
Damn.

685
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,240
Huh?

686
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:34,720
Boy, you bend words over like a Senate page boy.

687
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,600
It must be like what the Republicans say about drugs.

688
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,120
Huh?

689
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,220
Maybe they're right.

690
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:40,700
Lose.

691
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,240
Maybe I need to graduate to the hard stuff.

692
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:43,960
What the hell?

693
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,380
Yeah.

694
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,360
Couldn't hurt.

695
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,120
No, no.

696
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,800
That is just an expression.

697
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,420
Oh.

698
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,340
Duh, never mind.

699
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,220
Oh, Evil Susie, I don't know what's happening to my ministry.

700
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:57,840
Duh.

701
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:02,800
I used to get them coming and going, and now I don't think they're even going.

702
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,000
Oh.

703
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,340
Yeah, don't blame yourself, Lose, or the crap you play.

704
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:07,940
Oh, yeah?

705
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,020
It's the listeners.

706
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:09,100
It's the listeners.

707
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,100


708
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,100


709
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,100


710
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,100


711
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,100


712
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,100


713
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,100


714
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,100


715
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,100


716
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,540
It's the listeners' fault.

717
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:09,740
Huh?

718
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,780
Both of them.

719
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,460
Yeah.

720
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,540
You think so?

721
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:18,140
Those bums are getting complacent, like they're building up scar tissue or something, because

722
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,400
you're right, it's just not getting to them anymore.

723
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,960
Seriously, Lose, maybe you need to change your M.O.

724
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,520
Try some new schtick for a change.

725
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,300
I mean, for Dob's sake, Lose, I mean, you've been digging a rut so long it's really more

726
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,220
like a borehole at this point.

727
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,320
Oh, but...

728
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,380
Try a different tactic.

729
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:44,920
Like, uh, what would you really like to do to the Seekers?

730
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,220
Oh, but I...

731
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:51,720
Come on, trust me.

732
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,320
You swear on a stack of Revelation X's not to tell.

733
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,460
Yeah?

734
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,940
Uh, okay.

735
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,860
Just between the two of us...

736
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:07,980
Huh?

737
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,540
Oh, yeah.

738
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,400
I always like that fart in Multiple Maniacs when Devon says...

739
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,980
I think I'm beginning to get upset again.

740
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,060
My nerves are cracking.

741
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,060
I'm getting too old to play this circuit.

742
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,260
I'm tired of this show.

743
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,720
We oughta just pick them up and shoot them.

744
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,640
Just pick them up off the street, tie them up and kill them.

745
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,860
If we could move a lot faster that way, three or four loads a day, if I could give it all

746
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:35,220
these other people on this show, it could all be mine to do with if I please.

747
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,920
Ah, yeah.

748
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,360
I'm gonna have to go.

749
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:38,360


750
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:38,360


751
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:38,360


752
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:38,360


753
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:38,360


754
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:38,360


755
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:38,360


756
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:38,760
That one.

757
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,400
Damn, Flooz, it's still waters go.

758
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,380
Yours must be over the Marianas Trench.

759
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:44,860
Huh?

760
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,820
What is that, some kind of disease?

761
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,220
Ah, never mind.

762
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,440
He just surprised me is all.

763
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,200
She sure had the right idea.

764
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:53,620
Yeah.

765
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,600
I don't think they took the concept far enough for my taste.

766
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,560
Tell me, Evil Susie.

767
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,020
Huh?

768
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,220
Just between the two of us...

769
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:02,820
Mm-hmm.

770
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,020
What would you really like to do to the Seekers?

771
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:06,860
Well...

772
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,340
I don't know.

773
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:08,340


774
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:08,340


775
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:08,340


776
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:08,340


777
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:08,340


778
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:08,340


779
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:08,340


780
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:08,340


781
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:08,340


782
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,440
I've got a few questions for you.

783
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:11,440


784
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:11,440


785
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:11,440


786
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:11,440


787
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:11,440


788
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:11,440


789
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,340
Well, first off...

790
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:13,920
Uh-huh?

791
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,360
I need two important things.

792
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,180
Uh-huh?

793
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,620
Privacy and time.

794
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,700
Ah, yeah.

795
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:29,420
Oh, and a Sears Diehard hooked up to a bed frame.

796
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,060
Mm, yeah.

797
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,180
And then I get a gunny sack full of liver.

798
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:32,540
Ooh.

799
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,340
Some bathtub cock and an Evanrude outboard motor.

800
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,140
Oh.

801
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,320
And then I get a gunny sack full of liver, some bathtub cock and an Evanrude outboard

802
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:38,320


803
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:38,320


804
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,300
the piranhas. I need lots

805
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,240
of piranhas.

806
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,100
That sounds good.

807
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,680
Oh, look out, it's him!

808
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:52,200
Oh, you didn't

809
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,500
tell me this was on tape.

810
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,000
Oh, I think I got my left hooter caught

811
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,920
in the pickup reel on the way around.

812
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:58,460
Ah.

813
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,260
Oh, look, it knocked over all the stuff

814
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,080
on the table.

815
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,880
Oh, hey,

816
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,140
Evil Susie, don't throw away that old paper towel

817
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,740
tube. Why? It's just trash.

818
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,980
Boy, you have it

819
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,720
wrong. Look, I'm

820
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,420
trash. Whoa, you're right.

821
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,760
But this paper towel tube is a treasure

822
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,680
trove of magical entertainment.

823
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,300
Uh, yeah. Really?

824
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,720
Listen to Thomas Moore's record,

825
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,860
My Magical World.

826
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,860
Now hear this.

827
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,240
Now hear this.

828
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,460
All boys and girls are invited

829
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,400
to get a paper towel

830
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:34,980
tube.

831
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,820
It means your

832
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:49,900
good first

833
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:49,900


834
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:50,640
But I can tell you

835
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:50,640


836
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:50,960
say

837
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,440
you've

838
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:51,440


839
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:51,460
memory

840
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:51,480
is

841
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:51,480


842
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:51,480


843
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:51,480


844
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:51,480


845
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:51,820
need

846
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:51,920
a

847
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,760
second

848
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,260
guys

849
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:54,260


850
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:54,260


851
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:54,480
BAR

852
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:54,500
of

853
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:54,500


854
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:54,700
beard.

855
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:54,700


856
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:54,700


857
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:54,700


858
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:54,700


859
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:54,700


860
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:54,700


861
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:54,700


862
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:54,700


863
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:54,700


864
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:54,700


865
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:54,700


866
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:54,700


867
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:54,700


868
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,060
This

869
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,260
is

870
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:58,260


871
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:58,600
じゃ

872
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:01,760
없

873
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,300
encode

874
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:03,940
the

875
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,740
book

876
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:03,920
machine

877
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,520
glance

878
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:04,820
a

879
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,780
Roll it now.

880
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,800
Favorite towel tube is a rolling pin.

881
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,040
A rolling pin.

882
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,240
A rolling pin.

883
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,720
Favorite towel tube is a rolling pin.

884
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,580
Roll it now.

885
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,220
Whee!

886
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,700
Whee!

887
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,100
Whee!

888
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:32,280
Whee!

889
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:34,660
Whee!

890
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:36,860
See?

891
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,300
Whoa, you're right.

892
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,140
Woo-hoo!

893
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,100
Wacko!

894
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:40,640
Hey!

895
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,160
Yeah, that guy's got some tubular balls.

896
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,680
Just goes to prove that any idiot can get a recording contract.

897
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,100
Ah.

898
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,340
I bet it works with tampon applicators, too.

899
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,420
Hey, don't throw out that slimy old snot rag.

900
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,960
Yeah, yeah, I get the idea.

901
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,220
Jeez, flus.

902
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,300
If trash is so popular, how come you aren't doing better?

903
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,280
Yeah, damn good point.

904
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,520
Hey, you know, flus.

905
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,280
Uh-huh.

906
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,820
Maybe you just need a change of venue.

907
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,340
Uh-huh.

908
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:11,940
Venue?

909
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,340
Uh, scenery.

910
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,520
Sorry, old habit.

911
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,200
You know.

912
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:15,740
Uh.

913
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:20,500
New fields to plow, new pinks to torment, new seekers to fleece.

914
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:20,680
Woo!

915
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:26,320
We could load up everything into the devil's Nissan and take Bob's slack time funhouse on the road.

916
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,920
You know, that's a thought.

917
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:28,340
Ow!

918
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,780
Ooh, take it easy.

919
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,180
Ow!

920
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,940
Man, I'm spiked.

921
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:32,320
There.

922
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,400
Can't have too much of that now.

923
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,940
Going on the road could do you some good.

924
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:38,760
Yeah.

925
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,480
Yeah.

926
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:43,140
Yeah, that's how Stang got his act going, out on the road.

927
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,000
Oh, yeah.

928
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,000
He was geeking at drive-in movies.

929
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:51,660
Then he started sneaking in a little preaching between chickens, and pretty soon word was

930
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,080
spreading like Tracy Lords.

931
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:53,520
Ah.

932
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,220
They came for the geeking, and they stayed for the Bob.

933
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,760
Oh, touche.

934
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,580
That was when I met Stang.

935
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,080
That was when I met Bob.

936
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,540
That was when I fell under his spell.

937
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,200
Ah, yeah.

938
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,040
He worked me into the act.

939
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,640
He did the preaching.

940
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,300
I did the geeking.

941
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:16,280
Two of us had a real nice dog and pony show going there for a while.

942
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,980
God, it was hard biting the heads off of them.

943
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:29,060
Ah, memories, shmemories, flus.

944
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,800
We gotta start living for today.

945
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,160
Oh.

946
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:31,460
Oh.

947
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:31,700
Oh.

948
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:31,780
Oh.

949
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,040
Oh.

950
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,060
Oh.

951
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:32,060


952
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:32,060


953
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:32,060


954
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:32,060


955
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:32,060


956
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:32,060


957
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:32,060


958
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,420
Oh.

959
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:46,900
Oh.

960
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,480
Oh.

961
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:48,760
Oh.

962
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


963
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


964
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


965
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


966
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


967
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


968
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


969
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


970
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


971
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


972
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


973
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


974
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


975
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


976
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


977
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


978
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


979
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


980
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


981
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


982
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


983
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


984
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


985
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


986
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


987
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


988
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


989
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


990
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


991
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


992
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


993
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


994
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


995
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


996
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


997
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


998
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:48,760


999
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:56,560
Number Speed.

1000
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,760
Rest in The Reader's Line.

1001
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,620
Number Speed.

1002
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,540
Yeah, this could work.

1003
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,780
This could really work.

1004
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,100
Let's get some livestock and take our act on the road.

1005
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,260
Eh, you make a right nice vestal...

1006
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,080
Duh.

1007
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,460
Duh, whatever the hell you are, you're almost good at it.

1008
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,000
Yeah, whatever it is I am, I sure am it.

1009
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,040
Yeah.

1010
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,620
Come on, Evil Susie, there's seekers out there waiting to be fleeced.

1011
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,980
Ah, wait a minute.

1012
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,600
Wait a minute, Flooz.

1013
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,280
I just had a thought.

1014
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:28,780
Ow.

1015
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,500
The wallets we're fishing for are already empty

1016
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,900
because Stang and his crew have already milked every last subgenius and bobby out there.

1017
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:36,860
Uh-oh.

1018
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,200
Damn his eyes.

1019
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,880
Oh, the devil breathes.

1020
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,360
Dang.

1021
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:47,480
Oh, that rotten chicken joke and sump pumping son of a...

1022
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,960
Oh, touch E.

1023
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,140
I thought you and Stang were like this.

1024
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,360
Oh, how do you do that with your fingers?

1025
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,000
That's his extra.

1026
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,720
Extra joints, they sure come in handy.

1027
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,660
Ah, but what's the problem?

1028
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,580
I thought you and Stang were buddies.

1029
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,240
Oh, I don't know.

1030
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,500
Oh, I thought we were.

1031
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,660
Mm-hmm.

1032
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,300
Oh.

1033
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,680
I remember the way it used to be.

1034
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,800
Way back when Stang and me were working the circuit,

1035
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:21,700
following the road show of 2,000 maniacs and the corpse grinders.

1036
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,420
Oh, I got to see every drive-in theater in the Deep South.

1037
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:27,980
Even the circus.

1038
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:28,600
Secret ones.

1039
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,140
Damn.

1040
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,960
I've heard those whispered about.

1041
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,940
Oh, it was idyllic.

1042
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,660
I bet.

1043
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,420
Fighting the heads off livestock,

1044
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,500
draining the pus out all them infected whip marks on Stang's back.

1045
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:40,920
Ugh.

1046
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,860
Doing it all for Bob.

1047
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,820
Yeah, you bet your sweet ass.

1048
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:49,480
Oh, but then Stang started running with a fast crowd.

1049
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,360
This is just getting better and better.

1050
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,160
You know, Philo.

1051
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:54,640
Ooh.

1052
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,040
Sterno.

1053
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,400
Ooh.

1054
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,700
St. Byron.

1055
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:58,500
Ooh, yeah.

1056
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:00,620
Janer.

1057
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,260
Ugh.

1058
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:04,840
Oh, and then it took a hard turn down a bad road,

1059
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,400
and it was the doom and Papa Joe Mama.

1060
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,320
Wait.

1061
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,840
There's more.

1062
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,760
And all of them.

1063
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,680
All of them.

1064
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:13,980
Yeah.

1065
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,000
That was always my motto.

1066
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:16,960
Yeah, but...

1067
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,260
I just couldn't keep up with the geometrically increasing perversions

1068
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,100
that my church demanded of me.

1069
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,280
Who could?

1070
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,340
Well, I could, actually.

1071
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:26,980
Oh.

1072
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,460
And then came that night in Baltimore.

1073
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,080
Oh, here we go again.

1074
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,020
When my uterus fell out on stage.

1075
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:34,600
Mm-hmm.

1076
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,460
And killed that kid.

1077
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,180
Oh, yeah.

1078
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,260
Ha, ha, ha.

1079
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,020
Oh, kids, you're so cute.

1080
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:47,040
I mean, what was an 11-year-old kid even doing at a subgenius revival?

1081
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,720
Apparently stage diving.

1082
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,180
You weren't helping matters evil, Susie.

1083
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,600
One minute you're jumping up and down with glee,

1084
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,780
and the next you're going all psycho crazy, Luna.

1085
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,160
Oh, you're just looking on me.

1086
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,320
Yeah.

1087
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:05,220
Actually, at first I thought, oh, okay, she shoplifted us a rump roast.

1088
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:05,780
Great.

1089
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,800
Uh, hey.

1090
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,000
Wait a damn minute.

1091
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,940
Then I saw exactly what it was.

1092
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,160
Yeah, it was my freaking uterus.

1093
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,340
Matt, stop trying to make this about your necrotic baby hatchery flus.

1094
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:17,720
Oh.

1095
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,820
I know exactly what that was.

1096
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:26,300
A sneaky, underhanded bitch trick on your part to work a dead sixth grade kid into your

1097
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:26,760
routine.

1098
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,760
Oh, but you knew that was a bad idea.

1099
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:27,760


1100
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:27,760


1101
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:27,760


1102
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:27,760


1103
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:27,760


1104
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:27,760


1105
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:27,760


1106
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:27,760


1107
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:27,760


1108
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:27,760


1109
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,300
I knew damn well that I had to follow that act.

1110
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,060
Oh, but it...

1111
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:35,480
And just to get the audience back, I had to lead with my ping pong ball number.

1112
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,680
Oh, but I didn't mean...

1113
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,960
Talk about dirty pool.

1114
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,640
Speaking of that, I told you to put down a tarp.

1115
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,100
I was skating on my butt like Tonya Harding in a beer bust.

1116
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:46,660
Uh...

1117
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,420
Who?

1118
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,060
Oh, never mind.

1119
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,660
I guess I was once staying and I started drifting apart.

1120
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,740
Next thing I heard, he'd got the car.

1121
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:57,740


1122
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:57,740


1123
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:57,740


1124
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:57,740


1125
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:57,740


1126
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:57,740


1127
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:57,740


1128
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:57,740


1129
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:57,740


1130
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:57,740


1131
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:58,020
I thought I'd just be on the phone.

1132
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,240
He'd got the cosmetic implants and the glandscaping.

1133
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:00,820
Wow.

1134
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:05,740
And then he had a few of his peckers removed so his pants would fit tighter.

1135
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,200
Oh, like Cher's ribs.

1136
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,520
Oh, I don't know.

1137
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,240
Huh?

1138
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,260
Who are you talking about?

1139
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,620
Look, uh, never mind.

1140
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:17,120
Oh.

1141
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:20,200
Now he doesn't call, doesn't write.

1142
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:24,060
He hasn't played any of my shows in so long.

1143
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,400
Hey, he played your 1000th show.

1144
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,720
Yeah, but...

1145
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:27,720


1146
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:27,720


1147
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:27,720


1148
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:27,720


1149
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:27,720


1150
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:27,720


1151
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:27,720


1152
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:27,720


1153
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:27,720


1154
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:27,720


1155
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,880
I didn't hear it, so it doesn't count.

1156
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,000
Oh, Kenny.

1157
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:37,360
But that shouldn't make any difference because he's all-knowing and all-seeing.

1158
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,560
I can't believe it!

1159
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:40,160
What?

1160
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:43,660
You actually fell for his press release.

1161
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,060
Oh, but...

1162
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,160
But I didn't...

1163
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,060
I...

1164
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,920
Wake up call, bimbo breath.

1165
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:55,480
Just pay no attention to the man behind the curtain ring a bell, Quasimodo.

1166
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,060
Duh.

1167
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,700
I'm sorry, Tonya.

1168
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:57,700


1169
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:57,700


1170
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:57,700


1171
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:02,440
I'm sorry to be the one to break it to you, but Stang's a bigger charlatan than I am.

1172
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:02,720
Hey!

1173
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,860
Your hero ain't nothing but smoke and mirrors, baby.

1174
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:11,420
I did notice those little mirrors he had on the toes of his shoes, but I thought he used

1175
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,680
them to check his teeth for spinach before he went on stage.

1176
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:16,100
Oh, please.

1177
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:21,360
I don't have high standards for you, but you continually limbo right under them.

1178
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,100
Oh-ho.

1179
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,480
He seems so nice.

1180
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,540
Yeah, so does Mothra in the right light.

1181
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,120
Who?

1182
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,580
Duh, never mind.

1183
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:37,240
Oh, to think about all the years I've wasted working for that megalomaniac, turning out

1184
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:43,000
show after show after show for him like a bleeding battery chicken, and having to lick

1185
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:43,340
his...

1186
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,780
To lick his...

1187
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:45,640
His...

1188
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,360
His envelopes.

1189
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:52,480
And then getting passed around among this subgenius hierarchy like a cheap casu.

1190
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:55,060
Actually, you were more like a joy rag.

1191
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,040
Oh, but you're the writer.

1192
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:57,680
I'm not.

1193
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:57,680


1194
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:58,960
I'm just a text reader.

1195
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,080
And then getting tossed like an old salad.

1196
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,560
Ugh...

1197
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:11,100
You know, doctors say two more surgeries and I'll be able to walk a straight street

1198
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:11,560
again.

1199
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,560
Yeah, it sure did leave you with a bad pull to the left.

1200
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,220
Ah...

1201
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:22,280
Thanks to that slimy weasel staying in his friends, I'm left walking like a bad shopping

1202
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:22,720
cart.

1203
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,760
Oh, you're right.

1204
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,600
Hey, what time is it?

1205
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:27,680
It's a good time.

1206
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,400
I can't believe nobody's shown up for my yard sale yet.

1207
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:32,900
Oh, here we go again.

1208
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,240
Maybe they're having trouble finding the place.

1209
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,940
Oh, they'd have no problem.

1210
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,760
Oh, the flying saucer up on blocks in the front yard.

1211
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,400
How could they miss that landmark?

1212
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:43,920
Yeah.

1213
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,680
Sure does have a cheery green glow around it tonight.

1214
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:51,160
Boy, I wish that thing was up and running.

1215
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:54,080
Hey, I told you I'd try to fix it if you'd just get the parts.

1216
00:45:54,080 --> 00:46:00,100
It's two lousy little parts, so we'd be zooming around brown-eyeing the Air Force, but no.

1217
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,620
Hey, don't blame me.

1218
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,620
It's that idiot down at the parts depot.

1219
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:10,200
I've tried ordering it three times, and he always packs the antimatter drive in the same package as a matter converter,

1220
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:13,600
and they wind up blowing up in the box on the way home.

1221
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,960
You know, it's kind of funny how antimatter matters.

1222
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,160
Yeah.

1223
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,520
Yeah.

1224
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,780
Oh, boy.

1225
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,760
I can't believe nobody has shown up yet.

1226
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:33,260
Oh, by the way, Evil Susie, it was so nice of you to go down to the newspaper office

1227
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:36,720
and put that yard sale ad in the classified section for me.

1228
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:36,980
Huh?

1229
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:37,780
Yeah.

1230
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:38,720
Ad?

1231
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:41,620
Yeah, the one you took down to the newspaper office for me.

1232
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,100
Newspaper office?

1233
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,740
Yeah, that one.

1234
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,020
Uh.

1235
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:48,760
Oh!

1236
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,880
Oh, that ad.

1237
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:51,280
Uh.

1238
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:51,440
Uh.

1239
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,320
Yeah.

1240
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:53,000
Uh.

1241
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:59,460
They, uh, tintyped a velocipede of it and put it into perambulation.

1242
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:03,260
Oh, Evil Susie, what would I do without you?

1243
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:05,120
Ah, something stupid.

1244
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,060
Uh.

1245
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,100
Mm-hmm.

1246
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:08,180
Yeah.

1247
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:09,680
Uh, yeah.

1248
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,200
Uh, you know, Evil Susie, I've been thinking.

1249
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,240
Oh, man.

1250
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:14,820
No, no.

1251
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,620
That was just an expression.

1252
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,340
But I've been thinking.

1253
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,000
I've had it with Stang and his crusty crew.

1254
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,980
They're hoarding it over us like this.

1255
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:23,420
Oh, yeah.

1256
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,700
God, I hate that.

1257
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,360
Oh, I tell you, Flooz, you're preaching to the perverted.

1258
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:28,900
Oh, yeah?

1259
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:29,480
Yeah.

1260
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,460
For like 20 years now.

1261
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,640
It's crawled up my butt so bad.

1262
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:34,260
Oh.

1263
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,060
Oh, I've thought up so many vengeance scenarios.

1264
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:37,900
Yeah.

1265
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,580
That's a spirit.

1266
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,680
Oh, yeah.

1267
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,260
I did my research on this.

1268
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:43,500
Hmm?

1269
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,280
They're all holed up there in Subgenius Central.

1270
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:46,880
Oh, yeah?

1271
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,760
Where Stang and his goons are living like queens.

1272
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:50,320
Oh.

1273
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,160
They got the moat.

1274
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,040
Full of gators.

1275
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:52,360
Ah.

1276
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,520
Armed zombies patrolling the perimeter.

1277
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:55,020
Ooh.

1278
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,920
And they got gun turrets out the wazoo.

1279
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:58,220
Uh.

1280
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,720
We're just gonna have to face the ugly truth.

1281
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:01,100
Duh.

1282
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,840
Stang is damn near impregnable.

1283
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:04,200
Ah.

1284
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,400
You were gonna knock Stang up, too?

1285
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,100
Ah.

1286
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:08,540
Ooh.

1287
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,900
Damn it, Flooz.

1288
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:10,380
Look.

1289
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:10,920
Uh.

1290
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,980
We don't have firepower enough to take that place.

1291
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:14,660
Uh.

1292
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,520
Evil Susie?

1293
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:17,020
Hmm?

1294
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:18,020
Um.

1295
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,600
There's something.

1296
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,580
Something I should probably tell you.

1297
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,040
Hey, Flooz.

1298
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:27,300
I hate to break it to you, but you have no secrets from me.

1299
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,000
You've already spilled your guts, honey pie.

1300
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:30,780
Yeah.

1301
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,100
Well, I withheld my pancreas.

1302
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:35,700
What?

1303
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,360
I didn't tell you everything.

1304
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,280
Susie.

1305
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,500
Well, I ought to kick your ass.

1306
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,860
I mean, with your temper, I thought it would just be better if you didn't know about it.

1307
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,720
It'd just drive you crazy.

1308
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,980
Hey, I'm already there.

1309
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,000
How much crazier could I get?

1310
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:50,780
Oh.

1311
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:52,720
Yeah, you got a point.

1312
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:54,320
Damn it, Flooz.

1313
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:54,860
Ah.

1314
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:56,960
Well, uh.

1315
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,560
I've been keeping this secret for Stang.

1316
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,520
Like, uh, what?

1317
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,140
Oh, but he swore me to secrecy.

1318
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,420
I can't tell anybody.

1319
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,740
Can't spell secrecy without sucks.

1320
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,380
What?

1321
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,700
Oh, never mind.

1322
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,260
Oh, but no.

1323
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,540
No, there's no way.

1324
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,120
Flooz, don't make me go in there after it.

1325
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:19,880
Puff it up.

1326
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,720
No, no.

1327
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:21,760
You don't understand.

1328
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,260
I can't tell you.

1329
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,800
I can't even tell myself.

1330
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:25,680
Okay.

1331
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,160
Let's try this.

1332
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,280
Susie.

1333
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:30,320
Uh.

1334
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,080
Susie.

1335
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:32,600
Oh.

1336
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,400
Look into these eyes.

1337
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,060
Ugh.

1338
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:39,900
Evil Susie, that trick is not going to working on me.

1339
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,840
You can trust me.

1340
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,360
I can trust you.

1341
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:48,900
Trust.

1342
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,900
Trust you.

1343
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:52,860
Yes.

1344
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,720
Trust you.

1345
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:00,560
Oh, wait.

1346
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,000
It's a finger snap.

1347
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,440
Okay.

1348
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:08,060
Showtime.

1349
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:09,980
Ah.

1350
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,760
Ah, hell.

1351
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,860
You look trustworthy for some reason.

1352
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:14,840
Ah, excellent.

1353
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,000
Stang.

1354
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:17,640
Yeah.

1355
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:18,880
Slip.

1356
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:18,880


1357
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:18,880


1358
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:18,880


1359
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:18,880


1360
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:18,880


1361
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:18,880


1362
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:18,880


1363
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:18,880


1364
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:18,880


1365
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:18,880


1366
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:18,880


1367
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:18,880


1368
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:18,880


1369
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:18,880


1370
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,200
Slip me this little something for safekeeping.

1371
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:23,800
Back in 92.

1372
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,060
Oh, yeah?

1373
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,180
Like what?

1374
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,000
Uh.

1375
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,440
Come on.

1376
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,240
It'll be easier for me to just show you.

1377
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:30,920
Bring the lantern.

1378
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,120
It's around back.

1379
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,020
Oh, not out with bound, Flooz.

1380
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,000
I've done my walking for the night.

1381
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:38,060
Ow.

1382
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:39,660
Damn it, Flooz.

1383
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,200
Oh, yeah.

1384
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,140
Watch out for that.

1385
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,360
Oh, there's my rake.

1386
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,220
Oh, my.

1387
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:44,620
Ah.

1388
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,180
Don't forget to miss the sinkhole.

1389
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:48,860
Oh, yeah.

1390
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:48,860


1391
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:48,860


1392
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:48,860


1393
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:48,860


1394
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:52,540
Three hours later, suddenly things turned ugly.

1395
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,320
How much farther is this?

1396
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:55,820
Ah.

1397
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:56,700
Ah.

1398
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,160
Damn it, Flooz.

1399
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,260
Watch out for that.

1400
00:50:59,600 --> 00:50:59,840
Oh.

1401
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,700
Hey, hand me the lantern and close your eyes.

1402
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:03,380
Oh, hey.

1403
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,860
I'm not falling for that one again.

1404
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:05,240
Nah.

1405
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:06,720
You can trust me this time.

1406
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,580
We're nowhere near the Wolverine pen.

1407
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:09,260
Ah.

1408
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,220
Ah.

1409
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,360
Okay.

1410
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:13,220
I'll humor you.

1411
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:13,560
Okay.

1412
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,920
Close your eyes.

1413
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,840
Oh, well, that's going to be half a job because your damn rake took out.

1414
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:19,480
One of them.

1415
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:19,680
See?

1416
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:20,900
Things are getting better.

1417
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:22,420
Okay.

1418
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,900
I'll close my eye.

1419
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:24,740
Okay.

1420
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:26,400
Let me take your hand.

1421
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:26,880
Ow.

1422
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:28,840
Ooh, lower.

1423
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,460
Whatever it is, I've got here and...

1424
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:31,780
Okay.

1425
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,560
...and guide you to the main room.

1426
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:34,440
What?

1427
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:35,520
Left, right, what?

1428
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,020
Uh, this way.

1429
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:37,740
Oh.

1430
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:38,100
Ah.

1431
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:38,580
Ow.

1432
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:39,480
Sorry.

1433
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,360
I forgot about my pole to the left.

1434
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:41,760
Damn it.

1435
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,560
You're stupid.

1436
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,760
Oh, I don't know why I indulge your idiocies.

1437
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:46,220
Hey.

1438
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:47,700
Uh.

1439
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:48,840
This way.

1440
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:48,840


1441
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:48,840


1442
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:48,840


1443
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:49,000
This way.

1444
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,240
This way.

1445
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:50,540
This way.

1446
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:50,940
This way.

1447
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:51,060
This way.

1448
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:51,060


1449
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:51,060


1450
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:51,060


1451
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:51,660
That one.

1452
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,180
Damn it, Flooz.

1453
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:54,660
Oh.

1454
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:55,480
Don't be irresponsible for any impairment.

1455
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,200
Sore damage.

1456
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,180
You will not be held responsible for any impairment.

1457
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,080
Sore damage.

1458
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,240
I'm coming for you.

1459
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:01,900
Okay.

1460
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:02,720
This way.

1461
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:02,920
There.

1462
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:04,840
Oh.

1463
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:05,820
Ow.

1464
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:05,820


1465
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:05,820


1466
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:07,640
Oh, evil Suzy.

1467
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:09,720
You are going to be so surprised.

1468
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,920
Oh, yeah, Flooz.

1469
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,160
I am prepared to be totally freaking dazzled.

1470
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:16,640
Okay.

1471
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,380
Now open your eyes.

1472
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,340
Wow, Flood.

1473
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,340
Nice subterranean bunker.

1474
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:26,740
Like it?

1475
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,900
You've been a busy little beaver, haven't you?

1476
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:32,260
I carved it out myself with a soup spoon.

1477
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,400
Check out these hospital corners.

1478
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:38,100
Wow, I think dirt really is your medium, kid.

1479
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:41,000
Yeah, but wait, there's more.

1480
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,680
Oh, yeah.

1481
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:45,140
Okay, close your eyes.

1482
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,620
Okay, I'll close my eyes.

1483
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,720
Oh, evil Susie, I can't wait to see the look on what's left of your face.

1484
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,680
Right in here.

1485
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:00,080
Step this way.

1486
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,440
Oh, I don't know.

1487
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:04,680
Oh, damn it.

1488
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:09,020
Oh, nice acoustics.

1489
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,360
Well, here we are.

1490
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,400
Now open your eyes.

1491
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:13,540
See?

1492
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:14,360
Whoa.

1493
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:15,260
Yeah.

1494
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:15,840
Flood.

1495
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,400
Oh, it's beautiful.

1496
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,880
Oh, I should have known that you would have a huge arsenal.

1497
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:24,940
Yeah, check it out.

1498
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,620
Oh, sidewinders.

1499
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,600
Oh, minute-bent peacekeepers.

1500
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,740
Oh, look at all the icy beams.

1501
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:38,260
Oh, Flood, you better put a tarp under me.

1502
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,320
Oh, yeah.

1503
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:41,760
Oh.

1504
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:42,360
Oh.

1505
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:49,640
Geez, Blues, how did you wind up with all this great stuff?

1506
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:55,100
Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story.

1507
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,640
Oh, I bet it is.

1508
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:06,880
Way back, like, long before I started doing the funhouse and everything, I hear this urgent

1509
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:07,980
knocking at the door.

1510
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,280
So I go and answer it.

1511
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,640
And it stank out of the blue.

1512
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:14,860
And he's got that big grin going.

1513
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:15,120
Yeah.

1514
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:15,120


1515
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,700
And he's dancing around like he has to pee.

1516
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:20,380
So, yeah, I could tell something's up.

1517
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:24,100
And he tells me he needs to stash some stuff here for a while.

1518
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,460
And is that okay?

1519
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,000
Mm-hmm.

1520
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:27,320
Sounds like him.

1521
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:31,780
So I look past him, and there's a whole fleet of trucks out there looking like a frickin'

1522
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:36,720
May Day parade loaded down with what appears to be giant Coney Island wife tamers.

1523
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:37,200
Oh.

1524
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,660
So naturally, I said, yeah, I'd find a use for them.

1525
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:44,880
So how long did he say he was going to be leaving this stuff here?

1526
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,160
He wasn't specific about time.

1527
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:51,980
I think he was waiting until, like, the spring thaw.

1528
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:52,720
Mm-hmm.

1529
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,320
Because he said he'd be back when the heat was off, whenever that is.

1530
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:01,920
Well, he sure hot potatoed us, and I'm damn glad he did.

1531
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,060
So he never asked for this stuff back?

1532
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,800
I'm sure he forgot it.

1533
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,840
I mean, back then, staying was real heavy into the jankum.

1534
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:11,500
Uh-huh.

1535
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,260
And he was real forgetful.

1536
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,120
Oh, well, hey.

1537
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:14,860
Forget it.

1538
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,500
Everything is good.

1539
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,300
Like, uh, he forgot to tell me how he won all these weapons in a strip poker game with

1540
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,640
Khomeini, Gaddafi, and Kim Jong-il.

1541
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:24,820
Hey, that's funny.

1542
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:29,680
And he forgot to tell me that they were all three pissed off at him, because after he

1543
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:34,060
left with the swag, they got together and looked at the cards and saw where he'd marked

1544
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,220
them with the jankum stains.

1545
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,620
Hey, that's typical.

1546
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:42,320
And he forgot to tell me they'd be sending their killer goon squads after us to get their

1547
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:42,960
swag back.

1548
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:43,340
Whoa.

1549
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:49,720
That's, uh, situationally unethical.

1550
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:51,800
Duh.

1551
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:59,680
But, you know, it does explain those guys in the robes who kept exploding on our front

1552
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,100
porch.

1553
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:04,540
Yeah, apparently they weren't from the Baptist church from down the street that does that

1554
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:06,680
year-round living nativity scene.

1555
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:09,980
You know, I kind of wondered about that.

1556
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:10,680
Yeah.

1557
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:11,700
I mean, really?

1558
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:19,000
For such a small Baptist congregation, didn't it seem like they had an astonishingly high

1559
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,840
rate of spontaneous human combustion cases?

1560
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:22,640
No kidding.

1561
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:27,320
But, hey, what with all that hellfire and brimstone crap they're always spouting?

1562
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:28,080
Duh.

1563
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:31,440
It really didn't seem out of the ordinary when they blew up.

1564
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:32,220
Oh, yeah.

1565
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,980
Good thing we didn't open the door to them, huh?

1566
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:35,520
Yeah.

1567
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,080
Good thing we hate Christians and suicide bombers alike.

1568
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,540
Wait a minute.

1569
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:45,380
I thought Stang said the whole church had only three warheads.

1570
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:48,540
Oh, you mean you fell for his press release?

1571
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:50,160
Touche.

1572
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,060
No, I'm serious.

1573
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:56,800
Really, Flooz, we could do something with this.

1574
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:01,220
Oh, baby, this is gonna put us on the slack gravy train.

1575
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:02,440
Yeah.

1576
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:08,300
We can simply nuke that evil bastard Stang and all of his buddies back into their original

1577
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:08,820
atoms.

1578
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:09,280
Uh-huh.

1579
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,520
And then we could take over his whole scapegoat.

1580
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:11,520


1581
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:11,520


1582
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:11,520


1583
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:11,520


1584
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:11,900
Oh, damn.

1585
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:15,240
Oh, man, this has possibilities.

1586
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,260
Real possibilities.

1587
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:18,480
Really?

1588
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,860
You think so?

1589
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:23,580
Oh, tell me all about your nice shiny toys, Suzy.

1590
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,400
Well, it's simple, really.

1591
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,180
Totally idiot-proof.

1592
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:34,080
The missiles are all fueled up and ready to go, and we can send them anywhere on the planet

1593
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,520
with this handy computer guidance system.

1594
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:37,800
Oh, perfect.

1595
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:40,920
And here's the easiest part.

1596
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:45,640
I hooked up the launching and arming mechanism to a clapper.

1597
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,400
Hey, can't argue with lazy.

1598
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:50,720
Buttons?

1599
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:53,240
We don't need no stinking buttons.

1600
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:54,920
Oh, yeah.

1601
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:01,740
All we have to do is remember to open up the silo dome first.

1602
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,720
That's that little orange button over there.

1603
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:05,660
Uh-huh.

1604
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:09,180
I thought you said we didn't need no stinking buttons.

1605
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:10,900
Oh, well, I don't know.

1606
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:10,900


1607
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:12,420
It's probably just a little wrong.

1608
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:12,420


1609
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,340
Oh, that was a little too much.

1610
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:14,880
I was just thinking.

1611
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:15,920
Oh, I'm sorry.

1612
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:15,920


1613
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:15,920


1614
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:15,920


1615
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:15,920


1616
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:15,920


1617
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:15,920


1618
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:15,920


1619
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:15,920


1620
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:15,920


1621
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:15,920


1622
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,560
You can't be serious.

1623
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:18,560


1624
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:18,560


1625
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,220
Oh, you almost had me.

1626
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,980
Clues, I never thought I'd say this to you, but-

1627
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:24,160
Huh?

1628
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:24,980
Do what?

1629
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:29,100
I don't know why I try to kill you all the time.

1630
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:29,800
Oh.

1631
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,960
Oh, Evil Suzy.

1632
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:37,720
And I'm damn glad you dodged my coat hanger all those times, sugar.

1633
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:38,180
Oh.

1634
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:42,900
Oh, I'm so happy I finally did something to make you proud of me.

1635
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,660
Oh, Flooz, you don't know the half of it.

1636
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:51,920
I am so proud to have you standing in front of me as my human shield.

1637
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:55,260
Oh, you'd do that for me?

1638
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:57,120
Try to stop me.

1639
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,360
Oh, no, the things we are going to do.

1640
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,280
Put her there, partner.

1641
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,800
Uh-oh.

1642
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:10,980
Damn it, Flooz.

1643
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:11,880
What?

1644
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:34,040
Praise Reverend Susie the Floozy and Bob's Slack Time Funhouse

1645
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:34,260
of the Year.

1646
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:40,020

1648
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:45,660
Praise Bob.

1649
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:47,160
Well, look here.
