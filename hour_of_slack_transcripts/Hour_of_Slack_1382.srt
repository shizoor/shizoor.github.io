00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,740
You know, I'm so thankful tonight that I don't have a lot of money, I don't have a lot of friends, but I have a whole lot of diagrams of how to position Bob or Steve.

2
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:28,880
Steve, somebody's got a conspiracy going on, and you will say, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

3
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:38,300
We don't have a lot of money, we don't have a lot of people, and we got a lot of power of the wicked, Bob, and the spiritual darkness.

4
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:46,720
We asked Bob to come and to reveal the conspiracy in the skies above.

5
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:52,160
And open up every deceitful work of conspiracy.

6
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,080
You know, the things that it's done, the symbols and the emblems of Bob.

7
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:03,980
Now, a lot of people loved the hour of slug.

8
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,240
Actually, they're in bodies with two legs.

9
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,740
They have two eyes, they have two ears, and their mouth is filled with Bob's conspiracy.

10
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,620
From.

11
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,800
NPR News in Washington.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,700
I'm stoned.

13
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,120
President Obama told supporters.

14
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,140
I want everybody here to understand.

15
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,700
Our children will be at.

16
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,340
We have to.

17
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,760
And I want fewer jobs.

18
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:35,180
Meanwhile, in an address to the U.N. General Assembly, the president of Staten Island, New York, says his country is making the world's biggest Ferris wheel.

19
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:42,540
Making his U.N. debut, Thayne Sane pointed to some of the PR news on Wall Street 95-1358.

20
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,360
Republican Mitt Romney made his case at an American Legion.

21
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,300
The case claims that this is PR.

22
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,880
Coming up on your morning station, it's the hour of slack drive-by comedy hour.

23

24

So stay tuned to your classic rock station, coming up right after this.

25
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,780
I love you, boy.

26
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,220
And I'm on date if I can't whoop it.

27
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,880
I'm on down.

28
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,540
All right, man.

29
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,780
He's going down.

30
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:36,820
If the last 50 years made such a change, just imagine the New York of 1980, when everyone has a number instead of a name, and the government tells you whom you should marry.

31
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:43,760
Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man.

32
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,340
Number of a man.

33
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:54,360
His number is 603-score-and-six.

34
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:06,260
Say you don't know me, or recognize my face.

35
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,080
Say you don't wear clothes to that kind of place.

36
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,360
All right.

37
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,400
I got one more song for you.

38
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,480
I think you'll like it.

39
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,780
It kind of speaks about the subgenius entirely.

40
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,720
I saw you looking me up and down.

41
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,000
Then I saw you looking all around.

42
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,320
That cool guy at the cafe, his name is Jim.

43
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,100
But he's got good taste, so you ain't leaving with him.

44
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,080
You need a guy who's going to make you feel good, not dwell upon your faults.

45
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,260
Like the other guys would.

46
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,060
Like your green teeth and your knobby ass knees.

47
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,640
What you really need is a fella like me.

48
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,320
Cause I got low standards.

49
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,880
I got low standards.

50
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,240
I got low standards.

51
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,660
So why don't you get with me?

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,160
You got a lisp with every letter but N.

53
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,360
You say who, and I say when.

54
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,680
You say most of you is starting to sag.

55
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,120
I say grab that colostomy bag and get into my car.

56
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,480
It's a piece of crap, but just toss it Burger King.

57
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,720
Rapper's right in the back.

58
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,040
You will head off to your place or mine.

59
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,520
Or just find some parking lot shit.

60
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,560
That'll be fine.

61
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,020
Cause I got low standards.

62
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
I got low standards.

63
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,780
I got low standards.

64
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,020
So why don't you get with me?

65
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,400
I got low standards.

66
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,700
I got low, low, low, low standards.

67
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,980
I got low standards.

68
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:49,860
I got low, low, low, low standards.

69
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:49,860


70
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,280
Now you might think that I'm very refined,

71
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,840
but I'm just looking for a kinda good time.

72
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,900
So what if you're bald and missing an eye?

73
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,380
I can look past it.

74
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,600
I'm that kinda guy.

75
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,200
I'm Big O'Dwart, and you forgot your makeup kit.

76
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,680
Well, I'll just dim the lights a bit.

77
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,260
Wear diseases from your previous bows.

78
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,620
Don't bother me.

79
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,940
I got some of my own.

80
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,460
Cause I got low standards.

81
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,660
I got low standards.

82
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,240
I got low standards.

83
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,660
So why don't you get with me?

84
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,800
Why don't you get with me?

85
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,000
Why don't you get with me?

86
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,920
Oh, wait, wait, oh, fucking shit!

87
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,320
I forgot the last verse!

88
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,960
I'll chalk it up to a poor choice of words.

89
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,140
When you say that the Holocaust never occurred,

90
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,020
you think stem cells are part of your phone,

91
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,620
and that bathing is for those too cheap for cologne.

92
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,360
Well, I got a can of spray here to cover the smell,

93
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,100
and earplugs, cause your voice is grating as hell.

94
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,520
Besides, the things you say you must be out of your mind,

95
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,960
you make the guests on Springer sound like fucking Einstein.

96
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,280
But I don't mind, no!

97
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,460
Cause I got everybody here.

98
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,140
No standards.

99
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,340
I got low standards.

100
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,640
I got low standards.

101
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,840
Yeah, so why don't you get with me?

102
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,240
I got low standards.

103
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,700
I got low standards.

104
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,340
I got low standards.

105
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,120
Yeah, so why don't you get with me?

106
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,300
Why don't you get with me?

107
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,920
Alright, there we go!

108
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:41,000
Now, this next one is called

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,920
The Death of T-Rex.

110
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,740
Please don't mistake

111
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,140
My obsession with death for a death wish

112
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,500
I wouldn't wish death on anyone, not even me

113
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,580
I've always lived by the motto to die and to let live

114
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,940
Please disregard this noose that I have tied around my neck

115
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,560
But you gotta say yes

116
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,140
To the death of T-Rex and that guy in excess

117
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,540
And whoever's next, you just gotta make way

118
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,240
As long as you believe

119
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,720
I have a feeling that don't include me

120
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:03,620
Just because I sport black clothes, it upcourts his complexion

121
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,920
It doesn't mean I don't live my life to the fullest

122
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,700
You may call me morbid because I sleep in a coffin

123
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,220
My brain's not dead and buried on some suburban lawn

124
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,800
But you gotta say yes

125
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,600
To the death of T-Rex and some passerby

126
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,180
Pigeon with chromosome X

127
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,560
You just gotta make way for the strongest species

128
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,340
I have a feeling that don't include me

129
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,680
Me

130
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,560
Me

131
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:50,560


132
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:50,560


133
00:08:50,560 --> 00:09:20,560


134
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:50,560


135
00:09:50,560 --> 00:10:20,560


136
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:50,560


137
00:10:50,560 --> 00:11:20,560


138
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:50,560


139
00:11:50,560 --> 00:12:20,560


140
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:50,560


141
00:12:50,560 --> 00:13:20,560


142
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:50,560


143
00:13:50,560 --> 00:14:20,560


144
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:50,560


145
00:14:50,560 --> 00:15:20,560


146
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:50,560


147
00:15:50,560 --> 00:16:20,560


148
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:50,560


149
00:16:50,560 --> 00:17:20,560


150
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:50,560


151
00:17:50,560 --> 00:18:20,560


152
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:50,560


153
00:18:50,560 --> 00:19:20,560


154
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:50,560


155
00:19:50,560 --> 00:20:20,560


156
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:50,560


157
00:20:50,560 --> 00:21:20,560


158
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:50,560


159
00:21:50,560 --> 00:22:20,560


160
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:50,560


161
00:22:50,560 --> 00:23:20,560


162
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:50,560


163
00:23:50,560 --> 00:24:20,560


164
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:50,560


165
00:24:50,560 --> 00:25:20,560


166
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:50,560


167
00:25:50,560 --> 00:26:20,560


168
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:50,560


169
00:26:50,560 --> 00:27:20,560


170
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:50,560


171
00:27:50,560 --> 00:28:20,560


172
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:26,840
I have a feeling that don't include me

173
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:26,900
Me

174
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,600
Me

175
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,440
Me

176
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:50,540
Me

177
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,540


178
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,540


179
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,540


180
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,540


181
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,540


182
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,540


183
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,540


184
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,540


185
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,540


186
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,540


187
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,540


188
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,540


189
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,540


190
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,540


191
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,540


192
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,540


193
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,540


194
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,540


195
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,540


196
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,540


197
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,540


198
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,540


199
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,540


200
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,820
Me

201
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,040
Me

202
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,040


203
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,280
Ah!

204
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,440
Me

205
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:56,440


206
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:56,440


207
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:56,440


208
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:56,440


209
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:56,440


210
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:56,440


211
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:56,440


212
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:56,440


213
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:56,440


214
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:56,440


215
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:56,440


216
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:56,440


217
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,560
Give me the mule

218
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,300
Dave, there's a D on the next line.

219
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,580
Well, it's not a dirty line.

220
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,320
Hello?

221
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,060
Hello?

222
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,600
Not against him.

223
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,000
Oh, what a load of...

224
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,640
You said the next line is mine?

225
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,240
Yeah.

226
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,580
What a load of liberal crap.

227
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:45,360
Obama is a Marxist and the 47% are his boot-lick...

228
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,500
Freak-lickers.

229
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,700
That's me.

230
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,100
Freak-walk.

231
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,020
I'm the boot-lick-freeloaders.

232
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:50,920
I'm sorry.

233
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,600
I think the name of fruit-lickers.

234
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,560
Freeloaders.

235
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,020
They're all freeloaders anyway, though.

236
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:56,640
That's the truth.

237
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,800
I am.

238
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,100
You are.

239
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,380
Speaking of the truth...

240
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,260
I've seen we load and free many times.

241
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,140
Speaking of the truth...

242
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,460
The truth hurts.

243
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,520
Only those affected by this truth would take offense.

244
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,060
Ever notice near the end of the political race,

245
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,140
Democrats always have a slimy gotcha moment.

246
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,000
Seriously.

247
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,680
What would...

248
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,300
What would we hear if somebody smuggled a video

249
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,200
into a private fundraiser with Obama

250
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,440
and all his radical left Marxist-Communist socialist friends?

251
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,640
I'm sure it would make you sick.

252
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,760
But Republicans don't play Chicago thug politics.

253
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:35,040
The truth hurts no matter how ugly it's spoken.

254
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,500
Like gaining a few pounds and being told your ass looks fat.

255
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,680
You can get mad, snap back with insults.

256
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,920
Fact remains, you have a fat ass.

257
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,140
You...

258
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:47,660
You...

259
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,160
FN.

260
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,020
F-N.

261
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,160
F, the letter F, the letter N.

262
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:58,240
Yahoo about shifing your news on your evil candidates, the DFL party.

263
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,560
All you want to talk about is Romney, Romney, Romney.

264
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:07,720
For news on the real evil, get your news from Fox News.

265
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,880
The only honest network left.

266
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,360
You're right, honey.

267
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,860
Pass me the martinis.

268
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,240
It's a...

269
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,440
If it's a lance, if it...

270
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:16,800
It's...

271
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,200
It's...

272
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,860
If it's a landslide for Romney, no, they had to land and lead in the polls.

273
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,520
If it's a bummer, dead people voted Republicans.

274
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:31,080
Because between a rock and a hard place, either the polls lie or the...

275
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,160
Or demos get dead people to vote.

276
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,600
That's the only possible...

277
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,260
Those are the only possibilities.

278
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,680
Either the polls lie or Democrats get dead people to vote.

279
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,940
There's no way in the world...

280
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:51,100
That the polls could be telling the truth and that the dead people are not voting.

281
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,440
That's what I get from that one.

282
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,600
That's what I got out of it, too.

283
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,000
He's...

284
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,980
They're all convinced of a various number of truths which really haven't been proven.

285
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:10,140
And I guess supposedly in the communications world of research nowadays, especially this year before the election and usually in every year for the last 10 years,

286
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:15,500
they're wondering why some people don't believe anything they're told.

287
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,720
But believe everything they're told.

288
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,020
Do you know what I'm saying?

289
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:19,940
Yeah, yeah.

290
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,580
They believe everything that they tell each other.

291
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,900
That they want to believe.

292
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,280
They don't...

293
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,840
And they believe anything that sounds good to them.

294
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:31,920
But if it sounds bad to them, then it must therefore be a lie.

295
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,820
And demos get dead people to vote.

296
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:45,180
This is notwithstanding the fact that a week ago, a Florida Republican voting hot shot was busted for...

297
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,660
Adding hundreds of dead Republicans to the...

298
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,700
Well, you know how efficient the Republicans are.

299
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,460
They're going to actually bust those dead people in.

300
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,640
They're going to have numbers of buses from out of state coming in with all kinds of dead people.

301
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,800
Man, that's a smelly bus.

302
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,980
God, those things are so hard to clean afterwards.

303
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,420
It's really hard.

304
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:11,340
And they're also going to be hiring a bunch of people, you know, to get them off and get them on the bus because you know how slow they are.

305
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,880
But they're doing their job and...

306
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,340
Well, so then it's the...

307
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:14,980
We can only look forward.

308
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,920
The dead people...

309
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:15,920


310
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:15,920


311
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,900
The dead people versus the illegals then.

312
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:32,580
Because I heard that the demoncrats bring illegals deliberately into the country to give away the hardworking people's money to them so that they'll vote for, you know, who?

313
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,340
Obama.

314
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,740
Well, you know...

315
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:34,960
Obama.

316
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,660
Yeah.

317
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,580
And Michelle.

318
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,220
Yeah.

319
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,960
That's another thing I don't quite understand.

320
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:44,960
They see Michelle Obama as obesely fat.

321
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:45,780
Yeah.

322
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,340
And also the anti-crime tech.

323
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,520
They call her that all the time.

324
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,820
And they call her Moose Shell.

325
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,180
Yeah.

326
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:49,960
I get the impression...

327
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,540
She looks kind of like a hard body to me.

328
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:52,760
Absolutely.

329
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,020
If anything, she's a little bit too in shape.

330
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,780
I'd like it if she was a bit more of a Moose Shell.

331
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,280
It makes you jealous of Obama in many ways.

332
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:03,740
Yes, indeed.

333
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,440
Well, you know, now here's the thing, though.

334
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,680
We're not saying that the demon craps are angels by...

335
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,480
Look, I remember LBJ.

336
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,920
He was another technical...

337
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:14,940
Yeah.

338
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:15,680
Yeah.

339
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:15,740


340
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:15,740


341
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:15,740


342
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:15,760
Yeah.

343
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:15,760


344
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:15,760


345
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:15,760


346
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:15,760


347
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:15,760


348
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:15,760


349
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:15,760


350
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:15,760


351
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,980
Better JFK.

352
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,700
They're demons from hell, just like most of them.

353
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,460
And Obama could easily turn out to be another demon from hell, too.

354
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,140
It's just that a lot of people seem to think he's already proved he is.

355
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:33,380
And I just have not gotten that same impression.

356
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:38,240
In fact, in the debates, he seemed like just a regular guy.

357
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,980
And Romney seemed like a programmed and rather rude robot.

358
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,120
But that's...

359
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,840
Again, that's, you know, that's...

360
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,600
You may say that's selective perception on my part.

361
00:34:52,840 --> 00:35:02,120
On the other hand, I kept hearing Obama give these specifics and Romney promising everybody everything for free.

362
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,020
Yeah.

363
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:09,300
Which I was doing the math and it didn't add up.

364
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,640
No, it doesn't.

365
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:14,980
I was also wondering, as I listened, I didn't actually watch the debate.

366
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:15,760
I listened to it.

367
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:15,860
I listened to it.

368
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:21,280
And I could not see Obama's three or seven o'clock shadow like Nixon's or whatever he's saying.

369
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:28,560
Well, to tell the truth, he did look a little bit rumpled and unshaven compared to the...

370
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,300
Probably because he was working.

371
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,840
...the Stratford husband, Mitt, who...

372
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,140
Probably because he had an actual job and he was working.

373
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,180
Well, that's the thing.

374
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:45,680
Yeah, the guy is kind of busy during the day and he hasn't been rehearsing for debates for six...

375
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,140
...months solid nonstop every day.

376
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,740
With special coaches.

377
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:50,580
Right.

378
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,680
And he also didn't change his tune in the middle of the song, as it were.

379
00:35:55,060 --> 00:36:00,300
He did one time, though, but I won't say that because I think it made me...

380
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:06,700
From listening to it, it made me feel like Obama was trying to be like Romney because that was working or something.

381
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,360
Oh, I don't know.

382
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:11,680
I thought he did seem kind of bored and like he didn't want to be there.

383
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:15,540
And, hey, aren't I supposed to be doing something more important than this?

384
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,540
But...

385
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:23,020
As a true and personal listener to the debate, Obama won the listening debate.

386
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:30,040
And Romney sounded a little bit like he was on speed and he kept on repeating the same things over and over again like he was a little manic.

387
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:30,760
Yeah.

388
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,260
So I didn't see, you know, like, oh, Obama looks tired.

389
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,560
And I couldn't see that.

390
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,380
All I could hear was like one person was kind of smooth and had the facts in front of him.

391
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,740
Another guy was, you know, campaign sloganeering and jumping up and down.

392
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,660
Well, that's what...

393
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:45,760
Yeah.

394
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,240
We hear.

395
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,340
But that wasn't what some...

396
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,920
A lot of people heard, apparently.

397
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:59,420
At this point, Chris Moody, I wouldn't be writing stories on your make-believe poll number.

398
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,480
In 1980, Jimmy Carter had a four-point lead in the polls.

399
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:08,880
I'm sure if you would around your headline would read, what is Reagan's problem with voters?

400
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,440
You and people like you are a joke.

401
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,220
I'm sure in liberal circles, you are all the rage.

402
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,740
The fact is that...

403
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:22,360
Writing a story based on polls, especially polls that weight more Democrats than Republicans,

404
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,060
is beyond dishonest.

405
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,060
It should be criminal.

406
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,520
You are trying to sway people with make-believe numbers.

407
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,900
And for that, you should be branded a criminal.

408
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:38,720
Oh, well, we all know that Obama supporters love the news because they hear exactly what they want to hear.

409
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:45,320
They are the big television people who sit and absorb and then spew stupidity endlessly.

410
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,460
Let's face it.

411
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,700
They are fun to laugh.

412
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,440
Huh?

413
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,240
They're fun to laugh at.

414
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:51,600
At.

415
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,740
Oh, I had my finger there.

416
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,380
But it made sense with what the rest of what he was saying.

417
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:57,780
I'm sorry.

418
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:04,380
Nothing more can be expected from a president who would rather spend time with his celebrity friends

419
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:08,000
than tend to the business of the country.

420
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,680
What a loser he is.

421
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,840
And to think that a bunch of losers will vote for this clown.

422
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:14,800
Hmm.

423
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,480
Hmm.

424
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,580
France is not a raw model.

425
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,180
Never will be France.

426
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,860
For God's sake, they created the one-third world.

427
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,480
And they made Africa what it is now through a brutal colonialism.

428
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,180
Killed millions of Africans.

429
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,340
It's worse than the Nazis and the Holocaust.

430
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:38,040
The hate Jews and Muslim have no freedom of religion.

431
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:43,300
They like laic socialists.

432
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,020
Laic, yes.

433
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,600
The Africans.

434
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,740
The African French become the majority and that scares them.

435
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,900
Racism is casual in France now.

436
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,760
They hate African counties, but they want their business.

437
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:02,940
They supported Gaddafi for many years in his dictatorship and then turned on him when the U.S. and other did.

438
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,820
They are bunch or hypocrites.

439
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:11,820
If it wasn't for the U.S., the official language in France would be German by now.

440
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,220
Oh.

441
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:14,320


442
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:14,680
Oh.

443
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:14,820
Oh.

444
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,100
Oh.

445
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:15,340
Oh.

446
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:15,560
Oh.

447
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:15,560


448
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:15,560


449
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:15,560


450
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:15,560


451
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:15,560


452
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:15,560


453
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:15,560


454
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:15,560


455
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:15,560


456
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:15,560


457
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:15,560


458
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:15,860
Oh.

459
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:16,600
Oh.

460
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:17,540
Oh.

461
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,740
What did he actually do there?

462
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:23,420
I'm having a hard time even understanding what his message is.

463
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,740
Who cares about France?

464
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,200
What does France have to do with it?

465
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,620
Well, I don't know.

466
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,020
But it's not a raw model.

467
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,300
It's not a raw model.

468
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:33,920
Right.

469
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,060
That's right.

470
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,140
I forgot that part.

471
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,680
It's a well-done model, not a raw model.

472
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,080
It's cooked all right.

473
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:40,640
Wait until you...

474
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,540
There's one of these later on talks about loot holes.

475
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,180
They're taxed.

476
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:45,960
It's loot holes.

477
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,420
Civil rights groups.

478
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,540
Laugh my ass off.

479
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,940
That is just a euphemism for pro-Democrat hate groups.

480
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,920
This president...

481
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:02,740
Civil rights groups are, by definition, pro-Democrat hate groups.

482
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,080
Well, that's true.

483
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,160
Everybody knows that.

484
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:10,960
I went down to the local campaign office there and I got my brown shirt and my big buckled belt

485
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,820
and this big, huge pair of cool boots, man.

486
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:20,160
And it got like this motorcycle-looking kind of hat, kind of like an admiral on wheels or

487
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:20,740
something like that.

488
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,760
And I...

489
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,580
Did they have the army of Black Panthers there to intimidate you and beat you up?

490
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:30,660
That happens at every single polling station in the big city I've read.

491
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,960
Well, that's also true.

492
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,440
Or every voting place.

493
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:38,060
There's always a giant team of Black Panthers.

494
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,260
You know, Black Panthers are big these days.

495
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:40,900
Yeah.

496
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:41,840
They all have shotguns.

497
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,480
Huge, huge membership in that.

498
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:57,700
This president is the most crooked, evil piece of crap we in the history of this country has ever known.

499
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,560
You're absolutely white.

500
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,320
You're absolutely white.

501
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,620
Yes.

502
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,220
And notice, I say, finally, I say, seeing a change for the better with these sniveling Mexicans.

503
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,160
Yes, real Americans are, I say, fed up.

504
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,620
And even bigger and better.

505
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:15,940
Changes are near.

506
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,620
Look at Arizona yesterday.

507
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,480
Go, I say, go, Dan and Sheriff Joe.

508
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:29,240
If you want your hard-earned currency redistributed to the lazy, cheating welfare people who a

509
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,580
lot are working with the system, vote for Obama the pirate.

510
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:39,320
So, we cannot support the right to celebrate a Christian holy day, dot, dot, dot.

511
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:43,860
But we can support a pirate day, dot, dot, dot.

512
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,760
I guess...

513
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:51,420
That is because he has pirated all of the American funds for his devout Muslim friends.

514
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,500
That was a couple of weeks ago on Talk Like a Pirate Day.

515
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,120
Yahoo ran a photograph of Obama talking to a guy in a pirate suit.

516
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,900
The photograph was actually two years old, it turned out.

517
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:09,260
Did you see the Hitler-Romney YouTube video?

518
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,640
We'll make you laugh very hard.

519
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,080
It's, what's his name, who was in Silence of the Lambs?

520
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,160
What's that guy's name?

521
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,160
Hannibal Lecter.

522
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,780
The Hannibal Lecter guy portraying Hitler.

523
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:21,120
Remember when he was Hitler in his last days?

524
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:27,280
And the subtitles were in English, of course, and they were all about Romney's 47% comment.

525
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,140
And Hitler has a tantrum.

526
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:32,280
It's very humorous, and I would suggest everybody go watch it.

527
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,040
Yeah, those subtitled Hitler things are good.

528
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,960
There's, what did we also see?

529
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,080
Bad lip reading.

530
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:43,400
And that person, whoever does bad lip reading is pretty fair.

531
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,380
Because they do...

532
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:48,240
He puts words in the mouth of everybody.

533
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,640
Well, that's what all the Muslims do, too.

534
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,860
He did Obama, he did Romney, he did...

535
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,280
The one I saw recently was Paul Ryan.

536
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,320
It was pretty good.

537
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,580
Very cleverly crafted.

538
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:56,920
Yeah.

539
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,760
I want to hear his band, Steak Baby.

540
00:42:59,540 --> 00:42:59,900
Yeah.

541
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,620
Well, putting words in people's mouth is what all the Muslims do,

542
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,300
and all the Marxists and stuff, and all the Democrats.

543
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,260
Yeah, only they do.

544
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:13,680
Especially the atheist Muslim Marxists who are also communist spies.

545
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,340
They're spies.

546
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:20,700
For the fourth planet from the star system, Zub.

547
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:26,840
If fathers are so stupid as they can't figure out

548
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,600
that Romney was talking about the people who have made welfare their career,

549
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,520
then they deserve what they will get with Obama.

550
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,820
A country-gone socialist with sharia law.

551
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:42,340
Hey, man, if the Southern Baptists took over,

552
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,720
we'd have sharia law.

553
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:45,140
Yes, it's...

554
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,400
Yes, I'm...

555
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,380
Yeah, unfortunately, that's very true.

556
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,500
The evangelical movement is not very tolerant of others

557
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,480
and thinks that they are the American nationalist religion

558
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,260
and wants to start wars around the world.

559
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,980
Yes, it is kind of true.

560
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,900
Yes, it is.

561
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:07,440
Hard to find anyone commenting on any Yahoo blogs in favor of Obama.

562
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,220
Maybe the silent majority will come out of hibernation

563
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:14,120
and vote the person masquerading as president.

564
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,280
Out, out, out.

565
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,800
One can only hope for a change in November.

566
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,320
No Obama 2012.

567
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,100
Their originality abounds.

568
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:24,920
Hmm.

569
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:25,880
It's wild.

570
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,220
Just wild.

571
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,640
You know, it's although I haven't heard...

572
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,340
It's making me weep.

573
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,080
I'm...

574
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:30,700
I didn't...

575
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,320
I wet my pants, too, but...

576
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,040
Now, Dave, settle down.

577
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:34,780
I met the drool.

578
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,940
I'm not from any...

579
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,840
We do get overly...

580
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,920
You know, around election time, people get a little agitated.

581
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,240
Didn't the poor son of a bitch shot his...

582
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:45,560
wife and kids...

583
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:45,900
Unbelievable.

584
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:52,320
...earlier in the month because Obama might get re-elected?

585
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:53,580
Now, wait a minute.

586
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:58,280
And that would mean his kids would be in debtor's prison for the rest of their life.

587
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:04,320
He was so sure of this that he killed his little boys and his wife...

588
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:04,560
And himself.

589
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,660
...and then he killed himself.

590
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:06,780
Oh, wait a minute.

591
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:14,260
He knew the future or he believed the pundits of his...

592
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:14,480
No.

593
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,480
...favorite talk shows.

594
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,660
I missed it.

595
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,100
This is a real news story?

596
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:19,920
Yeah, that was a real...

597
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,140
Yeah.

598
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,320
This adds a totally different dimension to this thing we're doing here.

599
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:22,800
It didn't...

600
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,000
I didn't read it in the lamestream media.

601
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:30,220
I read it in the liberal communist media.

602
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,060
It was rawstory.com.

603
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,600
But it was a sourced news story?

604
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,060
Oh, yeah, yeah.

605
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,080
It wasn't just on that.

606
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,040
It was around.

607
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,200
It was just...

608
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,760
But it was very sad and ugly.

609
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:44,100
And I did not...

610
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:54,320
I did not encounter that one in anything but somewhat left-leaning news websites.

611
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,180
But it was a legit story.

612
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:56,820
I mean...

613
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:57,100
Yeah.

614
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,720
You know, I mean, I'm sure it wasn't the only one.

615
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:04,540
Well, I was just going to say the guy in Pittsburgh, which is a real documented story and was

616
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:10,140
covered in all the national media and stuff about the guy who thought the cops were coming

617
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:13,520
to take his guns because Obama was coming to take his guns.

618
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:14,160
Right.

619
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:18,440
And actually, they were coming because of a noise complaint that his mother made.

620
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,440
And it's not funny.

621
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:22,600
It's a real thing that happened.

622
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,360
And he let fire.

623
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,040
And I mean, he opened fire.

624
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,240
And I think he killed a cop.

625
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,580
And I don't know.

626
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:29,760
He was pretty well wounded.

627
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:30,960
But it was, you know...

628
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,940
Well, you got to be...

629
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:34,100
He was worried about those demon craps.

630
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:35,200
Yep.

631
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,000
They were coming to take his weapons from him.

632
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:37,500
Yeah.

633
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,440
Why would anybody take weapons from a nice guy like that?

634
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:44,360
I am doing a good job.

635
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:44,360


636
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:44,360


637
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:44,360


638
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:44,360


639
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:47,640
It's suckering the American peopley again.

640
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:49,860
I am Bozo Obama.

641
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,820
And I approve this message.

642
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,260
Oh, hell.

643
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,160
Let's go for broke.

644
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:02,580
Re-elect Obama so all those city dwellers will have to come to the country to buy food

645
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:04,060
from us or starve.

646
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:05,000
Go ahead.

647
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,460
Follow Obama down the yellow brick road and see what happens.

648
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:14,140
These Democrats need to unite in an effort to crush the whole God.

649
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:14,360
God.

650
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:14,680
Thing.

651
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,080
OMG.

652
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,380
Liberal media in overdrive.

653
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
We get it!

654
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,700
America is dying.

655
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:22,420
Obama!

656
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,320
Obama!

657
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:24,460
In 2012!

658
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:28,120
You love the misery and being the victim, America.

659
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:32,200
What have we done to this once great America?

660
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,700
Frown emoticon.

661
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,600
Maybe Romney was right.

662
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:42,520
If 40 per 7 will vote for, oh, despite his handling of the economy,

663
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,140
then, uh...

664
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:48,200
It shows their level of dependence on government welfare.

665
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,700
Don't you think that's true?

666
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,500
Yeah, that's me.

667
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,380
Uh, I'll vote for OB.

668
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,000
I'll vote for OB.

669
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,700
Despite his handling of the economy.

670
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:07,160
And if that shows my dependence on government welfare, that's great.

671
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:10,960
Because I've never taken government welfare.

672
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:11,500
Right.

673
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,020
And I'm exactly the same.

674
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,240
I will vote for him.

675
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,440
And I've never taken government welfare either.

676
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,720
Just think of we, how many years she put in there.

677
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:22,400
Working away like a fool and stuff like that.

678
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,160
And she's one of the 47%.

679
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:24,560
That's right.

680
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:25,640
She's rich.

681
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:27,160
She's rich.

682
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,080
No, that's the 1% of the rich people.

683
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:29,080


684
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,020
That's the 1%.

685
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:36,020
Yeah, the 47% of the vampire ticks and parasites on the government teat.

686
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:36,920
Spelled with two E's.

687
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,560
And man, now you would sound like a communist.

688
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,100
Want to stop the evil...

689
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:44,220
You don't call anybody a parasite or a vampire unless you, you know, they're actually hanging out.

690
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:44,800
They're hanging from your neck.

691
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,880
You could get in trouble and go to a memory camp.

692
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:52,220
Want to stop the evil rich guy liberals?

693
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:57,420
Cancel your order for your $600 iPhone 5, idiots.

694
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,480
Died of being poor?

695
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,840
Get out of your ass and work.

696
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:03,640
I am about to do that in about an hour.

697
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,120
Enjoy your sloth.

698
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:08,460
No, I'm sorry.

699
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:11,200
Enjoy your sloth and envy progressive liberals.

700
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:12,380
Marxists.

701
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:14,220
I enjoy sloth.

702
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,460
Am I sloth and envy?

703
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,460
I enjoy sloth anytime I can, man.

704
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,220
It's a busy world and it's a pain, you know?

705
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:21,400
Here's the loothole ones.

706
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:21,880
It's the lootholes.

707
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:23,400
You what?

708
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,420
The rich to pay more?

709
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,640
You say stop the lootholes.

710
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:31,600
Let's start with the earn income tax credit.

711
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,060
That is a loothole.

712
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,520
Pay their fire share.

713
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:42,100
Man, now that cat, I have to actually just interject a little bit here.

714
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,880
And notice that he's...

715
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,840
Totally, totally off the wall.

716
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,640
In fact, he's combining two news stories, both from Fox,

717
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,240
that kind of conflict with each other.

718
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:53,240
And he doesn't seem to know the difference.

719
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:55,700
God, you know what I just realized?

720
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,000
It's like five minutes to the end of the show

721
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,380
and we're only on, like, page two of three and a half pages.

722
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,180
I'm going to skip ahead.

723
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,420
This is my favorite, my favorite one.

724
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,080
It's right at the end.

725
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,920
Typical of a darkie.

726
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:20,880
That was the statement.

727
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,820
Typical of a darkie.

728
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:26,660
That was followed, however, by the first one that actually made me laugh.

729
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,700
Somebody said,

730
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:32,160
I wonder if the GOP has outsourced Yahoo trolling to China.

731
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,540
Somebody who didn't find that funny said,

732
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:39,080
I wonder if Obama sold Yahoo to China.

733
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:44,220
He's go at taking over private business and begging for money from China.

734
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:44,220


735
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:44,560
China!

736
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,080
So, I just don't know.

737
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:50,860
I don't know.

738
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,140
It's a very sad world we live in.

739
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:56,780
It's kind of depressing to think about that there are that many people

740
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:00,560
who would actually open their mouths and that would come out.

741
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:05,300
And it just shows that most of the people,

742
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:09,500
just as mentioned in the Church of the Subgenius, are idiots.

743
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:14,200
Demo-tard Paul reported on by a demo-tard.

744
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,180
Biased media.

745
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:18,320
Start the celebration, Libby's.

746
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,520
Then get out of the way on Election Day.

747
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:23,580
It'll be a Prozac moment for the socialists.

748
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,080
He's very familiar with that drug I might add.

749
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:32,020
Well, I think we've had enough here.

750
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,960
I don't want to do this one in black dialect.

751
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,700
Somebody would get mad at me.

752
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,660
They'd get the wrong idea.

753
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,080
But every now and then you see one that's written up in...

754
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,180
What would you say?

755
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:44,760
What would you call it?

756
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,420
Uncle Remus speech.

757
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:50,480
By some pecker word.

758
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:52,760
Trying to, you know...

759
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:56,440
Once again, it's like they can't say what they think.

760
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:00,720
They just tell each other over and over again what we think.

761
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:03,860
And they've got it all back last words.

762
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,300
And they've been told what we think.

763
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,700
Each and every one of us.

764
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,760
Not one deviation from that.

765
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,160
All Libs are the same.

766
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:17,180
Especially ones with huge, humongous breasts.

767
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,120
They're different.

768
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:19,380
They're not different.

769
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:20,720
They're all the same.

770
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,880
All liberals are...

771
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,320
Well, it's certainly true.

772
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,860
I have a lot of friends who are conservative.

773
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:34,680
Including lots of major subgenius contributors.

774
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,520
And they're not like that.

775
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:39,520
They're not like these people we've been reading.

776
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,200
But they don't post to Yahoo.

777
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,740
And frankly...

778
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:46,620
This is what I mostly find.

779
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,520
I could read a few comments by demotards.

780
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,360
But they're not very funny.

781
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:57,500
So, friends, I have to...

782
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,520
We have to put on a tape.

783
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:01,180
I'll tell you what I think.

784
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,080
Here's what I think.

785
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,360
I think J.R. Bob Dobbs is going to come in and sweep up this mess.

786
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,320
I hope he does, anyway.

787
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,860
I hope he does, too.

788
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:12,060
I think Big Bird is coming to take your guns, man.

789
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,060
But really...

790
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:18,760
It's like the show ends in five minutes.

791
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:24,240
I've got one very ancient joke political rant.

792
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,020
It's me.

793
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:28,740
Although you'll barely recognize it because it's so old.

794
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:29,900
And I was so young.

795
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:35,520
And then the slot rods from Live for the Next Day.

796
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,580
That'll be something...

797
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,340
Finally, you'll hear something good.

798
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,500
And fun.

799
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:43,340
So, Dave, thank you for calling in.

800
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:47,040
I'm sorry that these people made those comments.

801
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:49,780
And I'm just sorry to hear that.

802
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,800
Thanks for calling in.

803
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:57,500
And so, with that, goodbye.

804
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,900
But who cares, dear friends?

805
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:02,900
Who cares?

806
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:06,500
Because the end times are coming up.

807
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:08,640
You know?

808
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,260
It's the first day of the end of the world.

809
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:12,800
And...

810
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:15,860
We've been given...

811
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:21,040
Bob has given us to see signs and portents

812
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,800
of what will bring this end,

813
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,540
what will trigger the day of judgment.

814
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:31,920
And what it's going to be...

815
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,300
Of course, we know when the exes will, of course,

816
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,880
arrive July 5th, 1998,

817
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:39,380
at 7 o'clock in the morning all over the world.

818
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:43,220
But what triggers the end times

819
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:45,540
for the other alien beings,

820
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,500
the Yakutismo and so forth,

821
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:50,360
is this one moment when the world,

822
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:53,120
when America becomes so decadent

823
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:56,620
that it no longer deserves to live.

824
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:00,780
And that sign of the end times, dear friends,

825
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:04,620
is the royal jelly enema.

826
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:09,340
At a time, 1998, 97,

827
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,360
doesn't matter when, might be now,

828
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:12,380
may have already happened.

829
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,640
A time when beggars are crowding the streets

830
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:20,900
and children, poor children, are out starving.

831
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,020
Celebrities and lawyers in Hollywood

832
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:28,260
will be indulging in the latest hedonistic health,

833
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,320
the crap-pot health fad.

834
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:35,560
Getting enemas with pure royal jelly,

835
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,340
the honey fed to queen bees,

836
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:40,900
which costs $1,000 for enough royal jelly

837
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,080
to get the average jaded swinger,

838
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,220
you know, off or whatever.

839
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,440
And so at this time when the homeless

840
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,380
are selling their babies to procure used,

841
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,080
leftover amber grist and royal jelly enema byproducts,

842
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:58,400
when a Hollywood star,

843
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:00,720
the moment when a Hollywood star

844
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,840
spends $60,000 in one night on that,

845
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:07,500
and his used jelly is sold on the streets

846
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,340
for $200 for half a pint,

847
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:12,280
this so disgusts the aliens

848
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,060
that they don't even know what they're doing.

849
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:14,760
They decide to trash the earth

850
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,980
before the exes arrive.

851
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,040
The Existing.

852
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,160
The Existing.

853
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:52,160


854
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:52,900
The Existing.

855
00:56:52,900 --> 00:57:10,140
The Existing.

856
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,300
Thank you.

857
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,880
Thank you.

858
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,820
Thank you.

859
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,240
Thank you.

860
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:25,960
Thank you.

861
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,940
Thank you.

862
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,040
Thank you.

863
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:33,540
Thank you.

864
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:33,820
Thank you.

865
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:33,820


866
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:34,160
Thank you.

867
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:34,160


868
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:34,160


869
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:34,160


870
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,880
From PR News in Washington,

871
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:38,300
I'm taking responsibility for today's

872
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:40,120
suicide bombing in the afternoon

873
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:41,340
in the Afghan capital of Kabul.

874
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:43,420
Two adults and a child were killed

875
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:44,940
when their mobile home was destroyed.

876
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,400
Also killed a driver of a semi truck

877
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,080
that flipped onto a cement PR.

878
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:51,880
President Obama says President Obama

879
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,960
is not heading in the wrong direction.

880
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:56,180
The government said this is PR.

881
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,180
PR News.

882
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,040
Larry Miller reports at

883
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,780
This is PR News from Washington.

884
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:04,140
There is no more money.

885
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,620
We gotta get some money.

886
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:07,720
That dirty

887
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,340
Turkish Arkham backflagged

888
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:10,140
Morton, Philadelphia,

889
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,760
Martin, Perkaluma,

890
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,700
Burton, Boston,

891
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,740
Friends, we're glad you listened

892
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:19,660
to this show and we're even more

893
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:21,420
glad that some listeners have donated

894
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:23,440
enough to help us keep on going for

895
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,680
another couple of months.

896
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,860
Not just this show, but

897
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:29,320
subgenius.com and all the other archive

898
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:29,700
sites.

899
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,220
But if you truly love Bob

900
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:35,400
and want some of that slack back to

901
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,800
rebound to you,

902
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,640
you should go to subgenius.com

903
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:41,220
front page or especially

904
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:43,160
the radio page or the catalog

905
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,280
store pages

906
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,160
and help out financially as best

907
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,400
you can. Now we know

908
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,120
what it's like to be on the brink of

909
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,080
total poverty and we don't want any

910
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,940
subgeniuses to make their own situations

911
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:57,240
worse. But some of you

912
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:58,580
still have jobs.

913
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:01,140
Even five bucks makes a

914
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:03,160
big difference, even if it's only

915
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,240
once a month from enough of

916
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,160
50 bucks makes an even

917
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:07,840
bigger difference.

918
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,200
