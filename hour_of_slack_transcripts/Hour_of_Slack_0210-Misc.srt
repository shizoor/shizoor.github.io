1
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:16,540
Ah, yes, dear friends, this is KNON 89.3 FM here in Dallas, Texas.

2
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:23,200
Welcome, dear friends, to the subgenius hour of slack.

3
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:29,500
Slack, slack, slack, slack, slack, slack.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,480
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk.

5
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,740
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk.

6
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,980
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

7
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,840
Oh, wow.

8
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,960
Hey, I'm free.

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:56,540
The knee-deep sheep dip dipped deep down below the steep and chilly waters of the deep stream floats on the surface

10
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,860
like the ancient Egyptians floated on the current of their belief.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,800
for they thought they would never die,

12
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,980
but be reborn as gargling sarcophagi,

13
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,760
horrible mummies to march across the earth

14
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,920
and wreak and spew vengeance.

15
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,100
All of the little tiny dead deities

16
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,260
marched down the side of the subgenius church

17
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,740
and now live at last.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,120
Within the great pyramid,

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,640
the secret chamber of the subgenius.

20
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,700
What light and steam come from the special effects department

21
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,000
located below the pyramid?

22
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,800
Here, inside the heart of the mighty structure,

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,880
puzzling evidence broadcasts

24
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,300
from the inner chamber of the great pyramid.

25
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,580
Yeah, I'll teach you all how to talk on the radio.

26
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,100
Come on down.

27
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,300
Yes, these giant pyramids are actually radio stations

28
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,480
of a primitive nature,

29
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,060
which broadcast by the strange...

30
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,800
I'll play rock and roll until everybody falls apart.

31
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,400
I'll copy that old Procter & Bergman movie.

32
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,860
Then they would show the strange films

33
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,540
to the walls of the...

34
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,440
Come on, let's watch G-Man.

35
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,500
Please, Bob.

36
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,480
Oh, yes, dear friends.

37
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,840
This is me.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,340
Li Qing, a Chinese subgenius.

39
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,280
And you are listening to the Hour of Slack

40
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,900
on KNON in Dallas, Texas.

41
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,140
Remember, Bob is a comrade of all people.

42
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,600
He is a China, just like in America.

43
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,900
And people need slack.

44
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,320
In Chinese, we call slack

45
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,060
le tin pan.

46
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,780
But it must be true slack,

47
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,400
not the bad slack of the conspiracy.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,020
Please, Bob, help me somebody.

49
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:36,840
Please, Bob.

50
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,560
Oh, look out here he comes.

51
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,360
Or triple your money back.

52
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,720
The Church of the Subgenius

53
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,140
bring you another 33 minutes

54
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,780
of condensed

55
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,420
uraglic function.

56
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,980
Over the course...

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,380
of the quality audio visual techniques

58
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,760
exacerbated and complicated

59
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,840
by the Church of the Subgenius.

00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,060
Copyright 1985-86.

61
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,560
Oh, Dr. Spivak.

62
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,020
She said, cutting her own legs off.

63
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,220
I don't know where he gets that 33 minutes.

64
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,760
I understand the condensed uraglic functions.

65
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,980
That's no problem.

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,500
Oh, I hadn't played that little intro tape

67
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,680
in a while.

68
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,920
But that music's just too spooky.

69
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,280
I think it's slowed down too.

70
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:42,840
There.

71
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes, dear friends,

72
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,040
this is your

73
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,860
host and prayer partner,

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,420
Reverend Ivan Stang.

75
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,000
And, uh...

76
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,960
Yeah, that's not happy enough.

77
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,640
Oh, thank you.

78
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,120
Thank you.

79
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:00,960
I'm...

80
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,600
Yes, yes, I know.

81
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,220
I'm great.

82
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,160
Ha, that's more like it.

83
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,580
The potatoes here in the background.

84
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,880
Dear friends, we, uh...

85
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,700
This is gonna be a disorganized show.

86
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,260
I know that that makes you happy

87
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,660
because Bob has granted us slack.

88
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,880
That's what that always means.

89
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,920
Last week, the slack granted to me

90
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,600
was in the form of vile flu,

91
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,240
which made me sick.

92
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,220
Last night, we had, uh...

93
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,040
a down-home, holy ghost,

94
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,000
Bob Righteous revival

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,660
at the, uh...

96
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,180
science fiction fantasy fair

97
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,900
at the Marriott.

98
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,880
And, uh...

99
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,240
For those who were there,

100
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,100
we'll play the tape next week.

101
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,640
See?

102
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,520
And for those...

103
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,220
And for the anti-Stang forces out there,

104
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,600
boy, you missed it.

105
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,240
It was your chance

106
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,600
to be on the show

107
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,280
because we brought the show down there

108
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,200
in the form of the...

109
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,300
the Little Black Radio Shack box

110
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,780
and recorded, uh...

111
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,620
next week's hour of slack there

112
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,700
and let just anybody who wanted to

113
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,980
drop their pants and start spouting

114
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,700
into the tape deck.

115
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,580
And we actually fished out some pretty...

116
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:14,900
some...

117
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,820
one great new ranter, at least,

118
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,060
and some lovely, lovely tunes.

119
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,860
See how excited they are there in the background?

120
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,280
Uh...

121
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,300
So, we'll get into that.

122
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,220
But see, that requires editing

123
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,500
because the minute I told them

124
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,460
I was going to play it on the radio after editing,

125
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,340
they started screaming curse words.

126
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,280
Um...

127
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,900
And that offended me.

128
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,300
Anyway...

129
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,260
Oop!

130
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,420
Yeah.

131
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,920
So, friends, please call the station here

132
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,980
for information on the Church of the Subgenius

133
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,560
and that great man, Bob,

134
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,060
who we worship

135
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,740
as best we know how

136
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,860
by getting ourselves some slack.

137
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,320
Call and speak to the live...

138
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,540
the living Will O'Dobbs

139
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,980
here at 823-7...

140
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,480
uh...

141
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,580
7490.

142
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,840
823-7490.

143
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,680
God, I wrote my own phone number

144
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,640
down that piece of paper.

145
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,340
At least I didn't say it.

146
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,140
You're quite welcome.

147
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:22,700
Yeah.

148
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:23,980
Sure.

149
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,640
Just to get things started off on the right track,

150
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,160
I have a very, very pleasant little song here

151
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,460
by Zug's Rift

152
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,560
from his album,

153
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,220
his new album, Torment.

154
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,160
It's a song called

155
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,940
The Secret Marine Sex Kitten Party.

156
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,420
And it's...

157
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,960
It'll really make...

158
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,520
It's an uplifting, uplifting song.

159
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,640
I think you'll all really enjoy it.

160
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,580
And you'll know just what we mean by slack

161
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,800
when it ends.

162
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,080
Just after I was born,

163
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,340
Daddy was drafted and went off to war.

164
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,040
He was on a secret mission

165
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,520
that he could not tell us about,

166
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,640
but he looked worried.

167
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,320
The day he left with six other men in uniforms

168
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,900
was the last time any of us saw him alive.

169
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,440
Daddy went overseas

170
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,900
to a classified location,

171
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,320
and from his diary that was returned to us years later,

172
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,480
my mom and I read of how he was ambushed in the jungle

173
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,140
and how sickened he felt

174
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,860
the first time we had to kill him there.

175
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,560
Daddy's associates were horribly murdered,

176
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,020
then dismembered,

177
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,400
and Daddy was taken prisoner by the enemy.

178
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,020
They locked him up for almost seven months

179
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,300
in some small cell,

180
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,520
frequently refusing to feed him

181
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,900
or even allow him water.

182
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,320
Eventually, they took him from this room

183
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,220
and brought him into this large,

184
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,780
large house somewhere out in the country

185
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,520
where he hoped they would possibly give him

186
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,460
minimal but simple chores to do

187
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,740
while he was their prisoner.

188
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,400
They brought him upstairs

189
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,500
where they directed him to enter

190
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,100
this specially prepared room.

191
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,240
The entire floor of the room

192
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,440
was just one giant abacus,

193
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,300
a ten-foot by ten-foot giant frame

194
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,840
with large wooden beads

195
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,280
sliding back and forth on wires

196
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,440
stretched from one wall to the other.

197
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,180
It was impossible to stand up on it,

198
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
and Daddy was so scared

199
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,700
that he was forced down on his knees

200
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,700
as he crawled continuously into the room.

201
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,460
He realized that he must have been drugged,

202
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,160
for he next recalled awakening,

203
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,640
finding his wrists and ankles bound to ropes

204
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,160
rigged to the opposite walls of the room,

205
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,740
flat on his back on his uncomfortable wooden beads.

206
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,580
He looked up at one wall

207
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,840
and noticed a large picture window

208
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,120
with several uniformed enemy men

209
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,060
standing behind the glass,

210
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,460
smiling and talking in a language

211
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,200
he could not understand.

212
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,100
On command from one of the officials,

213
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,120
Daddy could feel the ropes

214
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,220
begin to tug at his arms and legs.

215
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,060
Daddy was rolled from one wall to the other,

216
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,340
then back again,

217
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,780
being pulled down and across the wooden beads

218
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,740
over and over and over

219
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,820
until the pain was unbearable.

220
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,780
Daddy would beg for mercy,

221
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,600
but for ten hours a day,

222
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,940
every day they would repeat this routine.

223
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,220
Daddy was fed just barely enough to stay alive.

224
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,100
He soon lost all control,

225
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,200
and the wooden beads soon began to chip away

226
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,400
at his insides, crumbling his bones.

227
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,240
Daddy, in horror, endured this every day

228
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,660
for almost two years.

229
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,500
One of the residing officers,

230
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,140
later apprehended and shot,

231
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,260
testified that Daddy was eventually stretched out

232
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,120
practically to the length of the room

233
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,580
and was soft, crippled, shapeless and helpless.

234
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,520
At the end of each session,

235
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,240
they would actually fold him up

236
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,080
and store him in the corner like a human pig.

237
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,720
Daddy, still alive,

238
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,700
could not cope with the horror of what they had done,

239
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,100
but could no longer speak or move,

240
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,860
and was their total slave.

241
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,080
He prayed that they would kill him,

242
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,680
but that was not the plan.

243
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,300
Every few days,

244
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,060
special officers would visit the compound,

245
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,100
and they would roll out Daddy

246
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,700
and display their trophy,

247
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,240
the living carpet.

248
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,460
They would all laugh and poke at him with their feet,

249
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,380
step on his sexual parts,

250
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,060
push in his soft face,

251
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,920
and kiss his face with their fingers

252
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,380
while he cried, unable to fight back.

253
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,060
When the diplomatic visit was over,

254
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,340
they would inject Daddy with nutrients

255
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,740
and fold him back up

256
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,240
and shove him back under a counter in the corner.

257
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,260
By the time the secret Marines had found him,

258
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,880
he was shriveled, black, and dead.

259
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,300
The Khalidomnia nhưng إلى khi

260
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,180
There was something wrong.

261
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,240
There was something wrong on your shoulder.

262
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,880
There was something wrong on your shoulder.

263
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,900
Oh boy, I don't know about you,

264
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,020
Oh boy, I don't know about you,

265
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,040
but that made me think

266
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,660
feel so much better.

267
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,220
It's all relative.

268
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,620
You know, that was Zug's Rift once again.

269
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,260
The mighty Zug's Rift.

270
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,560
I've got a lot of, you know,

271
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,560
on disorganized hour of Slack shows,

272
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,920
I play a lot of the KPFA show.

273
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,840
So you'll be hearing quite a bit of puzzling evidence.

274
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,680
Dr. Howell and special guests in this case,

275
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,700
Janer Hypercleets in one case

276
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,640
and in the other, Nancy Regalia,

277
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,400
Regalia, Reverend Nancy Regalia

278
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,760
and her husband, Reverend Dan Meyer

279
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,420
of the Church of the Great Green Frog.

280
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,160
So, but before we go on,

281
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,720
you know, I know that some of you have been wondering

282
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,580
just why we had to start a church

283
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,540
called the Church of the Subgenius

284
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,720
and why we worship that man, Bob.

285
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,240
Well, see, our God's dead.

286
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,880
Sorry about yours.

287
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,500
Well, I guess that doesn't really explain things.

288
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,160
But here is the man who smoked the pipe

289
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,580
that ran from the legs,

290
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,660
that swallowed the throat,

291
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,900
that digested the stomach,

292
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,080
that burned the fire,

293
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,120
that wet the water,

294
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,360
that cleaned the soap,

295
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,520
that excreted the urethra

296
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,700
that belonged to the church that Bob made.

297
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,340
Truth is stranger than friction.

298
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,780
This is a good friend of mine.

299
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,760
I want you to treat this guy just like he was me.

300
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,220
He's a good friend.

301
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,040
Well, not that bad.

302
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,920
Hey, asshole, you got five bucks for a bottle of coffee?

303
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,540
Yeah.

304
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,520
But you know, it's my fans that made me.

305
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,940
A bottle of coffee will carry you farther than ever before.

306
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,180
I've got my bottle of coffee.

307
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,360
It's as big as my head.

308
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,600
And I'm ready to drink it now.

309
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,020
But, Jane, what were you going to tell the friends of the show?

310
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,080
Well, it's my fans that made me what I am today.

311
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,020
Thanks a lot.

312
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,800
Oh, man, look at that guy.

313
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,460
But seriously.

314
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,980
But really, how does he keep coming up to me?

315
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,960
Here they are, carrying the ball downfield.

316
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,780
A little color game.

317
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,840
It's a beautiful ball,

318
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,300
rising over the mountains like a shining sun.

319
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,080
And the birds are singing.

320
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,680
The waterfall is falling.

321
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,560
The moose is bellowing in the woods.

322
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,240
Yeah.

323
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,300
And the show.

324
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,160
It's for you, I think.

325
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:24,980
Falling all over itself.

326
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,020
Puppet of the birds.

327
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,700
Early in the morning.

328
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,480
Fine.

329
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:27,860
Come on.

330
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,580
And we've got the show still coming up.

331
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,260
Hello?

332
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,360
Is this the show?

333
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,840
We are finished with all of the San Francisco gigs,

334
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,300
but we haven't stopped or started the local other shows yet.

335
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,020
What's the process to get a ham sandwich out of this joint?

336
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:42,620
Okay.

337
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,020
A ham sandwich?

338
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,160
You can't do that on the show.

339
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,860
No, a ham sandwich.

340
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,780
Yeah, a ham sandwich.

341
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,400
The box lunches are in the back.

342
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,660
That doesn't sound very cool.

343
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,280
Well, that sounds pretty good.

344
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,100
Yeah, I was just thinking,

345
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,120
I can't be a guy saying yes all day tonight like the usual.

346
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,680
Hang up on you, sir?

347
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,240
We would never do that.

348
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,000
Maybe I could make you sell the ham sandwich.

349
00:13:59,160 --> 00:13:59,860
It wouldn't feel so embarrassing.

350
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,660
I'm calling up the show.

351
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,720
Okay, we'll just go back in the kitchen and go ahead and grab one.

352
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,420
All right, where are they?

353
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:03,740
The refrigerator?

354
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:04,820
Yeah.

355
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,120
You guys get the refrigerator back all right that night, I guess, huh?

356
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,480
Yeah, the riot's over and the refrigerator's back in style.

357
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,560
Get away from that refrigerator.

358
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,960
I want to hear one peep out of you kids.

359
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,540
Confine your shenanigans to the rumpus room and keep it down to a dull roar.

360
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,660
And there goes those shenanigans now.

361
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,540
He's gone.

362
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,900
Down on the collar, Hopper.

363
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,500
Well, we'll have to.

364
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,480
We'll call little Reverend Sternow's house in a little while and see.

365
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
Yeah, we'll bounce him out of bed.

366
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,280
And before that, maybe we'll get another collar.

367
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,120
Maybe we should bother Ivan Stang, our pilot drummer.

368
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,860
No, blow it off, Doug.

369
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,540
After being threatened by the evil...

370
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,000
Thank you, thank you.

371
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,100
Oh, come on, come on.

372
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:37,780
I don't want sympathy.

373
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,500
Okay, okay, people.

374
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,360
Give me a break.

375
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,500
Oh, come on now.

376
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,280
Come on.

377
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,240
Well, the sympathy vote seems to be squarely in Jenner's court.

378
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,220
And now we're going to talk to another caller.

379
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,800
Come on, I paid money for this stuff.

380
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,900
I've been egged by better than you, baby.

381
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,560
Give me a break.

382
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:51,720
Okay, caller.

383
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,220
Come on, honey.

384
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,080
Shoot your...

385
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,400
Whatever it is.

386
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,060
Shoot your wad.

387
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,960
What do you think of Jenner?

388
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,080
Hello?

389
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,620
I don't think of Jenner.

390
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:06,280
Jenner, that sandwich guy, he just couldn't come through.

391
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,200
Couldn't come to the show.

392
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,020
Just couldn't make it.

393
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,420
He just doesn't have the subgeniality to...

394
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,960
Oh, that was old Spamhandler.

395
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,340
We're hungry.

396
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,300
We need that sandwich.

397
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,300
Unable to digest his food, you know.

398
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,680
At least one person's laughing at this.

399
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,340
He calls it Mr. Philostomy Bag of 1945.

400
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,040
He's a joker, a real jerk.

401
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,900
He's a joker.

402
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,380
He's a...

403
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,860
A handbag sandwich man.

404
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,820
We let him call.

405
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,320
Did you bring a grandma-faced sandwich?

406
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,840
A grandma-faced sandwich?

407
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,340
Two pieces of whole wheat bread, some lettuce, tomatoes, mustard.

408
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,740
Your grandma's face, sucker.

409
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,240
That's it.

410
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:35,800
Tell him.

411
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,960
That sandwich man, he went to the lecture in 1995.

412
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,880
The professor tapped his...

413
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,180
He kicked under the light during the main ugly faces at the crowd.

414
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:43,980
And he asked,

415
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,080
Do any of you posers know where I can lay my hands on the spec sheet for the life of...

416
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,920
Here, now.

417
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,400
We don't allow that kind of talk on the air.

418
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,860
I'd like you to reconsider your...

419
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,020
Before they get a little bit out of control.

420
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,620
Oh, no, no.

421
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,420
Never out of control.

422
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,680
Just like the Aryan youth whose father laid waste his early morning dreams.

423
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,800
Today, he so enamors himself of pledges and oaths to his career and his reward.

424
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:10,140
His reward is that he bickers with his only brother and lies next to his only bag of marshmallows.

425
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,140
Now, just calm down.

426
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,120
We're all Bay Aryans here and in the Bay Aryan movement.

427
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,160
Are you offended by the bold smell of Aryan sweat?

428
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,540
Why, it only proves that we live up to our Aryan racial style.

429
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,720
Well, I hope you can, uh...

430
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,300
Be on Aryan hold for a moment as we investigate caller number two.

431
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,440
You're on the Aryan of the soul.

432
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,620
Hello, you're on the air.

433
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,780
They're more like a mess.

434
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,280
Let me see you.

435
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:33,860
Yes, yes.

436
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,740
Ready to chat.

437
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,220
Ready to help you.

438
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,000
Do anything.

439
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,080
That's right.

440
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:38,900
We're on the air.

441
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,340
So what are they talking about?

442
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,260
Jeez.

443
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,680
Those guys.

444
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,400
San...

445
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,020
San Francisco.

446
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:45,700
You know.

447
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,180
You know what they say about that place.

448
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,360
I don't.

449
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,080
And I'm writing a new book.

450
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,000
It's gonna be called,

451
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,920
What Will the Preachers Do When the Devil is Saved?

452
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,900
Oh, that's a hard saying.

453
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,700
Oh, that's a hard saying.

454
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,720
Oh, that's a tough saying.

455
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,060
Joy to the world.

456
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,180
Moslems, you know, I mean, they're good folks.

457
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,100
There's all kinds of different dimensions of religious thought, you know.

458
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,080
And the Moslems, you know, they got their own thing going, you know.

459
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,880
And this one's standing over there in North Africa, you know, and he's gonna get this other catch.

460
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,840
You know, he came from Alabama and he went over there, you know, to see what his home land is.

461
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,340
And he said, hey, man, what's your home land look like?

462
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:28,240
And so he's over there and he said, hey, man, say, help me to some of this Moslem jazz, man.

463
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,740
I hear it's real strong singing.

464
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,160
He said, yeah, man, say, we close to it.

465
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,700
Say, we got all kinds of things going.

466
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,660
He said, well, man, say, I want to join.

467
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,700
Say, let's go get a drink and talk it over.

468
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,900
And he said, Moslems don't drink.

469
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,760
He said, forget it.

470
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,620
I'm gonna be a Christian.

471
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,000
Is that weird?

472
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,680
But it don't make no difference.

473
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,660
I was telling you a little while ago about that atheism.

474
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,820
A lot of folks get disturbed about that and think somebody could be...

475
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,200
See, let's break the word down and see what it means.

476
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,500
Atheism.

477
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,120
At the ill...

478
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,500
Them's hard sayings.

479
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,420
Be kind to strangers.

480
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,320
Remember, as a stranger, as a friend, you ain't met yet.

481
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,200
Don't bad mouth nobody.

482
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,740
Way back.

483
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,140
Now then, this is a weird thought and this is really out of it.

484
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,120
Like this here.

485
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,740
There was this violinist.

486
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,000
And he loved to play the violin.

487
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,280
I mean, that was his own kick.

488
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,200
He dug that stroke.

489
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:29,440
I mean, a lot better than some folks like to work on hot rod engines, you know, or things like that.

490
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,300
You know, I mean, he had his own serenity going.

491
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,220
And he loved to play the violin.

492
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,080
Yes, he did that.

493
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,980
And he had practiced it and practiced it and practiced it and even practiced.

494
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,420
Yes.

495
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,260
I mean, up until where that he could play this violin where it sounded like one.

496
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,140
Yes.

497
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,240
And even beyond that.

498
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,960
Oh, it was so beautiful that he just went so far out of it.

499
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,000
He left the whole scope of humanity.

500
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,720
I mean, humans could...

501
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:56,960
He couldn't understand or perceive the depth of the fine quality that he was getting out of this here musical instrument.

502
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,560
So he went yonder to seek him some folks that would enjoy it.

503
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:08,360
And so that he could give of his own creative being, his own self, which he had got in tune to and then brought it into material manifestation on the fiddle.

504
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,520
Thought I'd never get that one out.

505
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,080
Well, he went out yonder to the jungles out into Africa.

506
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,400
Bless his heart, he did that.

507
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,640
And he went out there and he got up on this stump.

508
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,380
He just kind of pounced up on it, you know.

509
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,380
And he took in his fiddle bow.

510
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,760
Well, took him, it still sounds right.

511
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,920
I ain't gonna let them smart-alecky intellectuals mess up my thinking.

512
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,500
Then he started to play.

513
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:41,180
And as the bow hit upon the strings, thereof such beautiful music you ain't never heard before, beloved, because there was no human ears there to perceive it.

514
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:48,340
And all the animals grouped around the great big ferocious lions and the rhinoceroses and all kinds of things.

515
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,360
Tigers and bears and snails.

516
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:56,080
and giraffes and little monkeys and great big gorillas

517
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,020
and I mean bad mean looking creatures, you know,

518
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,260
all come crept out there and just sat down

519
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,020
and swooped down and started sleeping

520
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,800
in these stereophonic vibrations from this violin.

521
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,940
And they was all so happy,

522
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,500
because you know them animals is here,

523
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,980
it's a sensitive, they was tired of hearing

524
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,920
all them old gunshots and everything, you know.

525
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,260
Tired of their head, all them barbarous folks over there

526
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,160
shooting them animals.

527
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,100
I mean, it ain't right.

528
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:18,780
You know what I mean?

529
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,120
Animals don't shoot humans.

530
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,480
That's right.

531
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,680
And so they're sitting there digging this music

532
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,700
and here come a great big black panther.

533
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,180
And he come running out from behind the weeds there

534
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:28,800
and he say,

535
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,960
and he jumped on this violinist

536
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,960
and they'd hem up and the violin, the bow strings,

537
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,880
everything, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp.

538
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,360
Wiped his mouth and you could just hear

539
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,240
all the other animals saying,

540
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,000
and he started to trot off like this

541
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,680
and this lion walked over to him and he says,

542
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,460
oh man, good lord.

543
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,480
What in the world did you do that for?

544
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,700
And the panther said, huh?

545
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,720
It don't make no difference.

546
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,580
Go on and how you think about it.

547
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,680
Well, this is one for you though,

548
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,040
because I mean, you know, a lot of you

549
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,420
have been hearing about the beat folks.

550
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,280
Well, actually I've got one prayer.

551
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,260
This dear heart over here on the side

552
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,440
asked me to say a prayer.

553
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,420
And I've got one prayer that really swings, friends.

554
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,720
You know, I've talked to some folks

555
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,200
and they think prayer ain't nowhere

556
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,400
and they think meditation is a stroke.

557
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,620
But wait a minute, meditation, prayer is asking for it

558
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,940
and meditation is waiting.

559
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,180
That's right.

560
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,720
Oh yeah.

561
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,400
Oh wait.

562
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,700
Just gotta hear this one little part.

563
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,800
Oh, I wish you would honey.

564
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,140
Oh, do it, do it.

565
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,080
Oh, well I just, I had to play that little

566
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,860
mini, mini, mini, mini.

567
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,100
I love it.

568
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,720
The fella talking there, ranting,

569
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,480
that was a brother Dave Gardner.

570
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,720
For those of you who weren't raised on the cat,

571
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,720
that wacky, wacky dude.

572
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,420
That's a good one.

573
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:17,420


574
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:17,420


575
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:17,420


576
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:17,420


577
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:17,420


578
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:17,420


579
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:17,420


580
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,340
Wacky, spacky.

581
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,960
What have I got here?

582
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,700
Oh yeah, okay.

583
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,520
Here's another cheerful little piece of music

584
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,800
that I, I don't know, it reminds me of my kids.

585
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,000
It's by one of my new favorite bands called Happy Flowers.

586
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,420
And you'll see why they call themselves that

587
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:45,700
when you hear this, if you're not familiar with Happy Flowers.

588
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,540
This is called,

589
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,700
Watch Cartoons.

590
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,640
I said,

591
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,900
I wanna watch cartoons.

592
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,240
I said,

593
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,940
I wanna watch cartoons.

594
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,760
I said,

595
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,980
I wanna watch cartoons

596
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,480
Come on, let me watch cartoons.

597
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,040
I said

598
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,080
I wanna watch cartoons.

599
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,700
I said,

600
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,680
I wanna watch cartoons.

601
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,360
I said,

602
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,140
I said I wanna watch cartoons!

603
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,400
Come on!

604
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:56,000
I said I wanna watch cartoons!

605
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,100
I already missed this first!

606
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:05,480
I said that I wanna watch cartoons!

607
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:13,360
I said I wanna watch cartoons!

608
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,060
Come on!

609
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,460
Let me turn on the TV!

610
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,900
How's about to start?

611
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:24,700
I said I wanna watch cartoons!

612
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,960
I said I wanna watch cartoons!

613
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,040


614
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,340
Let me watch them!

615
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,900
I said I wanna watch cartoons!

616
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,440
I wanna watch all the little ghostbusters!

617
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,060
That's all!

618
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,060
That's all I wanna watch!

619
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,820
Come on! Let me!

620
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,100
I said I wanna watch cartoons!

621
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,880
I said!

622
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,980
Come on!

623
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,200
I wanna watch cartoons!

624
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,180
If you don't let me turn on the TV

625
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,860
soon, all they'll have to be

626
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,820
Fraggle Rock!

627
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,520
I said!

628
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,480
I hate the Fraggles!

629
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,860
I hate the Fraggles!

630
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,200
I said I wanna watch cartoons!

631
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,600
I said!

632
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,260
I wanna watch cartoons!

633
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:29,900
I said!

634
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:29,900


635
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,400
That means I'm not in the TV!

636
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:31,700
I said!

637
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,400
I wanna watch cartoons!

638
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,260
I said!

639
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,160
I wanna watch cartoons!

640
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,460
Please!

641
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,520
Please!

642
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,620
Please, Mommy!

643
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,180
I really want to watch.

644
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,360
I like it.

645
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,300
I really do.

646
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,060
You let me watch my cocks.

647
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:08,100
You let me watch my cocks.

648
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,200
You let me watch my cocks.

649
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,840
I want my brother to turn blue.

650
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,220
I want to watch cartoons.

651
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,740
I want to watch cartoons.

652
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,080
I want to watch cartoons.

653
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,920
I want to watch cartoons.

654
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,560
The Passion of Children.

655
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,800
I've played that for all the parents out there.

656
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,340
Because I know that you'll understand.

657
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,300
I know that you'll identify with that.

658
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:27,660
Remember, those of you in the Dallas-Fort Worth listening area may call 823-7490.

659
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,680
And give Will-O-Dob something to do here.

660
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,580
He's waiting so patiently for your calls.

661
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:44,840
And as usual, when we start running out of...

662
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,460
things to say or play, we read from...

663
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,920
Fortean Times, the Journal of Strange Phenomena.

664
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,160
This is all true.

665
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,580
I've circled little interesting bits here.

666
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:07,500
A search through medical literature has found exactly 31 cases in all recorded history of people swallowing their toothbrushes.

667
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:14,820
One odd feature is that four of these incidents occurred in Durham, North Carolina.

668
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,340
In Rome.

669
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:15,940
In recent years.

670
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,200
The earliest reported case was in Hong Kong in 1882.

671
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:29,180
And the champion toothbrush swallower was a Soviet psychiatric patient who ate 16 of them in 1984.

672
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:35,320
One region in India reported six swallowings between 1960 and 1973.

673
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,760
Coinciding with Dobbs' years working for the...

674
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,520
Frederick's Holding Company at that time.

675
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,000
Hmm.

676
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:54,240
Strange what that great saint of sales can get people to do, if he puts his mind to it.

677
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:06,380
A mystery benefactor scattered 5,000 pounds worth of peseta notes along a two-mile stretch of motorway in Madrid

678
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:10,020
before vanishing into the traffic jam he had caused.

679
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,420
And less than a week later, the same anonymous man, or another, perhaps,

680
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:23,160
was back handing out 5-pound notes, or 1,000 peseta notes, in central Madrid and departing just before police arrived.

681
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:30,860
His origin and purpose remains a total mystery.

682
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:37,320
And dear friends, the earliest dwarf so far discovered, 3 feet tall and 17 years old,

683
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:44,260
lived with a tribe of nomadic hunter-gatherers in the mountains of southern Italy 11,000 years ago.

684
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:50,200
He suffered from an inherited form of dwarfism called acromesomelic dysplasia,

685
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,680
and must have been fed and cared for by his social group.

686
00:29:53,900 --> 00:30:00,400
The site of his grave, at Riparo del Romito, in a valley linking the Tyrrhenian Sea to the Ionian,

687
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:06,580
was an important social and ritual center, and few had the status necessary to be buried there.

688
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:14,240
So you see, friends, even 11,000 years ago, the mutants, the beautiful mutants and the subgenius,

689
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:14,240


690
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:14,240


691
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:20,920
were able to convince the normals around them that the world owed them a living.

692
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,480
And friends, I hope that you're able to do that too.

693
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:30,440
You certainly owe the station a living, and that's why I would like to take this opportunity to remind you to send in your pledges.

694
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:39,480
...dolls, fish and worms, frogs and mice, it's time to spin some platters and be really cool and wicked,

695
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,260
and you groovadelic love generation, you.

696
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,660
Yes, that's right.

697
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,200
You too.

698
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,540
The kids are real beautiful today.

699
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:49,160
I never hoped to see one, but I can tell you sure right now I'd rather see them than be one.

700
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,220
It's the now-ago-go-world of the subgenius show.

701
00:30:53,380 --> 00:31:03,180
The craft is hovering over the bovine now, and releasing its Waldo arms to pinch off portions of beefcake and beefsteak.

702
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,140
You mutilate it, you roast it. That's what we do down here.

703
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:11,240
You just come on in, folks, we'll give you a chainsaw and a sledgehammer.

704
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,240
You can poleax them, mutilate them yourself.

705
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,280
We'll cook it up for you.

706
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,000
Just hit them right between the eyes and tell them Bob sent you.

707
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,200
Just tell them God loves you.

708
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:19,480
What?

709
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,640
God loves you.

710
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,420
They'll never know the difference.

711
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,920
Called the Cordell Bank Marine Sanctuary,

712
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:32,920
the U.S. Marines plan to put up an enormous chunk of concrete and build a training base.

713
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,120
What are they going to train there?

714
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:42,000
Well, it's toilet training for those Marines who have been brain damaged by falling down too many stairs

715
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,820
in Quonset Huts carrying loads of irrelevant documents.

716
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:51,500
Yeah, watching the changing of the guard, I mean, you'd think they'd be old enough to change themselves by now.

717
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:56,960
Yes, well, they have to change the guard because without changing their right guard,

718
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:01,620
these Marines would smell pretty bad after the end of a long training mission, wouldn't you say, Ed?

719
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,500
Well, yeah, I...

720
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,480
The second Marine found the bean, Parley Vu.

721
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,600
Yes, indeed.

722
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,460
Oh, Parley.

723
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:10,660
Oh, Parley.

724
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,400
Oh, Parley.

725
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,120
I don't know about you, but I'm going to spend the next week thinking of ways I can murder the...

726
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,620
Well, let's turn that microphone off there.

727
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,940
Well, yes, if you're listening to this, we know where you live.

728
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,460
We know where you park your car.

729
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:38,060
Well, I have to look at that.

730
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,000
Look at those little campers building their calisthenics.

731
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:46,960
There they go, watch them wiggle as they sweat and perspire out by the lake and the camp

732
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,800
counselors are now wielding canoe paddles with abandon in their little rumps and forcing

733
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,960
them to perform cartwheels as part of their indoctrination.

734
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,800
Yee-haw!

735
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:08,080
Oh, yes sir, well, the other stations are having all kinds of problems.

736
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:15,060
Oh, dear friends, well, glad to know somebody's calling Will.

737
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,280
We'll have to return our calls tomorrow night.

738
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,200
This just ain't the time.

739
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,980
A brief note from South Korea.

740
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:35,060
Thirteen monks were injured in a battle over the leadership of a Buddhist temple in Seoul.

741
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,060
Hundreds of monks fought with clubs and stones.

742
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,560
So much for the way of peace and tranquility.

743
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:47,900
The body of bachelor Alfred Rylance was found standing at the kitchen sink in his one-bedroom

744
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,720
flat in Washbrook House, Sutton Estate, Salford.

745
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,940
He had been dead for at least a day.

746
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,580
A post-mortem revealed that he had inhaled his own vomit, but there was no evidence that

747
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,840
he had taken anything in an overdose quantity.

748
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:06,400
Police found that a cabinet and table had been broken and speculated that the dead man

749
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,040
had fallen into it.

750
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,280
It could have been an accident.

751
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:16,480
Convicted murderer Michael Godwin, 28, avoided the electric chair in Columbia, SC, where

752
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,440
his sentence was reduced to life on appeal.

753
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:23,880
While sitting naked on the metal commode in his cell, he electrocuted himself by biting

754
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,500
through the wire while mending the headphones on his TV.

755
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,180
Well, friends, sometimes there just is no slack.

756
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,700
Monkey business here.

757
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:38,020
The Saudi Oka newspaper reported on 27th of July, that the Saudi government had been

758
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:38,020


759
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:45,240
March 1988 that a man driving to work in the Kamis Mesheet region ran over one of a troop

760
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:50,860
of monkeys roaming the southern desert. When the remaining monkeys spotted his car on his

761
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:58,660
return journey, they jumped on it and smashed the windows with their fists. About 60 monkeys

762
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:04,420
attacked joggers and visitors wearing yellow in the Binang Botanical Gardens the day after

763
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:10,140
a youth wearing a yellow shirt had stoned a young monkey to death and taunted others.

764
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:16,040
There are about 350 monkeys in the gardens about 180 miles northwest of Kuala Lumpur,

765
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:23,480
Malaysia, which is itself about 400 miles north by west-east of Dobstown, Malaysia.

766
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:29,440
Dear friends, where you, after you send in your love offerings and join the Church of the

767
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,400
Subgenius, you can be sent to the jungle encampment in far-off Exile,

768
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:34,400


769
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:34,400


770
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:43,400
exotic Malaysia, where the sacred rituals of acubating and glandscaping will be applied

771
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:53,020
to your cranium, essentially, which will begin you on your long journey to over-manhood so

772
00:35:53,020 --> 00:36:00,000
that you will be ripe for the plucking come X-Day when the men from Planet X come down

773
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,460
in their prophesied saucers.

774
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,380
And, uh...

775
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:12,640
Save we subgeniuses while blasting and frying the pinks, the normals, so that we may sit

776
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:23,160
at the great view screens of the sex vessels of the X-Men and sex goddesses watching the

777
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,300
pinks fry in their own fat like pieces of bacon.

778
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,100
Wait a minute.

779
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,380
That wasn't people frying in their own fat like pieces of bacon.

780
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:34,380


781
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:34,380


782
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:49,180
That was plain food you would have come across in India.

783
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,500
I just liked the reality.

784
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,620
Mutual produce!

785
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:57,260


786
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,580
greatiano!

787
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,000

788
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,580
That's the bacon проб.

00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:04,360


790
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:04,360

Bye.

804
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:03,920
I'll remind you, you're listening to the subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack.

805
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,540
Originating here at K-N-O-N.

806
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:18,080
Also in the news, street gang invades motionless world of Earth-6.

807
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:23,100
The weird street gang that goes about randomly improving things invaded a neighborhood,

808
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,200
in the nearby Earth plane 6.

809
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,800
Gang members now numbering in the thousands, repaired cars, built fences, painted houses,

810
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:34,580
and left presents for children and the elderly, in a rampant display of kindness and charity.

811
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,980
I don't know why we do it, said Leopold Warner, gang member.

812
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,180
It just happens.

813
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,960
Several gang members were arrested because no one is supposed to be moving in the Earth-6

814
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,240
area due to the anti-time, anti-change bill passed there a few months ago, local time.

815
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,340
I can't figure it out, said an Earth-6 member.

816
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:57,520
Policeman contacted later this week by resident psychic Tasmirila Dingus.

817
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,100
We're arresting the good guys for moving.

818
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,580
They're supposed to move.

819
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:06,620
Gang leaders vowed to continue their rampage until all members have had their fill of constructive

820
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,120
acts.

821
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:12,180
I don't want it to sound like we're doing this for the sake of some old bitties and

822
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,280
children we don't even know.

823
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:18,640
I want to make it perfectly clear that we strike randomly and for unfathomable personal

824
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,320
reasons, Warner concluded.

825
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:31,420
Well, there's just three things I know.

826
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:42,120
Well, the sky won't always be gold.

827
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:48,180
And there's people outside trying to fool you.

828
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,840
But there's three things I know.

829
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,340
One, I'm not a fool.

830
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:53,340


831
00:41:53,360 --> 00:42:00,980
Two, because no one else when this אםor is a fool.

832
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:12,020
Three, I'm just a man.

833
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:16,360
Oh, praise Bob.

834
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,980
That was Gordon Truby.

835
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,060
And here is...

00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,180

00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,100
Disgusting swinging love courses.

850
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:46,920
Actually that was Ray Hay, only Ray Hay, a solo effort, that's why he can't understand the words too well.

851
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:50,020
And also why I'm gonna, I just realized why I really like Ray Hay.

852
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,200
We've developed a theme tonight.

853
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:59,000
All of a sudden, I've got, a few weeks back we were playing copies of Papa Prell's show.

854
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:06,180
Papa Prell is a cantankerous talk show host, you might say, in Stanford, California.

855
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:12,000
And I think this is 15 minutes so we'll barely be able to fit it all in.

856
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:15,540
In fact I may continue some of it next time.

857
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,960
It's hard to fit it all in sometimes, friends.

858
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:26,460
This is, this particular Prell show is not the kind of thing that you would hear on say, Oh Varied Voices, the show preceding ours.

859
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:33,300
In fact we might get in a lot of trouble for playing it, but well this friends is Papa Prell.

860
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:39,040
But I'm gonna get that down so that you can hear the lovely theme music as it comes in.

861
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,160
Praise Bob.

864
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,820
Hello out there in radio land.

865
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,020
It's time once more for another exciting installment of the Papa Prell show.

866
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:06,040
Tonight yours truly Papa Prell uses Mama Bell to call up a controversy over the phone, over the air.

867
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:09,060
I've got William Russell Gardner on the horn with me now.

868
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,440
Mr. Gardner has just written a book called The Wall.

869
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,960
And it's about the battle of the sexes, a battle he says the men are losing.

870
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,680
There ain't no doubt about that.

871
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,240
Could you elaborate on that some?

872
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:25,760
Well you know the statistics are is that they're, you know they're filing for over 60% of all the divorces in this country.

873
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,220
And they're the ones that are leaving the nest.

874
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:34,560
Men are seeking therapy, trying to hang on those.

875
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:41,420
You know another stat is, is that men continue holding on until the torch begins to burn.

876
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:42,280
And that's to burn his fingers.

877
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,000
Oh really?

878
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,200
Well you, you are a divorcer yourself aren't you?

879
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:47,400
Yes sir I am.

880
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,080
So some of this is personal experience.

881
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,540
Yes sir it is.

882
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,560
Is that what inspired you to write this book?

883
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:57,020
That's part of it and the other part is that the good Lord inspired me.

884
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:00,500
He's going to put a stop to this divorce epidemic.

885
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:05,780
And you know he's anti-divorce, he's anti-women's lib.

886
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,220
And how he's going to do it I don't know.

887
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,400
I don't know whether he's going to accomplish it through the act.

888
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:13,200
AIDS or through my book or what.

889
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,420
But it's like good housekeeping says.

890
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:20,020
It says that women are coming back and they, back and down.

891
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,560
And they call it the biggest movement since the 1960's.

892
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:24,060
Oh really?

893
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:27,880
Well you know it's interesting you bring up the Lord because I mean that's where this all starts.

894
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:32,300
Is at the altar and people make a promise to stay bound together till death do them part.

895
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:36,960
Now where did exactly, historically speaking, do you know where divorce came along?

896
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,400
And where they started unraveling this knot that was supposed to be there?

897
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:42,780
Supposedly that men would not undo?

898
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,280
Well it started actually in the Garden of Eden.

899
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:49,140
That where Satan interceded in this thing.

900
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:53,900
And then the lawyers followed suit.

901
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:54,840
That's right.

902
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,340
Well you know that's a pretty good analogy.

903
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,640
I could think, I know of a lot of lawyers that remind me of snakes let me tell you.

904
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,000
I guarantee you.

905
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,060
Boy you got the right, you hit the nail right on top of the head.

906
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:11,400
It says once upon a time courting was what you did at the start of the war.

907
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:11,660
It was a relationship.

908
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:16,180
Today court is where you go at the end of it.

909
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,080
I like that.

910
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,740
It's absolutely true.

911
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:26,800
And what about like out here in California they split the, I guess what's it called, the Commonwealth State?

912
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:29,440
Where they split everything you have right on down the middle.

913
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,060
It doesn't matter if you're a multi-millionaire before you get married.

914
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,980
Once you get divorced half of your estate goes to the woman.

915
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:35,800
That's true.

916
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,260
Now I don't know what it's like down there in Georgia.

917
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,560
Is that where you call, where you are now in Atlanta right?

918
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,380
Yes it well you know you have to look at it.

919
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:48,960
You know a half of a half of a half of a half is like the man that had been divorced two times.

920
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:53,100
And his friend tried to you know comfort him and said don't worry John.

921
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,020
He said there's still plenty of fish in the sea.

922
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:58,380
He said yes I know but the last one took all of my bait.

923
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,480
Oh boy I hadn't heard that one before.

924
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:07,860
And you know if you keep cutting down like you say you got a million dollars she don't have anything.

925
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:10,540
If she goes and marries you that's a million dollars.

926
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:13,800
And that's a good way of getting five hundred thousand dollars.

927
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,240
Uh huh.

928
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:20,000
And so then she'll go on to the next one and get a couple hundred thousand and on and on and on.

929
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:26,100
And you know after a man has two or three divorces he don't have you know a half of a half of a half.

930
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,520
If you keep you know the more the divorce is the less the percentage.

931
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,180
Uh huh.

932
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:37,820
Well you know my first son who died bless his soul had a wife that divorced him that just was always taking him to the cleaners.

933
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,520
And even before they got divorced she was always just running around.

934
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,300
Running up these gargantuan bills.

935
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,280
Uh huh.

936
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:46,220
Even my last wife spent my money like there was no tomorrow.

937
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:50,220
Well actually in her case there wasn't she died of an insulin overdose.

938
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,240
And not a moment too soon let me tell you.

939
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,380
I was at the end of my financial rope.

940
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:54,960
Yep.

941
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,700
And then there was her funeral bills.

942
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:00,760
I said just plant it in a pine box but the loss is you have to stuff them first.

943
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:03,740
So I say fine stuff in the flames cremate her.

944
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,820
But no the loss is you still have to embalm her.

945
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:07,800
What a rip off.

946
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:09,560
If I knew funerals were so expensive.

947
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,080
I would have divorced her first.

948
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,800
But then of course no telling what the course would have done.

949
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,860
What sort of legal precautions can a man take to be safe to marry these days?

950
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,800
Prenuptial agreements what do you recommend?

951
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:28,200
Well I think that the man needs to look at this thing in a realistic way.

952
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,700
In a rational way.

953
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:34,300
And he needs to take steps to protect himself.

954
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:35,000
Uh huh.

955
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,960
Prenuptial agreement is a good deal today.

956
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:38,980
Uh huh.

957
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:50,960
And he needs to you know the thought that a woman is pure innocent and is going to be submissive and secondary for all of her life is a farce.

958
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:51,460
It's a lie.

959
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:52,260
Uh huh.

960
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:55,160
And chances are a divorce is going to get you.

961
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,820
And she's going to get all she can.

962
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:03,020
So he needs to protect himself before he goes into this marriage bit.

963
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:03,640
Uh huh.

964
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,600
Even if she is you know best friends now.

965
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,840
I mean you get him in a court there with a vampire lawyer in between you.

966
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,700
It's not going to matter if you are best friends or not I guess.

967
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,240
I guarantee you.

968
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,740
What about trial marriages?

969
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,980
Do you think they're a good idea or where does this fit in or does it?

970
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:24,760
No I you know the thing about it is they women want more.

971
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:26,720
You know they want money.

972
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,880
They want to be independent.

973
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:29,940
They want to call their own shots.

974
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:30,520
Uh huh.

975
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:34,980
And to have this freedom and independence they need money.

976
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:35,780
Uh huh.

977
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,540
And money to them means power.

978
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:45,580
And uh and they'll they'll use their uh their sex appeal their bodies to get promotions

979
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:52,300
to get jobs and uh to lure men and then divorce him and get half of what he's got.

980
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:56,080
And so that's the way they go ahead today and make their way through life.

981
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,580
Well you know it seems a little bit unfair when you stop and think about it.

982
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:04,580
They've got affirmative action to uh make sure that the same number of women are hired as men.

983
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,700
And yet men can't live off their spouses.

984
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:14,020
And yet if you're a wife you can you know that let's just say 50% of the women don't get jobs and don't want jobs.

985
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:26,620
The other 50% are basically guaranteed by the government because they have double the uh uh well the employers uh want them so much more because half of their workforce is staying married and living off their husbands.

986
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:27,420
That's true.

987
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:33,900
So I you know it's it sure seems like an unfair bias to me but I I don't know exactly where these politicians are coming from.

988
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:37,420
Is there you think that special lobbying efforts are having an effect on this?

989
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:37,680
Uh what do you think?

990
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:48,720
Sure I think that uh well Women's Live you know they've been in existence uh you know in 1987 they celebrated their 20th anniversary to get the Equal Rights Amendment ratified.

991
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:55,920
And it's like the woman down here wrote in a newspaper a female lawyer she said Women's Live has created a generation of wimps.

992
00:52:56,780 --> 00:53:01,180
Men or males I don't call them men but I say males have become wimps.

993
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,620
You know you don't hear men speak up like you and I are speaking up.

994
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:05,980
They're afraid.

995
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:06,980
They're scared.

996
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:07,680
You know they're scared.

997
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:08,780
You know they're they're they're scared.

998
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:17,220
And they're afraid that they're that they're gonna lose it all you know the government says you have to hire so many women especially if you get government contracts.

999
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:17,900
Uh huh.

1000
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,820
And you have to promote so many.

1001
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:24,820
And if you think that the government's one out of five employees you should see who has government contracts.

1002
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,840
It's much larger than a fifth of the of the business out there.

1003
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,480
Everyone and their brothers got some sort of money coming in from the government.

1004
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:33,040
Yeah.

1005
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:34,380
It is the biggest employer.

1006
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:35,080
Yeah.

1007
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,300
Well and these women know today.

1008
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:41,640
They know you know divorce lawyers has increased over 100 percent since 1980.

1009
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:42,500
Really.

1010
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,400
And you know they're out there.

1011
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:50,280
What 20 30 years ago when my wife divorced me you couldn't hardly find a divorce lawyer.

1012
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:50,780
Uh huh.

1013
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,080
How long were you all married.

1014
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,580
I see your statistic here is six point nine years.

1015
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:56,880
Did you make it that long.

1016
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,240
Yeah I made it.

1017
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,340
I made it 10 years.

1018
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,180
Ten years.

1019
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:06,920
Boy that's a by that time you probably had a home all built up and a couple of cars and property and investments.

1020
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:07,600
Yeah.

1021
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:13,340
But you know she knew that their law you told her don't worry the law is on your side.

1022
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,000
You're going to get it all.

1023
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:16,180
So don't worry.

1024
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:21,280
And it just makes a woman a two fold child of hell that she was to begin with.

1025
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,240
So she took the house and left you with the car.

1026
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:28,800
Well she took the house and the new car and the kids and left me with the bills and the old car.

1027
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,120
Oh boy.

1028
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,220
What would you do as a job there.

1029
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,720
Was it like she was unemployed and you you had a job.

1030
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:36,900
Is that how they figured that out or what.

1031
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:36,900


1032
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,460
Oh no she was working making good money.

1033
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:40,640
Holy moly.

1034
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,020
But they don't care today.

1035
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:50,620
That's what I'm saying that the government and this women's labor you know I never thought that women's labor had made so much of an inroads into society.

1036
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,060
Well it was actually on the offensive.

1037
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,120
Yeah.

1038
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,820
And it's time for men to take customs last stand.

1039
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:58,940
This is our last stand.

1040
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:04,020
And we'll stand up and be men and tell the government what we want.

1041
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,200
We want our rights back.

1042
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,880
We want our God given freedom.

1043
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:06,880


1044
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:09,780
We want our position as head and authority of the household.

1045
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,860
I'll tell you in the next 10 years we're going to be pushed right off the face of the earth.

1046
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,880
Well I like that analogy of Custer's last stand.

1047
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,220
You know it's it's a lot more lethal than Cupid's here I could tell you.

1048
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:25,580
Well I think people only need to look around to see you know that you're not exaggerating too much.

1049
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:35,980
Out here even if you didn't contribute to the husband's education if he if you help him get through college or whatever whatever his position is after following it.

1050
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:42,240
Not only do you get half of the wealth that you have when you divorced but you get half of his income afterwards.

1051
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:51,180
Like if he becomes a doctor and you put him you or his wife during the time that he went through medical school you get half of his income afterwards as well whether there's children or not.

1052
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:58,060
Well it's strange you mention I mentioned one case in my book is about a woman that divorced her husband.

1053
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:05,120
He was going to school to be a doctor and she got a hundred and eighty thousand dollar settlement and she got forty thousand dollars a year.

1054
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,500
Holy mackerel.

1055
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:10,540
A bank you only pay back the education loans at nine percent.

1056
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:17,000
If they had that sort of deal where they make you a loan and put you through college and then you owe them half of the money that you earn for the rest of your life.

1057
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:19,240
I can guarantee you there'd be a lot more banks around.

1058
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,040
That's true.

1059
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,780
You wouldn't see these SNLs going under.

1060
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:22,540
That's true.

1061
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:24,020
My goodness.

1062
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:26,660
Well thank God I have met a man like you.

1063
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,860
I didn't know that they existed any other than me.

1064
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,380
Well you know it scares me when I stop and think about it.

1065
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:35,100
You know if there's such wimps out there now when in a divorce situation.

1066
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:35,100


1067
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:38,080
Of course where are they going to be out there on the battlefield if we ever get involved in a war.

1068
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:42,840
You know it's funny because the ERA wanted equal rights in every regard.

1069
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:50,260
But when it came time for the draft then they started saying oh no well we don't think anyone should be drafted and we certainly don't think women should be.

1070
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,120
That's true.

1071
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:55,920
I always said that equal rights end when the dinner check arrives.

1072
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:56,700
Oh really.

1073
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:59,020
I like that one too.

1074
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:01,220
Boy I wish I had called you sooner.

1075
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,060
Yeah I was a little bit worried there too.

1076
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:03,540
But you know.

1077
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:07,420
Just because we're recognizing the problem isn't going to solve it.

1078
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:12,640
Do you see any steps that the average individual can make in order to head off this problem?

1079
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:15,380
Well it's going to be hard.

1080
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:15,980
Uh huh.

1081
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:22,280
And you know women are going to the Bible says for a woman to take a secondary and subordinate position.

1082
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,800
And that's the only way it's going to work.

1083
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:30,540
The problem in the last 20 years women's lives has come in.

1084
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:31,500
It's run its course.

1085
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,780
It's degenerating.

1086
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:42,460
And hopefully that God is interceding and talking to these women saying you know maybe they're realizing that hey this is not where it's at.

1087
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,800
I've had it all out here in the business world.

1088
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:45,240
Uh huh.

1089
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,580
And I'm still not happy.

1090
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:47,220
Uh huh.

1091
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:53,380
I want a husband, a family, kids and I want to find myself again.

1092
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:57,360
Well old Papa Prel she knows how to pick them.

1093
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:01,420
What you mean in subgenius church women have equal rights too?

1094
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:04,080
Oh I'm going to be in that case I'm going to be a Christian.

1095
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:05,360
Oh ho ho ho.

1096
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:12,360
Well uh uh yeah Papa Prel there from Stanford.

1097
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,220
I don't know how he does it.

1098
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:16,600
Oh if that guy only knew.

1099
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:19,980
Well friends we got to move out of here pretty quick like.

1100
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:23,020
Actually I'm going to put in this just to scare you.

1101
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:28,700
Ahhhh.

1102
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:44,600
The Gyuto Monks friends and what they're saying in Japanese is you can get free information about Bob Dubs and the church of the subgenius with a simple 25 cent stamp.

1103
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:52,120
And a postcard or anything sent to the number I'm about to give so get them pencils ready.

1104
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,420
You can reach Bob.

1105
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:58,680
And you don't even you don't actually have to.

1106
00:58:58,680 --> 00:58:59,960
You don't even have to put a stamp on it.

1107
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,780
Just sit on the letter for a while rub it around inside your pants and just drop it ma'am.

1108
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,800
Envelope drop it in the mail box and thank Bob.

Oh yeah.

1140
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:40,320
When did you start learning your English language.

1141
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:40,320


1142
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:40,320


1143
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:40,320


1144
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:40,320


1145
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:40,320
