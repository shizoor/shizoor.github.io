1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
Answer every one of your prayers.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,120
And I said, come on, Bob.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,360
There are a lot of my prayers that go unanswered.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,640
He said, no, he will answer every one of your prayers.

5
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,080
The first answer he gives you is the one that you don't want to hear.

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,820
The Self-Genius Hour of Swatch.

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,080
If you are having fun, then you are sinning, you heathen.

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,900
Pleasure is the root of all evil.

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,160
Here, Satan's also known as Bid to capture your soul.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,940
Do I have to swallow my gun and blow my head off to get you heathens to listen?

11
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,180
The Lord God Almighty is great and should be feared.

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,320
Christ would do a double flip over his cross.

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,520
Lust for death.

14
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,340
Fear is wrath.

15
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,220
Fear for love.

16
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:39,960
Fear pleasure.

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,660
You police, men must stop beating and butt-raping these young black youths.

18
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:44,760
You swine heathens.

19
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,980
Chopping down weeds and burning them in satanic rituals.

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,300
Satanic power rituals.

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,060
Lust of power, the evil seed.

22
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,240
Poor huddled masses.

23
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,040
We will save you wretched from your death.

24
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:53,700
Your life.

25
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,140
Your death.

26
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,920
You are listening.

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,440
To the church of the new faith.

28
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,640
Send money.

29
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,160
P.O. Box 9152.

30
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,860
Virginia Beach, Virginia.

31
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,920
2-3-4-5-0.

32
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:21,180
By any chance you would make a mistake to try to come in and take any one of us.

33
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,400
We will not let you.

34
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,340
You will die.

35
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,140
You will have to take anybody over all of our dead bodies.

36
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:27,980
Stay away.

37
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,340
I now exercise the full country spirit.

38
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,480
Stay away.

39
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,040
I now exercise the full country spirit.

40
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,680
I will take my own family and then take my own life and become God.

41
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,380
Son of you need your religious doctrine ripped out of your brain.

42
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,280
All across the country there's people just like you.

43
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,320
Set out to destroy human life.

44
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,320
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now that they are who they are.

45
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,420
Are there other cults in America with tragic potential?

46
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,940
She loved a puttin' on you.

47
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,480
She loved a puttin' on you.

48
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,660
She loved a puttin' on you.

49
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,280
She loved a puttin' on you.

50
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,240
Heal my toe, honey.

51
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,280
Heal my back.

52
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,280
Heal my bottom.

53
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,220
But don't you heal my mind, because my mind is too sick.

54
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,800
Sex, violence, suicide, and Satanism.

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,200
And I pray to God that you stay away.

56
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,400
I now exercise the most unseen spirit.

57
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,880
Stay away.

58
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:27,620
Stay away.

59
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,660
For God's sake, let's get on with it.

60
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,180
We've lived.

61
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,000
We've lived.

62
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,600
There's no other people who've lived and loved.

63
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,900
We've had as much of this world as you're gonna get.

64
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,380
Let's just be done with it.

65
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,920
Let's be done with the agony of it.

66
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,440
I got me some big plans.

67
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,860
And it doesn't matter how guilty you may seem.

68
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,680
How many terrible things you may have done.

69
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,040
Jesus Christ says, come with me.

70
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,240
Come with me.

71
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,240
How guilty you may seem.

72
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:01,960
Stay away.

73
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,260
I have my own life.

74
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,120
He broke your friend.

75
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,100
I don't wanna be.

76
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,180
I don't wanna be.

77
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:07,240
I don't wanna be.

78
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:07,860
Stay away.

79
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,240
I have my own life.

80
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,080
I broke your friend.

81
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,160
He was a sacrifice.

82
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,260
I wished to murder three million people with my own dirt.

83
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,200
I now exercise the most unseen spirit.

84
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,940
You did call up the only one who's not in danger.

85
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,020
I know.

86
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,660
I know.

87
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,760
I know.

88
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,140
I know.

89
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,140


90
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,140


91
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,140


92
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,140


93
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,140


94
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,140


95
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,140


96
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,140


97
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,140


98
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,200
I know.

99
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:40,560
You and I get mad.

100
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:40,560


101
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,500
We're just playing so fuck whoever got him.

102
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,420
If you said you wanted to kill me, you never will.

103
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:44,420


104
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:44,460
I'm not nitpicking, I swear.

105
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:44,560
I don't know why Quick and Sarah left.

106
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:44,560


107
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:44,940
Jay lived in San Francisco two years ago.

108
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:44,940


109
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:44,940


110
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:44,940


111
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:44,940


112
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,960
recognise where this is.

113
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,480
shin Swiss.

114
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,000
If you use sheeps.

115
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,000


116
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,000


117
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,680
Tell me about the dragon.

118
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:53,980
Yeah.

119
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,800
It stems from malaria.

120
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,120
Uh, lay this stone down.

121
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,620
on the Illuminati.

122
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,340
As with Adolf Hitler.

123
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,540
Can anybody tell me what's wrong with this picture?

124
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,500
The Negroids in New York City.

125
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,540
Yeah, well, hey, I'm really sorry.

126
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,060
On the Illuminati.

127
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:16,940
Think about it.

128
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,420
The Negroids in New York City.

129
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,960
Well, it's also flapping after a Jew there.

130
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,160
The Negroids in New York City.

131
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,280
All you prove, you freakos,

132
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,220
is that you all belong in a padded cell.

133
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:37,660
What do you mean?

134
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,860
The Rosicrucians, the Great White Brotherhood,

135
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,920
the High Secret Orders.

136
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,900
Hitler, you shall be in this.

137
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,000
You must have faith.

138
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,920
Faith and power, secret power.

139
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,120
Men who guard the trust from the deepest inside

140
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,000
of the Watchmaker Corridor.

141
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,280
Men who are one club, chained together by one purpose,

142
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:54,780
one idea.

143
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,100
The mankind's champions.

144
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,500
And the new Polacks are meetin'.

145
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,140
Flapping after Jews there.

146
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,560
Oh, Savior, how great is the day?

147
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,300
Oh, Savior, how great is the day?

148
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,740
Can anybody tell me what's wrong with this picture?

149
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,500
There ain't a chicken shack or a rib joint within miles.

150
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,980
What are the implications of all this, Phil?

151
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,400
The Jews control the prayer block, Moe.

152
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,700
Yeah, well, hey, I'm really sorry.

153
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,060
God had him on the way.

154
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,960
God had him on the way.

155
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,580
They had him on the way to march down the street to the graveyard.

156
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:36,880
No.

157
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,140
Disgusting vermin came out of the closet.

158
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,840
They came out of the closet, out into the open.

159
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,680
They marched down the street, but they didn't know it.

160
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,480
But God had him on the way to march down the street to the graveyard.

161
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:52,800
Lord.

162
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,520
May.

163
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,140
You give.

164
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,140


165
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,140


166
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,140


167
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,560
Now, Lord, now, Lord, now, Lord.

168
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:11,060
When praying days are over on the other side of the river.

169
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,280
Yeah.

170
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,040
Receive it on the last step.

171
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,560
In Jesus' name we pray.

172
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,500
In Jesus' name we pray.

173
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,380
In Jesus' name we pray.

174
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,720
Think about it.

175
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,520
Oh, yes, praise Bob, dear friends.

176
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,100
What an amazing couple of mixes there.

177
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,400
Well, actually, first we heard from Church of New Faith.

178
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,420
And then we heard from, well, those two?

179
00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:01,080
Two musical, semi-musical, lovely mixes there were indeed by Brain Rot West

180
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,740
from their cassette Radio Shorts.

181
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,480
One of their Radio Shorts cassettes,

182
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,160
which includes Apocalypse Now, the opera,

183
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,220
and The Totally Realistic Children.

184
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,520
I'm going to give their address for information about Radio Shorts.

185
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,960
Dear friends, please write to

186
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,000
got that pencil ready?

187
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:31,980
Wes Jenkins at 2935 Van Ness Avenue.

188
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:37,020
That's 2935 Van Ness Avenue, number nine.

189
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:44,440
In San Francisco, California, 94109.

190
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,380
94109.

191
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,900
2935 Van Ness Avenue, number nine.

192
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,000
In San Francisco.

193
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,940
In San Francisco.

194
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,820
I now realize that I was walking up and down

195
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,780
and probably right past their place

196
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,680
shuffling mindlessly with no sleep at all

197
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,300
while going to and from the layout place

198
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,920
and the linotype place

199
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,520
while working on our new subgenius book, Revelation X,

200
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:13,960
which should be due to hit the world around November 18th.

201
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,440
And yes, dear friends, you are listening once again

202
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,300
to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack,

203
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,780
that great umbrella of mutation,

204
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,020
which may contain such things as Church of New Faith

205
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,160
and Radio Shorts, Brainwashed West,

206
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,320
and the Swingin' Love Corpses and the Doctors for Bob

207
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,500
and the Word of Bob and tonight,

208
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,840
some more news of the weird

209
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,960
from Chuck Shepard's wonderful newsletter.

210
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,320
And I think I'll start with this bit of news

211
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,320
from the continuing crisis.

212
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,760
Friends, in November, Dr. Avi Ben-Abraham,

213
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,220
president of the American Cryogenic Society,

214
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,760
told an audience in Washington,

215
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,840
D.C. that several high-ranking Roman Catholic church leaders

216
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,800
support human embryo cloning

217
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,140
despite the church's public stance against such research.

218
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,220
According to Ben-Abraham,

219
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,200
those church leaders hope to reproduce Jesus Christ

220
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,360
from DNA fibers found on the Shroud of Turin.

221
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,540
Well, I think that's a notice like Jurassic Park,

222
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,400
you know, reweave the DNA and bring them right back to life.

223
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,280
But what if it isn't?

224
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,320
Jesus, my friends, they haven't ascertained.

225
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,140
Last I heard, it was paint from the 14th century.

226
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,380
But what if they cloned the paint creature,

227
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,700
whatever weird prehistoric warthog the blood was taken from

228
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,380
to make that paint?

229
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,260
Or what if it wasn't?

230
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,560
What if it's a recent hoax?

231
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,740
What if it is the blood of none other than Adolf Hitler?

232
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,800
As that very fact is described in our book,

233
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,180
Three-Fisted Tales of Bob, a Nenslow theory there.

234
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,060
Anyway, back to news of the weird.

235
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,580
Interviewed by Mother Jones,

236
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:58,500
William Stickney, a director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency

237
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,160
under President Bush,

238
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,720
revealed that their nuclear disaster plans

239
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,340
called for the evacuation of Congress and top government officials,

240
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,880
but not him.

241
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,260
He said he would have been among those expected to be,

242
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,360
in the Federal Emergency Management Agency's term,

243
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,900
cindered.

244
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,740
In May, at a cable news network conference,

245
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,560
on the impact of TV on indigenous peoples,

246
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:29,300
the Ted Turner-owned World Championship Wrestling Organization,

247
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,740
whose TV programs are beamed worldwide,

248
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,760
was criticized by a Malaysian tribal spokesman.

249
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,900
Our value system has changed,

250
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:43,340
said Anderson Mutang Urud, a Sarawak Indian,

251
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,720
in that young people no longer revere their elders,

252
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,640
but rather revere Ted Turner wrestlers,

253
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,600
such as...

254
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,200
Nature Boy Rick Flair.

255
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,360
Yes, friends, Nature Boy Rick Flair becomes

256
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,280
the new god of the Sarawak Indians.

257
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,000
Sad but true.

258
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,380
Oh, let's listen to this little Wendy Carlos piece.

259
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,820
I think this is the part I love so much of the building of, too.

260
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,800
Oh, no, it's not.

261
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,160
No, it's not. I just realized.

262
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,260
It's a lovely little arpeggio,

263
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,940
but that's not the totally psychedelic part I was thinking of.

264
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,320
Oh, let's say, further news of the weird.

265
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,120
Lead story.

266
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,880
In May, the Michigan Court of Appeals

267
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,240
affirmed a lower court decision dismissing

268
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,560
Richard Overton's $10,000 1991 lawsuit

269
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,300
against Anheuser-Busch for false advertising.

270
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,100
Overton, the overman,

271
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,020
said he suffered physical and mental injury

272
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,200
and emotional distress

273
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,240
because the implicit problem of the law was that he was a man.

274
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,240


275
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,240


276
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,240


277
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,040
I wonder if these promises in the company's advertisements,

278
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,220
especially of success with women,

279
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,780
did not come true for him when he drank their product.

280
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,420
And besides that,

281
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,760
he sometimes got sick when he drank.

282
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,320
Well, now come on, pal.

283
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,960
Sure, it's a, you know,

284
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,580
I mean, it's a narcotic drug

285
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,240
dispensed by the conspiracy

286
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,140
to make us all stupid

287
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,040
and quit complaining about their crimes.

288
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,520
But, you know, I mean,

289
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,220
you ought to believe that.

290
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,780
be sued for believing the advertising.

291
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:28,480
In May, Dayton, Ohio government officials warned the Spirit of Life Christian Center

292
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:34,520
that its upcoming immoral book burning ceremony could not take place because its municipal

293
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:42,460
pollution control permit allowed it to burn only clean, dry wood, and not filthy, wet

294
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,120
pornography, or rock and roll albums.

295
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:52,580
According to statistics compiled by the Los Angeles Daily News, 46% of convicted sex offenders

296
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:59,000
in California, including 20% of convicted rapists, never spend a day in prison.

297
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:04,900
They either get probation or to terms of less than a year in county jails.

298
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:10,000
The average prison term for the other 54% of sex offenders is three and a half years.

299
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,720
Is it worth it, man?

300
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,040
In April, officials at the Sedgwick County

301
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:24,340
Zoo in Wichita, Kansas, asked the city to remove a fire hydrant from the yard in which

302
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,040
its camel, Tomolock, is housed.

303
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:32,900
They had to get rid of the fire hydrant because the camel's would-be mate died last year,

304
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:39,740
and Tomolock has turned his affections to the hydrant, rubbing against it vigorously

305
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,040
at all hours, said keeper Julie Fritt.

306
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,360
If it's during public hours, I just go hide somewhere.

307
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,780
What can I say?

308
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,240
The camel doesn't have a life.

309
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:01,640
And John Luckett, age 70, did not luck it out when he collapsed and died of a heart

310
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:07,420
attack after too vigorously heckling gun control activist Sarah Brady during her speech in

311
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:07,600
Ohio.

312
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,460
Yeah, guns don't kill people.

313
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,900
Heart attacks...

314
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,240
Dur...

315
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,640
Uh...

316
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,300
Vigorous heckling gun control activists kills people.

317
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,360
And that's from News of the Weird.

318
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,380
Actually, I've got some more wonderful News of the Weird coming up, but I'll go ahead

319
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,100
and give their address.

320
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,160
You should write for information from Chuck Shepherd, P.O.

321
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,780
Box 8306.

322
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,140
That's Box 8306, St. Petersburg, Florida.

323
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:40,820
33738.

324
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,220
That's it once again in St. Petersburg, Florida.

325
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,120
33738.

326
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:53,820
And I've got some wonderful stuff to read to you later from The Jewel in the Lotus,

327
00:14:54,180 --> 00:15:02,220
a fantastic history of sexual practices in the Middle East and the mysterious Orient

328
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,860
during the pre... well, before the turn of the century.

329
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,860
Oh, here... this is so pretty coming up in here.

330
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,200
Now, put your headphones on and you'll be able to hear the sound of the music.

331
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,200


332
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,720
And you'll hear a giant wheel spinning around your head.

333
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,600
That's just a turn of music playing.

334
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,960
I think that's the buzz you want.

335
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:30,960


336
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,040
Whew...

337
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,580
How do you feel?

338
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:31,580


339
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:31,580


340
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:31,580


341
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:31,580


342
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,000
No, that's not what I mean...

343
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,000


344
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,000


345
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,000


346
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,000


347
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,160
spinning around your head.

348
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,780
Kudos to these uwu comics.

349
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:35,780


350
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:35,780


351
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:40,420
But you can't 일 onto the trip threatening our lives, I don't think.

352
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,100
I heard a took Fli Sic Rabakali

353
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,180
You can play.

354
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,220
Thank you.

355
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,600
Thank you.

356
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,480
Thank you.

357
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,260
Thank you.

358
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,220
Thank you.

359
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,280
Thank you.

360
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,240
Thank you.

361
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,300
Thank you.

362
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,280
seeking dogs, though they don't know why.

363
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,100
They don't know why.

364
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,740
So if you like to gamble,

365
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,900
come take a little ramble.

366
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,020
Just step right up and

367
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,480
tell me I'm your man.

368
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,380
Gonna be with you in Bobstown,

369
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,420
in Sidney and all his dobs down.

370
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,960
When we all go down,

371
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,100
down in subgenius land.

372
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,180
Hurry, hurry.

373
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,820
Ladies and gentlemen, come to the

374
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,960
subgenius land carnival of grotesques

375
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,760
and oddities for one time.

376
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,620
Ten cents, one thin

377
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,440
tenth part of a dollar admission to the

378
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,400
cage of kids. You will see

379
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,640
two-ton Tessie, the ugliest thing on the

380
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,520
midway, see her twirl her

381
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,380
tassels. Grown men, blanch,

382
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,480
and young boys lose the

383
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,360
desire to continue with puberty when

384
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,200
this horrific sight of nature is revealed.

385
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,340
Oh, my.

386
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,580
Hey, that's my butt.

387
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,340
Billy, you are not going in there.

388
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,920
Come away right now.

389
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,040
Oh, but it looks me,

390
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,240
the in person. I want to see

391
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,360
you.

392
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,680
I don't care to tell.

393
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,580
I want to see you, the two-headed snake, Aunt Bertha.

394
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,440
Now, boys, you know

395
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,760
that it says in the Bible,

396
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,480
he who lookest upon the two-headed

397
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,040
geek becomes himself

398
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,740
a horrible freak.

399
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,620
One of us, one of us, one of us,

400
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,320
one of us.

401
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:01,860
And so,

402
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,540
Aunt Bertha and the children left

403
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,660
the fairgrounds, sadder,

404
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,720
but perhaps a little wiser.

405
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,460
For they understood

406
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,400
that Jehovah

407
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,680
won in his majesty

408
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,380
and put the carnival there in the first

409
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,180
place just to teach

410
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,240
them that lesson.

411
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,380
I hope you

412
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,100
like this story, boys and girls.

413
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,180
If you would like a free picture

414
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,280
of me in the buff or in

415
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,700
a compromising position,

416
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,200
write to Aunt

417
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,600
Bertha,

418
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,060
Dial A. Rubab,

419
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,900
Box 17,

420
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,940
Grand Dragon,

421
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,480
Ku Klux Klan.

422
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,380
Good luck.

423
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,040
Goodbye now.

424
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,460
She has been locked in the attic.

425
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,440
I'm being tortured.

426
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,740
Folks, the Aunt Bertha program

427
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,000
is brought to you by your donations and interest.

428
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,600
We couldn't do it without you.

429
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,460
Remember, Aunt Bertha herself,

430
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,720
as she looks down from her perch in heaven,

431
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,600
sees everything you do

432
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,340
and knows what is in your secret heart.

433
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,920
That's right, everything.

434
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,200
Guests of Aunt Bertha stay at the

435
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,260
Poshworth Motel.

436
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,360
Not that she can do anything about it,

437
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,880
but she views

438
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,200
all human sin

439
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,820
and clucks

440
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,920
over the predicament

441
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,620
of errant humanity.

442
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,640
Meanwhile, down on Earth,

443
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,060
Uncle Charlie now helms

444
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,460
the Children's Bible Hour.

445
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,160
And Aunt Bertha is only

446
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,040
a fading memory

447
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,580
in the gaps between the stars

448
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,800
and in the starlight

449
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,960
or under the bright rays

450
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,800
of the moon.

451
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,480
Some say

452
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,380
the spirit of Aunt Bertha

453
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,980
floats between heaven and earth

454
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,780
like a cloud,

455
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,300
floating

456
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,940
in the sky

457
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,600
forever.

458
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,400
Aunt Bertha,

459
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:53,940
could you please

460
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,060
thank you,

461
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,600
thank you very much.

462
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,020
Aunt Bertha,

463
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:58,940
you're struggling.

464
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,420
Aunt Bertha,

465
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,300
you're struggling.

466
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,840
Oh, my.

467
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,440
Last call, people.

468
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,120
Last call.

469
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:05,980
Drink up.

470
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,500
Time to go.

471
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,100
It's a silly thing,

472
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:08,940
but she just

473
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,200
keeps coming on.

474
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:10,740
Lights out.

475
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,280
Come on.

476
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:12,920
I'm sorry.

477
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:13,960
I don't make the rules.

478
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,300
No, you may not order again.

479
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,000
Oh, my.

480
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:20,680
Bye-bye.

481
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,340
How sweet.

482
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,580
How sweet it is

483
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,920
to tend the babe

484
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,460
that, uh,

485
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,380
well, um...

486
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,960
You know, I can't really

487
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,880
hear these callers,

488
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,000
but sometimes I wonder

489
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,800
if they have the

490
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,320
best interest

491
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,540
of our program at heart.

492
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,040
Well, we have it at this point.

493
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,560
Ha, ha, ha.

494
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,940
Ha, ha, ha.

495
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,000
Ha, ha, ha.

496
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,980
Ha, ha, ha.

497
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,000
Ha, ha, ha.

498
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,700
Ha, ha, ha.

499
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:47,940
Ha, ha, ha.

500
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:48,220
Ha, ha, ha.

501
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,200
Listen to them laugh

502
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,720
in simple joy.

503
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,100
Ha, ha, ha.

504
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,240
You know,

505
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,780
it is because I,

506
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,460
Dr. Howell,

507
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,420
choose to reveal

508
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,160
to the world

509
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,600
these ukebalaponga

510
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,620
herbal secrets

511
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,080
that my course

512
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,500
in success

513
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,240
in real estate

514
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,020
is possible.

515
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,640
Well, it comes to me

516
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,760
I can eat more fiber

517
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,480
in your diet.

518
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,320
Well, if you just

519
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,240
eat a ball of fiber,

520
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:11,260
you can go to work.

521
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,020
String, what's that?

522
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,560
The other caller is shouting something?

523
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,060
I want to make a million bucks.

524
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,420
There we go.

525
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,300
You want to make a million bucks.

526
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,980
Well, why stop at a million?

527
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,880
How about a billion?

528
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,120
Maybe you'd like 10 million or maybe even 10 billion.

529
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,760
You could be as rich as Ross Perot and Donald Trump.

530
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:34,280
Just jump into this cage with a giant, ferocious, half-starved lion.

531
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,400
Tiger man! Tiger man!

532
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,120
Behind one of these doors, there is a beautiful lady,

533
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,120
and behind the other, a man-eating tiger.

534
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,920
Never get off the boat. Never get off the boat.

535
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Got to remember. Got to remember. Never get off the boat.

536
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:50,900
Your success in real estate and business practices

537
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,120
depends on which door you will choose.

538
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,920
What's that? Buxom woman, don't you usually have buxom women around here?

539
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,520
That's right, but I tell you, it's behind one of the doors,

540
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,300
and there's a slavering, drooling tiger on the other side of this other door.

541
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:04,700
Okay, well, let's see.

542
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,380
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

543
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,360
No, wait, no, don't casually make this important choice.

544
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,360
This is something you need to think about.

545
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:17,580
Oh, dear. Well, he had a tiger in his tank.

546
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,680
I guess you caller who's left,

547
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,280
you realize the other door contains my buxom assistant.

548
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,360
Oh, my God, look at the tiger dragging him around by the eye sockets.

549
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,240
That's really disgusting.

550
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,540
Boy, look at him flop and twitch.

551
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,240
No, tiger.

552
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,740
Tiger just kind of likes to play with him,

553
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,840
and we'll settle down and eat him after a while,

554
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,560
and when he delivers the coup de grace,

555
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,660
the other caller will stop suffering,

556
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,580
and we can go on with...

557
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,220
Oh, gee.

558
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,980
Wow, opened him up like a can of beans.

559
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,080
Oh, good.

560
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,440
Let me out of my gallery now.

561
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,200
And thus it is to all who call

562
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,100
without truth, courage, and justice in their hearts.

563
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,600
For in order to speak on this radio program,

564
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,060
the caller must be equipped with the shield of truth

565
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,020
and the sword of ultimate justice.

566
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,700
Truth decay.

567
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,980
And he must be wrapped in the cape of, uh...

568
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,160
Good sanitary practices.

569
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,060
More death and horror in five minutes.

570
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,800
Hooray.

571
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,600
Hooray.

572
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,940
Hooray.

573
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,580
Hooray.

574
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:04,580


575
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:04,580


576
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:04,580


577
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:04,580


578
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:04,580


579
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:04,580


580
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:04,580


581
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:04,580


582
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:04,580


583
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:04,580


584
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:04,580


585
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:04,580


586
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:04,580


587
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:13,680
Oh, absolutely astounding there from Radio Shorts.

588
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:18,520
Brainrot West, that piece that Wes Jenkins gave us.

589
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,580
Beautiful, dear friends.

590
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,000
I believe we gave their address earlier.

591
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:29,120
And before that, of course, a nice long stretch of Dr. Howell.

592
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,960
How hilariously horrible.

593
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:39,260
Dr. Howell on KPFA in Berkeley.

594
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:41,380
Unbelievable.

595
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,740
And thanks also to his callers.

596
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:52,880
You know, I was listening to that cartoon music sample there by Radio Shorts for the first time.

597
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,520
The same time you were hearing it.

598
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,680
Well, you'll hear it on a tape after me.

599
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,460
But I was hearing it for the first time just now.

600
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,700
And anyway, where are we on the show?

601
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,340
Well, I think actually...

602
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:09,420
It's time probably to whip that out and whip this in.

603
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:16,900
And I want to read to you, dear friends, from The Jewel in the Lotus.

604
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,860
And whatever we don't get done on this side, we'll just continue with the next side.

605
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:27,280
The Jewel in the Lotus, this amazing historical document here.

606
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,740
Just a random sampling.

607
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,280
Did you know?

608
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:42,600
That aphrodisiacs were administered with art in India, but with poisonous effects in Egypt.

609
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:51,680
One private soldier, a felah, or Egyptian peasant, sluiced with barbarous potions, ran amok,

610
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:56,480
and raped nearly all his company in barracks at Cairo.

611
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,020
He had to be shot down like a rabid dog.

612
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,360
But such cases recurred, and with such violence,

613
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,640
that men preferred to oblige rather than resist.

614
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:42,900
The Jewel in the Lotus

615
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:42,900


616
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:42,900


617
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:42,900


618
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:42,900


619
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,800
A little Nathan Vinson there, from right here in Dallas.

620
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,880
Well, we'll continue with The Jewel in the Lotus,

621
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:55,400
this romantic manual and history of orgasmic nature.

622
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,680
Did you know that for immediate excitation,

623
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,340
the Persians were notorious for their use of...

624
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:10,560
the waujong, the anointed battle root, or artificial phallus.

625
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,940
This, generally made of wood, was first dipped in olive oil,

626
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:20,140
then sprinkled with fine pepper and ground nettles.

627
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,620
Worked in, it produced instantaneous results.

628
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,020
Cowudge, a hairy pod known for its aphrodisiac effects,

629
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,840
was the delight of Hindus seeking such stimulation.

630
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:43,420
When rubbed upon the penile skin, it provoked a prurient itch,

631
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,420
accompanied by swelling and throbbing.

632
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:48,840
Sometimes the skin twitching, intensified by friction,

633
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,280
reached such an extreme as to drive witless users of the drug

634
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,020
to suicide or self-mutilation.

635
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:02,500
Virgins going to sacrifice were said to rub it upon themselves,

636
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,380
to counteract pain.

637
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:11,900
Hairy insects and strange varieties of plants were also used for similar purposes.

638
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,800
Frequently, these aphrodisiacs proved toxic and brought on frightful skin afflictions,

639
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:22,240
which in time spread over the entire body and ended in death.

640
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:27,340
In some individuals, the furious priapism it induced

641
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,520
lingered even after death.

642
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:39,060
Some masochistic Brahmins provoked a bee to sting their virile part

643
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:42,580
before engaging in copulation,

644
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:46,480
not only benefiting by increased turgescence,

645
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:51,940
but reveling in the, to them, pleasurable pain.

646
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,980
Ooh la la, friends.

647
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,940
You know, people think the ancients were square.

648
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,780
No way, not a bit of it.

649
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,760
You know, the famed Huli and Diwali,

650
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:09,640
that is, the spring and autumnal fiestas, as you know,

651
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,840
inflamed the normally mild, sober Hindu into a lustful satyr.

652
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,260
Two- and three-foot red-daubed wooden phalli were strapped to men's waists,

653
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,740
rushing and shrilling about the streets.

654
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:27,860
They clutched and wielded them, brandished them in the motions of Khoi-shian,

655
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:32,300
poking them at people right and left and chanting obscene.

656
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:37,280
During the festival of Shiva-rautri, the night of the lingam,

657
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,980
men and women flocked to the temples in order that they might participate

658
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,680
in the ceremonies honoring Mahadeva.

659
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:49,860
In emulation of Lord Shiva, these rituals invariably terminated

660
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,540
in indiscriminate and frenzied Khoi-shian.

661
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:57,960
Well, it sounds like the latest subgenius convention.

662
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:02,480
The Indians supposed that consecrating the Lord Shiva

663
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,720
to the consecrated venery between Mahadeva and Mother Kali

664
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,060
would not alone replenish her needs, assuage her lust,

665
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,840
glut her seething desire.

666
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:21,340
Blood, streams of blood, she must subsist on human life.

667
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:27,960
Late at night, during the Huli and just before the torrential bursting of the storm in 1857,

668
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,660
fanatical Hindus rushed from their houses.

669
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,400
They moved frantically ere time caught them dead.

670
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,420
Down they stampeded to the banks of the Ganges,

671
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:42,440
where they stripped themselves and rubbed their bodies and foreheads with ashes of cow dung.

672
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:48,420
They feverishly molded footlong lingams of red clay and they fell prostrate before them.

673
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,840
Some shook violently. There were tears in their eyes.

674
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:55,700
They dreaded the insidious bloodthirsty power of the Black Goddess.

675
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:00,480
They cleansed their idols with holy water, fondled them and kissed the sand before them,

676
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,460
and pressed their foreheads into the coarse yellow loam.

677
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,220
Not a few sat moaning in fetid shallows.

678
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,880
Some submerged themselves.

679
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,780
Many offered their own seed in libation to Mother Ganges,

680
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:18,400
then abandoned the hallowed stream to smear clay all over their bodies,

681
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:23,280
caking it especially around their secret parts for purification and protection.

682
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:29,260
Protection against Kali, mistress of castration and impotence.

683
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:35,720
The Hindus believed there was a jack for every jill,

684
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,360
and keeping company and propagating with partners of the proper type and caste

685
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:44,200
were supposed to ensure fulfillment of desire and perfect harmony.

686
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:52,140
Nothing seemed more incongruous or defiling than an elephant woman mating with a rabbit man

687
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:56,440
or a lotus woman coupling with a stallion man.

688
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,460
Each normally held the utmost contempt for the other.

689
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,380
Just like today, dear friends, you know, things haven't changed hardly a bit.

690
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:13,400
Why, let's see, here's some stuff about prostitution in the name of the jihad, the holy war.

691
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,540
Even the sultan's daughters had to go out and take care of business.

692
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,920
Sometimes eunuchs would sneak into the harem.

693
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,520
Well, the eunuchs were already in the harem,

694
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:28,220
but young men would pretend to be eunuchs in order to get into the harem.

695
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,460
But when their secret parts were out,

696
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,680
and the eunuchs descended or whatever,

697
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:41,780
then, of course, the inflamed females applied the knives to her paramour's body.

698
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:46,420
The moment her fingernails gouged his scrotal area,

699
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,320
the Persian female relished.

700
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,120
Orgasm.

701
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,280
And it gets pretty frightening here.

702
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,620
Where's my very favorite part?

703
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,180
Uh, it's unbelievable.

704
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,960
Ah, yes, here we go.

705
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:11,520
Yes, it seems the Turks, the evil Turks, were indeed frightening.

706
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,060
The Russians at the Battle of...

707
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:17,320
Wait a minute, I've got to bring that music right out.

708
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,920
This is too weird.

709
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,920
The Russians at the Battle of Crimea and the Plevna

710
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,040
got an unpleasant taste of the bashi-bazook,

711
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:38,700
whose procedure on killing a man was to take full sexual advantage of the spasms of certain areas.

712
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:45,480
With horror, the Russians beheld that familiar flagrancy on a Turkish battlefield.

713
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,460
The, quote, bestial Turks, their pantaloons down,

714
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,900
working heatedly upon the freshly slain.

715
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,020
When hesitantly asked about the situation,

716
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:02,540
about this horrible desecration of human beings by a certain war correspondent,

717
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,340
the indifferent Turk characteristically replied,

718
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:13,700
It is to be sure, effendi, a most devilish matter of expert timing.

719
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,420
Together with the gypsies of the Deccan,

720
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,840
there were also sects of pariah women,

721
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,400
adorers of ghastly Kali,

722
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,640
called she-wolves and pae-dogs,

723
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,460
who hunted men in bands.

724
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,040
Like the Bakantes of Greece,

725
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,320
their aim was to spring upon the unwary traveler

726
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,820
and sacrifice him to the dark mother of destruction.

727
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:45,340
Torture and sapphic rape were the usual preliminaries

728
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:48,460
to a death involving disembowelment, decapitation,

729
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,600
and genital dismemberment.

730
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:54,300
A common method of torment employed by the tiger women

731
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,380
was that of slowly and persistently,

732
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:01,620
let us say, treating their service,

733
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,380
taking care of their victim to the point of senselessness,

734
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:10,080
all the while assailing his ill-fated limb

735
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,040
with vellicating oils and hairy pods

736
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,840
that engendered irritable constriction and desire.

737
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:23,200
Well, you know, it's very, it's very,

738
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,060
oh, wait a minute, what is this?

739
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:25,900
I'm just skimming.

740
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,860
I'm skimming the tiny print on this document.

741
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,660
The Turk ruled the Arab,

742
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,160
for there thrived in him savage ambition.

743
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,000
The Arab possessed sub-genius,

744
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,800
oh, no, I'm sorry, subtle genius,

745
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,400
but the Turk had keen emotional drives.

746
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:44,140
Public declarations were placarded as to physical measurements,

747
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,700
and the overawed subjects were therefore obliged

748
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,960
to submit to the Turk's power.

749
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:49,740
Power!

750
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,680
For the Arabs, like the Hindus,

751
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,000
held an uncanny, perhaps instinctive reverence for the phallus.

752
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,420
It was the co-generator of human existence,

753
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,640
a vigorous fikundate symbol of power.

754
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,560
Certain Eastern women even adorned their garments

755
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,380
with phallic tassels to show how many men they had slept with,

756
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,860
and just as with the hallowed dervish or venerable Sufi,

757
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,960
in some areas it was considered virtuous

758
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,220
for a young wench to be penetrated by an eminent Turk.

759
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,600
The same honor and dignity were thus bestowed upon any new addition

760
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,860
to the Turkish harem of a wealthy bey or pasha,

761
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,160
and upon the eve of consummation,

762
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,100
crowds gathered outside the residency

763
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,400
to drive away evil genies

764
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:34,960
and cheer the couple on to fruitful mitochondrial orgasms.

765
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,260
And there's things about peppercorns being thrust into the well,

766
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:43,340
and parchment serving as a target when they were spewed out,

767
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,160
and like tiny grape shot blasts,

768
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,000
bets were often placed,

769
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,720
and every strike counted for.

770
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:52,500
Well, it's, yes, I have to carefully go through these things

771
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,140
before I can read them.

772
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,420
I'll read them on the air to you friends,

773
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,560
as much as I'd like to.

774
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,720
Now, in News of the Weird,

775
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,960
there was some interesting material recently from the Arab world.

776
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,060
Let's see, ah, yes.

777
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,420
A January Associated Press report from the Gaza Strip

778
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,300
described recent sentences handed down

779
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,220
by one of the best known local religious arbiters.

780
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,480
Most Gazans, you see, boycott the Israeli-run court system

781
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,740
and opt for private arbitration.

782
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,280
And here are some of the punishments

783
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,400
for things that the bad, ah, Palestinians or whatever do.

784
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,520
A man who winks at a woman and says,

785
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,820
Hey, beautiful,

786
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,960
should pay the woman's family about $2,500

787
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,860
and have his eye gouged out.

788
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,580
As punishment for rape,

789
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,900
a rapist must ride an oiled camel from his house to the victim's,

790
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,940
and upon arrival, he must submit to having cut off

791
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:51,060
any part of his body that has oil on it.

792
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,120
A murderer's family was ordered to pay

793
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,360
either a large amount of money to the victim's family

794
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,760
or a smaller amount, plus the use of a woman

795
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,120
to bear a son to replace the victim.

796
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,300
Oh.

797
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,500
Oh, here's some nude stories.

798
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:14,020
In Indiana, over a six-week period in March and April,

799
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:17,560
four different men were involved in public incidents while naked.

800
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,960
Indiana must be a swinging place.

801
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,400
A nude man set fire.

802
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,560
In a Michigan City outlet store,

803
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:28,980
a man pumped gasoline while nude at a Lebanon, Indiana station.

804
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,640
A nude man claiming to be a pizza deliverer

805
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,040
roamed an Indianapolis apartment complex,

806
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,480
coincidentally injuring his groin while fleeing

807
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,040
as he unsuccessfully attempted to leap a fence.

808
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,580
And a man left nude photos of himself

809
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,840
in a Sullivan, Indiana State Park men's room.

810
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,140
All but the gasoline pumper,

811
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,020
while the copes were apprehended.

812
00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:00,220
A recent semi-official student pamphlet

813
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,600
of George Mason University

814
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,520
in Fairfax, Virginia explained that

815
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,600
freedom from discrimination includes

816
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,020
gay and lesbian's rights not to be stood

817
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,940
too far away from

818
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:13,900
during conversations with straights,

819
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:17,180
as well as minority students' right

820
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:20,600
not to have white students act surprised

821
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,060
when a minority student performs a task well.

822
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:29,860
The Los Angeles Daily News reported in April

823
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,100
that the city's Department of Building and Safety

824
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:36,100
has ordered an adult nightclub to remove its stage,

825
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,560
which was built as a large shower

826
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:43,060
where nude dancers could cavort for customers' enjoyment.

827
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:46,640
Authorities said the shower was not wheelchair accessible

828
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,980
for disabled nude dancers.

829
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,620
Although no such dancers have come forward.

830
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,660
However, they had to destroy their stage

831
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:59,620
because it wasn't PC enough

832
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:03,020
for the disabled nude wheelchair dancers.

833
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,140
And I'll probably get in trouble for saying that.

834
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,880
And, uh, let's see.

835
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:13,940
Oh, here's a guy who just can't seem to walk past a ladder

836
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,200
without stealing it.

837
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,200
He keeps getting caught for stealing ladders.

838
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,260
Interesting news of the weird.

839
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,060
Joseph Randall Davis was committed for mental treatment

840
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,940
in August by a judge in Knoxville

841
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:27,500
after he was charged with burglary

842
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,660
and driving under the influence.

843
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:33,100
While in custody, Davis had insisted that he is a cat,

844
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,820
that he be allowed to live in the woods,

845
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,040
and that he wear gloves at all times

846
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,320
because of his dangerous claws,

847
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:44,980
and also because he believes his hands will fall off

848
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:47,020
unless they are protected.

849
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,580
And, uh, in a way, he's a man of his word.

850
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:50,580


851
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:50,580


852
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,960
In Warren, Ohio...

853
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,840
In Warren, Ohio,

854
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,520
Trumbull County Jail inmate Lisa Lane, 33,

855
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,540
serving time for destruction of property,

856
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,860
was separated from other inmates

857
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:09,560
because of her penchant

858
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,360
for what she said were religious reasons

859
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,320
for removing her clothes

860
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:18,080
and spreading a feces over her body.

861
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:20,940
Uh...

862
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:23,820
Uh...

863
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:28,280
Francis Bobnar of Adamsburg, Pennsylvania

864
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,940
filed a lawsuit against the Pennsylvania Lottery Commission

865
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:33,100
claiming she and her family members

866
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:36,760
have spent over $150,000 on lottery tickets

867
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,020
in the last 10 years,

868
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,560
but have never won.

869
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,460
Well, imagine that.

870
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,920
And Bernadette French, 36,

871
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,580
won a $1 million lawsuit

872
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,340
against...

873
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,860
against the Wilmington, Delaware Hospital.

874
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,840
French, who suffers from manic depression,

875
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,440
gouged her own eyes out

876
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,560
and then claimed the hospital staff

877
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,780
was negligent in allowing that to happen.

878
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:03,740
You know, friends,

879
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,500
people just can't take responsibility anymore.

880
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,900
There was a cell block fight

881
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,120
between suspected murderers

882
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,720
Colin Ferguson and Joel Rifkin

883
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,860
at the Nassau County Jail in New York.

884
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,780
Ferguson was using a telephone

885
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:19,520
and told Rifkin to be quiet.

886
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,580
According to the Nassau County Jail,

887
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,660
Ferguson told Rifkin,

888
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,300
I wiped out six white devils

889
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:26,860
and you only killed women.

890
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,960
Rifkin originally responded,

891
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,780
Yeah, but I had more victims.

892
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,100
Ferguson then allegedly

893
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,420
punched Rifkin in the mouth.

894
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,680
Dear friends, truly,

895
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,220
these are

896
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,460
the end times.

897
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,640
The city walls are burglars

898
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,740
to all Satan's monsters.

899
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:46,020
Angels throw bibles

900
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:46,900
and even the gargoyles

901
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,000
try to evade the airspace

902
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,100
over the city of God.

903
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,160
The word of God,

904
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,840
God rips the limbs off of Satan's invaders.

905
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,660
This is why hell smells of rotting flesh.

906
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:54,920
This is why hell is thick

907
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:55,840
with the wailing screams

908
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,960
of livid torsos.

909
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:58,000
This is why in hell

910
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,660
none can ever die into oblivion

911
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,180
so that man can kill, kill, kill

912
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,840
and kill again into obscenity.

913
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,520
God damn the push of man.

914
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:05,160
God damn the...

915
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:09,780
Horror.

916
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,460
You must make a friend of horror.

917
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:18,860
Horror.

918
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,140
You must make a friend of horror.

919
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:20,140


920
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:20,140


921
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:20,560
Horror.

922
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:31,700
Terminate...

923
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:34,560
Terminate...

924
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,300
Terminate extreme prejudice.

925
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,460
I'm a little man...

926
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,280
I'm a little man...

927
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,460
I'm a little man...

928
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,180
He's a great man!

929
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,640
I'm a little man...

930
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:49,360
He's a great man!

931
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:50,120
I should call...

932
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:54,540
There's been a pair of ragged claws scuttling across floors of silent seas.

933
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:01,660
Never get out of the boat.

934
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,980
Never get out of the boat.

935
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,140
Even close.

936
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:17,760
If you can keep your head when all about you're losing, there's a blame on you if you can trust yourself.

937
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,180
You must make a friend of horror.

938
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:20,600
He's in command here.

939
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,540
He's a great man. I'm a little man. I'm a little man.

940
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,680
He's a great man. Do you know he's in command here?

941
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:46,200
Terminate. Terminate. Terminate with extreme prejudice.

942
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,100
Terminate. Terminate. Terminate with extreme prejudice.

943
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:50,420
Terminate with extreme prejudice.

944
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:51,120
Horror.

945
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:55,080
Victory.

946
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,140
Horror.

947
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:03,740
Victory.

948
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:09,420
I didn't see any message at all.

949
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,340
If you can keep your head when all about you're losing, there's a blame on you if you can trust yourself.

950
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,780
You must make a friend of horror.

951
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,160
Do you know he's in command here?

952
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:16,220
Horror.

953
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:17,440
Victory.

954
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,100
He's a great man. I'm a little man. I'm a little man.

955
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:20,420
Horror.

956
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,260
He's a great man. Do you know he's in command here?

957
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:25,160
Horror.

958
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,840
Nobody to take a chance with us.

959
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:33,180
Horror.

960
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:36,360
Nobody to take a chance with us.

961
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:41,020
Terminate. Terminate. Terminate with extreme prejudice.

962
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:41,720
Terminate.

963
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:47,840
But on your radio, lady, lady, oh.

964
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,020
Horror.

965
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:50,100
But on your radio, lady, lady, oh.

966
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,400
Radio Shorts.

967
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:02,340
Yes, dear friends, a little last-minute piece there from Radio Shorts.

968
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:06,480
We gave that address earlier, Brain Rock West.

969
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,960
That one's called Apocalypse Now Opera.

970
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,280
And it is a now.

971
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:13,580
That is a wonderfully now opera.

972
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,820
And, well, I'm not sure where we go from here.

973
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:23,420
Perhaps now is the time to give the Church of the Subgenius a mailing address.

974
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:28,320
And, of course, we have to have just exactly the right music with that.

975
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:32,400
This little CD can possibly keep up.

976
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,280
You got that pencil ready, my friends.

977
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:42,780
I want you to just sit down and write that letter requesting free information

978
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:46,720
from the Church of the Subgenius by merely addressing

979
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:48,620
that thing to Bob.

980
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:50,220
That's right.

981
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,140
Just Bob is good enough.

982
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:58,240
At Post Office Box 140306.

983
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:58,720
That's right.

984
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:04,060
It's Box 140306 in beautiful Dallas, Texas.

985
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:07,760
75214.

986
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,200
And, as you know, we always say that a second time

987
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:16,300
because it's so important to us that you be exposed to the word of that man,

988
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:16,580
Bob.

989
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:19,660
And that is, once again, Bob at Post Office Box.

990
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:24,420
P.O. Box 140306.

991
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,840
Dallas, Texas.

992
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:28,640
75214.

993
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:35,060
Where you can learn more about the many, many tapes and books and everything.

994
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:39,000
You know, every damn gimmick you could think of

995
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,720
that some religious nuts would try to sell to you.

996
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,160
Well, friend, we will sell it.

997
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:46,520
We will.

998
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,140
Sooner or later, sell it to you.

999
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:52,000
Because we love you so.

1000
00:51:52,440 --> 00:52:08,400
We love you.

1001
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,300
This is mighty Papadopoulos.

1002
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,600
Home of the...

1003
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:16,800
Home of the...

1004
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,100
Home of the Flunky's football team.

1005
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:24,380
And the world's largest robot corncob sorting plant.

1006
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:30,300
This is also the home of Blobco Industries.

1007
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,300
I'm proud to be on this show.

1008
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:42,820
Proud to be broadcasting for Dobbs.

1009
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:46,020
And proud to be an American.

1010
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:46,780
Proud...

1011
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,180
I love you.

1012
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:53,540
I love America and all Americans.

1013
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:03,720
Okay, we can't see for the bomb's early fright

1014
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:09,500
That too loudly we retch in the toilet

1015
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:14,860
Blaspheming whose clogged pipes and dark smears

1016
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:18,340
Throw the vomitous night

1017
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,460
Where the hamsters were splashed

1018
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:25,920
Are rebellantly steaming

1019
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,100
And the rockets appear

1020
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,640
On the charts every year

1021
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,740
More pro we've become

1022
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:39,600
All we hate and we fear

1023
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:44,560
Oh, shame must that scar strangle

1024
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:44,840
Oh, shame must that scar strangle

1025
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:49,260
Yammer get waved

1026
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:53,960
In the land where they pee

1027
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:00,660
On an old hobo's grave

1028
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,540
On an old hobo's grave

1029
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:18,600
On an old hobo's grave

1030
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,600
On an old hobo's grave

1031
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:24,340
Boys and girls, did you ever hear a mouse or a robin talk?

1032
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,900
No? Well, neither did I.

1033
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,940
But then, I don't understand mouse and robin language.

1034
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,300
Dear son,

1035
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:37,240
You ask my reaction to long hair or beards on young people.

1036
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,600
Some great men have worn long hair and beards,

1037
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,680
George Washington and Abe Lincoln.

1038
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:44,840
If to you long hair and beards are a thing,

1039
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,520
If to you long hair and beards are a thing,

1040
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:47,440
If to you long hair and beards are a thing,

1041
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:48,000
If to you long hair and beards are a thing,

1042
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,520
If you believe in your heart that the principles of this country,

1043
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,560
our heritage,

1044
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:55,320
is worthy of this display of pride,

1045
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:57,820
that all men shall remain free,

1046
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:01,080
that free men at all times shall not inflict

1047
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,880
their personal limitations of achievements on others,

1048
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:07,980
to demand your own rights as well as the rights of others,

1049
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,360
and be willing to fight for this right,

1050
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:12,300
you have my blessing.

1051
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,660
You ask that I not,

1052
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:19,320
judge you merely as a teenager to judge you on your own personal habits

1053
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:24,780
abilities and goals this is a fair request and I promise I will not judge

1054
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:29,980
any person only as a teenager if you will constantly remind yourself that

1055
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:35,560
some of my generation judges people by their race their belief or the color of

1056
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:40,680
their skin and this is no more right than saying all teenagers are drunken

1057
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:46,340
dope addicts or glue sniffers if you will judge every human being on his own

1058
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:53,540
individual potential I will do the same you ask me if God is dead this is a

1059
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:58,960
question each individual must answer within himself with a warm summer day

1060
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:04,160
with all its brightness all its sound all its exhilarating breathiness just

1061
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:09,780
happen God is love remember that God is a guide and not a stormtrooper

1062
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:10,000
remember that God is a guide and not a stormtrooper

1063
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:14,520
realize that many of the past and present generation because of a well

1064
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:18,940
intention but unjustifiable misconception have attempted to

1065
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:24,740
legislate morality this created part of the basis for your generations need to

1066
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:29,660
rebel against our society with this knowledge perhaps your children will

1067
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:36,420
never ask is God dead I sometimes think that much of mankind is attempting to

1068
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:40,640
work him to death you ask my opinion of draft cards

1069
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:47,740
burners I would answer this way all past wars have been dirty unfair immoral

1070
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:52,520
bloody and second-guessed however history has shown most of the necessary

1071
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:57,320
if you doubt that our free enterprise system in the United States is worth

1072
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:02,180
protecting if you doubt the principle on which this country was founded that we

1073
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:07,840
remain free to choose our religion our individual endeavors our method of

1074
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,660
government if you doubt that each free enterprise system is worth protecting if you doubt that each free enterprise system is worth protecting if you doubt that each free

1075
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:11,140
enterprise system is worth protecting if you doubt that each free enterprise system is worth protecting if you doubt that each free who would purchase it every private

1076
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:15,680
individual in this great country should rebuild commensurate only with his own

1077
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:15,940
individual in this great country should rebuild commensurate only with his own

1078
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:18,200
efforts and then it's doubtful that you

1079
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:21,140
should Prince sealed order to her

1080
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,720
governments are still extensively

1081
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:22,760
kind ofDeleiche

1082
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,500
whether day is dead or not

1083
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:24,500


1084
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:24,800
will wait until end of the 19 were just

1085
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:29,200
love it can't handle your

1086
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,680
ALL REINCOME

1087
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,620
will fill the house

1088
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:40,660
ALL REINCOME

1089
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:44,580
and you do not feel pride enough to fight for your right to continue in this manner,

1090
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:51,960
then I assume the blame for your failure to recognize the true value of our birthright.

1091
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:56,400
I would remind you that your mother will love you no matter what you do,

1092
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:58,140
because she's a woman.

1093
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,480
And I love you too, son.

1094
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:04,300
But I also love our country and the principles for which we stand.

1095
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:08,360
If you decide to burn your draft card,

1096
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:12,120
then burn your birth certificate at the same time.

1097
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:17,580
From that moment on, I have no son.

1098
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,360
Well, hi there, buddy.

1099
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,380
Thought I'd drop you a line.

1100
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,000
I haven't seen you for a hundred years.

1101
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:47,100
When you get the time, will you let me know if it's true what a fella is?

1102
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:49,880
Heard you've been leading those campus demonstrations.

1103
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,320
You're as busy as you can be.

1104
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:55,480
With the sit-downs, walk-outs, and other aggravating that you hardly ever think of me.

1105
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:58,200
Well, I'm on a little vacation in South Vietnam.

1106
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,600
Expensive paid trip for one.

1107
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:03,800
I got my own little rifle and a great uniform and a job that must be done.

1108
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:06,560
But we're sleeping in the jungle and ducking real bullets.

1109
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:07,960
And man, it's a lot of fun.

1110
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,040
Wish you were here.

1111
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,080
Wish you were here.

1112
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:45,520
Oh, yes, dear friends, and it sounds like lonesome cowboy Dave and Chaz are gonna take

1113
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,100
us out.

1114
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,500
Take us out of our minds.

1115
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:14,060
Now, this is Brain Rot Radio East, as heard on WCSB, amazing WCSB there in Cleveland.

1116
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,680
Evil cowboy Dave.

1117
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,980
Evil, evil Chaz Smith.

1118
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:40,800
Help me, I'm drowning in my own ideas.

1119
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:45,500
No.

1120
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:46,440
No.

1121
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,480
No.

1122
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:48,480


1123
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:48,480


1124
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:48,480


1125
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:48,480


1126
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,200
No.

1127
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:07,860
No.

1128
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,300
No.

1129
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:10,580
No.

1130
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:11,880
No.

1131
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,160
um
