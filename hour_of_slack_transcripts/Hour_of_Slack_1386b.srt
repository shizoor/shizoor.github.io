1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
I'll put me through!

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,560
Yes, speaking of the body of Paul.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,600
Here it is! Here comes the show! Quiet!

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,500
I think I got it.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,180
Right between the walls.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,800
Okay, drag the show over here. Come on, guys.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,980
Come on, guys. We gotta get the show up the stairs.

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,740
Check it. See if it's got its wallet.

9
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,280
Let's take it down to the old abandoned warehouse.

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,740
Hey, this show's got $500 in its wallet.

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,500
This show's got a motor truck. Tie it up.

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,960
We'll get its car keys.

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,600
I always wanted to get into the show.

14
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,260
Now it's our chance.

15
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,060
You'll never forget, Abel, when I say I get into the damn show!

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,560
And he was hopeless.

17
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,340
His legs drew up tight and tense

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,600
and withered away to just skin and bones.

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,300
Probably would have had to limp.

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,020
For a few days because of sore shin.

21
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,040
Don't you see my point?

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,500
No, no, no.

23
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,280
Oh, yes, we all love each other.

24
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,140
Well, Bob, I don't know how you feel about matters like this,

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,640
but personally, I just don't approve of

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,200
the self-genius

27
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,720
power of

28
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,040
watching.

29
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,200
I hardly agree with you.

30
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:19,600
Oh.

31
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,060
In the next 13 or 14 minutes,

32
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:25,980
something good,

33
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,480
good, good

34
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,300
is coming.

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:28,880
Your wave.

36
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,200
So don't leave this radio station.

37
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,760
Let's have a good time together.

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,820
He's all I need.

39
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,200
He's all I need.

40
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,600
Ah, yeah.

41
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,220
Ah, friends, we had so much new stuff to play

42
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,940
that it put us behind.

43
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,540
And the only way to catch up was to blow off the new

44
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,320
and just, uh, well, basically, friends,

45
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,840
what I did was grab one each of all of our subgenius CDs,

46
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,140
the masters of which were right at hand.

47
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,880
And so, uh, what we have are one or two tracks

48
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,180
from each of these various CDs.

49
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,820
We have, uh, Bob's songs, one through six,

50
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,960
media barrages, ten through twelve,

51
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,360
plus zero and five,

52
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,500
and the best of hour of slack.

53
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,440
And so, friends, back to

54
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,340
the good old days.

55
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,500
As soon as you turn your back,

56
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,620
everything in the universe snaps itself inside out

57
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,280
with a hideous sucking motion.

58
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,860
The only reason you cannot call the world impossible

59
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,600
is because it is only through the world

60
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,380
that you know the concept of impossibility.

61
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,160
You have been led to believe that everyone feels

62
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,120
he or she may be the only living consciousness.

63
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,020
But you are in fact the only one for whom this is true.

64
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,080
Oh.

65
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,340
Divine.

66
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,860
The fundamental structure of reality

67
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,500
is totally transformed every instant.

68
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,600
But it provides you with a phony memory

69
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,380
that it has always been the way it is.

70
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:08,280
Oh.

71
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,380
Since you are always at the exact center of an infinity,

72
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,180
there is no such thing as movement,

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,420
location, space, or time.

74
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,180
Oh.

75
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,320
Oh.

76
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,380
You are a row of electrochemical events

77
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,960
taking place in your cerebrum.

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,280
Oh.

79
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,800
Nothing has meaning in itself,

80
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,400
but everything can support any meaning.

81
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,340
Oh.

82
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,020
Oh.

83
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,000
If you could glimpse for even a moment

84
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,660
the real meaning of existence,

85
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,180
your brain would be neuroanatomically destroyed.

86
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,460
Oh.

87
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:41,680
Oh.

88
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,200
You cannot conceive a thing for which you do not have a word.

89
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,340
Oh.

90
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:47,820
Oh.

91
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,500
Everyone's perception is radically unique,

92
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,700
but leads them to believe it is more or less similar

93
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,960
for everyone else.

94
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:55,600
Oh.

95
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,460
You have always been listening to this tape.

96
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,480
Oh.

97
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,340
You cannot remember a time before you were born

98
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,860
because there was no such time, nor any other.

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,080
It has always been this moment.

100
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,120
Oh.

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,940
Death could occur inexplicably any second.

102
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,600
Oh.

103
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,500
Oh.

104
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,660
The oddness of the world exceeds the imagination by an infinity.

105
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,740
It has produced this talking about it,

106
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,200
this talker,

107
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,000
this labeling of it,

108
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,340
this labeler,

109
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,440
the concept of labeling,

110
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,860
the concept of oddness,

111
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,820
the word oddness,

112
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,640
the concept of a word,

113
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,560
the word word,

114
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,560
the word concept,

115
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,720
and the concept of a concept.

116
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:45,820
Oh.

117
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,320
Consciousness is not a continuous state,

118
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,640
but a momentary surfacing for variable periods at random points.

119
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,480
Your next awakening could be 20 years from now.

120
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,940
Nothing can be proven to be true.

121
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:02,320
Oh.

122
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,900
Because reality is composed of infinitesimally small moments,

123
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,700
there is no such thing as an event.

124
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,340
Oh.

125
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,620
The reason people are untrustworthy

126
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,080
is because their cerebral processes are fundamentally random ones.

127
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:19,860
Oh.

128
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,720
During the night, every ego in the world changes bodies,

129
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,880
inheriting also the memory.

130
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,080
Oh.

131
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,660
Old age is not a gradual,

132
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,460
but a catastrophic process,

133
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,060
and could strike at any moment.

134
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:35,540
Oh.

135
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,820
Dreams are the reality for which the real world is a dream.

136
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,320
Oh.

137
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,940
There has never been a time in history

138
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,480
when men have voluntarily used less than the greatest possible military technology

139
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,240
against their enemy,

140
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,760
and allowed a great technology to fall into disuse and ignorance.

141
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,280
Oh.

142
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,180
Therefore, there will be a full-scale nuclear holocaust.

143
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:01,500
Oh.

144
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,820
You are dreaming this moment.

145
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,820
Oh.

146
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,260
The universe will continue to expand

147
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,300
until there is not enough matter per unit space

148
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,120
to provide the gravity necessary for regeneration,

149
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,840
and it will slowly die out.

150
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:19,820
Oh.

151
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,280
When you finish listening to this,

152
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,760
everything will be different from the way it was when you began.

153
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,260
But, again, your new memory will conceal this from you.

154
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,020
Oh.

155
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,540
All events occur at random.

156
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,020
Oh.

157
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:39,100
The universe is one of an infinite number of universes,

158
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,720
the closest of which is undetectable,

159
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,520
being a billion universe lengths away.

160
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,280
Oh.

161
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,480
Only what you are experiencing right now exists.

162
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,180
Oh.

163
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,760
Love is the feeling that another person

164
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,400
is really yourself.

165
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,260
Oh.

166
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,720
You are about to make the first conscious decision of your life.

167
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,540
Oh.

168
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,260
Shut up!

169
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,180
Shut up!

170
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,220
Hundreds of New Yorkers at a religious revival

171
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,720
chanting the name of a modern-day prophet, Bob.

172
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,640
Bob's teachings are the foundation of a church

173
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,600
that does little more than parody cults and American consumerism.

174
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,080
It's called the Church of the Subgenius.

175
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,040
Tom Vitale has this report.

176
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,240
You will pay to know what you really think.

177
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,020
But if you give us money,

178
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,880
we will tell you what to think.

179
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,460
And not only have you paid to know what you really think,

180
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,440
but once you will get value for your dollars.

181
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:50,960
Oh.

182
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,100
Americans will buy anything,

183
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,100
and they're getting sold short.

184
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,080
That's the message of the Church of the Subgenius,

185
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,160
as delivered by the Pope of all New York,

186
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,980
David Meyer, at a recent revival.

187
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,200
Meyer also instructed the enthusiastic crowd

188
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,600
in how to get slack,

189
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,400
how to get right with Bob,

190
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,280
and how to pull the wool over your own eyes.

191
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,940
For they shall see God.

192
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
It's still true.

193
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,500
God still speaks in special ways to each of us today.

194
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,800
But my feelings toward him are still so brittle and sour.

195
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,840
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care,

196
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,840
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care,

197
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,860
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care,

198
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,120
I don't care anymore.

199
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,740
Tired, I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired.

200
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,080
I can't tolerate it.

201
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,160
I can't live with it.

202
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:39,600
And that's how I became a subgenius.

203
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,600
Children of the great Saint Lenny Bruce said,

204
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,880
American society cripples you and arrests you for limping.

205
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,180
Here in the Church of the Subgenius,

206
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:53,920
we say, cast off those crutches and crawl with pride.

207
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,180
You can crawl again.

208
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,580
You can crawl again, children.

209
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,400
I may sound like a Bible-beater

210
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,060
yelling up a revival at a river crossing camp meeting,

211
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,280
but that don't change the truth now.

212
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,280
I want to see if one person,

213
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,520
one single person,

214
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,620
will have the courage of their convictions

215
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,260
and come down here and open up to Bob

216
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,080
and give them, give me their wallet.

217
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,700
I don't just want your money.

218
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,860
Don't just want your credit cards.

219
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,680
We want your library cards, your voter registration.

220
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,360
Give it all up now.

221
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,920
Give it all up now.

222
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,640
Give it all up now.

223
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,640
Give it all up now.

224
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,560
Now, now, now.

225
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,220
I'm talking to you tonight about the Holy God,

226
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,760
about the One and Only Bob,

227
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,880
the One and Only Bob,

228
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,860
the Church,

229
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,400
the One and Only Bob,

230
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,480
the Subgenius,

231
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,780
the Subgenius.

232
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,520
Praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob.

233
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,400
Can I get a witness?

234
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,580
Can I get a witness?

235
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:47,660
Can I get a witness?

236
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,680
Can I get a Praise Bob?

237
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,880
Can I get a Praise Bob?

238
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,600
Thank you, children.

239
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,260
Thank you.

240
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,140
Thank you, children.

241
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,720
Some of you may not be familiar with the church of the subgenius.

242
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,840
Some of you may not know the heart of the subgenius,

243
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,300
Some of you may not know the purpose,

244
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,220
the divine,

245
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,540
the divine.

246
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,020
What is the purpose of the church?

247
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,820
What is the purpose of the church?

248
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,200
The purpose of the church is to have what?

249
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:17,820
Slack!

250
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,280
Can I hear that again?

251
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,800
I need more slack!

252
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,160
Can I get some slack?

253
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,480
Can I get some slack?

254
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,040
Has this ever happened to you?

255
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,600
Why, I should have been there, Ted.

256
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,400
It was great.

257
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,560
There was free booze, great music,

258
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,540
one of the best parties I ever went to.

259
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,060
Where were you that night?

260
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,180
Oh, I just kind of stayed home and watched TV.

261
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,040
I guess I should have gone, huh?

262
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,600
Didn't you feel stupid?

263
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,400
Didn't you wish you could go back to that night, that party?

264
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,700
Well, maybe now there's a way to learn how to do that very thing.

265
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,860
Introducing Bob's School of Time Control.

266
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,740
At Bob's, you'll learn how to speed time,

267
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,640
slow time,

268
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,160
and make time run backwards.

269
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,220
Thank you, Lorenz.

270
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,480
But most importantly,

271
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,120
you'll be learning how to make time work for you.

272
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,360
How, you may ask?

273
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,860
Well, just ask this man here,

274
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,620
an actual graduate of Bob's School of Time Control.

275
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,060
One day, my dog ran out in front of a truck.

276
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:06,800
Blango.

277
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,000
My dog was dead.

278
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,840
Was I sad till I met Bob.

279
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,800
Bob showed me how I could go back,

280
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,480
get the registration number for the car,

281
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,920
do a slip job on the brakes,

282
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,940
and wouldn't you know it,

283
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,240
that truck went off into a ditch and burst into flames

284
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,280
just exactly a block before he could hit old Booger.

285
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,040
Ain't that right, fella?

286
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,120
Yes, just imagine the horrible things

287
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,500
that could be undone tomorrow

288
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,400
if you had only gone to Bob's School of Time Control today.

289
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,460
Courses start yesterday, but you can catch up.

290
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,680
Ha ha, just right.

291
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,640
Bob's School of Time Control, the universe.

292
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,660
Bob's School of Time Control,

293
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,000
a division of Subgenius Industries Unlimited.

294
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,100
Everybody says I'm paranoid.

295
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,220
They all think I'm crazy.

296
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,440
They all smile to my face.

297
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,320
But they'd like to see me die.

298
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,980
And to attain the slack of Bob,

299
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,520
a subgenius must fight a vast and powerful conspiracy,

300
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,700
what Pope Meyer calls the pinks.

301
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,640
Pink is sort of that ruddy glow in the cheeks you see on people

302
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,520
who want to sell you something you don't really need,

303
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,740
who want to take away that which means the most to you

304
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,560
and give it back to you for a profit.

305
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,260
Reject!

306
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:11,780
Now!

307
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,480
Who has come along to save us from this conspiracy?

308
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,240
This conspiracy that would feed you this trash?

309
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:20,940
It's Bob.

310
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,700
J.R. Bob Dobbs was the world's greatest salesman.

311
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,820
He could sell anything to anybody.

312
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,220
He was a foregoing, full-fledged, blue-ribbon member of the conspiracy.

313
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,580
Selling and selling and selling and selling.

314
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,260
And one day he discovered a fantastic secret.

315
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,620
What is it?

316
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,000
A secret that had been hidden.

317
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,660
The secret of slack.

318
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,580
The Church of the Subgenius, a parody of weird cults,

319
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,820
has some 3,000 devoted members who have bought thousands of pamphlets,

320
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,220
stickers, cassettes, and t-shirts,

321
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,960
all bearing the trademark of Bob's smiling face with a pipe stuck in his mouth.

322
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,000
Peek-a-boo!

323
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,460
I can see you!

324
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,480
And I know what you do!

325
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,260
Bob is...

326
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:19,220
That big, all pervasive figure that encompasses spuddom on planet Earth.

327
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,640
And what is spuddom?

328
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,980
It's the human condition.

329
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,260
It's things falling apart.

330
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,200
It's fat ladies in double-knit jumpsuits beating their kids in Krogers.

331
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:40,700
We hope to welcome you all tonight to the fervid celestial spouting of the inner epochs and clockwork workings of the Church.

332
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,700
But this task will not be easy.

333
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:50,360
The fruits of the subgenius plant are not as cordial to the taste as others may be,

334
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,200
kind of mucilaginous paste.

335
00:13:53,680 --> 00:14:02,580
But it's easy to become tangentially twisted along precarious paths that have nothing to do with the straight and true direction of our search.

336
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,660
We are born with the Dobbs nature.

337
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,240
However, only exist technology can complete a subgenius.

338
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:11,240


339
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:11,240


340
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:11,240


341
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,240
The subgenius's transfiguration into over-manhood or over-womanliness.

342
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,500
And so far, Bob has allowed this to happen to one solitary guinea pig.

343
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,180
His friend, Dr. Philodrummond.

344
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,660
What? Goddammit!

345
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,080
Man was born with original slack, yet most civilized people don't believe in it.

346
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,420
And their most learned scholar can't even comprehend it.

347
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,840
Well, I've studied the Saurian stage in human evolution.

348
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,980
As it turns out, many of our ancestors are not the primates as commonly thought, but the theropod line.

349
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,000
The great archosaurs of the Mesozoic.

350
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,240
Oh no, look out!

351
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,420
Get him out of here!

352
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,940
Bob's Saga

353
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,260
Bob is a rock

354
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,100
Bob is a tree

355
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,140
Bob is you and me

356
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,800
Bob is me

357
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,520
Bob is a football

358
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,720
Bob is a basketball

359
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,680
Bob is a rugby ball

360
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,960
Bob is a golf ball

361
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:21,300
In an order like this, we may have guidelines but you must remember not to be literal minded.

362
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,280
No subgenius follows any two rules exactly.

363
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:30,560
You must also remember that anything any subgenius says at any time is sacred dogma automatically.

364
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,360
And now the rules of the church of the subgenius.

365
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,020
The first rule of the church of the subgenius is

366
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,020
The subgenius must have

367
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,900
What must he have?

368
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,480
What must he have?

369
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,880
What must the subgenius have?

370
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,820
Doug, what must he have?

371
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,540
He must have slack.

372
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,540
Help me out here, Doug.

373
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,840
The second rule of the church of the subgenius is

374
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,360
too much is always better than not enough.

375
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,320
Can I get a too much?

376
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,660
Can I get another too much?

377
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,900
Can I get another too much?

378
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,140
Oh, but too many of those, children,

379
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,060
it's always better than not enough.

380
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,460
The third rule of the church of the subgenius

381
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,920
is a rule violated every day, everywhere you go.

382
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,820
People say to me, who is a conspiracy?

383
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,360
Look and see who violates this rule,

384
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,560
and you will know them by their actions.

385
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,600
The third rule of the church of the subgenius is

386
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,160
if you don't have a sense of humor,

387
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,160
don't try to be funny.

388
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,420
The fourth rule of the church of the subgenius,

389
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,280
thank you, Buck,

390
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,320
and one of the most important rules

391
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,800
that supersedes all other rules is

392
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,920
fuck them if they can't take a joke.

393
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,740
Fuck them!

394
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,180
Fuck them!

395
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,480
You must draw your own conclusions.

396
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,240
But that's the way religion is.

397
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,740
It's been a constant battle since the very beginning.

398
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,680
The first man to try to guess why he climbed out of the slime

399
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,820
was the first man to pick up a stick and hit his brother.

400
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,000
We've been programmed.

401
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:04,920
We've been programmed.

402
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,840
Since the very beginning,

403
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,780
our slack was taken away

404
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,040
the moment we entered this room.

405
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,640
This world worries treadmill.

406
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,160
And we've been running like a little rat through a maze.

407
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,860
And the only way you can get away from that

408
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,920
is to deprogram.

409
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,700
Edit your own memory.

410
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,000
Take those bad memories.

411
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,560
Take those horrible training regimens

412
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,160
that you were subjected to as a youth.

413
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,840
Flush them down the toilet as you excremeditate.

414
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,460
Let me ask you.

415
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,440
Let me ask you.

416
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:30,900
Yes, sister.

417
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,300
Did you ever own a guinea pig?

418
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,780
I ate my guinea pigs.

419
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,540
I grew them and I ate them.

420
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,300
That's dick, Craig.

421
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,060
They were food.

422
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,600
I'm a carnivore.

423
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,780
I can't help myself.

424
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:42,500
Thank you.

425
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,060
My every honor says a lie,

426
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,940
including this honeymoon.

427
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,740
I say, fuck them if they can't take a joke.

428
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,000
I got anything for a laugh, I say.

429
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,080
I am the last winning homo correctus.

430
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,040
I am the last winning homo correctus.

431
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,820
I am the goddamn man of the future.

432
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,880
I'll drive a mile so as not to walk on foot.

433
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,000
I am a human being of the first goddamn order.

434
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,340
I am too intense to die, for I speak only the fucking truth.

435
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,520
Da-da-da-da-da-da.

436
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,180
Da-da-da-da-da-da.

437
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,200
Da-da-da-da-da-da.

438
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,860
Da-da-da-da-da-da.

439
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,860
Fuck you.

440
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,740
Fuck you.

441
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:41,740


442
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,680
Fuck you.

443
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,820
Fuck you.

444
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,600
Fuck you.

445
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,240
Fuck you.

446
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,840
My imagination is a fucking cancer.

447
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,440
And I'll spark it before it sparks me.

448
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,680
I think backwards.

449
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,440
I do it for fun.

450
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,180
I cook and eat my day.

451
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,460
I swam up into the triangle and didn't get wet.

452
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:08,780
Fuck.

453
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:08,880
Fuck you.

454
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,020


455
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,920
I'm looking at the future, I'm ransomed into the past.

456
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,540
I wait time, wait up for me.

457
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,820
I'll live forever and remember afterwards.

458
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,620
Yes, I am the purple flower of Hell County.

459
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,080
Give me wild birds.

460
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,160
They say a godzillion is the highest number there is.

461
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,640
Well, by God, I count to a godzillion and one.

462
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,440
I weigh 666 pounds and zero gravity.

463
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,140
Come and get me.

464
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:13,680
I told Jesus I wouldn't go to church and he shook my head.

465
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,520
I have my own personal saviors.

466
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,980
I change them every hour.

467
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,160
I don't give a fuck if there's life after death.

468
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:25,120
I want to know if there's even any fucking slack after death.

469
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,700
I am a goddamn visionary.

470
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,720
I see the future and the past in comic books and wine bottles.

471
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:37,860
I paint my jeans and wear them my DNA with the force of my mighty will.

472
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,660
I steer my own goddamn engine.

473
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,720
Give me slack.

474
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,420
Give me slack.

475
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,200
Yeah.

476
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,300
Hey, what's going on here?

477
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,340
Along with Bob, the pursuit of slack, and a conspiracy of pinks,

478
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,580
the subgenious theology includes a vision of the apocalypse.

479
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,840
Accordingly,

480
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,940
According to church doctrine, on July 5th, 1998,

481
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,340
when the television signal of Amos and Andy reaches the men from Planet X,

482
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,680
the aliens will unleash their wrath upon the Earth.

483
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,920
And the men from Planet X are going to come down and take over Earth.

484
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,040
They're going to...

485
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:00,540
They will put us out of our misery unless Bob can explain to them

486
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:05,460
in ways that they can understand that there is something on Earth worth saving.

487
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:09,180
And only the subgenii, the dues-paying, book-buying,

488
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,120
receipt-in-the-pocket, paid in full to the church subgenii,

489
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,700
have the tiniest prayer of survival.

490
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,760
The rest of them? It's a tough world, Jack.

491
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,900
There are people in them, and many of them have already landed on this Earth.

492
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,680
Oh, give me back my lost freedom.

493
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,440
Oh, ye aliens.

494
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,640
Alien stick-men.

495
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,740
Oh, give me back my gone cat.

496
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,280
Oh, great daddy-o from outer space.

497
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,160
Oh, give me warning.

498
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,280
Oh, space creatures.

499
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,300
Ye-i-i.

500
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,100
Give me the signal.

501
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,420
Ye-i-i.

502
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:04,320
Oh, hideous alien monster creatures from the beyond world.

503
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,720
Oh, the

504
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:24,240
The message is Mars needs women.

505
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,940
Mars needs...

506
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,600
It's a gag. It's a prank. It's a fake.

507
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,300
I don't think so, sir.

508
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,300
What's gonna happen to your children?

509
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,880
What's gonna happen to your children?

510
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,180
What's gonna happen to you when this society we've created,

511
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,880
when this society we've created,

512
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,020
air conditioners,

513
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:47,160
are station wagons with wooden sides,

514
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,940
station wagons with wooden sides,

515
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,120
are cautious indeed, are retired actors,

516
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,980
are orange hails, are politicians,

517
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:53,700
are orange hails,

518
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,100
What happens when that collapses?

519
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,500
What happens when your diary was a damn well?

520
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,260
That's when the man from Planet X-9,

521
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,120
I'm down to save the members of the subgenius church.

522
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,840
I'm down to save the members of the subgenius church.

523
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,500
But until that day,

524
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,540
the power and wisdom of Bob can help us break their mind control

525
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:14,660
by activating that mutant gland that we all have within us.

526
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,340
There's a fella down in Texas

527
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,060
They say his name is Bob

528
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,940
He tells me I should slap God

529
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,080
I should quit my job

530
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,620
I should quit my job

531
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,980
Well I'm a subgenius

532
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,520
And I must have my slack

533
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,380
And I must have my slack

534
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,740
If I don't live forever

535
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,100
If I don't live forever

536
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,840
I get my money back

537
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,340
I get my money back

538
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,460
They said that on July 5th

539
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:56,820


540
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,340
of 1998

541
00:24:59,340 --> 00:24:59,340


542
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,580
the earth would be

543
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,220
destruction

544
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,480
And I would suffer a deadly fate

545
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,920
And I would suffer a deadly fate

546
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,780
That day was long away

547
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,240
That day was long away

548
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,980
Now it has come and gone

549
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:17,880
Now it has come and gone

550
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,120
Now it has come and gone

551
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,320
There was no fire from heaven

552
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,340
There was no fire from heaven

553
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,800
And this old world rolls on

554
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,340
And this old world rolls on

555
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,460
Well I'm a subgenius

556
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,020


557
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,460
And I must have my slack

558
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,340
And I must have my slack

559
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,040
If I don't live forever

560
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,180
If I don't live forever

561
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,120
I get my money back

562
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,740
I get my money back

563
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:48,540
The poor stank was made to suffer

564
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:48,980
The poor stank was made to suffer

565
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,220
A terrible disgrace

566
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,420
A terrible disgrace

567
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:53,800
A terrible disgrace

568
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,500
Of such humiliation

569
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,120
Of such humiliation

570
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,180
He feared to show his face

571
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:01,440
He feared to show his face

572
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,700
Now Bob may be laughing

573
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,360
Now Bob may be laughing

574
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,860
Because we are such chumps

575
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,020
Because we are such chumps

576
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,120
But there is no reason

577
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:14,960
But there is no reason

578
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,060
To be down in the dumps

579
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,120
To be down in the dumps

580
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,200
It'll all still happen

581
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,480
It'll all still happen

582
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,460
No need to curse or frown

583
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:26,900
No need to curse or frown

584
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,960
They got all the right numbers

585
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,460
They got all the right numbers

586
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,780
Just got them upside down

587
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,100
Just got them upside down

588
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,000
Well I'm at some genius

589
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,320
Just got them upside down

590
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,900
And I must have my slack

591
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,960
And I must have my slack

592
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,940
If I don't live forever

593
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,800
If I don't live forever

594
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:51,440
I get my money back

595
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:58,460
I get my money back

596
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,340
And I will

597
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:02,340


598
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:02,900
And I will

599
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,720
And I will

600
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:03,840
And I will

601
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:03,840


602
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:10,660
back to the office to the meeting the meeting of the other uh new and potentially

603
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:20,140
significant contributors to the corporal world of communications and uh

604
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:32,320
the psychological world of how to get ahead by kissing butt but by not actually letting the lips

605
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:43,360
of the kisser kisser touch the butt of the kissy yes by providing the illusion that the actual

606
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:51,740
kisser's lips are indeed kissing and touching i mean the molecules themselves are

607
00:27:51,740 --> 00:28:01,560
one on the point of contact with the kiss ease but but in this case we have found how to get ahead

608
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:14,900
ahead ahead in uh the corporate world by only using the established norms of success climbing

609
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:25,660
up the ladder and how to use those norms as a uh shall we say skeleton of whose bones you

610
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,960
uh one in that position would act as if they were a ladder or a

611
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:39,820
some type of stairway yes and advancing up those bones causing the illusion to all other

612
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,900
entities involved in the corporate climb that the feet are actually touching the bones

613
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,580
and the lips are actually touching the butt

614
00:28:52,720 --> 00:29:00,600
but we both know now that that does not necessarily ring true for a oh say a subgenius in that position

615
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:10,200
and we have found here that the mostiska is the kind of thing that is

616
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:20,320
allowed to take flight so strategy but then the nangios and the animo have actually never

617
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,660
color coded the way to come up uh wind or conversation checking modern technology

618
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:29,060
toward lights artoxia so those ».

619
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:29,660
lorrit per.

620
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,300
how fasting ace with rep AMP

621
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:32,300


622
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,340
the utmost sincerity,

623
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,200
to use that word again,

624
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,900
and by doing so,

625
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,860
fall into the trap.

626
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,560
Yes.

627
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,900
By following the illusion,

628
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:46,940
conversely,

629
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,180
one can avoid the trap,

630
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,760
but reap the benefits.

631
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,540
Ha ha.

632
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,720
And so my,

633
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,240
this concludes our topic

634
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,540
of the Zen of butt kissing,

635
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,520
corporate style.

636
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,840
We're all brothers in a perfect world.

637
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:08,360
There's no need for spontaneity.

638
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,900
Perfect system,

639
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,320
we're all brothers to the end.

640
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,720
I think this is about the sickest,

641
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,800
sickest, sickest thing I've ever heard on KFJZ,

642
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,500
and since I've been listening to it.

643
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,880
It's not just the wars and the awards that win them.

644
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,800
It's not just the dull and empty distaste

645
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,100
for a smothered culture

646
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,480
that expires all around you

647
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:31,900
and pools,

648
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,300
with its own wastes.

649
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,860
It's not just the terminal folds of Nunu.

650
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,260
It's not just the child zombies

651
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,900
that murdered their mediocrity parents,

652
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,900
and then cruise the streets with bloody feet.

653
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,960
It's not just those starry old vecks

654
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,940
on the park benches

655
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,540
with looks on their faces

656
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,580
like those who shuffled out of the boxcars

657
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,160
of Belsen and Auschwitz.

658
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,260
It's not just the anesthesiologist,

659
00:30:59,340 --> 00:30:59,840
Franigi.

660
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,000
It's not just the heaving pink meat masses

661
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,320
that grope and clutch all around you.

662
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,700
It's not just the dino bones for Wotan.

663
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,560
It's not just the broken headlights,

664
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,860
snapped antennae,

665
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,860
and human excrement on your car hood.

666
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,680
It's not just that the old ways were best.

667
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,880
It's not just the bastardization and perversion

668
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,140
of every honest means of self-expression.

669
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,700
It's not just the killer shit ganja

670
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,920
from the dark side of the bush.

671
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,560
It's not just the penoid snipers

672
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,160
locking and loading on every high-rise rooftop.

673
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,420
It's not just the widescreen,

674
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,300
technicolor corporate daisy chain

675
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,340
that has defiled the entire planet.

676
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,820
It's not just Mongo in the Congo

677
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:53,020
with fa-fa-fals the size of basketballs.

678
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,280
It's not just the prophets crying lonely

679
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,520
and alone in the wilderness.

680
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,820
It's not just the people who are the most

681
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,300
It's not just the indignity of having to work

682
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,980
for some bland, non-entity son-of-a-bitch

683
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,400
who thinks workers are property.

684
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,860
It's not just the blueness of the womb

685
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,100
cleansed by evil.

686
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,900
It's not just the battling eco-freaks

687
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,040
who want to go back to nature

688
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,500
without realizing that nature

689
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,600
is an open-ditch latrine in midsummer.

690
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,940
It's not just some asshole with a pipe

691
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,320
and a shit-eating I-know-more-than-you-do

692
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,360
dog grin all over his homogenized face.

693
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,360
It's not just the horrible feeling

694
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,780
of being entrapped inside a regimented,

695
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:34,600
devolving world that you certainly never made.

696
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,020
It's not just the doorway to doom.

697
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,740
It's not just wanting to know

698
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,780
what the hell is really going on.

699
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,420
It's not just the missing H's

700
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,000
or the stolen alpha-beta-max.

701
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,040
No, dear friends, there is more to it all than that.

702
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,880
Bob ain't no nickel-dime bum-show.

703
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,260
I put it to you, he's on the square

704
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,060
and a corking fine business proposition.

705
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,280
He's the grandest thing yet,

706
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,680
and don't you forget it.

707
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,840
Shout salvation and fightin' Jesus,

708
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,540
you'll need to rise precious early,

709
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,720
you sinner there, if you want to diddle the almighty Bob.

710
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,900
Not off.

711
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,680
He's got cough mixture with a punch on it for you, my friend.

712
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,660
In his back pocket.

713
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,220
Just you try it.

714
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,540
I understand them.

715
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,920
They don't understand me.

716
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,440
They are the normals.

717
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,640
They're all that I'm not.

718
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,340
But I'm not the normals.

719
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,500
I am a subgenius,

720
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,300
a whole different species.

721
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,300
If I had my way,

722
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,360
they all would be shot.

723
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,840
For when I was young,

724
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,240
the pigs ruled the world.

725
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,660
Now all that has changed,

726
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,360
cause Bob's flag's unfurled.

727
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,780
I spit on normals,

728
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,760
cause I hate their guts.

729
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,320
I am a subgenius.

730
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:01,600
I am a subgenius.

731
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,440
I am a subgenius.

732
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:03,580
I am a subgenius.

733
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,100
They like their jobs,

734
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,420
for all the wrong reasons.

735
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,560
They wear me down

736
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,860
with their false holler smiles.

737
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,800
But my kind triumphed,

738
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,840
and now we will kill them.

739
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,960
Dead normal bodies

740
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,280
for mile after mile.

741
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,800
For when I was young,

742
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,060
the normals held sway.

743
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:27,300
I'm a subgenius,

744
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:27,760
a whole different species.

745
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,640
Now all that has changed,

746
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,800
cause Bob has his day.

747
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,520
My shoe will soon kick a hole

748
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,780
in their butts.

749
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,240
I am a subgenius.

750
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,740
I am a subgenius.

751
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,140
I am a subgenius.

752
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:48,140


753
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:48,160
I am a subgenius.

754
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:48,700
I am not bitter

755
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,120
for all they did to me.

756
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,220
They're only humans.

757
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,460
They're deaf, mute, and blind.

758
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,280
But I am a subgenius.

759
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,240
But I am a subgenius.

760
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,680
And I have a duty.

761
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,700
The utter destruction

762
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,980
of all humankind.

763
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,540
For when I was young,

764
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,820
the pinks ruled the world.

765
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,160
Now all that has changed,

766
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,740
cause Bob's flag's unfurled.

767
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,360
Cause Bob's flag's unfurled.

768
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,720
Soon I will grind

769
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,000
their face in the dust.

770
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:21,280


771
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:21,280


772
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,320
I am a subgenius.

773
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,280
I am a subgenius.

774
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,780
I am a subgenius.

775
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,320
I am a subgenius.

776
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:31,740
Thank you.

777
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,560
Oh friends,

778
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,740
I just, I can,

779
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,640
the miracle of the Bob world

780
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,500
is unfolding in front of me now.

781
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,820
I can see in the spirit,

782
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,040
through my windshield,

783
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,600
I see superimposed over

784
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,160
this mixmaster

785
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,080
across which I drive.

786
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,380
I can see an ocean

787
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,060
of self-realized subgeniuses

788
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,720
all in one place.

789
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:57,700
I can see the

790
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:06,320
the face that can

791
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,700
pile through

792
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,500
eight foot thick

793
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,660
titanium steel conspiracy

794
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,120
fort knocks doors.

795
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,680
The face that can burn

796
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,540
through metal with that mighty pipe.

797
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,360
From across the nation

798
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,140
they came and they saw

799
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,060
a new will begin

800
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,020
in northern Arkansas.

801
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,380
They drove the storms

802
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,300
and heralded night

803
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,580
to their new awakening

804
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,380
and dock docking site.

805
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,500
The cares deep in love

806
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,820
hang through their ties.

807
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,500
The journey was dead

808
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,420
and they were meeting in five.

809
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,660
Bob's flag

810
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,480
was not even there

811
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,500
but they were few.

812
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,980
It was mostly cool guys

813
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,600
like me and you.

814
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,140
And we got high,

815
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,700
so high

816
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,180
on dock dock houses.

817
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,660
Yeah we got high,

818
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,800
so high

819
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,460
on dock dock houses.

820
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,040
We ate lots of mushrooms

821
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,080
to commune with nature.

822
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,100
How are we to know

823
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,080
that the moon

824
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,180
is in nature?

825
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,120
Five hundred colors

826
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,180
flashed into my brain.

827
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,140
My cell division occurred

828
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,100
in three or four planes.

829
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,440
My brain was blasted.

830
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,180
My head feeling fixed.

831
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,540
My eyeballs protruding

832
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,000
but I didn't get sick.

833
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,240
We packed up our tips

834
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,360
but we kept seeing dots.

835
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,340
Yeah we found that the peak

836
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,400
had gotten all the best spots.

837
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,800
So we got high,

838
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:45,820
so high

839
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,100
on dock dock houses.

840
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,980
Yeah we got high,

841
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,580
so high

842
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,240
on dock dock houses.

843
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,660
The people were happy

844
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,620
they were all having fun.

845
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,840
While doctors for Bob

846
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,820
was farming skulls in the sun.

847
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,920
The corpses were swinging

848
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,780
their love did abound.

849
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,720
The average corpse

850
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,980
floated a foot off the ground.

851
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,640
The band had jammed

852
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,660
and their god was speaking his name.

853
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,260
While the doctors on the plant

854
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,260
cell were swaying their fame.

855
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,140
Farthog explosion

856
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,160
and combo gang fun.

857
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,040
Finish this then,

858
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,140
just in time for lunch.

859
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,460
Yeah we got high,

860
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,240
so high

861
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,600
on dock dock houses.

862
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,880
Yeah we got high,

863
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,780
so high

864
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,420
on dock dock houses.

865
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,640
Yeah we got high,

866
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:45,640


867
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,480
so high

868
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,400
on dock dock houses.

869
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:12,480
The people were happy

870
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:12,480


871
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:12,480


872
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:12,480


873
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:12,480


874
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:12,480


875
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:12,480


876
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:12,500


877
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:12,500


878
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:12,960
that was awesome.

879
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:12,960


880
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,260
we got to get back

881
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,640
to work.

882
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,600
Ah, yes, dear friends, the swinging love corpses.

883
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:13,440
The swinging love corpses.

884
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,940
The swinging love corpses.

885
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,260
The swinging love corpses.

886
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:30,100
The swinging love corpses.

887
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:15,480
The swinging love corpses.

888
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,460
The swinging love corpses.

889
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,760
The swinging love corpses.

890
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,060
The swinging love corpses.

891
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,160
The swinging love corpses.

892
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:44,900
The swinging love corpses.

893
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,560
The swinging love corpses.

894
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,380
The swinging love corpses.

895
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,020
The스트bs aye aye villeo.

896
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:02,240
The steba it revitalize.

897
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,340
The steba it revitalize.

898
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:09,420
The steba it revitalize.

899
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,180
That's a proclaim alright yonen

900
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:10,520
noticed inBeen thought that

901
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:10,600
the same investor uh oportunisation

902
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:15,640
ever one is guteer enough to

903
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:15,640


904
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:15,640


905
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:15,640


906
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:15,640


907
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:20,160
Sparrows, we need to have our lives doubled by...

908
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,520
Dobstown!

909
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:25,940
It's where the bad little girls and boys go.

910
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,860
It's where something is happening all the time,

911
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,060
and most of it unsolved.

912
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,800
Some of it is so hard to locate.

913
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,380
Many of the people from the saucer ship emblem itself

914
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:41,940
have been sucked out and left here.

915
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,320
Dobstown.

916
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,540
I didn't want them to be oblique.

917
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,680
When they strapped me down in a chair

918
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,700
and started asking me questions about Dobstown,

919
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:58,980
I gave them the location of the website.

920
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:01,360
Dobstown.

921
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:04,060
It's Nwatsbod spelled backwards.

922
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,100
It's Brigadoon without the haggis.

923
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,180
It is surrounded by the seven cities of Cibola,

924
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,560
which are its slums,

925
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,080
and it has a ferry to Monster Island.

926
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:19,060
And what a delightful pair of individuals

927
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:21,020
you'll never find there.

928
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,800
The ferries of Monster Island.

929
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:28,320
Tiny little happy people who do things for other people,

930
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,380
who live for other people,

931
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,820
so big are their hearts and so tiny is their stature.

932
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:34,980
They...

933
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,500
Dobstown!

934
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,140
That's where Amelia Earhart crashed, friends.

935
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,040
It's where the Tunguska meteorite came out

936
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,620
after bouncing around inside the airport.

937
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:07,340
It's where the Tunguska meteorite was, of course,

938
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,820
as you know from reading your book of the subgenius, Dave,

939
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,800
was a miniature black hole.

940
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:14,560
It's shot by Dobs,

941
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,620
the young ten-year-old man,

942
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,600
called J.R. Bob Dobs,

943
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,500
from his slingshot,

944
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:20,000
in a completely by accident.

945
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,480
In a fit of rage?

946
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,480
No, he didn't even know he was doing it.

947
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:25,340
It was just, you know, I mean, he picked up a...

948
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:27,400
Other kids might pick up a pebble

949
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,220
or a cat skull for their slingshot.

950
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,200
Yeah, a cat skull.

951
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:31,880
That makes a lot more sense.

952
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,140
A tiny black hole.

953
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,740
A singularity.

954
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,260
A singularity.

955
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,640
The glowing essence of nothingness

956
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,300
sucking in all that is not Bob.

957
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,460
And that is what he shot into the Tunguska plane,

958
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,660
in the middle of Siberia.

959
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,440
And then, past the event horizon,

960
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,460
the little thing itself went and then became like a bigger thing.

961
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:56,880
And it went into the Earth, Bob's tiny black hole did,

962
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:59,960
and it bounced around like a cue ball on a pool table,

963
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,180
back and forth until finally it exited

964
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:06,720
at the place we now know as Dobstown.

965
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:09,120
Dobstown, friends!

966
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:13,440
It is where a thing of beauty is a joy for a while.

967
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,620
It's where you are better than you were then!

968
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:16,200
It's where you were in high school!

969
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:19,320
It's where you get all the pets you ever wanted!

970
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,440
It was never a colony of France!

971
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,080
It is where science and magic are the same things!

972
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,220
It is the unfolding of miscalculations.

973
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:36,660
It is the dawning of the height, weight, hair, and eye color of Aquarius!

974
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:41,680
It is the fizzling, crackling, ebony...

975
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,420
It is the dissonant fifth vortex,

976
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,840
disrupting the harmonic convergence!

977
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,020
It's where the early worm gets away!

978
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,840
It's where the gravediggers leave their shoes in the middle of the night.

979
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,520
Dobstown!

980
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:00,600
It's for when you're too lazy to kill yourself!

981
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:01,980
Dobstown!

982
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,360
Where there are no lawyers!

983
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,920
And where the government never tries to be helpful!

984
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,900
Dobstown, friends!

985
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:13,800
It's where you can make your imaginary friends

986
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,180
fight to the death!

987
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,660
Dobstown!

988
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,720
It's between the dark and daylight,

989
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,260
when the night is beginning to lower!

990
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:24,880
It is where neither heredity nor environment matter!

991
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:33,980
It is where the lamb and the lion lay down and have sex together, friends!

992
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,320
Dobstown!

993
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:42,640
It is proof that hell is full!

994
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,840
And the dead walk the earth!

995
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:50,240
The fabric is one thing, like yourself,

996
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:54,620
one thread that could lead to thousands of other threads!

997
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,940
That is our caustic solution for you,

998
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:05,140
as members of this solemn group gathered together,

999
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:09,120
squandered and quashed and pushed under heavy stones,

1000
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,820
so that you may not know the truth that we speak,

1001
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:15,020
and yet here we are, speaking it to you!

1002
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,600
Dobstown is not a place where a man or woman dwells,

1003
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,880
but a place in the heart,

1004
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,920
as big as that mighty elephant yoke,

1005
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,820
and twice as tasty as all the trees that you could imagine!

1006
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:31,880
Now, imagination is not a place you want to stay.

1007
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,720
It's not a place you want to bring the kids, grandma,

1008
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,760
and ride the ferris wheel with.

1009
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:41,400
It's not the kind of place you want to leave for a better home.

1010
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:45,300
It's a place you visit, over and over again,

1011
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,380
with your pants on, your pants off,

1012
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,680
and your heart ripped right out, hanging from your chest.

1013
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:55,700
Dobstown!

1014
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,240
Where Bob comes home,

1015
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,300
after an easy day's work.

1016
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,280
And where you can come home too, friends!

1017
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,480
Where you'll be home!

1018
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:11,180
Where you'll finally realize why,

1019
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:12,560
why,

1020
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,000
why,

1021
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:19,240
and why you can find out more about beautiful Dobstown

1022
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,100
when you join the Church of the Subgenius,

1023
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:26,420
the world's only, first, true, last, final,

1024
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,080
one, true, religion!

1025
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:33,820
Because it admits it is full of crap,

1026
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,880
it is the only one that's not full of crap!

1027
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:40,740
And that's right, and I know it's coming each time,

1028
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:42,560
I can tell it, you tell it,

1029
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:44,580
ah, ah, ah, go!

1030
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,380
It's where Ennio Morricone was delivered

1031
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:53,820
of his inspiration for this music in the background.

1032
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,900
Huge, huge mandibles,

1033
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:59,320
large, large, fresh, gamy legs.

1034
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:02,520
And now the matador Dobbs steps out

1035
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,420
before the enraged triceratops dinosaur,

1036
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:08,580
flashing his red Dobbs-headed cape

1037
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:10,580
in front of the maddened beast,

1038
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:13,980
the furious creature that stomps its feet

1039
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,040
and paws at the ground.

1040
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,080
Dobbs grins, he smokes,

1041
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,620
the creature charges!

1042
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,280
Dobbs whips out his pipe

1043
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,500
and gives it a little conk on the noggin

1044
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,540
as it runs by.

1045
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,120
And after that,

1046
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:31,300
it sits and pants like a little puppy dog.

1047
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:38,320
And then he gets up and starts to bark.

1048
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:38,400
And then he gets up and starts to bark.

1049
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:43,660
My life has changed in many ways

1050
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,460
since I first saw this place.

1051
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,840
I know that Bob will triumph

1052
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,780
with our friends from outer space.

1053
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,260
And though we suffer, Niggie,

1054
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,180
I know that it's all right

1055
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,820
because I know Bob and I.

1056
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,500
Tell me what the thing.

1057
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:00,420
The church of the subgenius

1058
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,000
will spread across the land.

1059
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,600
With pipes in place,

1060
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,400
we'll build their place.

1061
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,500
They march together and in hand.

1062
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:09,340
The starfish of removal

1063
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:11,560
will strike a mighty blow

1064
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,740
and we'll be free

1065
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,880
of the noble and the pig.

1066
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,000
So give to Bob, Bob, Bob

1067
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,240
and you'll feel a whole lot better.

1068
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,400
Sir Bob, Bob, Bob

1069
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,480
send a dollar and a letter.

1070
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,620
He will change all your behavior.

1071
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,820
He's your short-duration savior.

1072
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,400
He is Bob, Bob, Bob.

1073
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:33,980
Bob!

1074
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,680
Bob!

1075
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,060
Friends, this hour of Slack number 984

1076
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:47,860

With that song, there's a feller.

00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,040
And now, friends, Brother Cleve.

1104
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:54,620
Well, there once was a man.

1105
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:58,080
The world's greatest salesman.

1106
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,180
And he had devised a plan.

1107
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,860
To get the shackles from my feet.

1108
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,860
Oh yeah, but now he's gone.

1109
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,400
A martyr for the cause.

1110
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,140
Bob is my lord.

1111
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,560
And he's coming again.

1112
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,700
Who knew that the first shot.

1113
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,240
Was gonna be the last shot.

1114
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:30,080
But he's got a hard driving pipe.

1115
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,220
The gas won't go through.

1116
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,580
And I'm so much more than I thought.

1117
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:37,780
And although he may be hurting.

1118
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:42,900
The universe will keep on squirting Bob is my lord.

1119
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,360
And he's coming again.

1120
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:47,820
Yeah!

1121
00:55:47,820 --> 00:56:02,920
The world's greatest salesman.

1122
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:02,980
Robert G. Gordon.

1123
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:02,980


1124
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:02,980


1125
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:02,980


1126
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:02,980


1127
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,700
If he's not gonna make history.

1128
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,580
Only thing that matters.

1129
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:24,580


1130
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:25,160
If he's gonna make it back.

1131
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:26,940
Austin, tackling.

1132
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:26,940


1133
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:26,940


1134
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:26,940


1135
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:26,940


1136
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:27,900
From the drinking.

1137
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:29,060
Of a referring job.

1138
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:29,980
And my follies.

1139
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:30,020
Every last one of them.

1140
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:30,520
Paide no.

1141
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:36,660
We can only drink and say

1142
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,840
Father's my Lord

1143
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,040
And he's coming again

1144
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:48,060
I know he can make it

1145
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:51,940
Without him we can't take it

1146
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:54,200
We'll lose the pieces of our minds

1147
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,340
To the pink boys and the wimps

1148
00:56:57,340 --> 00:57:01,140
Until the day that he comes back

1149
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:04,740
It'll be a world with no slack

1150
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:06,620
Father's my Lord

1151
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:10,080
And he's coming again

1152
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,420
Father's my Lord

1153
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:16,380
Father's my Lord

1154
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:19,080
Father's my Lord

1155
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,960
Father's my Lord

1156
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:25,080
And he's coming again

1157
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,380
If we don't want the answers upon us

1158
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:30,840
Then we need more

1159
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,700
To be honest

1160
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,380
Father's my Lord

1161
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,660
Father's my Lord

1162
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,180
Father's my Lord

1163
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:45,220
And he's coming again

1164
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,240
Great God is on the throne

1165
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,400
Right now

1166
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,340
Again

1167
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:59,980
This will all come

1168
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:00,820
to an end

1169
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:01,060
To you

1170
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,520
If you send a dollar

1171
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,800
To the church

1172
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,840
Of the subgenius

1173
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,380
P.O. Box

1174
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,800
181417

1175
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,600
Cleveland Heights

1176
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,460
Ohio 44118

1177
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:17,480
This will enable us

1178
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:20,300
To continue with the marvelous operations

1179
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:22,620
Which we've known about

1180
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,200
And we've tried to spread

1181
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,020
Throughout the western hemisphere

1182
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,660
And change this

1183
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,180
CFR

1184
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:30,820
Triforce

1185
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:32,680
And we've tried mediators

1186
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:36,680
In many ways

1187
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,480
To them

1188
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,160
We've turned around

1189
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:39,160


1190
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:39,160


1191
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:39,160


1192
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,080
And Justin

1193
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:40,420
And lots of other

1194
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:40,420


1195
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:40,420


1196
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:41,400
And as we speak

1197
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:41,400


1198
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:41,400


1199
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:41,400


1200
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:41,420
Know

1201
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:41,460
How we get

1202
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:42,060
To those

1203
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:44,460
Tourneys

1204
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:46,940
So may deeds

1205
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,520
Go before

1206
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:48,760
I

1207
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,200
Have

1208
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,880
B streak

1209
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,860
If you

1210
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:54,180
Know

1211
00:58:54,180 --> 00:59:02,240
concepts will always be linked in your mind. Sex, money, Bob. Sex, money, Bob. Sex, money,

1212
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:12,320
Bob. Yes, this is a continuation of the flow spew that the doctors of feel-good-ice now

1213
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:20,880
got for us here. You would have been told which Bob to tune to in your area, and this

1214
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:28,940
is not a burned-out, radiance-oriented cult, ladies and gentlemen. This is a spouting spew

1215
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:38,320
and tumping of graven images, spewn-eyed, blun-y-o-ed, nor-deed-y-o-ed.

1216
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:44,580
My mind is my own and nobody's gonna change it. I'm not going into that room! Nobody is,

1217
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:49,260
come on. Break out of that glass bar.

1218
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,980
And join the Church of the Subgenius.

1219
00:59:56,200 --> 01:00:03,340
You're listening to the Hour of Slack. For more information, check out www.subgenius.com.

1220
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:15,100
And friends, you can write to Bob or the Hour of Slack at Post Office Box 181-417 Cleveland

1221
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:19,840
Heights, Ohio 44118.

1222
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:29,280
After relaxing on the lake, Bob's ready to have a great time entertaining his friends.

1223
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:34,140
Right, Bob? Bob? Bob?

1224
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:42,380
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show, and we're even more glad that some listeners

1225
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:47,480
have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months. And not just

1226
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:50,860
this show, but subgenius.com and all the other articles. We're glad you're here, and we're

1227
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:51,600
glad you've made this possible.

1228
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:52,980
I'm Bob Morin, and I'm the creator of the online blog that you can find on the Subgenius

1229
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:52,980


1230
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:59,300
And if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you, you should

1231
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:05,980
go to subgenius.com, front page or especially the radio page, or the catalog store pages,

1232
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:12,660
and help out financially as best you can. Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink

1233
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:18,520
of total poverty, and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse. But some

1234
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,380
of you still have jobs.

1235
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:20,860
Subgenius.com is a free subgenius site, with training and training options to help you

1236
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:27,120
Even $5 makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1237
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,520
$50 makes an even bigger difference.

1238
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:38,300
All we're saying is that glow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1239
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:43,760
We also take checks and money orders to Subgenius Foundation.

1240
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:56,240
P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

1241
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:01,440
Thanks for anything you can do to help Let There Be Slack.
