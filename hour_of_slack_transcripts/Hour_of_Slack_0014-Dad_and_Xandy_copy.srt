1
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:07,680
Well, that about wraps it up for the American Music Party this week.

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,820
I'm Robert Wisdom, and you've been listening to the American Music Party, blues from the 80s.

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,980
I'd like to leave you with these words from the immortal, mad lad, Reuben T. Washington.

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,120
Good blues to you where I'll doggone you.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,080
Hoo!

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,180
All praise Bob, dear friends.

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:36,400
Yes, well, folks, I'm afraid you'll have to say goodnight to the good music.

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,800
For a little while, for the next hour anyway.

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,240
Probably for a while, because Norm comes in after us, and he hadn't been playing a whole lot of music.

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,520
This is the subgenius family hour tonight, folks.

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:59,700
Yes, tonight, as not promised, is the subgenius hour of Slack sound effects special, the kids show.

13
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:06,180
Starring Negative Land and that great adventure team, Captain Sun, Sunsun, and Daddy.

14
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,400
So, go wake up your kids.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,820
Or you can tape this thing, but if you do, get it in stereo.

16
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,940
And use headphones.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,700
This is the headphones show.

18
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,600
The headphones show.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,840
Before I go on, God, I hope these machines work.

20
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,920
Before I go on, I must publicly thank the Smith Zombies.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,840
There were a number of Smith Zombies in the industrial laboratory all night tonight,

22
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,680
putting stamps on little pamphlets that are going to China this time.

23
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,260
Subgenius pamphlets.

24
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:48,400
We'll give our address at the end of the broadcast where you can write for one of these heartbreaking and blessing new pamphlets.

25
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:54,080
By the way, for those who've asked, we've been getting letters from as far away as Nebraska.

26
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,960
Seriously, I don't know how they get the show up there, but they do somehow.

27
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,320
They've been wondering, where's Buck?

28
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:07,860
And Buck is not off the show, but he was off of this city, if not this planet.

29
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,660
I don't think he wants to be a host, though.

30
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,520
He said he just mainly wanted to be a guest.

31
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,760
He has to go to work in the morning.

32
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,220
I'm sure he's tired of me and all my tape decks doing all the talking.

33
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,780
But, I've got seniority.

34
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,060
And more tape decks than he does.

35
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,400
Everybody in the Subgenius church is mad at me now, so I had to get a new co-host for the show.

36
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,560
He's only six years old, so we had to change the format just a little.

37
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,960
Let's see if we can get cassette number two going here.

38
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,480
What's up, Sandy? Tell them this is KNON 90.9 FM.

39
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,480
This is the new co-host.

40
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,660
This is KNON 90.9 FM.

41
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,240
FM.

42
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,880
FM.

43
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,320
In Dallas, Texas.

44
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,820
In Dallas, Texas.

47
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,520
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

48
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,580
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

49
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,440
I am Bob Lundin!

50
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,760
No trouble.

51
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,740
Hear me.

52
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,360
Recording.

53
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,760
Everything's going through.

54
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
No trouble.

55
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,840
And now you are ready for the final 200,000 mile voyage.

56
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,940
The wheels of action begin to move.

57
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,940
Stop right there.

58
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,980
Intensifying our prospects' desires.

59
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,200
That's when the wheels of action begin to move.

60
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,160
Sorry for jumping in, doctors.

61
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:38,840
Go on.

62
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:46,280
Dr. Dobbs is known worldwide as a foremost spokesman for Christian and family values.

63
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:52,500
So plan to attend this rare personal appearance of Dr. Dobbs to second in the past four years.

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,540
Dr. Dobbs is known worldwide as a foremost spokesman for Christian and family values.

65
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:56,540


66
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:56,660
Gosh.

67
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:03,820
Even if you never intend to write your name again, one sure way to impress folks is to stay a little bit over their heads.

68
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,900
Because it was better than looking stupid.

69
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,400
It's natural that we followed the circle around and around and around.

70
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,560
Helping to create a nice round world of confusion and misunderstanding.

71
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,680
Resist the temptation to feed your ego.

72
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:26,120
Well, we take our initiates and we string a little tendon between their heels and drag them three times around the radio station before beginning.

73
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:26,640
Work it, sir.

74
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,820
We dip them in the sacred waters of the slot.

75
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,000
And what exactly does this do for them?

76
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:39,380
Well, it causes them to forget everything they've learned and it prepares their mind for the slate-like impression, the imprinting of the true subgenius.

77
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,700
Welcome, dear friends, to the subgenius hour of slack.

78
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,540
Slack, slack, slack, slack.

79
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,320
Slack, slack, slack, slack.

80
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,840
What, what, what, what?

81
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,360
Slack, slack, slack, slack.

82
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,000
Slack, slack, slack, slack.

83
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,500
Why, why, why, why, why?

84
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,080
Why, why, why, why, why?

85
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,340
Slack.

86
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,160
A message has now been registered in your subconscious mind.

87
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:18,040
Every time you say, see, hear, or think.

88
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,060
.

89
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,100
That's your key phrase.

90
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,660
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

91
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,700
Repent. Quit your job. Slack off.

92
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,800
Ah, yes, dear friends.

93
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,800
Well, for once, I took my own advice, which is rare for a subgenius preacher, especially me.

94
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,140
I did repent, quit my job, and slack off.

95
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,020
I actually did that this weekend.

96
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,100
As for not taking my own advice, usually, as Bob Dobbs himself said,

97
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,420
I don't practice what I preach because I'm not the kind of man I'm preaching to.

98
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:06,960
This line from Prescriptures is, in fact, one of the foundation stones of the Church of the Subgenius.

99
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,500
Hypocrisy is the sandy beach upon which our church is built,

100
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:16,200
and other churches may be built upon a rock, steadfast and true,

101
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,100
but ours changes with the tides,

102
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,080
scurrying in and out of holes like a crab,

103
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,560
occasionally pinching innocent bathers,

104
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,060
and finally, in the end, getting skewered by kids with sticks.

105
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,480
But, uh, it's true.

106
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,020
Oh, sire, there is no more money?

107
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,520
Yeah, that's right.

108
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,700
Get some money!

109
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,440
I did repent, quit my job, and slack off.

110
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,160
I didn't really have a job to begin with before I quit it.

111
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,340
I quit before it started.

112
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,080
You can't beat that.

113
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,380
So I've been slacking off, and pretty soon I'm gonna have to get a job.

114
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,880
One that doesn't last long, I hope.

115
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,660
I only last about as long as it takes to get a ten-minute film to the lab,

116
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,300
and then I just run out of gas till you put another quarter in.

117
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:06,400
So, uh, if you need, friends, a freelance film or videotape cutter,

118
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:12,240
a clay animator, weird comedy show producer, magazine editor, business writer, babysitter, baby sacrificer,

119
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,380
or a true ordained mad prophet of the airwaves,

120
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,040
or just an all-around cool guy, friends,

121
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,020
just write me.

122
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,340
At the Church of the Subgenius, or this affiliate station which we own.

123
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,820
And, uh, no jobs on spec.

124
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,540
Um, my, my.

125
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,080
If, friends, if I don't get a job pretty soon,

126
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:40,820
uh, I'm gonna have to start cashing in all those souls that are stacking up around the church headquarters.

127
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:48,360
We, we store the souls of those who send a dollar to the church in handsome blue cylinders in the tabernacle basement.

128
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,060
Uh-huh.

129
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:54,920
And we keep these souls on ice until such time as they can be liberated from this earthly plane.

130
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,900
But if the church goes broke, friends, why, we have to cash in some of those souls,

131
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,720
and one of them might be yours, so neither one of you or us can get them back after that.

132
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,080
I don't know where they go after Bob sells them, and I don't ask.

133
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:13,680
So, you can tell by the way I'm talking that I'd be a dedicated worker in whatever job you might want to give me.

134
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,420
It's, I love having a show.

135
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,900
It's great.

136
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,680
You can use your,

137
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,100
your own religious broadcast for job hunting.

138
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,500
Oh, yes, but it's better than using the telephone,

139
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,000
because I get to do all the talking.

140
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,620
Praise Bob.

141
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,100
Yes, help me somebody.

142
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,320
Ain't got no leg in my legs.

143
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,720
I'm on fire.

144
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,380
Pull the lever down.

145
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:30,620
You go.

Well, friends, on with the show.

148
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:44,080
It's a good thing that this entire show is composed of one tape and one negative land record,

149
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,580
because one of these tape decks does not work tonight.

150
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,240
Thank you.

151
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:54,180
If you've been driven to the brink of false sanity by the conspiracy's false reality

152

153
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,220

00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,720
Put on them headphones.

173
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:39,100
111 years ago, when I was 33 years old, right after the atomic wars, my church was rubbed out by a band of wild pink boys.

174
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:46,540
Only ones left were my son and me.

175
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,480
My son and me.

176
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:48,480


177
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:48,800
My son.

178
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:49,780
Captain.

179
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,420
Son.

180
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,460
Son.

181
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:51,820
Son.

182
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,140
Captain.

183
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:52,860
Boy.

184
00:10:54,400 --> 00:11:03,000
Well, they say the monsters have come back to this, uh, to the lost land of Palenka, dude.

185
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,280
Is that, is the spaceship locked?

186
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,980
Oh, there it is.

187
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,300
You know.

188
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,260
You drop your life support system in there, we won't be needing it.

189
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,620
It's too dangerous.

190
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,140
The show won't be in danger.

191
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,480
Unless the monsters get the tape.

192
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,620
Maybe it would stop the monsters.

193
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,960
You think we could use the show to stop the monsters?

194
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:29,480
Yeah.

195
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:34,520
If it sounded bad enough, even the monsters would flee.

196
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,700
And the land would again be safe.

197
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,160
For the free.

198
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,420
Friends, we're walking, uh, out of the laboratories.

199
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,240
We're out of identification.

200
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:46,980
Out of.

201
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,720
I don't want to go in any direction that ink will be coming from.

202
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,540
Uh-uh. We've got to avoid ink and the Yaka Teasman.

203
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,560
We're going to have to fight a lot of monsters on this show tonight.

204
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,300
Right now, we're not live. This is in the daytime.

205
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:14,580
And now that we're away from the encampment and the laboratories,

206
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:20,320
there are bones of creatures, Martian goats and things,

207
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:26,000
that have been killed by the Cyclops and by other nefarious monsters around here.

208
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,100
What could have done that?

209
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,920
Something could have been living in there.

210
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,880
Something could be living in there now.

211
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,840
Careful.

212
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,720
Stick it towards you.

213
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,720
Okay.

214
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,320
Come on.

215
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,020
Look! Look! Look at what's running out! Crab creatures!

216
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,400
Grab a weapon!

217
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,800
Please, come on! Crab creatures are coming!

218
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,120
Hey, don't forget the show! Come on! Grab it!

219
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,120
You stopped them for a second.

220
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,900
They're still coming, though.

221
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,600
Turn on the radio!

222
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:04,340
Huh?

223
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,200
Turn on the radio!

224
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,740
I think that'll do it! We'll turn on the radio!

225
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,800
I can't get it to come on!

226
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,000
You do it!

227
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,040
Okay. Now what's the button?

228
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:13,840
That one!

229
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,340
Which one?

230
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,260
Um, that one. Yeah.

231
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,800
You got it!

232
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:20,920
Okay.

233
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,800
Got him!

234
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,420
Oh no! It only wounded him!

235
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,880
Here he comes! Quick! Quick, Grim!

236
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,440
I think I got him.

237
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,820
He's down. He's still breathing, though.

238
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,420
I hope this isn't an endangered species on this planet.

239
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,000
I think I got him.

240
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,000
Let's keep throwing rocks at it!

241
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,700
Got him right in the hole!

242
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,180
Let's throw the show at it!

243
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,420
Ooh! Ooh! The show got something gross all over my hand!

244
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,800
Ooh! Get away from it! Get away from it!

245
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,640
It's gonna explode!

246
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,200
Ouch!

247
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:08,860
You okay now?

248
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,220
Yeah.

249
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,960
Did you fix the show?

250
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,360
Alright. Listen, I'm gonna have to...

251
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,400
Here's me array gun!

252
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,100
Oh, I know what... The show needs new batteries.

253
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:19,760
Yeah.

254
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,620
Okay, look. I brought some with me.

255
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,520
Let's kill it and get some new batteries in.

256
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,940
There won't be any air for a while, folks, so just hang on.

257
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,460
I was gonna say a gas match.

258
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:37,700
What?

259
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,920
I mean, no sign of gas.

260
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,560
A gas match? Maybe that was the rescue colony that came in.

261
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,060
Maybe it was the rescue colony that came out here.

262
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,440
It might be a big...

263
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:54,020
God, this pink sky here just... I can't believe it. It's like... Remember Mars? Ooh!

264
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,420
Face, eyes, nose, and nose.

265
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,380
Yeah, that's not a gas match. That's a skull.

266
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,760
But of what?

267
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,600
Look under it.

268
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,760
Okay, stand back. Because one of those Ramphorhynchuses might be under me.

269
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,060
Oh, it's okay.

270
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:12,780
Huh.

271
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,360
Strange lifeforms.

272
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,280
I don't want to find a Gaius Gudis.

273
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:29,100
Captain Zandy here, his face is scarred from an attack by a Gaius Gudis on the way into the laboratory earlier today.

274
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,600
We're gonna need... That's a good weapon right there.

275
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:44,340
The ground is littered with weapons and bones from the many, many battles that have been fought between the subgenius colonies.

276
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,160
And the creatures that live on this planet.

277
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,060
Head horn.

278
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,280
You know, the amazing thing about this...

279
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,540
This thing is...

280
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,180
I heard something answer you.

281
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:06,540
God, your face looks cool with that scar.

282
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,000
You look like the old G.I. Joes.

283
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,140
The old G.I. Joes, the tall ones, you know, they're about a foot long.

284
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:21,980
They all had a scar in the same place, like every one of those guys had to go through this initiation rite where they were scarred so they'd all look alike.

285
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,880
Even the ones with beards.

286
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,180
Go down in there.

287
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,220
Yeah, you bet I still got this hook.

288
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,240
This thing could save my life.

289
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,180
Hey, this is a tree, isn't it?

290
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,360
Oh, it's got me! It's got me! What is it?

291
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,480
What is it? Hook him! Hook him!

292
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,860
Oh, it's gone.

293
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,400
Oh, you got me!

294
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,800
You're gonna have to do the rest of the show yourself.

295
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,220
Here. Here. Quick. Quick. The show.

296
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,800
This is K&ON 90.90.N.

297
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,400
FM. In Dallas, Texas.

298
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,920
Raise the bomb!

299
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,780
This has been the Subgenius News.

300
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,400
News Hour.

301
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:22,620
Brought to you in part by the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer Launcher Society, Dobbs Co.

302
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,100
In Sex Art Around and Yakateezma Vision.

303
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:36,340
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

304
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,860
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

305
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:49,480
Stay strong out there, Bob.

306
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,880
I has so much sex with Bob!

307
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,780
Bob the

308
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:55,780


309
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,600
Oh, yes dear friends.

310
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:03,460
Let your body be sucked out of your ears

311
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,560
by the sound effects of Bob.

312
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,920
We're going to take you deeper

313
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,500
and deeper inside yourself to find Bob.

314
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:14,960
Come with me.

315
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,700
That's right, inside.

316
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,120
Into your consciousness.

317
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,160
It's slippery. It's wet.

318
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,300
But we shall go deeper and deeper

319
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,720
and deeper into the consciousness.

320
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,280
We must bore down into the cranium.

321
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,720
Drill out and drill through

322
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,680
the irrelevant thoughts of job and reality.

323
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,460
Rolling along the hollowed-out inside of the skull.

324
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,720
Piercing the squamous epithelium.

325
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,840
Tickling past the supernumerary nipple.

326
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,180
Scraping along the edges of the birth canal.

327
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:59,040
Stretching the imagination gland until it pops.

328
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,100
And finally,

329
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,860
bursting through the perineum.

330
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,100
Until finally,

331
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,640
getting into the bottom of the brain pan and

332
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,860
tumbling down through the sinuses,

333
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,960
down the esophagus,

334
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,860
and finally,

335
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,640
landing at the very soul,

336
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,200
located in the foot gland,

337
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,940
at the very lowest organ of your physical being.

338
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,900
Until finally,

339
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,800
an idea,

340
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,800
an ultimate plan,

341
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,380
is born.

342
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,900
At the very bottom of your brain.

343
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,300
At the very bottom of your mind.

344
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,180
At the very bottom of your mind.

345
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:44,180


346
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,380
And soon,

347
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,060
you will be ready

348
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,560
for

349
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:48,780
for

350
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:48,880
for

351
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,640
negative land.

352
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,960
for negative land.

353
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,300
for negative land.

354
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,340
for negative land.

355
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,060
Yes, folks, tonight,

356
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,120


357
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,760
through the magic of negative land,

358
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,940
we're going to try to make them famous for a change.

359
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,840
They're not a bunch of subgeniuses.

360
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,420
This band,

361
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,300
quote, band, unquote,

362
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,900
was doing this long before they discovered me.

363
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:09,900


364
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:25,080
They're doing this now.

365
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,880
This band,

366
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


367
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


368
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


369
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


370
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


371
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


372
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


373
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


374
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


375
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


376
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


377
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


378
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


379
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


380
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


381
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


382
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


383
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


384
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


385
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


386
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


387
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


388
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


389
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


390
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


391
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


392
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


393
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,980
quote, band, unquote,

394
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,820
is a band of the most advanced classical symphonic group

395
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,320
of this century so far,

396
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,800
aside from Doctors for Bob.

397
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,360
And, uh,

398
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,580
well,

399
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,080
they're my heroes.

400
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,260
And yet,

401
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:52,920
and yet,

402
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,460
they did sound for,

403
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,000
they enhanced our sound system.

404
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,640
That's sort of like,

405
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,340
having negative land do sound for subgeniuses

406
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,700
like having Federico Fellini set up lights

407
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,140
for your Uncle Fred's home movies,

408
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,320
or like having Michelangelo do

409
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,700
Elvis Presley black velvet paintings.

410
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,480
It's like seeing Jesus pose for pie pads in the Yellow Pages.

411
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,480
You know, it just ain't right.

412
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:15,840
So,

413
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,460
this is the subgenius sound effect show dedicated to negative land.

414
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,180
You've got to see this guy for what he is.

415
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,820
He's a maniac out to rule the world.

416
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:29,820
Yeah.

417
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,120
I guess I'm gonna have to start jamming mobile.

418
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,660
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

419
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,680
Do you think I should start jamming mobile?

420
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:39,860
He's a maniac.

421
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,040
All right, people.

422
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,400
It's almost time for us to be ten-eight.

423
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,020
In just a few moments,

424
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,880
we're gonna be ten-eight,

425
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,940
and I'm going to tell you the story

426
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,620
of 180 and the letter G.

427
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,340
All right, people.

428
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,440
It's almost time for us to.

429
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,280
We're almost to that moment right now, people.

430
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,500
Just a few moments.

431
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,940
We're gonna be ten-eight.

432
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:14,940
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

433
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:35,460
I am a man, a man with four fingers, a man with four fingers on my hand.

434
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:48,260
I am a man, a man with four fingers, but that doesn't count my thumb.

435
00:22:53,460 --> 00:23:04,720
I am a man, a man with three fingers, a man with three fingers on my hand.

436
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:20,780
I am a man, a man with three fingers, but that doesn't count my index finger or my thumb.

437
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:35,440
I am a man, a man with two fingers, a man with two fingers.

438
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,680
I am a man, a man with four fingers, a man with three fingers on my hand.

439
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:54,880
I am a man, a man with two fingers, but that doesn't count my middle finger, my index finger, or my thumb.

440
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:05,440
I am a man, a man with four fingers, a man with four fingers, a man with five fingers on my hand.

441
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:05,440


442
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:05,440


443
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:05,440


444
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:05,440


445
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,860
I am a man, a man with one finger, a man with one finger on my hand.

446
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:29,900
I am a man, a man with one finger, but that doesn't count my ring finger, my middle finger, my index finger, or my thumb.

447
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,700
I am a man.

448
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,900
I am a man.

449
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,420
A man with no finger.

450
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:10,680
A man with no fingers on my hand.

451
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:18,380
I am a man, a man with no fingers.

452
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:25,200
But that doesn't count my pinky or my ring finger,

453
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:30,960
my middle finger, my index finger, or my thumb.

454
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:44,120
Okay, we're 10-8, and the number is 180 and the letter is G.

455
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,720
There's no other possibility.

456
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:55,800
And all you slimy fruitcakes in San Francisco are going to find out

457
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,340
how to get to 180 and the letter G.

458
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,400
I repeat, there's no other possibility.

459
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:05,400


460
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,480
There is no other possibility.

461
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,740
The number is 180 and the letter is G.

462
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:20,540
The first thing you have to do to get over to 180 and the letter G

463
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:26,880
is to get into your vehicle and head east.

464
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:33,080
I repeat, you have to head east over the bridge.

465
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,400
But before you do that,

466
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,480
you have to get onto the bridge around one big turn.

467
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:45,100
You'll come up to the place where the sex chemicals burned up.

468
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,660
I repeat, where the sex chemicals burned up.

469
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:57,820
And of course, you all must have heard about that on News Center 4.

470
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:03,940
Let us know in the comments below what you think of this new

471
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:03,940


472
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,380
Let us know what you think of this new little movie and

473
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,560
if it's fun enough.

474
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,060
And I'll see you guys in the next video.

475
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:11,120
On your way to 180 and the letter G.

476
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,740
And now, and now, and now we're on the bridge.

477
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,760
That's nothing very much.

478
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,800
But when you get on the other side of the bridge,

479
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:39,660
of the bridge on your way to 180 and the letter G, you'll notice two things. First of all,

480
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:50,060
it's very important that you turn on your AM radio. Set it to 1010 on your dial. And

481
00:27:50,060 --> 00:28:01,340
let the radio frequency energy from K101 overload your little tuner until it distorts very highly.

482
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:12,580
Now right at the point of that extreme distortion, there's the big chairs. I'm not exactly sure,

483
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,620
but I think that's where all the sewer water from Oakland goes.

484
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:33,380
And then by then, you'll be out of all that distortion and you'll be looking east toward

485
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:42,140
the hill. And if it's at night, you'll see the little red lights flashing on my favorite

486
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:49,620
AM radio repeater station. That's WR6 automatic bowel movement.

487
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:04,640
And if you are into jamming, keep talking, keep jamming, because I'll be listening on

488
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,900
my scanner radio. And just maybe, you'll be on the news.

489
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:11,520
Oh.

490
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:18,680
You come up to the tunnel. And now we're coming up to the tunnel.

491
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,260
Up to the tunnel.

492
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:32,340
And then as you get into the tunnel, you'll start to sense something.

493
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:40,060
And then about halfway through the tunnel, something will suddenly hit you.

494
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:47,580
You won't sense it a lot until you get almost through to the other side. You'll realize right

495
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,040
then and there that you're entering a tunnel. And then you'll start to feel something. And then

496
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,540
you'll start to feel something. And then you will start to feel something afterよ.

497
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:50,540


498
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:50,540


499
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:50,540


500
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:50,540


501
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:50,540


502
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:50,540


503
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,440
Since you've entered Con Cost to County.

504
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,580
It's.

505
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:54,860
Hard

506
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,740
to explain.

507
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,800
Wh hiden explain.

508
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:06,800
It's hard to explain but you'll feel a certain way when you get into Contra Costa County.

509
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:07,560
.

510
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,920
On your way to. Will.

511
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,480
There is absolutely no other possibility.

512
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,820
Get to Martinez.

513
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:00,340
When you're up to Martinez, you'll see a sign.

514
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,840
A sign that says change.

515
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:09,340
And you're just going to go right on up there in your little vehicle.

516
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,300
And you're going to turn left on the change.

517
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:18,720
On the left-hand side of the street is the A&W Root Beer Place.

518
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,020
And on the right-hand side of the street is the A&W Root Beer Place.

519
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:25,360
And on the right side is another place where you can go to your own business, Charlie.

520
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,300
It's Safe Muffins.

521
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:36,080
Now that you're on G, you're just going to keep right on going up G.

522
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,120
Heading west on G, all the way to the top of the hill.

523
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,780
Now that's for 180.

524
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,120
Right up there at the top.

525
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,000
And just before that...

526
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,920
Before you get to the top of the hill...

527
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,380
You'll notice the green slime...

528
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,520
Closing out from under the house...

529
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,660
At 180 and the letter G.

530
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,920
And of course...

531
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,660
It had to be true.

532
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:16,320
You just gotta go right back down to Safe Muffins.

533
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,880
And shoplift.

534
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,000
I repeat.

535
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:28,500
You're gonna have to shoplift the HR Steam Cleaning System from Safe Muffins.

536
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:34,000
The only way you're gonna be able to do it successfully is to become invisible.

537
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,240
And then when you're totally invisible...

538
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,440
You'll just creep right on into Safe Muffins.

539
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,780
And there you'll see it.

540
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:50,000
The HR Steam Cleaning System.

541
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:56,440
This is K-N-O-N 90.9 in Dallas, Texas.

542
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,040
180 very quickly.

543
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:05,260
So you whisk your steam cleaning machine right back up G all the way to 180.

544
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,920
You go right up to the front door.

545
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,720
And you push the button.

546
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,000


547
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,080
We're ready.

548
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,600
The door opens automatically.

549
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:44,040
And the first thing you see is the orange carpet inside 180.

550
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,700
And you'll see the dog juice.

551
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,360
A horrible dog juice all over the orange carpet.

552
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:57,060
And 180 in the letter G.

553
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,840
You're just going to march right on into G there with your HR steam cleaning system.

554
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:15,580
Go right all the way back to the kitchen where the Mr. Coffee Coffee Maker has your hot water.

555
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:21,780
Your hot water ready to pour in your HR steam cleaning system.

556
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:30,200
So you go in there and get your HR steam cleaner all fired up.

557
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,560
Then you bring it on out into the living room.

558
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:38,940
And you take care of all the dog juice on the orange carpet.

559
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,000
And 180 in the letter G.

560
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,380
I think I'd like to have a cigarette.

561
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,160
Now, where are my cigarettes, David?

562
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,200
They're on top of the refrigerator.

563
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,200
David, I'd like to know what you did with my cigarettes.

564
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,680
They're under the house.

565
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,140
My cigarettes are missing, David.

566
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,300
I'd like to smoke.

567
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,680
What did you do with them?

568
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,040
They're in the tote cage.

569
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,540
David?

570
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:19,540
I'd like to have a cigarette right now, but I can't find the package.

571
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,900
I put them on the table and they're not there.

572
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,880
Did you take them?

573
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:28,640
I think we may have left them at the grandma's house.

574
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,860
My mother doesn't smoke, David.

575
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,820
What did you do with my cigarettes?

576
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,440
I told you they're on top of the refrigerator.

577
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,500
I looked on top of the refrigerator.

578
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,840
They weren't there.

579
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,980
Will you please tell me what you did with my cigarettes?

580
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,540
Maybe you left them in the car.

581
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,140
I haven't been in the car all day.

582
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,260
You must have put them somewhere and I can't find them.

583
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:01,660
You better tell me now or I'm going to really get mad.

584
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,500
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

585
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,280
I think I know where they are.

586
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:12,040
They're in back of the TV set where all the parakeet feathers are.

587
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:14,800
I think I know where they are.

588
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:14,800


589
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:14,820
I think I know where they are.

590
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:20,360
And as you're cleaning the orange carpet, there will be a voice that says,

591
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,160
Fetch my cigarettes.

592
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,200
Another voice will say,

593
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,020
They're on top of the refrigerator.

594
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:37,020
And then of course you've forgotten completely about the green slime.

595
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,420
And you'll realize that the only way to get rid of the green slime

596
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,800
is to go to the bathroom.

597
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:44,800


598
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:50,520
And you'll go back down, down the stairs, down to the basement of 180

599
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:55,960
and the letter G, where you'll find a bottle of formula 409.

600
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:07,220
You'll get that 409 up there real quick and go outside to the mailbox of 180

601
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:12,860
where the green slime and all the ants are oozing out onto the sidewalk.

602
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,800
And you'll find the bottle of formula 409.

603
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,580
And you'll spray it with all your might as hard as you can on that goddamn green slime.

604
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,380
And then you'll have gotten all that horrible stuff.

605
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,620
There'll be a few toads left under the house.

606
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,960
And they'll be saying,

607
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:37,240
Kermit, Kermit, under the house.

608
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,120
Strain me with the 409, Kermit.

609
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,800
That's what the toads are gonna say.

610
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,820
They won't cry if they don't actually say that.

611
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,340
But you're a G.

612
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,180
Hawaii.

613
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:04,340
By then you'll realize that you're gonna have to take your HR steam cleaning system

614
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,820
back down to safe muffins.

615
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,040
And before you can do it,

616
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,460
you'll of course have to become invisible.

617
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,600
And before you can do it,

618
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,720
you'll of course have to become invisible.

619
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,720
Once again.

620
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:24,200
You'll take your HR steam cleaning system

621
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,020
which you stopped at the safe muffins.

622
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,960
You'll put it back in the bin.

623
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,260
And you'll put it in your own home.

624
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:36,420
And some of them will do this.

625
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,660
Some of them will do this.

626
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,220
Some of them will do this.

627
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:39,900
Shut up.

628
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,600
And I'm gonna need that first எனenga,

629
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:49,660
and it'll be time for you to head back to San Francisco.

630
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,220
Don't!

631
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,220
Because if you don't

632
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,880
you'll never leave Contra Costa County.

633
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,900
I can't hear.

634
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,880
Are you doing something?

635
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,820
Get it outta here.

636
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,160
If you'll get back in your vehicle

637
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,620
and you'll go in reverse in reverse gear

638
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,600
using your rear-view mirror

639
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,220
all the way back down the freeway,

640
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,560
freeway past Pleasant Hill, Lafayette, and Arenda.

641
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,180
Get them off! Get, get, get!

642
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,940
You'll go back through the tunnel,

643
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:21,080
and you're going to get back on the other side of the hills there.

644
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:28,400
Through the tunnel, right past the ham radio repeater,

645
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,780
and you'll whisk down that hill at 90 miles an hour.

646
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:39,860
You'll get into the appropriate lanes on your way from 180 in the letter G.

647
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,820
Back to San Francisco.

648
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:47,920
Back past K101 and the big chairs,

649
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,680
which remind you of the sewer gas back in G where you could become invisible.

650
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:00,520
Not really sure if Oakland sewer gas can do it as well as Montana sewer gas.

651
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,380
How are you, Ashley?

652
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,200
That's right. How are you? How are you?

653
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,960
And you're on the bridge now heading west into the fog.

654
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,700
The high fog, I repeat.

655
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,000
Fog never touches the ground in California.

656
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,940
It's always so damn high.

657
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,640
And you get across,

658
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,720
and you look back to where the sex chemicals were made.

659
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,380
And finally, you get back into your sewer pipe,

660
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:38,120
and disappear down into the sewers of San Francisco.

661
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:47,960
And you know that you'll never, ever want to come out to 180 in the letter G ever again.

662
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,840
And in that sorry situation,

663
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:00,160
I think it's just about time we went 10-7.

664
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,900
I'm getting that feeling now.

665
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,280
Deep within those sewer pipes by now.

666
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,300
And never find your way out.

667
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,600
You'll never want to find your way out.

668
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:33,760
I'm sick.

669
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,760
We're 10-7.

670
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,740
Oh, shut it up.

671
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:39,020
Out.

672
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,320
Shut it up.

673
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,680
Stop everything.

674
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,760
Well, we stopped everything.

675
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:52,560
There is absolutely no other possibility.

676
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,000
That's all there is to it, folks.

677
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,600
That's what I've been playing there.

678
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,000
I can shut off now.

679
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,980
That was Negative Land, their third album.

680
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,480
A big 10-8 place.

681
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,380
And I'm going to read their address here in just a second,

682
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,980
so you can send them $7.50 and buy that thing.

683
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:16,900
I know that probably some of my listeners are absolutely disgusted

684
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:23,120
that they'd have to listen to something as probably strange as all of this may sound,

685
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,600
but that's too bad, ain't it?

686
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,360
I quit my job.

687
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,540
What do I have to worry about?

688
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:31,700
Nothing.

689
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:32,780
Nothing.

690
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,660
It's freedom, baby.

691
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,980
Can you dig it?

692
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,540
So anyway, yes, that's Negative Land at...

693
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,760
See, they distribute their own record.

694
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,080
You might be able to find it somewhere.

695
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:50,600
It's at Box 54, Concord, California, 94522.

696
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:57,120
Box 54, Concord, California, Concord, 94522.

697
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,700
Send $7.50.

698
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,140
And I hope y'all were getting that in...

699
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:01,780
I hope you were getting that in a stereo,

700
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:06,400
because it's really a pretty amazing piece.

701
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:12,320
So if I can just cut myself loose from these other shows that we fly...

702
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:12,880
.

703
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:16,920
.

704
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:16,920


705
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:16,920


706
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:16,920


707
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:16,920


708
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:16,920


709
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:16,920


710
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:16,920


711
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:16,920


712
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:16,920


713
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,040
.

714
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,040


715
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,160
.

716
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:17,660
.

717
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,020
.

718
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,940
.

719
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:31,960
.

720
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,400
.

721
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,060
.

722
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,100
You've got to see this guy for what he is.

723
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,840
He's a maniac out to rule the world.

724
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,900
What can I do to make you understand?

725
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,120
I love you.

726
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,680
Goodbye, Iceman.

727
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,040
I'm not sleeping.

728
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:06,460
No!

729
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,360
No!

730
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:53,140
How's that?

731
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,400
What happened?

732
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,560
What happened?

733
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,100
Where are we?

734
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:04,100
A minute ago, I was walking around in Glen Rose, Texas,

735
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,220
and now I'm on this planet.

736
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:08,560
Sandy, what happened?

737
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,400
You got captured by a monster, and I accidentally hit you.

738
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,340
A monster?

739
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,700
Yeah, right up here.

740
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,060
It's dead.

741
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:17,420
It's dead now.

742
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,360
What's the show doing here?

743
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,980
I don't remember anything.

744
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,380
I don't remember anything.

745
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:32,120
You brought the show with you from the laboratory.

746
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,800
I'm going to have to think about this.

747
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,200
I don't understand it.

748
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:42,920
Okay.

749
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,280
We're safe now.

750
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,140
Man, that was a long day.

751
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:47,140


752
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:47,560
That was tough.

753
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,480
Too many monsters around here.

754
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:58,160
At least this old road is still here that the space bulldozers built.

755
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,020
I wish the Transformers were around to help us.

756
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,360
Yeah, really.

757
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,980
Well, which way do you think we should go, Captain Zandy?

758
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:15,540
Where'd the Lost Subgenius colony...

759
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,140
Where do you think they came from?

760
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:17,140


761
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:17,300
The

762
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:17,300


763
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:17,700
.

764
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,860
.

765
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:36,020
P

766
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:36,020


767
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,640
the

768
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,100
rid of

769
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:41,900
Unbelievable!

770
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:45,900
I can't even describe these monsters, folks.

771
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,640
Asleep?

772
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,120
Some of them run off in the bushes.

773
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:52,120


774
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:11,060
Now there could be something lurking in those boulders over there.

775
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,260
Yeah, so they're looking.

776
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:13,680
Ooh, what is that?

777
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,300
Looks like the end of one of the space bulldozers.

778
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,220
Yeah.

779
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,100
The yellow one.

780
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,060
The yellow and red thing.

781
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,000
Uh-huh.

782
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,180
Into them.

783
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,560
But what did this to it?

784
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:31,120
What could have done this to a space bulldozer?

785
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,820
This looks like the cyclops' head.

786
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,640
And the nose horn.

787
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,380
The two ears.

788
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:43,660
Maybe the bulldozer had crashed into the cyclops and knocked his horn off.

789
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:46,540
If that's the case, he's going to be really mad.

790
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,780
And this is just his whole horn?

791
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,160
That's probably just the tip of it.

792
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:55,440
It's only about eight feet long.

793
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,880
The whole horn is twenty feet.

794
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:04,020
Then he must be giant-er than the sky.

795
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:09,080
No, well, his head touches those low clouds over there.

796
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:14,040
So I hope the show is ready to take that on.

797
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,360
That's the only thing.

798
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,580
If we can make the show sound bad enough,

799
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:23,780
then even the king's cyclops will be driven away,

800
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:27,340
and the land will be left in peace and harmony forever.

801
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,880
And Eternia will be ruled.

802
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:30,820
Eternia?

803
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:31,360
Yes.

804
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,760
Without He-Man.

805
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:33,700
Yeah.

806
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:39,060
Only soon the Transformers will rule Eternia.

807
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:42,000
No, the Transformers will.

808
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:46,640
I hope that the Autobots get back to Cybertron, their home.

809
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:47,740
Why?

810
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,560
And leave the Decepticons here on Earth?

811
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,100
To destroy us?

812
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:51,620
Yeah.

813
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:52,880
Why?

814
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,240
Because I'm...

815
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,800
Do you want Earth destroyed?

816
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,700
You've got to see this guy for what he is.

817
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,380
He's a maniac out to rule the world.

818
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,420
What can I do to make you understand?

819
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,620
I love you.

820
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:12,380
Tune in for mind-melting extremist noise

821
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:18,320
with best industrial experimental music.

822
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,740
I'm not going to be featuring such top-neighbor group songs.

823
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,360
What planet are we on?

824
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,560
Oh, me too.

825
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,700
We aren't planning this.

826
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:32,700
This is, uh...

827
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:33,780
Oh, it's all planned.

828
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:34,260
Bob, look.

829
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,260
Go ahead and admit it.

830
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:35,940
See, look, look.

831
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:36,720
It's a conspiracy.

832
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,560
Look, I'm on page 16.

833
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,620
It says, Lady Paul talks about chili.

834
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,080
I mean, all this stuff is...

835
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,060
You can't fool these people.

836
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:46,820
Yeah.

837
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,000
They're...

838
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,800
Yeah, I'm tired of this script.

839
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,500
Let's go to this script here.

840
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,860
No, look, do my stuff.

841
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,500
My stuff's really funny.

842
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,400
Prepare for the econocataclysm of my hoarding food.

843
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,660
Gold gun, ammo, and gas.

844
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:02,660
Going up on survival techniques and learn how to kill.

845
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,080
Of course, you don't want to kill a subgenius believer, but...

846
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:10,140
God's judgment is going to come and fall again

847
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:15,380
upon a godless, Christ-rejecting, blasphemous society.

848
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:20,420
Well, if this sounds paranoid, you're right.

849
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,200
But I think I have good reason to be paranoid.

850
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,860
It's a strange world out there.

851
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:36,540
Kind of, this is what life is like at a bottom-line level.

852
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,820
You know, and I'm not going to make you cut through a lot of other stuff to get through it.

853
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:41,660
Here's what it is.

854
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,640
There's no gimmick about that.

855
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:44,240
It's straightforward.

856
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,800
It's strong.

857
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:47,140
And it's elemental.

858
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:49,080
Yeah, heavy stuff.

859
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:51,540
Witchcraft.

860
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,800
Voodoo.

861
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,920
Devil worship.

862
00:50:55,720 --> 00:51:01,900
A wild, gnawing, animal hunger will grow in you.

863
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:07,160
Number six hundred, three score.

864
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,220
Every day,

865
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:14,880
everybody welcome.

866
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,800
One too stupid.

867
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:21,860
Three, four dumb.

868
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,980
Five, six idiotics.

869
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,020
Seven, eight, seat me safe.

870
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,760
Very stupid.

871
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:33,400
Very stupid.

872
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,120
Very stupid.

873
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,700
Very stupid.

874
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,760
I like Concord.

875
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,680
And 180G.

876
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,540
I like Pleasant Hill.

877
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,780
No other possibility.

878
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,560
Very stupid.

879
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:53,180
Very stupid.

880
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,800
Very stupid.

881
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,540
Very stupid.

882
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,200
Very stupid.

883
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,680
Very stupid.

884
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,240
Very stupid.

885
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:01,380


886
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,560
Very stu...

887
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,040
That is no more money?

888
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,880
We gotta get some money.

889
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:11,660
That dirty, purgy, shark-a-bat, flat-a-pot-a-filla-fuck-a-button,

890
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,040
you don't want the, the deceph...

891
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,020
That sounded pretty good.

892
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:22,220
Our ancestors used to do this.

893
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,840
Making stupid noises with rocks.

894
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:31,080
And one day they found out that certain types of rock, when chipped like that, would become

895
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:39,360
sharp, sharp flint knives worthy of felling even the mighty saber-toothed tiger.

896
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:41,640
Here's a new one from the

897
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:44,500
Even the mighty Babosaurus.

898
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:45,180
Who are our ancestors?

899
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:45,860
Huh?

900
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,400
Our ancestors are the cavemen, right?

901
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:53,500
And the monkeys and stuff, right?

902
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,300
Well, our ancestors.

903
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:59,580
See, Zandy, as subgeniuses,

904
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:03,300
our ancestors were giant eight-foot-tall yetis,

905
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,740
abominable snowmen and Bigfoot creatures

906
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:10,100
created by the aliens who came to Earth

907
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,900
after they destroyed the dinosaurs.

908
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,800
Unfortunately, these godlike, super-intelligent ancestors of ours

909
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,680
were smited by evil gods

910
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:28,240
and turned into pathetic monkeys and humans.

911
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,380
And the humans and the subgeniuses

912
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,180
have always been a little different

913
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,460
and always waged this endless war

914
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:40,080
over what's funny and what's not funny.

915
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,360
What do you think about that?

916
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,020
What?

917
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,500
What I just told you, the history of mankind.

918
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:47,980
Yeah, here's your club.

919
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,200
What am I supposed to do with it?

920
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,900
Yeah, call...

921
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:56,140
Oh, me subgenius, me good, go find human.

922
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,520
Ah, human!

923
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,880
That's just a rock.

924
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:02,600
Ah, find human.

925
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,520
Ah, subgenius.

926
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:06,300
The evolution.

927
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,360
Kill bug.

928
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:09,860
Kill human.

929
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,880
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

930
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:13,640
Ah, ah.

931
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:14,100
Ah.

932
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:15,980
Ah.

933
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:16,380
Ah.

934
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:16,740
Ah.

935
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:18,400
Where we find human, master?

936
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,220
I am a human.

937
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:21,040
What?

938
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,940
My own son?

939
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,420
A human?

940
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:26,360
Yeah.

941
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:30,180
Shelby didn't tell me.

942
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:30,500
Oh.

943
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:32,400
This was a plant.

944
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,860
Or, it was a live plant.

945
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:39,620
See, here's the two eyes, the mouth, and here's the long nose.

946
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:40,080
Oh.

947
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,080


948
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,080


949
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,080


950
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,080


951
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,080


952
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,080


953
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,080


954
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,080


955
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,080


956
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,080


957
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,080


958
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,380
And that was a plant?

959
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,160
Yeah, or actually, these are like leaves.

960
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,800
It looks like a mutated goat head skull.

961
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,800
And it had eyes?

962
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:51,940
A plant with eyes?

963
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:52,460
Yeah.

964
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:57,020
Never heard of such thing, but that's real!

965
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,400
It's real, folks.

966
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:04,260
This is a real show and we're really in a dangerous environment.

967
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:05,640
A hostile planet.

968
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,020
And another time...

969
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:08,360
Look it.

970
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,760
This was a leg bone.

971
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:13,420
We're 225 years in the future from when you're hearing this.

972
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,020
This was a leg bone.

973
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,120
This was a leg bone.

974
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,240
I wish She-Ra was here.

975
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:17,920
Yeah.

976
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,900
So I could kiss her.

977
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:21,780
Zandy?

978
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:22,380
Uh huh.

979
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:23,400
God.

980
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,560
That's what I'm supposed to be thinking.

981
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:27,080
You're only six years old.

982
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:29,960
Look at this.

983
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:31,820
Hey!

984
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,700
Oh, oh, what is that thing?

985
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:35,940
Oh, oh, get it off!

986
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:37,160
Oh, get it off me!

987
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:37,560
Oh!

988
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:38,340
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

989
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:38,600
oh!

990
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:38,740
Those are the unsencنا 쓱s!

991
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:40,780
Oh, that was...

992
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,420
Must be one of those them-a-pods...

993
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:53,800
We gotta find some us-a-pods as an antidote, in case one of the them-a-pods fights us.

994
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,060
Yeah, because those antisence can really help!

995
00:55:59,180 --> 00:55:59,480
Did you hear that?

996
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,560
You heard that sound?

997
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:02,480
.

998
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,220
I heard gunshot.

999
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,480
An earth weapon.

1000
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,600
Look out! An egg!

1001
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,120
Do you think that's a Gaius Goudis egg?

1002
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:19,460
Well, it won't break it open so it'll die.

1003
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,600
Well, it doesn't explode.

1004
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,880
I'm gonna stand back.

1005
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,780
Way to go! Are you okay?

1006
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,960
I didn't brush you off.

1007
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:36,760
You got egg goop all over you.

1008
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,500
Look out! Here comes its mother!

1009
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:42,080
Grab a stick! Grab anything!

1010
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,700
Stop me!

1011
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,280
Quick! Quick! Turn up the show!

1012
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,240
Don't you hold it.

1013
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,400
When that baby died last night...

1014
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:53,860
...I was a little scared.

1015
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:54,460
You made it.

1016
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,480
Zandy!

1017
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:05,180
Am I teaching you too much violence?

1018
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:05,820
No.

1019
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:10,320
Why would you teach me stuff like that?

1020
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,320
Huh?

1021
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,620
Why would you teach me stuff like that?

1022
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:14,060
I don't know.

1023
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,900
Because that's what I got taught.

1024
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,380
But it's so much fun.

1025
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,960
Like I'm gonna grab the egg.

1026
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,840
Where is the egg?

1027
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:36,560
I don't know.

1028
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:39,940
Let's play.

1029
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:40,280
Ta-da!

1030
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:42,880
Here goes the star!

1031
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:42,880


1032
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:42,880


1033
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:42,880


1034
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:42,880


1035
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:42,880


1036
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,180
You should be required to do something like this.

1037
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,220
Everyone in this colony needs to be epitomised!

1038
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:47,220


1039
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:47,220


1040
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:47,500
explos放

1041
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:51,100

1042
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:53,260
Oxyn'

1043
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:56,520
Oh, listen to that beautiful noise, friends.

1044
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:02,900
That's some more negative land capping off the Captain Sun Sun Sun and Daddy show.

1045
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,740
Boy, there's going to be a real crowd in here.

1046
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:15,820
Norm's got a whole bunch of guardians of the airwaves here ready to destroy any of the evil callers that call in.

1047
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:19,800
And my time is slowly beginning to run out.

1048
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,580
I've got another five minutes here.

1049
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:24,140
Here, I guess you've got another five minutes of slack, friends.

1050
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,320
But at least you get that much.

1051
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:29,040
At least listen to that slack skipping by.

1052
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,980
Going just right out of your reach.

1053
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,220
I smell gasoline.

1054
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,360
I smell gasoline.

1055
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:36,400
Where's the lighter?

1056
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:38,840
Yes, friends.

1057
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:41,260
So send for that negative land record.

1058
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:49,600
And, of course, as we come down upon the beautiful closing music of the Hour of Slack show,

1059
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:51,340
this is Reverend Ivan.

1060
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:53,580
Reverend Ivan Stang starting to sign off.

1061
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,100
Friends, I want you to send your love offerings our way.

1062
00:58:58,460 --> 00:58:59,560
Bob loves you.

1063
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:06,840
And send those, well, every kind of thing you can scrape out of your drawers.

1064
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:12,280
Because we need those donations to keep the home for slackless children afloat.

1065
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,560
Keep the church open.

1066
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,300
Keep the new pamphlets going out.

1067
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:18,560
You members out there, probably in about a week and a half,

1068
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:21,220
you'll be getting the new subgenius pamphlet.

1069
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:21,780
Number two.

1070
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:27,720
I'll be interested to see whether people like it better or worse than the old original first pamphlet.

1071
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:33,260
Why, nothing could beat that original slack of that first subgenius pamphlet.

1072
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,460
You can get that pamphlet, friends.

1073
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:38,280
We can't tell you how much money to send because you're supposed to send that money to the station.

1074
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:46,560
But we'll be reading that address of the subgenius church where you can write for information on just what the heck is going on here.

1075
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:51,320
And that is the church of the subgenius.

1076
00:59:52,320 --> 01:00:00,440
P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1077
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:04,320
Once again, that's Bob at P.O. Box 1403.

1078
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:08,480
No, not P.O. Box 140306.

1079
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,540
Box 1403.

1080
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:09,900
O. 6.

1081
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,320
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1082
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:16,340
And dear friends, our show is slowly starting to run out.

1083
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:19,360
But before you take over the airwaves.

1084
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,600
I'm taking over.

1085
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:25,360
I want to let Pastor Naked's song, Drinking Bud, Watching Bob, play.

1086
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,180
Because we keep getting requests for that.

1087
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:29,960
Drinking Budweiser.

1088
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:32,920
Oh, yes, that's right.

1089
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:34,960
Drinking Bud, Watching Bob.

1090
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:37,140
By Pastor Buck Naked.

1091
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:38,560
Coming up.

1092
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:40,920
This is stirring music.

1093
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,940
I thought it was sting music.

1094
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:45,620
Stirring sting.

1095
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:47,220
Sting sting music.

1096
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:49,280
I like the lyrics.

1097
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:50,000
Ba-ba-ba-ba.

1098
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,020
Here we go, friends.

1099
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:52,960
Pastor Buck Naked.

1100
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,220
Buck Naked and the Jaybirds.

1101
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,080
Drinking Budweiser.

1102
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,000
Watching Bob on TV.

1103
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:05,220
Swallowing Redman.

1104
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,680
The day my coon dog died.

1105
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,640
Reading the pamphlet.

1106
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,760
Over and over again.

1107
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:24,440
I was drinking Budweiser.

1108
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,200
And Bob was on TV.

1109
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:37,740
The day that Uncle got kicked by a mule.

1110
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:42,560
I was with Cousin Junior.

1111
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,140
The DNA backfired.

1112
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:51,300
I was drinking Budweiser.

1113
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:51,300


1114
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:51,300


1115
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:51,300


1116
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:51,300


1117
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:51,600
I was drunk.

1118
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,780
I was lonely.

1119
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,000
I was plastered.

1120
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:01,520
I was drinking Budweiser.

1121
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,300
And Bob was on TV.

1122
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,200
Drinking Budweiser.

1123
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,860
Watching Bob on TV.

1124
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:19,640
Swallowing Redman.

1125
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:21,300
Drinking Budweiser.

1126
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:24,620
The day my coon dog died

1127
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:29,560
I was reading the pamphlet

1128
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:33,700
Over and over again

1129
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:39,000
I was drinking Budweiser

1130
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,740
And Bob was on TV

1131
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:48,300
I was drinking Budweiser

1132
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:51,940
And Bob was on TV

1133
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:05,560
A few days this last week has brought the passing

1134
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:14,060
of another, I don't know if he's a minister or not,

1135
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,200
an evangelist of sorts, Mr. Herbert W. Arm.

1136
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:22,220
Armstrong. Yeah, that's right. I've been getting mail from that

1137
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:25,920
guy for about five years. Free mail. The plain truth

1138
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,760
about today's world news and the prophecies of

1139
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:34,340
the world tomorrow. The plain truth, as a matter of fact, that's what we got about half of our early dogma

1140
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:38,740
out of that magazine. You just switch a few names around and point them out to the church.

1141
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:42,160
It's great. But yeah, I was actually, you know,

1142
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,240
it's too bad because now Garner Ted will

1143
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:48,140
Well, Garner Ted has

1144
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:52,360
his own church in Tyler. Yeah, right. But Garner Ted was thrown out of

1145
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:56,280
I mean, that's pretty bad when you got to throw your own son out of your church

1146
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:00,120
twice. Twice. What I'm worried about

1147
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:03,000
is my own son throwing me out of my church. Twice.

1148
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,740
So what is going to happen? I don't know. I need a job.

1149
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:10,600
I do. Excuse me. I really do.
