1
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:05,560
I want a tail, a one, two, three, four.

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,960
83-day squids, falling from the sky.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,500
83-day squids, man, they get me so high.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,740
83-day squids, now they're falling, oh no.

5
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:19,040
83-day squids, come on, let's go.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,360
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry,

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:31,340
the hour of slack, sponsored by the church of the subgenius.

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,020
Yes, dear friends, I don't even know where to start.

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,600
I've got so much good tape.

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,400
This time, we just got back from the Portland and Seattle devivals, dear friends,

11
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,400
which were actually the best subgenius devivals I've ever witnessed.

12
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,320
And I've been...

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,820
I've been a part of.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,340
Praise Nenslow.

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,340
Praise Dr. Howell.

16
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,380
Praise Sternow.

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,900
Praise Doctors for Bob.

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,660
Praise Pope Angus.

19
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,240
And praise Papa Joe Mama, who couldn't even be there.

20
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,460
Praise Janer, who couldn't be there, but was somehow there anyway.

21
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,280
Oh, and the Duke of Uke as well.

22
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,400
And Popus Lilith and so many, so many...

23
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,720
Friends, I don't even know where to start.

24
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:31,120
But Sternow did some of the greatest preaching I've ever seen in my career as a subgenius preacher.

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,380
We'll be playing that uncensored for the internet later on.

26
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,020
The music you're hearing in the background is Doctors for Bob.

27
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,020
And I...

28
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,140
Praise Bob!

29
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,460
I've got to actually do this song with those guys live in Seattle.

30
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,640
But the original Doctors for Bob, oh, it was...

31
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,340
Well, like, it took three of us to make a half-hour of it.

32
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:54,500
And I'm a big fan of Bob's.

33
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:54,500


34
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:54,960
And it's a little bit of a jangler.

35
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,580
But otherwise...

36
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,980
Hey, friends, I don't even...

37
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,560
Hey, hey.

38
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:08,080
And I've got a Suzy the Floozy Bob Slacktime Funhouse show that is unbelievable,

39
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,760
that I must share with all of you.

40
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:16,920
I have here in front of me an Einstein Secret Orchestra show that is...

41
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,900
Einstein Secret Orchestra changed a little bit,

42
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:31,180
as WCSB there in Cleveland got a new call-in board so that they can do conference calls and so forth.

43
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:40,160
And that means that it's easier for Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chaz and Princess Wee and whatever...

44
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,140
Michelle and whatever guests.

45
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:50,260
They can get phone-in guests a lot easier, such as, in this case, Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

46
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,580
And yours truly.

47
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:57,680
And I've got all these tapes from people I don't know and never heard of.

48
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,300
But the Lord Jesus, praise Jesus, has queued this stuff up and found...

49
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,400
has already dug through it and found the good parts.

50
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,320
And well, let's just...

51
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,780
I'm on my own.

52
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,560
Wait a minute. Actually, before I do that, we'll switch over to this quiet...

53
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,340
I did want to say one thing, friends.

54
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,160
It's actually not me saying it.

55
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,240
Believe it or not, it's...

56
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:31,800
Carl Sagan in his book, The Demon Haunted World Science as a Candle in the Dark,

57
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:38,120
which I would have to call required reading for any subgenius.

58
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,520
In American polls in the early 1990s,

59
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:49,040
two thirds of all adults had no idea what the information superhighway was.

60
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,120
42% didn't know where Japan is.

61
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,960
And 38% were ignorant of the term Holocaust.

62
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,000
But the proportion was in the high 90s who had heard of the Menendez,

63
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,440
Bobbitt and O.J. Simpson criminal cases.

64
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,660
99% had heard that the singer Michael Jackson had allegedly sexually molested a boy.

65
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,840
The United States may be the best entertained nation on Earth,

66
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,940
but a steep price is being paid, my friends.

67
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:30,680
And once again, I would very much recommend Carl Sagan's last book,

68
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:36,620
The Demon Haunted World Science as a Candle in the Dark, to everybody.

69
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,940
It's very important that you occasionally...

70
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,460
When was the last time you read any science?

71
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,500
Most of you.

72
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,960
As compared to when was the last time you saw a TV show about UFOs?

73
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,880
Or ghosts or whatnot?

74
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,900
Friends, start with a cage.

75
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,220
Oh, pardon me.

76
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,660
But this is in the background.

77
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,860
The music we're listening to is my good friend, close personal friend,

78
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:12,140
El Diablo, also known as Imat Zepol with his band, a CD this time called Cosmic Voyeur.

79
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:18,620
Start with a cage containing five apes, friends. In the cage, hang a banana

80
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,120
on a string and put stairs under it. Before long, an ape will go to the stairs

81
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,640
and start to climb towards the banana. As soon as he touches the stairs,

82
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:33,520
spray all the apes with cold water. After a while, another ape makes the attempt.

83
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,820
With the same result, all the apes are sprayed with cold water.

84
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,580
Now turn off the cold water.

85
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,920
If later another ape tries to climb the stairs,

86
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,200
the other apes will try to prevent it, even though no water sprays them.

87
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,620
Now remove one ape from the cage and replace it with a new one.

88
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,800
The new ape sees the banana and wants to climb the stairs.

89
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,600
To his horror, all the other apes attack him.

90
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,600
After another attempt and attack,

91
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,360
he knows that if he tries to climb the stairs, he will be assaulted.

92
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,720
Next, remove another of the original five apes and replace it with a new one.

93
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,640
The newcomer goes to the stairs and is attacked.

94
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,080
The previous newcomer takes part in the punishment with enthusiasm.

95
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,860
Again, replace a third original ape with a new one.

96
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,300
The new one makes it to the stairs and is attacked as well.

97
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,100
Two of the four apes that beat him have no idea why they were not permitted

98
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:32,020
to climb the stairs or why they are participating in the beating of the newest ape.

99
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,900
After replacing the fourth and fifth original apes, all the apes which had been

100
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:45,520
sprayed with cold water have been replaced. Nevertheless, no ape ever again approaches the stairs.

101
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,240
Why not?

102
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,740
Because that's the way it's always been around here.

103
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,200
Sound familiar, dear friends?

104
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:04,460
Well, we're we're we're coming closer and closer to the end times.

105
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,460
The final, final days are approaching.

106
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,220
And I'm digging it.

107
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,420
I'm digging it.

108
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,380
You know, it's the end of the world called here in Dallas.

109
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:14,720
Our

110
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,720
in Garland, Texas, last night gave up the ghost.

111
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,040
God didn't appear on television on

112
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:30,640
on Channel 18 and that particular UFO cult and just gave up.

113
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,540
But you know what, friends?

114
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,720
God did call me on the phone twice today, right when I was starting to put the show

115
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,180
together, Jesus Christ, the Lord, well, actually the son of God, the son of man as

116
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,120
well, Jesus Christ called me.

117
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,420
And I'm like, which which cult are you going to go with?

118
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,520
Friends of the ones that talk about it all the time are the ones that can really deliver.

119
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:55,820
And.

120
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:33,540
Well, senators at the school, they always have had too many of that trade.

121
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:39,460
Of course, where we were.

122
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:39,460


123
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:39,460


124
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,420
Well, I lighted the sail that I love myself, could you hit the sun and show it?

125
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,160
How about.

126
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,480
Scott?

127
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:45,480


128
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,900
A great star has fallen from heaven upon a third of the earth's rivers and springs.

129
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,220
Their waters have become polluted and bitter.

130
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,600
The sun, the moon, and the stars are struck.

131
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,420
A third of the world is in darkness.

132
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,760
Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth

133
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,420
because of the rest of the trumpet blasts which the angels are about to sound.

134
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,680
The earth is filled with smoke.

135
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:22,280
A great whirring sounds in the sky as beasts like locusts of iron fall upon men.

136
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,240
East of the river Euphrates is the land where the sun is born.

137
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,500
Two hundred million men march to destroy a third of the world.

138
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,600
It is done. The final trumpet has sounded.

139
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,620
The mighty cities of the nations fall.

140
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,940
Islands disappear. Mountains crumble.

141
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,500
As God's final wrath pours upon mankind.

142
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,200
As lightning flashes from the east to the west, so he comes.

143
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:55,880
The son of man, anointed in power, returns with majesty and glory to take his kingdom.

144
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,360
Uh, Bob, let's really have some smoke on this one, all right?

145
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,680
All right. Let's go.

146
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,240
Time is running out for the human race.

147
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,760
Get ready for the judgment day.

148
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,680
The sun is shining. Come on, get happy.

149
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,420
The Lord is waiting to take your hand.

150
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,240
Shout out, Alida, come on, get happy.

151
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,960
We're going to the promised land.

152
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:24,080
And if she wants to get some white underwear, it might be best she get them in asbestos, all right?

153
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,400
Might better get them in asbestos.

154
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,000
And I'm teasing now, of course.

155
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,560
Don't, don't let her put on asbestos breeches, all right?

156
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,560
They'll, it might get, uh, might get, be harmful to your breathing.

157
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,240
First, I want to remind you that in the last days there will be some scoffers who will do every wrong they can think of and laugh at the truth.

158
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,120
If you are scoffing right now, in your heart, if you are not believing.

159
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:44,680
Bob!

160
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,200
Coming back.

161
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,800
You are one of the signs of his coming.

162
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,040
If you're going to continue to scoff, will you do me a favor?

163
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,940
Prepare for the end.

164
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,320
Oh, wow!

165
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,920
Well, there's a day soon coming when the judgment of the world will begin.

166
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,400
When the sky will be darkened and the mountains dance like cocaine.

167
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,500
When the temple will be broken.

168
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,080
When the whole of the earth will fall like food from the tree.

169
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,460
Oh, I wish you'd all believe me.

170
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,940
I wish you all could see.

171
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,480
I wish you'd all believe me.

172
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,640
I wish you'd all believe.

173
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,680
The truth will not hurt you, only her life.

174
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,540
I wish you'd all believe me.

175
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,480
The truth will not hurt you, only her life.

176
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,220
The next video will be about you beating theavy in the face of this waltz.

177
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,220


178
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,220


179
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,220


180
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,220


181
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,220


182
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,220


183
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,220


184
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,220


185
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,220


186
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,220


187
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,220


188
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,220


189
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,220


190
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,220


191
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,220


192
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,220


193
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,220


194
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,220


195
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,220


196
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,220


197
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,780
In that altaire

198
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,740
From the deadly valley

199
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,540
where the armies of the world make their war

200
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,060
Good blood will flood the hillsides

201
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,680
And the land become a blistered sword

202
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,820
And death will ride victorious

203
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,100
Through the carnage of man's misery

204
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,540
Oh, I wish you'd all believe me

205
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,680
I wish you all could see

206
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,760
You don't really believe that, do you?

207
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,660
I don't know.

208
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,080
Impossible, fantastic, ridiculous, absurd, really?

209
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,240
The ambush is set, and it's working.

210
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,000
1998, the year of fear.

211
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,000
Jack, explain it, will you, please?

212
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,480
Now, these are not my dates.

213
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,500
We don't set dates.

214
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,260
This is one of the best intelligence sources in the world,

215
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,060
along with Jane's defense out of England.

216
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,860
But let me tell you this, friend.

217
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,580
We believe things are going to come and happen sooner than we think.

218
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,900
The world must be seeing it coming, right?

219
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,680
I'm afraid not.

220
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,780
Even though the technology had been around for years,

221
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,300
nobody really paid too much attention to it.

222
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,020
Almost no one saw it coming.

223
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,560
Almost no one?

224
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,900
Yeah, almost.

225
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,000
Those of us who did express our concern

226
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,720
were just branded as paranoid,

227
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,440
as people who hated technology,

228
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,640
people who just weren't ready to be part of a new united world.

229
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,480
Don't listen not to this child of Satan.

230
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,880
Reverend, I gotta admit,

231
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,620
this doomsday,

232
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:35,740
we're going to have to do something about it.

233
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,760
This morning has me just a smidge Twitter-painted.

234
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,020
Oh, now be calm, Ned.

235
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,980
But be afraid also,

236
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,700
tremendously afraid,

237
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,340
for the day of reckoning is upon us.

238
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,040
Oh!

239
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:47,840
Now!

240
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,840
We're heading across the river

241
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,360
to wash your sins away in the tide.

242
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,520
It's all so peaceful

243
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,820
on the other side.

244
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,440
Forget the troubles,

245
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,700
come on, get happy.

246
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,740
You better chase all your cares,

247
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,220
they never take you away.

248
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:07,960
Shout alleluia,

249
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,320
come on get happy.

250
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,080
Get ready for the judgement day.

251

–¶¶

298
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:04,680
choice, huh? Oh, but there are some among us who aren't sure yet. Maybe they can't quite tell if

299
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:11,600
they're pink or if they're truly a mutated son of Dobbs. Hell, just send in that membership fee,

300
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:17,820
and whether you're pink or not, chances are everything will be fine. Hell, those saucers

301
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,740
come with airlocks and torpedo tubes. I'm sure we'll be able to do a little weeding out once

302
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:29,200
we're airborne. Oh, but that can come later, and hopefully there won't be a lot of weeding to do,

303
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:35,240
because weeding's hard on a girl's knees. But I don't expect a lot of the wrong kind of people

304
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,940
to be on board if you catch my drift, because they're going to be misreading the flaming signs

305
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:48,480
in the heavens and trying their brand-ex-apocalyptic solutions until it's too late to turn to Bob.

306
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,680
Oh, but they never have been able to...

307
00:19:52,740 --> 00:20:02,380
figure out how to get it right anyway. Oh, they screw it all up. They can't tell a 999 from a 666,

308
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:08,420
and I can see how they could mistake our triumphant subgenius Ragnarok for their

309
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,620
cheesy bargain basement Armageddon.

310
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:22,720
Pfft. Oh, but hey, you putzes, Armageddon tired of waiting for you to get around to it. Your god can't get a...

311
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,780
up to destroy the Sodom and Gomorrah that it has created for itself.

312
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:35,460
Oh, but Bob's gonna clean house on this cat box, but good. And the mighty wrath of Jehovah One and

313
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:44,420
Negi and the elder gods and the sex goddesses are just for the overkill. Oh, Bob, great is thy power.

314
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:52,600
Cream rinse us all in your sweet load and rupture us up into the heavens. Yay, we strip naked,

315
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,700
and light the sacred frop, and implore your mercy upon your believers.

316
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,320
In the days of the end, there shall come from among the race of men a new ruler.

317
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:13,000
From the chaos of the nations, he will forge peace and security. As one risen from the dead,

318
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,240
he will entrench the world with his sorcery, and at the time appointed, he will take his place in

319
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,620
the very temple of the Lord of Hosts, scattering the true children of the Father over the

320
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,060
face of the whole earth. He is Antichrist.

321
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:44,060
Worship the one who bears on his head the mark of destiny. Worship the one who involves and

322
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,840
flush the power of divinity.

323
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,660
Worship the one who bears on his head the mark of destiny.

324
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,600
He is the shine of God.

325
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:05,120
From the chaos of the nations, he rises in power. The mark of the wind on his head.

326
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,680
From the chaos of all nations, wherefore his calling be deterred from the place of the dead.

327
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:18,660
In the chaos of war, there he's hidden beneath, the fury of battle is seen.

328
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,140
In confusion and terror,

329
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,720
he abolishes the world,

330
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,280
and that is why he is seen.

331
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,600
The old man follows the beast,

332
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,220
searching his own for a plan.

333
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,760
He is the shine of God.

334
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,020
Shine, oh, touch, touch the fan.

335
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,540
Shine, oh, touch, touch the fan.

336
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,560
Oh, look at his face.

337
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,120
This is your God.

338
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,080
God.

339
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,540
God.

340
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:52,820
God.

341
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,960
Rise up and kick the ground before your God.

342
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,680
God.

343
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,720
Worship this image of your God,

344
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,040
and destroy those denying your true God.

345
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,280
Be marked with the sign of man's God.

346
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,180
His number.

347
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,280
Six of his number.

348
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,140
Six of his number.

349
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:10,360


350
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,980
This is your God.

351
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,700
This is your God.

352
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,480
Touch the fan.

353
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,900
This is the number of the plan.

354
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,600
Worship the one who bears on his head the mark of destiny

355
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,520
Worship the one who informs and plushes the power of destiny

356
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,880
Worship the number of times

357
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,100
In the sign of God

358
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:51,440
I don't want to put anybody on guilt trips, and I don't want to frighten people.

359
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,360
But I'm going to tell you something.

360
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:58,560
If you're listening to a preacher or a group of people that are telling you are saved

361
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:04,200
and that there's going to be the next Messiah that comes is going to pull you up to him and you're leaving,

362
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,880
that Messiah is Satan.

363
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,960
He is Antichrist.

364
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,880
And if you think you're saved whoring after Antichrist,

365
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,260
you are sadly misled by your little house of ill repute.

366
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,220
That's a strong statement.

367
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,240
The secret Bible has thousands of followers.

368
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,260
What is it?

369
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,300
The secret Bible has thousands of followers.

370
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,360
The secret Bible has thousands of followers.

371
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,420
The secret Bible has thousands of followers.

372
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,460
The secret Bible has thousands of followers.

373
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,360
We hear a great deal today about the end of the world.

374
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,540
When is it going to come?

375
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,340
Some have been so presumptuous as to set dates.

376
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,800
And as a result, people have sold their worldly goods,

377
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,440
gone to a mountaintop somewhere,

378
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,920
and waited for the end of the world to come.

379
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,420
I have no doubt that it will be in this generation,

380
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,380
No man knows the day, but it's going to happen in this generation.

381
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,440
How you fix for blades, friend?

382
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,660
They say it could be within 18 months.

383
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,960
Not my dates, but supposing they're right.

384
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,900
Let's get ready.

385
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,720
These are serious times.

386
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:15,960
There is now evidence to support the view that the Middle East moment of truth could come as early as the second half of 1998.

387
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,340
Have you heard?

388
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,820
It's in the stars.

389
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,300
Next July.

390
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,980
We collide with Mars.

391
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,780
Well, did you ever?

392
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:33,740
What a swell party, a swell party, a swelligant elegant party this is.

393
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,020
God forbid.

394
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,420
We'll be doing another telephone call in very soon after July the 4th.

395
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,400
So, stand by for it.

396
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,360
And I'm not, you're going to do it.

397
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:50,760
You must.

398
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,460
We've got to make a stand.

399
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,780
I'll be, we'll be showing some numbers and we're going to be going to work pretty soon.

400
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,340
You bet we're going to fight.

401
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,520
All right?

402
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:07,360
Dear Lord, if you spare this town from becoming a smoking hole in the ground, I'll try to be a better Christian.

403
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,800
I don't know what I can do.

404
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:20,000
Um, ooh, the next time there's a canned food drive, I'll give the poor something they'd actually like instead of old lima beans and pumpkin mix.

405
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,040
One minute to core meltdown.

406
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,660
Shut up!

407
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,180
Sir, there may never be another time to say I love you, sir.

408
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,500
Oh, hot dog.

409
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,800
Thank you for making my last few moments on Earth socially awkward.

410
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,500
Looks like this is the end.

411
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,140
That's all right.

412
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,900
I couldn't have led a richer life.

413
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,880
After the meltdown, we can expect roving bands...

414
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,480
I don't like this program.

415
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,500
...danger jam.

416
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,380
...traffic for hours.

417
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,660
We are a fortune!

418
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,080
This is all your fault!

419
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,420
Okay, gotta pick a button, pick a button, pick a button.

420
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,320
No, one potato, two potato, three potato, four, no, wait!

421
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,700
Bubblegum, bubblegum, in it it!

422
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,240
How many pieces do you want?

423
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,040
No, no!

424
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,720
Thirty seconds to core meltdown.

425
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:04,600
Oh, Smithers, I guess there's nothing left to do but kiss my sorry ass goodbye.

426
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,440
May I, sir?

427
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,200
Mm.

428
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,520
These unfortunate people here will be instantly killed.

429
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:16,860
This circle, which I am sad to say we are in, will experience a slower, considerably more painful death.

430
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,400
Good Lord!

431
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:22,740
They called me old-fashioned for teaching the duck and cover method, but who's laughing now?

432
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:28,440
He's duck and cover, duck and cover.

433
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,220
He did what we all must learn to do.

434
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,300
You and you and you and you.

435
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,120
Duck and cover.

436
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:46,280
Be sure and remember what Bert the Turtle just did, friends, because every one of us must remember to do the same thing.

437
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,080
Remember what to do, friends.

438
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,500
Now tell me right out loud.

439
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,200
What are you supposed to do when you see the Flash?

440
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,400
No!

441
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,520
No!

442
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,520
Fifteen seconds to core meltdown.

443
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,600
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

444
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,540
Catch a tiger by the toe.

445
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,420
If he hollers, let him go.

446
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,560
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

447
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,100
Whoa!

448
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:09,940
What?

449
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,360
I bought the lens!

450
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:12,880
What?

451
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,280
I bought the lens!

452
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:15,900
What?

453
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,360
I bought the lens!

454
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,080
What?

455
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,360
I bought the lens!

456
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,080
What?

457
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,880
I bought the lens!

458
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:22,880


459
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,280
I bought the lens!

460
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,660
Wait a minute.

461
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,760
Statue of Liberty.

462
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,060
That was our planet!

463
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,680
You maniacs!

464
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,680
You blew it up!

465
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,560
Damn you!

466
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,660
Damn you all to hell!

467
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,880
Thank you, I'm afraid that's all we have for you.

468
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:53,860
There is going to be a judgement caused by radiation through atomic weaponry in the days that are ahead.

469
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,480
Oh yes, we need to be so prepared, don't we?

470
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:01,600
I purchased the Hale-Bopp Comet Eclipse update tape.

471
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:07,500
Is there another book that I need to be through in my study?

472
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,040
Not too good.

473
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,480
Are we going to Black Angus?

474
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:15,740
Well, you might say we're going to the best steakhouse in the whole universe.

475
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,300
So we're not going to Black Angus.

476
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,940
Will you leave me alone?

477
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,680
It's bad enough you're making me go to your stupid judgement day.

478
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,080
Please, Lisa.

479
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:32,820
I don't know exactly what's going to happen, but I really wish we could make peace before sunset.

480
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,180
Nothing is going to happen, Mom.

481
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,760
I hate to disappoint you, but the world is not coming to an end.

482
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,720
The tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosives.

483
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:54,400
There are weapons that are simply thoughts, attitudes, prejudices, to be found only in the minds of men.

484
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,900
For the record, prejudices can kill, and suspicion can destroy.

485
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:06,460
And a thoughtless, frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all of its own.

486
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,780
That's all you need.

487
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,420
Doug from Idaho.

488
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,520
Under ordinary circumstances, I would never deny Jesus.

489
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:22,780
But under physical torture, I'm afraid I would break down, strapped to a table with someone sticking needles in my eyes.

490
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,700
Now, wait a minute.

491
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,640
Whoa, hold the phone.

492
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:32,700
What kind of a false Christ is supposed to be coming that loves and saves souls?

493
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:43,820
Now, how many people would he see if he took you, Doug, and said, let's strap old Doug down and poke his eyes out and save his soul?

494
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:53,460
Now, next we have a figure who is as legendary, in fact, more so than Jane or Hyperclete.

495
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:58,240
He, too, comes from the wild subgenius hinterland.

496
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:07,720
In the old and golden days, he used to hurl his lances in the sun, whistle back the parrot's call, and leap the rainbows of the brooks.

497
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:13,020
He would catch the wild goat by the hair as he bounded from crag to crag.

498
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,100
But then...

499
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:26,780
Time hit him, and the incredible burden of subgenius knowledge, and he became the sleazy, rum-soaked reprobate and terrifying psychopath we know today.

500
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:34,740
There is a word, a control word, I'm supposed to say, which will render him harmless, but honestly, I can't remember it.

501
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,440
Maybe I will during his performance.

502
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:44,080
At any rate, please put your maxillipeds together for the incomparable Pope Sturgeon.

503
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,160
He's a traveling man, and he'll be traveling on the traveling microphone.

504
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,940
The original Sturgeon!

505
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,560
Sturgeon!

506
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,000
Sturgeon!

507
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,000
Sturgeon!

508
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,000
Sturgeon!

509
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,920
Give me a K!

510
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:08,840
Say!

511
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,040
Give me an I!

512
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,480
I!

513
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,560
Give me an L!

514
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:11,720
L!

515
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,920
Give me an L!

516
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,460
L!

517
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,480
What's that spell?

518
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:14,960
L!

519
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,100
Give me a P!

520
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:16,740
P!

521
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,860
Give me an I!

522
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:18,200
I!

523
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,280
Give me an N!

524
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:19,620
N!

525
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,460
Give me a K!

526
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:20,980
K!

527
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,040
Give me an S!

528
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:22,360
S!

529
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,280
What's that spell?

530
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:23,780
S!

531
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,200
Now put it together and what do you got, children?

532
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,120
Kill pigs!

533
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,280
Kill pigs!

534
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,180
Kill pigs!

535
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:41,420
Now each one of you tonight has just most eloquently elucidated one of the three reasons we're here in Portland tonight.

536
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:41,540
We're here in Portland tonight.

537
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:41,540


538
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:41,540


539
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,520
We're here to kill pigs.

540
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,640
We're here to smash the conspiracy.

541
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,620
And we're here to praise Bob!

542
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,100
Praise Bob!

543
00:32:54,040 --> 00:33:02,260
Now I am Reverend Sternodot, the pope of all Arkansas.

544
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:11,520
And I pit the goddamn terror of the fucking gods out there.

545
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,640
Out of my nose.

546
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,360
Pardon my language, but...

547
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,760
Yee-haw!

548
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,660
Let the sons of God and man bear witness!

549
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,800
I port the devil to prove my fitness!

550
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,900
I'm armed and loaded!

551
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,440
I'm a fission reactor!

552
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,400
I don't consider mortality to be a factor.

553
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:39,540
And I proved that the anti-virgins weren't so posh when I gave her a high-protein tonsil wash.

554
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:42,140
I have the evil eye!

555
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,120
I carry mojo bags!

556
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,280
I tire out Jesus with my frock jags!

557
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:52,920
I sire retarded space bastards across the cosmos.

558
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:57,640
When I drop my drawers, even Mother Nature follows.

559
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,260
I eat black holes for breakfast!

560
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,340
I steer my own evolution!

561
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,820
I think backwards, Bubba!

562
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,280
That's my solution!

563
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,420
So step aside, all you butt-lips!

564
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:13,820
I'm a crime-fightin' master criminal thug-eat-jeans!

565
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,040
I'll freeze your seed before it hits the bed!

566
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,800
I have a triple backbone!

567
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,480
I eat my dead!

568
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,440
I swam the Bermuda Triangle!

569
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,160
And didn't get wet!

570
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,420
I fart plutonium!

571
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,640
I drink my sweat!

572
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,840
I achieved nirvana!

573
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,520
And took it home with me!

574
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,820
And I'm here to tell you, it ain't worth pee!

575
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,400
I've been crowbarred with my measles!

576
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:39,520
I eat eggs!

577
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,400
I leaped a plate from my nether parts!

578
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,940
And that's a fact!

579
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:47,140
I'm the big-footed devil of level 17!

580
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:51,200
I communicate, baby, without wires or strings!

581
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,500
I cram coca leaves right into my arm veins!

582
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,900
I'm a screamer!

583
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,700
I'm a lapper!

584
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,440
I've got six brains!

585
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,800
I'm insured for acts of God and Satan!

586
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,540
I bleed my lizard and keep time waitin'!

587
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,540
I'm fuel-injected!

588
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,220
I'll live forever!

589
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,620
I ran him out of heaven with a knee-glee lever!

590
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:19,620
They call me 666, and that's just fine!

591
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:26,860
But I'm here to tell you tonight, children, that my slack factor is 999!

592
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:36,540
Now, children, before I proceed with tonight's sermon,

593
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:40,680
I would just like to state here briefly and for the record

594
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:46,120
that my fellow doctors for Bob and myself gathered here in Portland, Oregon tonight

595
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,980
are all members, in good standing, of a church.

596
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,720
But not just any church, for the church to which we belong

597
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:01,680
just happens to be, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the world's only bogus true religion!

598
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:06,520
Of course, I am referring to the church of the subgenius!

599
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:12,500
Now, the church of the subgenius, as founded by J.R. Bob Dobbs,

600
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,860
the saint of sales and master of slack in 1953,

601
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,700
is the pan-religion of the future!

602
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:25,800
Uniting superior mutants, social renegades, twisted geniuses,

603
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:35,840
and sci-fi sinners in a worldwide rampage of immoral and prophetic yucks and grins!

604
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:43,160
Yucks and grins which will hopefully, inevitably, lead us directly to a commodity all too lacking

605
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:48,820
in today's modern, jet-age-a-go-go society, and that commodity, friends, is slack!

606
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,060
Now, slack is what the conspiracy wants to take away from us!

607
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,420
Slack is what the conspiracy wants to deprive us of!

608
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,440
Slack is our way of grabbing life by the lapel!

609
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,520
And Bob loving it!

610
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,560
Now, back in the 50s, children, Bob himself noticed,

611
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:10,840
a decided lack of slack in our culture!

612
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:15,980
He noticed an awful prevalence of normalcy!

613
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:21,880
He noticed that the normals formed a vast conspiracy against the different!

614
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:28,420
And insidious conspiracy children, dedicated to squelching our natural rogue instincts,

615
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,920
dedicated to wiping out our fun factory,

616
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,380
dedicated to obliterating our right to pee freely,

617
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:40,860
dedicated to trouncing on our inalienable right to launch golfer heads in our public schools!

618
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,480
Well, Bob wanted to fight this conspiracy, ladies and gentlemen,

619
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:50,040
and what better way, I ask ye, than by the foundation of a major, new, world, religion!

620
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,940
Hence, the Church of the Subgenius!

621
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:52,700
Praise Bob!

622
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,060
Help me, somebody!

623
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,720
Now, children, I live in Arkansas.

624
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,820
What the fuck?!

625
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:06,640
Way down at the end of this dirt road, when it rains real hard sometimes,

626
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,980
my driveway gets washed out.

627
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,160
And when that happens, I give, or I used to give, Otis a call.

628
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,480
Otis was a po-bucker.

629
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,700
Otis had a bulldozer.

630
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:23,260
And I would say, Otis, my driveway's looking like the Grand Canyon, you're gonna have to come fix it.

631
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,740
So my driveway got washed out, and I gave Otis a call, and said, Otis, you need to bring your bulldozer over.

632
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:32,600
And as fate would have it, that morning, I had received in the mail,

633
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,040
one of those body modification magazines.

634
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,600
And there, prominently featured in this body modification magazine,

635
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:49,240
was a very peculiar and singular body modification known as a subincision, or a metotomy.

636
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,380
Does anyone know what a subincision is?

637
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:57,780
What a subincision is, is, a guy takes a scalpel or a knife,

638
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,820
and he cuts his dick open, all the way up to the urethra,

639
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,820
peels it apart, lets it heal in two distinct flaps.

640
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:10,820
Well, this magazine had a two-page full-color spread of a subincision,

641
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,120
and I thought, this would be a good way to freak Otis out.

642
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,320
So I said, hey Otis, come up here, I want to show you something.

643
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,380
So Otis put down his two quarts of Diet Dr. Pepper, his large package of Twinkies,

644
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,580
spat out his tobacco, waddled up to the porch, and I said, hey Otis,

645
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,920
why do you think a man would do this to his own dick?

646
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,900
Well, Otis didn't hesitate one millisecond, children.

647
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,960
He looked at that picture, he looked me in the eye, and he said,

648
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,080
cause he's a dumbass.

649
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:45,760
Yeah! Children, I was still, I was astonished.

650
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:50,840
There, from the mouth of that barely literate, ill-educated povoker,

651
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,720
was the wisdom of the ages.

652
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:57,040
And the more I thought about what he said, the more I realized what he'd hit upon.

653
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,820
Why did that pig boy cut me off?

654
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,580
Because he was a dumbass!

655
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,980
Why did that waitress fuck up my breakfast order this morning?

656
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:19,880
Why did she bring me my eggs scrambled when I plainly ordered them magnetized?

657
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,720
Why did she do that, children?

658
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,320
Cause she's a dumbass!

659
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:29,700
Now children, I want to ask you, why in hell would anyone not send their thirty dollars

660
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:29,900
to a prostitute?

661
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:29,900


662
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:29,900


663
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:29,900


664
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,160
What's a bob? Why?

665
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:34,900
Hell yes!

666
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:42,320
Speaking of dumbasses, I often have the problem, people walk up to me and say,

667
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:47,300
well, Reverend Sternow, how do I know there is a bob?

668
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,720
How do I even know bob exists?

669
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,860
Well children, I'm going to tell you what to say to people like that,

670
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,380
because right here on this stage, right now,

671
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:03,220
I can prove the existence of J.R. Bob Dobbs using nothing but pure logic.

672
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:09,660
So the next time some doubting Thomas or Thomasina professes a disbelief in bob,

673
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,380
here's what you say.

674
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,500
If Jesus smoked Marlboro, there could be no bob.

675
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:22,620
If Jesus smoked Winstons, there could be no bob.

676
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:27,260
If Jesus smoked Kool, there could be no bob.

677
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:32,380
But children, Jesus doesn't smoke Marlboros, Winstons, or Kools.

678
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,820
What kind of cigarettes does Jesus smoke, children?

679
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,160
What kind does he smoke, children?

680
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:45,480
That's right! Jesus smoked Chesterfields, therefore there is a bob!

681
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,520
Winstons!

682
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,580
Now children,

683
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,680
as in any other major world religion,

684
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:05,260
the Church of the Subgenius has certain inalienable tenets,

685
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:09,440
certain basic precepts around which a life philosophy can be formed,

686
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,740
the most important of which are, number one,

687
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,400
the subgenius must have slack!

688
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,320
What must he have? Slack!

689
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,020
What must he have? Slack!

690
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,400
What must he have? Slack!

691
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,100
He must have slack!

692
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,360
Now the next rule of the Church of the Subgenius is,

693
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:31,420
and this is one that a lot of religions, particularly the Christians, really get into,

694
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,940
the next rule of the Church of the Subgenius is,

695
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,640
we don't practice what we preach,

696
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,560
because we're not the kind of people we're preaching to!

697
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:46,240
Now have you ever heard another church with the guts to admit that most basic of all religious principles?

698
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,360
Children say no!

699
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:47,800
No!

700
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,240
Children say no!

701
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:49,700
No!

702
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,680
Thank you children! Praise Bob!

703
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,360
Praise Bob!

704
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:52,780
Praise Bob!

705
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:53,040
Praise Bob!

706
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,300
Praise Bob!

707
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,040
And the last rule of the Church of the Subgenius I'd like to mention tonight is,

708
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:06,660
anybody you see driving a Lexus doesn't deserve it.

709
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,800
You deserve it and you deserve it and you deserve it and I deserve it.

710
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,260
They don't deserve it.

711
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,260
Do they deserve it? Say no!

712
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,100
No!

713
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,520
Do they deserve it? Say no!

714
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,160
No!

715
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,060
Do you deserve it? Say yes!

716
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:18,380
Yes!

717
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,340
Thank you children. Praise Bob!

718
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,160
Praise Bob!

719
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,360
Now the last rule of the Church of the Subgenius,

720
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:31,300
the last rule of the Church of the Subgenius I'd like to mention tonight, children,

721
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,820
is perhaps the most important rule of all,

722
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:39,340
or the final rule of the Church of the Subgenius.

723
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:43,700
The ultimate rule of the Church of the Subgenius is...

724
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,540
What's the big idea?

725
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,700
To paraphrase, the rule is,

726
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:56,280
if they cannot take a joke, then let them mount up upon themselves, friends.

727
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:15,520
If you are what they call different,

728
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,680
if you think...

729
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,420
we're entering a new dark ages,

730
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:25,700
if you view the entire universe

731
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:31,040
as one vast, morbid, cosmic joke,

732
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,300
if you are searching for an inherently bogus religion

733
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,540
that will condone superior degeneracy

734
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:43,660
and tell you that you are above everyone else,

735
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,120
the most important of all, children,

736
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:48,640
the most important,

737
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:52,380
if you can help us with a donation,

738
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,900
then the Church of the Subgenius may just provide you with the slack you've been lacking.

739
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,280
Now I'd like to finalize tonight here, children,

740
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,760
with a quote from Bob himself.

741
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:07,460
As he wrote in the Econometon,

742
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,520
the book of Neuronomics,

743
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,320
verse 16 in chapter 12,

744
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,040
the word S

745
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,680
is for the...

746
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:19,440
suckers

747
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,740
that live all around.

748
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,340
U is for you.

749
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,140
They're always putting you down.

750
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,960
B is for Bob.

751
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,340
He gives us our bread.

752
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,860
G is for the guns

753
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,100
they put to your head.

754
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,320
E is for the unit

755
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,400
they want you to become.

756
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,340
N is for nuts.

757
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,680
They wish they had some.

758
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,020
I is for the eye

759
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,380
in the back of my head.

760
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,420
U is for us.

761
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,680
They want to see us dead.

762
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,500
S is for the shit

763
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,380
that flows all around.

764
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,960
I'm a subgenius, mother...

765
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,200
and I ain't no...

766
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,180
clown.

767
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,680
I'm a subgenius, mother...

768
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:18,680


769
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:18,680


770
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,320
winning one place.

771
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:23,320


772
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,180
What's he say to us,

773
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,180
and children of mankind?

774
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:29,140
Vermont!

775
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,800
Te mismo!

776
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,160
Less look-guys!

777
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,780
V hyanour on d'aé...

778
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,060
Vietnam's flag 높.

779
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:40,660
I act as corpse bait,

780
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:41,540
here, praying on a limb,

781
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:41,540


782
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:41,540


783
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,760
God rest their feet.

784
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:43,900
Why say we should take

785
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:44,840
blood, seeds and bread for empty bodies,

786
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,580
after they were to sell them?

787
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:46,800
Draw.

788
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,980
Well, friends, I just about forgot to mention...

789
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,360
Darn it, the phone's ringing now.

790
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:03,680
Well, that's just one of the hazards of doing your radio show from your home, dear friends.

791
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:11,700
And I'd just about like to forget that Negative Land should be credited there.

792
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:19,740
Negative Land actually... Negative Land is five or six guys, and in this case it was Mark Hosler,

793
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:27,020
with a couple of local friends, Reverend Bunny Boy, and another guy I can't remember who did the sound effects

794
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:36,000
and music backup for Pope Sternodoc's amazing, really, really impressive subgenius rant,

795
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:41,320
which I should mention, oh, this is Sternodoc playing bass in the background, too.

796
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:42,700
Doctor's for Bob.

797
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:52,620
I should mention that that rant he did was actually a compilation of some of the classic old-timey subgenius rants,

798
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,280
The Brag by yours truly.

799
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:02,280
Sternod himself, I think, penned the explanation, and because he's a dumbass,

800
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:11,320
the rules are based on Pope David N. Meyer's classic rules of the Church of the Subgenius Rant,

801
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:17,360
and the final thing subgenius was actually Brother Cleve Duncan.

802
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:23,900
Praise Bob, Sternodoc just skimmed the finest cream right off the top.

803
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:24,180


804
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,480
Mmm!

805
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:27,760
Mmm!

806
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,240
Mmm!

807
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:30,740
Mmm!

808
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:31,400
Mmm!

809
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:33,520
Mmm!

810
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:33,680
Mmm!

811
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,320
Mmm!

812
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:34,760
Mmm!

813
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:35,100
Mmm!

814
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:35,460
Mmm!

815
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:35,960
Mmm!

816
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:36,380
Mmm!

817
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:36,380


818
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:36,640
Mmm!

819
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,200
Mmm!

820
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:37,560


821
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:37,560


822
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:39,120


823
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:39,180


824
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:41,460
Mmm!

825
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,240
Mmm!

826
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,400
Mmm!

827
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:51,440


828
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:52,020


829
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:52,040


830
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:52,040


831
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:52,040


832
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:52,040


833
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:52,040


834
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:52,040


835
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:52,040


836
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:52,040


837
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:52,040


838
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:52,040


839
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:52,040


840
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:52,040


841
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:54,160
Mmm!

842
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:55,080


843
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:55,080


844
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:55,080


845
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:55,520
Mmmm!

846
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:56,420
Mmm!

847
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:56,500
Mmm!

848
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:56,740
Mmm!

849
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:57,340


850
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,340
Ooooh, right.

851
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:05,540


852
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:07,860


853
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:07,860


854
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:07,860


855
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:07,860


856
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:07,860


857
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:10,900


858
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:11,640


859
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:11,640


860
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:11,640


861
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:11,640


862
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:11,640


863
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:11,640


864
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:11,640


865
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:11,640


866
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:11,640


867
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:11,640


868
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:11,640


869
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:11,640


870
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:11,640


871
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:11,640


872
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:11,640


873
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:11,640


874
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:11,640


875
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:11,640


876
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:11,640


877
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:11,640


878
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:11,640


879
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:11,640


880
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:15,120
That's ridiculous. You know what this stuff does to you?

881
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,120
It actually weakens your will.

882
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:21,060
Takes away the capacity for free and creative thought

883
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,300
and makes you a slave to the state.

884
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,700
Don't you ever wonder about all these militia groups?

885
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,200
Survivalist-type kooks on the right-wing side?

886
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:33,700
They say that they're defending the country from the UN troops.

887
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,360
These guys are yelling so loud, my theory is,

888
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:37,700
and this is a conspiracy, pal,

889
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:40,620
that they are the UN troops and that they're in place.

890
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,520
The infrastructure's ready, it's just a fading off.

891
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,100
When the time comes, they'll just take over and we'll all be toast.

892
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,380
Oswald, yeah, Oswald, that's what I said, Oswald.

893
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,740
He said, I'm just a patsy, and that means that he didn't do it.

894
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,200
But this, I think this is what's been causing the problem.

895
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,740
I mean, this is the third issue this year.

896
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:57,260
Conspiracy theory, I give you conspiracy theory.

897
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,500
It's a... This is my newsletter.

898
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,460
I think it's got him scared.

899
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:05,580
You know? I must have hit a nerve with one of those articles in there.

900
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,880
Otherwise, you know, they're pretty pissed off about something, and that's...

901
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,540
The space shuttle site.

902
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:11,100
The seismic secret.

903
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,380
The Oliver Stone-George Bush connection. Oliver Stone.

904
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:18,240
Oh, yeah. Sure.

905
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,460
I mean, he's their spokesman.

906
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,820
Yeah. I mean, you think if anyone had the information that he's got

907
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:27,780
and had a national podium to shout it from,

908
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,020
that they'd actually let him do it?

909
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:32,100
No, it's quite clear that he's a disinformation junkie for them.

910
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,000
The fact that he's still alive says it all.

911
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,500
I mean, he probably should be dead, but he's not.

912
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,200
Can you prove any of this?

913
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:44,220
Oh. No. Absolutely not.

914
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:46,620
A good conspiracy is an unprovable one.

915
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,180
If you can prove it, I mean, they must have screwed up somewhere along the line,

916
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,760
and if that's the case, well...

917
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,440
They?

918
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:56,520
They.

919
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:57,360
Yeah.

920
00:50:59,000 --> 00:50:59,640
They who?

921
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,700
They. Well, they...

922
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:06,200
I... I don't know. That's why they call them they.

923
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,300
And... and... them, you know?

924
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:11,520
And where does Jonas fit in?

925
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,060
Oh, he's one of they. He's one of them. He's them.

926
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:16,140
I mean, for sure. I mean, I know.

927
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:17,840
They... them?

928
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:18,240
Them.

929
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,700
I suppose they have a secret handshake.

930
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:23,340
Yeah.

931
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:26,980
Well... well, no. How would I know?

932
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:29,480
I'm just... I'm not one of them. I'm just, you know, horsing around.

933
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,740
Well, that was way underground, Daddy-O.

934
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,440
I mean, that was like, you know... I don't know...

935
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,080
Williamsburg, is that still happy? That's kind of passé.

936
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,980
Now, where do all the ultra-weirdos go now?

937
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,560
I was playing with the Williamsburg Leprechauns.

938
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,400
Yeah. Did I...

939
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:40,680
Yeah.

940
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,420
What was the deal on that? They were running the place.

941
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:42,420


942
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,240
Yeah, they were running that place for years. That's how they got it on TV.

943
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,980
You got... you got it on footage, Nick?

944
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:49,500
Oh, sure.

945
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,680
Oh, man. How do you get it off your feet like that?

946
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:52,900
Well...

947
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,580
That's a soulful thing that he does.

948
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,580
No, I mean, really. You saw them?

949
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,520
Yeah, yeah, no, no. I was there. Yeah, yeah.

950
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,180
Actually, Dave... Dave has been spirit-channeling.

951
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:04,420
The whole Williamsburg Leprechaun thing was... shoot, that was...

952
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,760
Oh, God, you know, Liddy and all those people.

953
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,440
Gordon Liddy was involved on it?

954
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,600
Sure. Of course.

955
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:11,440
What was he doing like that?

956
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,280
Anybody in Virginia, you know...

957
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:19,280
Oh, geez, man. We're talking about a pretty X-rated connection there with the 700 Club and the Dirty Money and the Slush.

958
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,480
Sure. Yeah.

959
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:24,280
Boy, well, you said it on this here air right now, didn't you, Bleep? I mean, it's...

960
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,140
Do you think I don't remember?

961
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,080
Well, I hope you better look out your window tonight if you keep on talking about it. You know what I'm saying?

962
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,660
Oh, I'm not really talking about it. That's the whole thing.

963
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,520
We're just alluding to it vacuously.

964
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:34,740
Right, right, right.

965
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,720
But it... it all... look.

966
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,220
It always knows what you're thinking.

967
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:38,680
It's always thinking anyway.

968
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,220
Yeah, that's the problem.

969
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:46,940
So you might as well just like, you know, as we used to say in college back in the fraternity, in the secret fraternity, embrace the tentacle.

970
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:51,800
Embrace the tentacle and then the tentacle flows away from you.

971
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:55,040
And just let it suck everything out of you? I mean, come on, man. I mean...

972
00:52:55,040 --> 00:53:00,260
Well, yeah, but by the time it does that, you know, you're it. You don't care, you know?

973
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,000
I don't know. Maybe it's a New York thing again.

974
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:06,820
What, letting it... just letting the tentacle suck everything out of you? That's a New York thing?

975
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,020
Come on, man. Take a ride to...

976
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,840
Or a car symphony or something or... or a net con or someplace.

977
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:11,440
It's the woo weed!

978
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,120
No, no, no, no. Look, look, look, look.

979
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,940
Path of least resistance, the woo weed.

980
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:17,780
There's so many tentacles anyway...

981
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:18,140
Yeah.

982
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:21,120
...that if you embrace it enough...

983
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:21,580
Yeah.

984
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:26,220
...if you embrace the tentacle and stroke it enough, it thinks it's sucking more out of you than it is.

985
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:27,440
But it's not really.

986
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:28,600
Well...

987
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,540
But it lets up some then, Dave. You see?

988
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:36,980
It's a whole combination where you... you increase your tolerance for being sucked and it...

989
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:42,920
...at the same time, that one tentacle, if you... if you get... become into... it's a matter of being in a depth with this thing, you know?

990
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,260
Learning to drive it, as we call it.

991
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:54,520
If you learn how to drive the tentacle, it... it... it doesn't... you know, it eventually starts seeking more nourishment elsewhere without knowing it.

992
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:58,540
Dude, do you get a license or you gotta take a test or anything like that? Because I'm bad with numbers and stuff.

993
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:03,660
Well, you know, you train... it's like a tantric thing. You have to train yourself with prairie squid.

994
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:09,540
You go... you go all the way up the ladder, man? I mean, you know, you're one of them guys who go all the way with a prairie squid, all the way up to the top?

995
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,080
Well, sure.

996
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:10,980
Shit, man.

997
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:13,960
If you can't climb the ladder, then you shouldn't be taking the stairs.

998
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,700
Well, I... I really can't get...

999
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:15,700


1000
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:18,120
I can't get it past good old number two, if you know what I mean.

1001
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:22,600
Well, if you can't climb the ladder, you shouldn't be taking the stairs. And you can write that down, kids.

1002
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:23,720
Okay, well, I...

1003
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,780
That's what I always said and that's what I...

1004
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:26,400
Is that like a...

1005
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,220
...still ascertained?

1006
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:27,840
...bleepoism?

1007
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:28,980
That's a truism...

1008
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:29,040
Yeah, yeah.

1009
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,300
...but it's also a falsity or a... a paraphrase.

1010
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,000
False, yes.

1011
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:36,700
But if we'd write it down, perhaps it would get... it would accrue more value as it sat on paper.

1012
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:37,180
Yes.

1013
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:38,000
But I... I don't...

1014
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,240
As is often the case.

1015
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:40,280
It's often the case.

1016
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:45,660
It's like... it's like when you think that someone else is in charge and then you look down and realize the steering wheel is in your hands.

1017
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:50,480
And you... you errantly look off and drive out of the parkway onto a bridge and get killed.

1018
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:50,700
Yeah, right.

1019
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:51,800
Well...

1020
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,020
That's the way I look at it, too.

1021
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,980
Just a little ball of meat in a metal can.

1022
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:59,620
Well, you become... but again, you become... you have to hurdle that ball of meat.

1023
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:01,080
Oh, no.

1024
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,540
You have to be a self-hurdling ball of meat.

1025
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:04,160
Oh, no.

1026
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:04,840
Sweetness.

1027
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:05,340
Oh.

1028
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,280
You know what I'm saying?

1029
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,580
No, of course.

1030
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:07,820
You hear me?

1031
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:12,940
As you're... as you're... as you're hurdling your meat self forward, you know...

1032
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:13,220
I... I...

1033
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:14,480
I sense a song coming on, man.

1034
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,340
Are you gonna give us one?

1035
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,820
As you sense your...

1036
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:18,160
I'm sorry.

1037
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,260
No, no, no.

1038
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:19,900
I didn't hear that one.

1039
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,340
No, I thought you were gonna do it.

1040
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:29,900
As you sense your meat going forward, and the car is gray.

1041
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:37,720
May you always look to a word.

1042
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:39,460
Amen.

1043
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:40,600
Amen.

1044
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:41,700
Oh, I forget the rest.

1045
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:41,940
Sing it.

1046
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,400
All the... the... the way.

1047
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,160
That's right.

1048
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:47,600
That's right.

1049
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,420
And then...

1050
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:51,020
All the way back there again.

1051
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:52,880
Sing it first, please.

1052
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:58,540
Yeah, and then there's the whole thing about the spam... not the... it's... it's... it's...

1053
00:55:58,540 --> 00:55:59,780
it's the whole luncheon meat announcement.

1054
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:01,780
I don't want to say spam because it's overused.

1055
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:05,820
Yeah, spam's overused, but you could maybe allude to fritters or something.

1056
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,380
No, not fritters.

1057
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:07,300
I mean, what do they call it?

1058
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,160
Mortadella or sausages.

1059
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:09,660
I'm sorry.

1060
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:11,020
Yeah, little Vienna sausages.

1061
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:16,440
It... it means that the actual substance of stuff stuck together tightly and then re-vacuumed

1062
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,420
and then re-stuck together again is pretty much what we're in right now.

1063
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,600
And it's getting thicker or something.

1064
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:21,820
Yeah.

1065
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:22,040
I don't...

1066
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,400
El Nino's just one example of it, too.

1067
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:24,740
Yeah.

1068
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:25,480
It's...

1069
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,800
I mean, that whole thing, coming down the pike like that.

1070
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,760
And why did it come down the...

1071
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:30,860
It's stuck in your wall of meat self.

1072
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:31,640
At me.

1073
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,700
And you, personally.

1074
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,160
And me.

1075
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,260
See, that's the thing.

1076
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,460
It's got a monogram, Daddy.

1077
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:35,920
And you.

1078
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:36,420
You're me.

1079
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,100
I'm you.

1080
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,320
And so that's why I come after all of you.

1081
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,920
Because you are me and I am you.

1082
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,020
We are not together because I am paranoid.

1083
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:45,000
We are not together but I'm paranoid.

1084
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:49,780
And listeners out there in Radio Land, we are all of you and you are us, too.

1085
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:51,820
We are...

1086
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:52,420
But that... you knew that.

1087
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:54,160
I didn't have to... that was just stupid.

1088
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:56,040
That was baby stuff for me to tell you that.

1089
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:59,540
I know, but I'm still devastated because I can't really remember very much of it.

1090
00:56:59,560 --> 00:56:59,740
I know, but I'm still devastated because I can't really remember very much of it.

1091
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:03,560
You know, I studied for so many years at the smelly feet of the masters and...

1092
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:03,800
Yeah.

1093
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,780
And now what do I wake up with but a headache and a few bad, you know, a few bad memories.

1094
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:09,480
You know, it's just not right.

1095
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,000
I mean, I think it's not right.

1096
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:11,920
I think it's not right.

1097
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:12,580
But...

1098
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:15,300
But I can think we is gonna sing about 83D Squids.

1099
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,760
Oh, man, we're all gonna sing it.

1100
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,460
Dave, come on.

1101
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:18,920
Does Bleepo have a copy, too?

1102
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:19,260
Yes.

1103
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,000
No, Bleepo doesn't have a copy.

1104
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:21,220
He can sing along.

1105
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:21,620
Hey, man, why...

1106
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:22,820
But the chorus goes like this, Bleepo.

1107
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:23,180
Okay.

1108
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:24,420
83D Squids...

1109
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:25,040
Oh, he'll get it.

1110
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:29,620
Falling from the sky, 83D Squids, man, they get me so high.

1111
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:30,980
I think that's a drug reference.

1112
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,880
83D Squids, now they're falling.

1113
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:34,540
Oh, no.

1114
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:35,100
Oh, no.

1115
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,760
83D Squids, I got...

1116
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,380
I got them head to toe.

1117
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,900
But that changes in each chorus, so you'll just...

1118
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:42,980
You'll feel it, Bleepo.

1119
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:44,380
Is this the Bob Denver version?

1120
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:45,000
Yeah.

1121
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:45,460
Okay.

1122
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:46,860
Hey, mine's written in Russian.

1123
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,340
This is a...

1124
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:48,200
One, two...

1125
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,160
Oh, it's upside down.

1126
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:50,380
One, two, three, four.

1127
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,940
83D Squids...

1128
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:54,600
Falling from the sky, 83D Squids...

1129
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,760
They put me in the eye.

1130
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:56,780
We don't need a drum meet.

1131
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:57,540
83D Squids...

1132
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:57,820
Yeah, we do.

1133
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:58,640
Gave me real good love.

1134
00:57:59,140 --> 00:57:59,600
83D Squids...

1135
00:57:59,600 --> 00:57:59,600


1136
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:00,260
83D Squids...

1137
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:02,880
But can Bleepo hear the beat?

1138
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:03,760
I don't know.

1139
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:04,400
He can feel it, man.

1140
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:04,620
Come on.

1141
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:05,700
I can hear the music.

1142
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,840
He can feel the beat from a trans...

1143
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1144
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:08,880
It's not transcon.

1145
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,560
Is this a beat?

1146
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:10,980
Is this a bass beat?

1147
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,240
Well, if he can hear the music...

1148
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,080
If you can hear the music, he'll be able to.

1149
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:14,840
Afro-Norwegian kind of...

1150
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:15,180
I hear that.

1151
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,140
Afro-Norwegian kind of...

1152
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:16,520
He can hear it.

1153
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:17,600
He can hear it.

1154
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:22,880
A one, a two, a one, two, three, four.

1155
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:29,600
83D Squids, falling from the sky, 83D Squids, man, they get me so high.

1156
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:36,320
83D Squids, now they're falling, oh, no, 83D Squids, come on, let's go.

1157
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:44,680
We were driving down the road.

1158
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,800
Something started to snow.

1159
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:54,280
Well, it looked like nothing unknown that we had ever seen before.

1160
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,340
Came to flow.

1161
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,600
83D Squids, falling from the sky.

1162
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,420
83D Squids.

1163
00:58:59,420 --> 00:58:59,580
83D Squids.

1164
00:58:59,580 --> 00:58:59,580


1165
00:58:59,580 --> 00:58:59,580


1166
00:58:59,580 --> 00:58:59,580


1167
00:58:59,580 --> 00:58:59,580


1168
00:58:59,580 --> 00:58:59,580


1169
00:58:59,580 --> 00:58:59,580


1170
00:58:59,580 --> 00:58:59,580


1171
00:58:59,580 --> 00:58:59,580


1172
00:58:59,580 --> 00:58:59,580


1173
00:58:59,580 --> 00:58:59,580


1174
00:58:59,580 --> 00:58:59,580


1175
00:58:59,580 --> 00:58:59,580


1176
00:58:59,580 --> 00:58:59,580


1177
00:58:59,580 --> 00:58:59,580


1178
00:58:59,580 --> 00:58:59,580


1179
00:58:59,580 --> 00:58:59,580


1180
00:58:59,580 --> 00:58:59,580


1181
00:58:59,580 --> 00:58:59,580


1182
00:58:59,580 --> 00:58:59,580


1183
00:58:59,580 --> 00:58:59,580


1184
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,720
83-D squid.

1185
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:02,460
83-D squid.

1186
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,000
83-D squid.

1187
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,740
83-D squid.

1188
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,320
83-D squid.

1189
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,080
I got him head to toe.

1190
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,460
I'm afraid this child's covered with 83-D squid, doctor.

1191
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:19,280
Look at them wiggly squids.

1192
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,960
We pulled off to the side.

1193
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:27,180
We just knew they wanted to ride.

1194
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:30,480
The sweetest squid you'll ever know.

1195
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:33,780
Blow you right through the door.

1196
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:38,420
83-D squids falling from the sky.

1197
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:40,380
83-D squids.

1198
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,000
83-D squids.

1199
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,500
83-D squids.

1200
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:43,500


1201
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:45,000
Now they're falling, oh no.

1202
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,780
83-D squids.

1203
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,420
Here comes a tentacle.

1204
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:51,340
No, no, it's two.

1205
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:52,740
Three.

1206
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:56,780
Watch out, there's three or four squids over there.

1207
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:58,780
Oh my God, one of them is a great squid.

1208
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:02,000
It's okay, embrace the tentacle, boys, embrace the tentacle.

1209
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:03,280
Embrace the tentacle.

1210
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:07,180
Oh yeah.

1211
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,000
Okay, embrace the squid.

1212
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,140
Come on, officers, on your knees.

1213
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:14,140
Oh, don't it feel good?

1214
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,560
I always embrace the squid back at the station house.

1215
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:22,900
I said, if you're ever out on your ride,

1216
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,200
don't think you have to hide.

1217
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,160
Oh.

1218
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:27,560
Is that right, captain?

1219
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:27,820
Oh, oh.

1220
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:29,280
I want you to see some hairy pink, pink snow.

1221
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:32,060
Coming down.

1222
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:32,500
Oh, oh, oh.

1223
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:32,640
Oh, no, no.

1224
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:36,840
Coming down from the sky.

1225
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,880
Just pull out, oh, let them come inside.

1226
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,240
Falling prairie quid is the best, best kind.

1227
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:49,120
And you sub-dinies enjoy the ride in the M83-D squids.

1228
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:50,400
They're only getting bigger.

1229
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,480
83-D squids.

1230
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,040
One of them is your sister.

1231
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,180
83-D squids.

1232
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:56,740
It's all right, it's all right.

1233
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:57,080
No, no.

1234
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,840
83-D squids.

1235
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:00,560
Now, that's slack galore.

1236
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,320
83-D squids.

1237
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:03,480
Get me some.

1238
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,400
Oh, 83-D squids.

1239
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,100
They're falling from the sky.

1240
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:08,540
83-D squids.

1241
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:10,400
Come on.

1242
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:11,780
83-D squids.

1243
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:14,060
I can't believe it, mom.

1244
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,020
I can't believe we got this far.

1245
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,540
I can't believe we got this far.

1246
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:18,940
There.

1247
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:19,760
Hmm.

1248
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:25,160
Don't congratulate yourself yet.

1249
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,720
We still have the squids to get you.

1250
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:26,720


1251
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:26,720


1252
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:26,720


1253
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:26,720


1254
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:26,720


1255
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:26,720


1256
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:26,720
