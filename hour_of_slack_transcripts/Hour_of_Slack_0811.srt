1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,880
Hey, well alright sir, here we go then, what are they gonna give for him?

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,200
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

3
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,340
That's the most incredible performance I've ever seen.

4
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,820
And look, the one with the sandwich hat thinks it's giving birth to something, I guess.

5
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:41,960
Ewwwww!

6
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,680
A thing with a sandwich hat!

7
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,660
A gift for you!

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,260
A gift for each and every one of you!

9
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,980
Hey, these slackers didn't even donate last week. What should we do about it?

10
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,360
They were slappers.

11
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,640
Oh really? This show didn't get much support?

12
00:00:59,820 --> 00:00:59,980
No.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,760
From the believers?

14
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,240
No.

15
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:03,340
Wow.

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,480
Alright, there they are again. We get the most people on the internet.

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,060
Not one of them, not one of you people called in to donate to this show last week. Not one of you.

18
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:13,660
I've been a bit of a stalemate.

19
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,300
They're not only slackers, they're all like, you're all like slackers.

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,260
Not even Reverend Turin, I'm surprised.

21
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:18,660
None of them.

22
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,180
He always, he always used to donate.

23
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,000
Well the only way you can redeem yourself is to call up during business hours tomorrow and put in a donation.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,980
But I'm, I'm disgusted with y'all actually.

25
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:36,560
Bob's calling me home. I'm going home my friend. I'm going home. Bob doesn't call me home.

26
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,940
He doesn't want to, he's not going to listen anymore to your garbage.

27
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:45,500
And that means we can't do any more of our garbage. If you ain't going to pay for it, you pay your garbage man.

28
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,940
Why don't you pay Lonesome Cowboy Dave to bring you garbage?

29
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:55,120
How about Mr. Egalitarian Fartbushel and some of those other people who have not connected with their dues for the last five year plans?

30
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,960
These people are not only remiss in their doodads, they're also completely and totally ungrateful.

31
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,640
They're useless as far as I'm concerned. They're useless.

32
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:11,100
You know they listen to this stuff as if air was free. As if somehow radio broadcasting was something that was done without any formal...

33
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,600
Do you think they're getting free radio waves in Afghanistan?

34
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh it's as if you had unlimited brain cells Dave.

35
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,200
They think we have little tin cans and were yelling into the one part real hard...

36
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:29,940
Dave, these are little tin cans connected together by strings and we are yelling into the one part real hard.

37
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,040
And, friends, it's because Bob did call me home.

38
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:42,720
This is the subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack, dear friends.

39
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,580
Does it sound a little crappy this time?

40
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,380
Well, it's like this.

41
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:55,680
I was in my white tassel in the clouds in Cleveland in my slick sound studio

42
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,380
about to spend last week's hour of Slack

43
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:07,680
when I got a call from HQ that I was urgently needed back home in Texas.

44
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,600
Bob called me home immediately.

45
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,200
Four hours later, I was on a plane, friends, and now here I am in Texas,

46
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,880
in fact, on a remote cattle ranch way out in the boonies.

47
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,600
Now, my dire mission has been accomplished,

48
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,660
but now it's time.

49
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,560
It's time to finally get that hour of Slack done.

50
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,520
And what do I have to produce it with, my friends?

51
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,280
Why, I've got all of subgenius needs.

52
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:44,020
A bad cold, duct tape, bailing wire, twine, some popsicle sticks,

53
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,560
my mom's boom box, which is what I'm talking into right now,

54
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,000
some blank cassettes.

55
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,340
Remember those, friends?

56
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,080
Cassette tapes from Radio Shack.

57
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,500
As you can tell by the low noise that comes free with every Radio Shack tape.

58
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,880
It's the only kind of tape you can get out in the boonies.

59
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:08,420
But, my friends, I brought with me two uncut ESO Swamp radio shows

60
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:13,760
from WCSB Cleveland, and I've got my dad's CDs,

61
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,400
which include Hank Williams, Roy Acuff, Cab Calloway, and so forth.

62
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,660
So, bear with me, my dear friends, on this,

63
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,060
the very first hour of Slack.

64
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,500
Slack done the old way in two years.

65
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,160
Mixed and duplicated on cheap tape decks.

66
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,760
And for this one time only at the Dobbs Bar Sinister Ranch

67
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,320
in Stangsville, Texas.

68
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,220
The All Stang Family Special is this one, friends.

69
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,560
Co-starring ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB Cleveland.

70
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,500
Starring Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

71
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,020
Mrs. Smith, Princess We Are Doe.

72
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,420
And yours, truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

73
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,240
Friends, I can't edit very well on these decks,

74
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,480
and they probably won't sound all that great,

75
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,120
but by gobs, the word about doesn't have to sound that great.

76
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,100
So, let's go back.

103
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:59,980
I heard the crash on the highway

104
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:05,620
But I didn't hear nobody pray

105
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,500
When I heard the crash on the highway

106
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,480
I knew what it was from the start

107
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,140
I went to the scene of destruction

108
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:29,260
And a picture was stamped on my heart

109
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,060
There was whiskey and blood all together

110
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,080
Mixed with glass where they lay

111
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,820
Death laid her hand in destruction

112
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,000
But I didn't hear nobody pray

113
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,940
I wish I could change this sad story

114
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,820
That I am now telling you

115
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,440
But there is no way I can change it

116
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,680
For somebody's life is now through

117
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,120
And I wish I could change this sad story

118
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,060
But there is no way I can change it

119
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,060


120
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,860
Their soul has been called by the master

121
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,860
They died in a crash on the way

122
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:40,740
And I heard the groans of the dying

123
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:46,420
But I didn't hear nobody pray

124
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,340
I didn't hear nobody pray

125
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:58,220
Yeah, brother, I didn't hear nobody pray

126
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,300
I heard the crash on the highway

127
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:10,440
But I didn't hear nobody pray

128
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,260
Dave, I heard they're broadcasting us on Radio Free Afghanistan.

129
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,420
Well, I heard the Northern Alliance...

130
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,320
That's to show how bad America is.

131
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:22,600
Yeah.

132
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,480
Well, they had one of those...

133
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,100
This is what they have to listen to in America.

134
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,220
They call themselves free, and they are free to listen to garbage!

135
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,080
It's Dave, Lone Cow Dave, man.

136
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,160
And free to correct themselves.

137
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,600
He and Bert, evil Bert, puppet devil.

138
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:41,180
And free to have those really awful one-night-a-pancake, three-nights-a-sausage dinners

139
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,460
that they're having at Pickelodeon Bill's or some of those other places.

140
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,800
This is where they're giving people regressive fametergy.

141
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,920
We evil doers, we hate freedom.

142
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,100
So do we.

143
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,040
We are evil doers.

144
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,420
Oh, you are evil doer, too?

145
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,220
Yes, I am.

146
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
Oh, let us be evil doers together.

147
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,220
Well, it takes more than one evil doer to make evil doers.

148
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,140
I know, let's have a war.

149
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,360
We can make a lot of money.

150
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,200
We'll make a big war.

151
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:02,860
Yes, yes.

152
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,480
Let's make a big war.

153
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,820
You be evil doer number one, I'll be evil doer number two.

154
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,320
And together we will be the evil doers.

155
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,280
We've had big fights.

156
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,180
We get rid of surpassed populations.

157
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,360
We sell tons of gunpowder.

158
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,440
And we get rid of all the soapstones.

159
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,900
And all of the alternative pizzas.

160
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,140
Yes, the psychic pizzas.

161
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,620
And then, of course, the...

162
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,220
Oh, this is fun and easy to be.

163
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:22,820
Evil doers.

164
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,280
What the hell are you guys talking about?

165
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,100
And they're 14.

166
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,260
And people want to know what you're talking about.

167
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,880
Look at this rocket launcher I've got.

168
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,940
Can you explain?

169
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,420
People, yeah, people, sure.

170
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,220
People want to know what you're talking about.

171
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,500
What are you talking about?

172
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,620
In the old days, back a long time ago,

173
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,540
before procreative girth was really invented,

174
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,560
people sprang into existence from underneath trees,

175
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,840
fully grown, with their hair and their hands

176
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,760
and the nails on their feet intact.

177
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,140
That's not explaining anything.

178
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,160
Yes, it is.

179
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,380
It's explaining the...

180
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,620
You're just getting to the good part, man.

181
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,780
Okay, this is the part that I...

182
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,880
What part did you not understand?

183
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,300
How can a...

184
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,400
Why does a...

185
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,920
Okay, you forgot.

186
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,860
When a mommy loves a daddy very, very much,

187
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,200
well, they get together and they feel very close.

188
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,820
And mommy's forehead looks kind of like a unicorn's foreskin.

189
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,200
It gets... His head gets actually bigger.

190
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,160
And then daddy's forehead actually...

191
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,160
You know, your hair shows up further breadth to it.

192
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,320
But really, why is a little bun still in fire?

193
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:27,760
You can imagine a small short what falls off the power supply

194
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,540
Once it's then directly pressed and thencićман starts to color theiin the applying it on.

195
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,480
uhm..

196
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,080
He is now learning more about entender own self and how to live bigger than part of your brain.

197
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,160
You couldn't help it.

198
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:46,000
Anytime it's the cake of your life.

199
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,960
the dex are still there for the winners.

200
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,360
Well, can you open up?

201
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,060
Your no, gosh.

202
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,060


203
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,100
There are some crazy amazing projects in the future.

204
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:52,300
So, can you sort them out?

205
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,140
It's not fair.

206
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,540
It's not fair.

207
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,580
Mutated children again.

208
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,480
And it doesn't look like we're ever going to get rid of them.

209
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,500
They seem to be procreating like trees or some other small mammal.

210
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,580
And I don't know if I can stand this much longer than...

211
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,160
Now, that's the character Dave does that we can never figure out.

212
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,840
That is mean old lady.

213
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,820
Kind of like women, old lady.

214
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:15,640
But sometimes there's a gay character that's very close to it.

215
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,200
Deep down inside.

216
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,880
No, the gay character is completely different.

217
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,540
Is it?

218
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,560
Is that any relation to the French character?

219
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,380
The favorite is the southern gay character.

220
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,480
So that's what this is.

221
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:37,200
Dave would be institutionalized if he didn't have this venue for letting all those creatures and entities and personalities.

222
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,840
Well, he was a hairdresser in Memphis, Tennessee for about 14 years.

223
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,540
And just really got tired of the whole thing down there.

224
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:47,980
Just...

225
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,320
Others call it a serious multiple personality disorder.

226
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,420
Yes, it's a form of schism indeed.

227
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,820
But is it a real party schism or something?

228
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,000
We as members of the international subgenius...

229
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,860
You can help these multiple personality disorder character actors...

230
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:12,580
...by donating to help their medicinal needs.

231
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,580
Medicine can help their condition.

232
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,880
Give me the little small frozen monkey hand.

233
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,380
And put them in a box.

234
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,160
Are you getting tired of Dave's standard 57 personalities?

235
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,020
Don't you wish he had more like 250 or 1,000?

236
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,420
Send more frock to Lone Cow Dave.

237
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,020
At Admiral Corporation Box 757577.

238
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,200
New York, New York 11307.

239
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,180
Well, I thought you could buy that as an upgrade.

240
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,820
All the Lone Cow Dave.

241
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,940
You could boot it.

242
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,980
Nightmares and insecurities and...

243
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,670
Supposedly those can be good.

244
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,310
Those are very popular as compressed files on the internet.

245
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,030
Well, the horrific visions came as a separate disc.

246
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,650
I had to buy horrific visions separately.

247
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,230
Oh, you paid money for that?

248
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,990
Oh, man, that had a triple X disclaimer on it.

249
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,610
Well, I needed the manual.

250
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,870
I couldn't figure certain things out, so I needed the manual.

251
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,530
Oh, you can download the manual.

252
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,470
The whole manual?

253
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,570
From the Dave brain cell manual.

254
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,030
It's only one brain cell.

255
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,090
I thought there were three.

256
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,630
So it's not like it's a real long...

257
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,210
It's a real long...

258
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:17,610
File.

259
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,390
Complete discret...

260
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,010
Discrete?

261
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,670
Or whatever they call them and stuff.

262
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,110
They're the size of your thumbnail.

263
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:27,370
And when you had that whole set, you didn't have to worry about hanging on your forepaw.

264
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:27,970
Right.

265
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:28,330
Or like...

266
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:33,750
The instruction manual for you, Dave, is a lot more complicated than the brain cell itself.

267
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:37,130
I thought it had the two brain cells so you could rub them together.

268
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:37,890
Isn't that...

269
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:38,970
I thought that was the whole...

270
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,230
That's the missing Mrs. Dave.

271
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,450
The anti-Dave.

272
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,050
The receptacular Dave.

273
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,270
I remember Scott Loshley.

274
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:46,670
Dave Vest.

275
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,150
14 years ago, Scott Loshley.

276
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:49,410
Dave Vest.

277
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,790
And just tried to walk out...

278
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:51,830
Daveena.

279
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,730
In a pair of little pink booty socks.

280
00:13:55,150 --> 00:14:00,290
And it wasn't the time of year to be walking around in the middle of a snowstorm in pink booty socks.

281
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,790
Especially if nearest highway was...

282
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,650
Popular cowgirl Dave.

283
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:05,630
Yeah, popular cowgirl Dave.

284
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,330
She only had 56 personnel.

285
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:12,410
If only her blood temperature was higher, she'd be here right now trying to suck on my booties.

286
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,490
But she just didn't quite get it.

287
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,030
You can't drink three pints of whiskey.

288
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,790
You can't walk around in the snow in your socks.

289
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,330
Pop cow Daveena.

290
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,210
Long cow Dave.

291
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:21,890
Long cow Dave.

292
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,250
Me so milky.

293
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,390
Yes, yes.

294
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,910
She did come from the old country, I guess you'd call it nowadays.

295
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,950
She was a visa bride, all right.

296
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,190
But I didn't get to see her very much.

297
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,130
Came across the country on a Conestoga.

298
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:35,930
Yep.

299
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,310
She was wearing one of those weird Vietnamese bonnets.

300
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:39,470
Singing like...

301
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,130
Oh, I can't tell you this and that.

302
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,910
Ordered from a Russian mail-order bride website.

303
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:47,990
Yeah.

304
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:48,810
Oh, yeah.

305
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,950
Have you checked out the Russian mail-order bride website?

306
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:52,590
No.

307
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,150
Latvia.

308
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,190
Oh, should I?

309
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,390
Yes, you should.

310
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,970
Latvia was so hot for you.

311
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:57,070
Yeah.

312
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:57,970
How much do they cost?

313
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,790
I don't know.

314
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,170
It depends.

315
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,770
They just want a new life over here, you know.

316
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:07,930
Then they divorce you and run off with some Russian guy that they had all planned.

317
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:13,350
And Mr. President, your stimulus package is in the other room, if you know what I mean.

318
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,470
Except genius and all slack.

319
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,870
Natasha, I guess, is her first name.

320
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:16,770
That's all you need to know.

321
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:17,090
Was saying that...

322
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,930
A friend of his had actually done that.

323
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:23,150
They'd gotten a picture of the Russian woman.

324
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:23,910
She was beautiful.

325
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,290
Hello, Mr. President.

326
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,990
And he went to Russia to meet her.

327
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:32,930
And strangely enough, all his friends were saying, no, man, it's going to be a lie, you know, when you get...

328
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,870
She was, just like in her picture, she was...

329
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,450
And she was an actress.

330
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,730
She wasn't a prostitute.

331
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:39,970
She was a singer.

332
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:43,930
But she was a schizo-screaming maniac.

333
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,470
Maybe that was lone...

334
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,350
Maybe that was Pop Cow Debina.

335
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,730
And why you think she only has two toes on each single...

336
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:53,150
So the guy had a leaf and he swore off...

337
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,730
He didn't marry her.

338
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,890
And she screamed at him the whole time.

339
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,970
The Russian mail-order bride screamed at him.

340
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,250
And she wasn't even a bride yet.

341
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,990
Then she sent him thousands of emails apologizing.

342
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,490
But it was too late.

343
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,350
The American millionaire had left.

344
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,430
She said she was an actress.

345
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,910
That's kind of like that Johnny Cash movie.

346
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:13,910


347
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:13,910


348
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:13,910


349
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,930
Johnny Cash on Teenage Queen.

350
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,810
Do you remember when he was on Morph...

351
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,210
He was on Acid, I think it was on...

352
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,430
Kill the Pop.

353
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,690
Remember Kill the Populous?

354
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,530
It was very popular around the Vietnam era.

355
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,430
Yeah, Johnny Cash was on Acid on Kill the Pop.

356
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,310
Remember Kill the Populous with Dick Cabbage?

357
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:29,970
Yeah, yeah, sure.

358
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,670
Okay, he was right in the middle of it.

359
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,530
And of course, they had the scene where like the union...

360
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,850
Ruth Buzzi was in that one.

361
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:35,630
Yeah, Ruth Buzzi.

362
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:36,710
She played the actually...

363
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,970
She played the parrot in the thing.

364
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,870
And she had the full headdress and everything like that.

365
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,050
And when they invite...

366
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:42,190
She was hot.

367
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:46,590
The members of the quote unquote Gaffer's Guild in there all help her...

368
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,150
Ruth Buzzi.

369
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,350
Stang's got a thing for Ruth Buzzi.

370
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,530
He does, he loved her.

371
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:57,410
She was in Far Out Space Nuts with Chuck McGann and Gilligan.

372
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:58,270
I think...

373
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,190
So you know they were fropping, man.

374
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,790
Well, you know what's going on in the internet now.

375
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,590
Yeah, right.

376
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,370
Maynard G. Krebs wasn't just allergic to work.

377
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,290
Yeah, right.

378
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,170
Yeah, they didn't call him Maynard.

379
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,410
He bobbed in for nothing.

380
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:20,190
The grim visage of Maynard G. Krebs as he lurks in your town.

381
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,830
No, he never went away.

382
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:23,470
He never died.

383
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,970
The program never went away in his mind.

384
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,750
Griselda was one of my role models growing up.

385
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:36,250
She was my first sexual encounter because Griselda, the witch, the evil witch of the

386
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:36,910
north, was it?

387
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:37,250
South?

388
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,070
No, I...

389
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,950
What were you talking about?

390
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:40,650
Dobie Gillis.

391
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:44,230
Oh, I thought you were talking about Hector Pelvis Cube or what?

392
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:44,930
What was that one guy?

393
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,790
No, the girl that was really, you know, bookish, the bookish girl.

394
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,970
Right, with the huge eyeballs and the weird like Dobie ears.

395
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,150
I always wanted Dobie to like her.

396
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:56,830
Right, but she was a pathetic laughing stock because she had glasses.

397
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:58,890
Do you remember watching Yogi...

398
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,370
Little Wrinkle Nose Girl?

399
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,650
Do you remember Yogi Satyananda?

400
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,650
Remember, remember, I think it was Morning Cube with Yogi Satyananda.

401
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,630
We would sit around in the regular morning cube.

402
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:10,630


403
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,050
Or a small circle, examining each other's navels.

404
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,890
We are a very social group.

405
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:22,050
We do not contemplate our own navels but the navels of our friends and families.

406
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:36,110
Now, some of the shows, if you play the tape back, they do make sense, then there's the

407
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,070
ones like this.

408
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,450
Some of the shows are evil.

409
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,350
Yes.

410
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,570
Yes, some of those shows are evil.

411
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,010
But some are good.

412
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,310
Those are ignored.

413
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,630
No one cares for them.

414
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:45,870
They only like the evil.

415
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,510
And now you can tell the difference with an amazing new...

416
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,630
Craft Go.

417
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:53,490
Some of the horror shows are evil doers.

418
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,270
Bandwidth generator.

419
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:56,210
Horror shows.

420
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:59,110
Play each song backwards till your heart's content

421
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,990
and then listen in forward and reverse modes.

422
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,910
You'll know the good from the bad in just a very short period of time.

423
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,390
All at once?

424
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,290
Craft Go.

425
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,690
So, perplexing the young.

426
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,810
You'll pay to know what you really think.

427
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,130
And now I'm like...

428
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:21,910
There's slackers out there listening in on the internet and all that.

429
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,930
You left us hung and dry last week, didn't you?

430
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,170
Yeah.

431
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,250
They don't care.

432
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,610
They don't love Bob the way they used to.

433
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,650
They did not call.

434
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,310
Not only did they not call, they did a pledge.

435
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:35,250
They refused to believe the truth to stand.

436
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,830
We needed that money.

437
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,270
We needed it.

438
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:38,390
We needed it.

439
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:43,090
We had to buy blood for our executive staff.

440
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,870
Keith, because they're here all the time.

441
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:49,370
You have to keep a blood supply on your tap for them.

442
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:52,190
Now we don't have that backup blood supply.

443
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:53,690
I gave.

444
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,430
Princess, we here gave.

445
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,130
We gave.

446
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,170
We gave a part of our time.

447
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,770
Sad, sad documentary.

448
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,690
And they...

449
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:04,630
We gave more.

450
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,850
Oh, look at so many beautiful tropical birds.

451
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,070
So many beasts.

452
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:08,970
So many birds.

453
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,430
So many birds.

454
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,050
So many birds.

455
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:10,250
So many birds.

456
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:10,250


457
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:10,250


458
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:10,250


459
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:10,250


460
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:10,250


461
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:10,250


462
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:10,250


463
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:10,610
Look, look, look.

464
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,910
There's another shape emerging from the top of my forehead.

465
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,450
Well, it's time to sit down now.

466
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,210
I think I've gone one foot further than I...

467
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,890
Throw that thing in a box.

468
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:20,790
God, that...

469
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,590
We're going to have to get another box soon.

470
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,350
Dave, can you do something about that forehead?

471
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,190
Get this...

472
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:26,690
Get this...

473
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,110
Get this...

474
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,450
Get this...

475
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,130
Get this damn dog suit off me.

476
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,190
My knees are burning.

477
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,910
My knees are burning.

478
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,690
Turning my mic on.

479
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:38,730
Oh, I'm sorry.

480
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:39,890
I just thought...

481
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:40,750
I'm turning off.

482
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:41,970
I'm going to sit over here in the corner.

483
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:43,170
Turning on.

484
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:43,870
Off.

485
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:44,350
On.

486
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,850
I'm going to go sit in the corner.

487
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,970
I will no longer...

488
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:48,390
At the wall.

489
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,230
I will no longer sandbox.

490
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,730
I promise.

491
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,890
Put your mic back where it belongs.

492
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,230
And I promise I will not play bad.

493
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,790
Dave, look at these spiders over here.

494
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,230
The spiders are in your pocket, man.

495
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,370
Hey, I never saw this place before.

496
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,410
And I just...

497
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,230
What's under this couch?

498
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:08,470
I'm not going to get in there.

499
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,590
Don't touch that thing, Chaz!

500
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,050
Just take the one little knob off there.

501
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,710
Yeah, just so long as you've got some room to breathe.

502
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,910
A little bit of air to get in there.

503
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,030
Oh, man.

504
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,730
I think I ought to get out of here entirely.

505
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,630
Just leave the entire area.

506
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:22,130
I think...

507
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,450
I don't know.

508
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,350
I think it starts to collapse.

509
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,750
As Chaz enters the infrastructure of the building,

510
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:33,570
Rhodes Tower is built exactly like the World Trade Center's.

511
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,570
You can tell me, B.S. me.

512
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,150
Actually, Rhodes Tower does look...

513
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,090
It does look like the World Trade Center.

514
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:39,810
...like the Pyramids.

515
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,610
Kind of a miniature version of the World...

516
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,650
Well, what was the World Trade Center.

517
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,050
Yes, it was once at Giza.

518
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,850
Speaking of the World Trade Centers,

519
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:51,310
I hear that these movie stars are afraid to fly in airplanes.

520
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:56,170
Including Bruce Willis, it seems, refuses to fly in airplanes.

521
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,310
It seems that they want to stand up and go,

522
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:01,250
Oh, we want people to know that we care.

523
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,230
But they don't care enough to...

524
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,570
They aren't willing to die hard in real life.

525
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,070
No.

526
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,530
Only in movies.

527
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,490
Oh, yeah, that was a stuntman who died hard.

528
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,070
They just want everybody to watch their little award show

529
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,950
and watch them pat each other on the back.

530
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,930
Well, it's more than the back patting.

531
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:17,610
I think it's great.

532
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:20,390
I think if nobody goes to movies, good.

533
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,150
Yeah.

534
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:25,330
Knock them damn Hollywood people off that damn pedestal they're on.

535
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,630
I think the minister of home...

536
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,290
I think we should go see subgenius movies.

537
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,990
Yeah, and cartoons and midnight movies and old crazy stuff.

538
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,950
On the day after Thanksgiving,

539
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:38,130
the anti-world global conspiracy people,

540
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,870
say you should not buy anything.

541
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:43,990
And, of course, this is kind of a rough time to shake the economy.

542
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,030
Now, you must elaborate.

543
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,890
You should go.

544
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,410
I think you should go to...

545
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:54,870
Or, you know, you can also protest globalization by buying subgenius.

546
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,130
Making all the clothes.

547
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,310
Buy, but don't buy conspiracy.

548
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:00,250
Or by donating to this radio station.

549
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:00,770
Right.

550
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,290
Instead of buying that...

551
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,530
Donate radio station.

552
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,890
...Pootie and the Blowfish used CD...

553
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:06,890
Or that dozen donuts.

554
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:07,670
...to the...

555
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:08,850
WCSB.

556
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:09,590
Yeah, we could use the donuts.

557
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,930
Instead of going to see that Bruce Willis Hollywood movie,

558
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:13,790
go see that...

559
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,150
Crap.

560
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:17,050
...weird little art film that you heard might be good.

561
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:17,830
Oh, speaking of that...

562
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,410
It's only in one theater.

563
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,030
November 17th.

564
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,350
...the dreaming of pickerwoods with...

565
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,370
Speaking of weird little art movies...

566
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,070
Weird little art movies.

567
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,490
Speaking of weird little art movies.

568
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,330
November 17th.

569
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:28,710
Weird little art movies.

570
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,810
November 17th, Cobra Verity will be playing live music

571
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:35,070
at the Cleveland Cinematheque along with...

572
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:35,990
What's the name of that weird movie?

573
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,390
Sexual Thaumaturge.

574
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:37,670
Sexual Thaumaturge.

575
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,130
Sexual Thaumaturge.

576
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,270
The Andalusian Dog.

577
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,450
Yeah, your favorite dog.

578
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,950
The Salvador Dali and Louis Buñuel.

579
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:46,590
So this really crazy, surrealistic night out at the Cinematheque,

580
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:50,050
November 17th, with live music by Cobra Verity.

581
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,170
So, you know.

582
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,890
That should be a really artistic experience.

583
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,770
I'm going to wear, like, a Black Turtle-ish sweater.

584
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:56,850
I think the night before that,

585
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:00,530
I'm speaking at the Skeptics Society meeting.

586
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,610
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

587
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,730
They wanted to have a believer in...

588
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:05,970
Welcome once again...

589
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,270
They're so used to skeptics, they wanted...

590
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,010
...to the foolhardy...

591
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,730
Skeptics in Assen, as we like to call ourselves.

592
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:14,170
The lovely Mr. and Mrs. Reverend Ivan Stang.

593
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:15,490
We...

594
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,010
Nothing...

595
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:16,910
I'm a believer.

596
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,010
...needs no more further...

597
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,430
I believe in this man, J.R. Bob Dogg.

598
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,390
The face of J.R. Bob Dogg.

599
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,830
I believe in this face.

600
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,270
This face!

601
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,490
This dot-be-speckled,

602
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,970
real-cream-be-shining,

603
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,590
hairdo-ed face!

604
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,390
This pipe-gripping...

605
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,190
Usually excitable.

606
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,130
...floats against the TV.

607
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:38,130


608
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:38,130


609
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:38,130


610
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:38,130


611
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,310
That's the weird thing.

612
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,370
He is my Messiah.

613
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,930
Bob's grin is a clenched grin,

614
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:45,710
yet he has a pipe attached to his mouth somehow.

615
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:46,850
How can this be?

616
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:47,810
Is he missing a tooth?

617
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,930
Is that how the pipe sticks through,

618
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,790
even though he's gripping?

619
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:53,430
Adios, man.

620
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,810
Before you go off, you know, I'm sorry.

621
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,210
Und...

622
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,250
Und...

623
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:00,770
Und das...

624
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:01,410
Und das...

625
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,050
...lachmache...

626
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,930
Guido, silent, they leave the room.

627
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:06,470
Guido.

628
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:06,790
Guido.

629
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:07,430
Guido.

630
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:07,910
Guido.

631
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:07,950


632
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:08,130


633
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:08,130


634
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,270
Guido.

635
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,710
Guido.

636
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,950
Guido.

637
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:14,950


638
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,290
Guido.

639
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:16,750
Guido.

640
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:16,750


641
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,390
Guido.

642
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,110
Guido.

643
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:18,110


644
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:18,870
Guido.

645
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,110
Guido.

646
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:22,110


647
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:25,730
Now is the whole downtown circus and all the people with three eyes.

648
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:29,210
La comedia es finita.

649
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,350
La comedia dell'arte è finito.

650
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,790
La parola è fatta.

651
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,410
And now it's time for the...

652
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,890
Search your heart loop.

653
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:51,070
The stinky winter song, brought to you by Abel Cloggs and the Spider Chorus.

654
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:55,430
These small children here, after the latest onslaught of mutations,

655
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:58,890
have legs that resemble hairy little spider legs.

656
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:02,310
We want something good for everyone.

657
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:06,310
Not just foolhardy or the big and onion.

658
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:12,730
We want all God's childs to shine with that same effervescent smelly sound.

659
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:17,330
Okay kids, let's make good faces for the camera now.

660
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,050
One more time.

661
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:21,970
Oh they're so cute.

662
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:26,230
ESO Radio. Television for the blind.

663
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,830
Take one or two of them home.

664
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:32,390
Take them home and put them in a vat of salt water.

665
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,430
See how long it takes.

666
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:41,350
Stand back please. Stand back please.

667
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:42,970
Some of these children are dangerous.

668
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:46,250
So Dave, can you answer the eternal question?

669
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:51,050
Is masturbation really just a porn movie for the intelligent?

670
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:56,370
For the intelligent or perhaps for the extremely physically handicapped?

671
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,970
The emotional... Yes.

672
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,130
No, it's for the artist.

673
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:03,050
The only true artist, Bob said, is the jack-off artist.

674
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:06,870
That's the truest, most sincere form of creation.

675
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:10,930
Because the artist works for no one but him, his or herself.

676
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:16,570
He points his confused epithets skywards and hopes they land somewhere besides his own pillogs.

677
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:20,650
There's no concern over critics or audiences.

678
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:26,670
It's merely the creation for the pure joy of creation.

679
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:30,370
I hope DJA's on his way up.

680
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:34,130
Because I can't hang out all night tonight.

681
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,650
We'll just lock Dave up here in the studio.

682
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:38,210
Yeah.

683
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,730
We'll get Luis Bunwell.

684
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:47,330
Just leave all the microphones on and lock Dave in the main air studio until the sun comes up.

685
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:50,050
I bet Dave would figure out how to play record.

686
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,370
He's gonna play records on those turntables.

687
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:52,810
Yeah?

688
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:56,830
You know, if you push enough buttons, sooner or later, noise will start coming out of something.

689
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,570
Well, that's a hypothetical question, you guys.

690
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:04,070
What if you were to light up all these wax demons sitting out here at one time?

691
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,050
Well, it'd be great if this was a TV show, but...

692
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,650
They are lit up. Look, Dave.

693
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,610
No, no, there's still four or five.

694
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:10,910
Look, see, those are the important ones.

695
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:15,330
John Gold, Kibofrenia, Mr. Slap-Happy.

696
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,210
These are the...

697
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:17,610
Mr. Slap-Happy?

698
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,530
Is Mr. Snuggles here, too?

699
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,730
Yes. My favorite demon.

700
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:27,170
I liked it when Mr. Snuggles was here last week. That was Dr. Legume. He's Mr. Snuggles.

701
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,730
Yeah, I'm surprised he didn't call.

702
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:29,630
Cute little demons.

703
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,030
No one called.

704
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:31,910
Bleepo was supposed to call.

705
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,410
No one cares anymore. They didn't donate. They don't call.

706
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,190
Our mom's calling me.

707
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,110
What's the point?

708
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:38,150
He was going to call.

709
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:39,850
Who was?

710
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:44,230
Bleepo. Bleepo. Bleepo was going to call. He told me he was going to call.

711
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:44,530
Why?

712
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,730
He was caught in the most recent...

713
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,930
He had a big thing about Frank Sinatra. He was going to talk to us.

714
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:49,450
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

715
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:55,590
Bleepo has become... Frank Sinatra is his new short-duration personal savior.

716
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,290
Oh, well, that makes a lot of sense to a lot of people.

717
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,250
Yeah, well, blue eyes.

718
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,710
Nancy Sinatra was mine numerous times.

719
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:10,370
How many times a day, tops, say, age 13? You don't have to tell me.

720
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:13,370
Yeah, you're sort of putting me on the spot here.

721
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:19,510
Yeah, I know. That's like making you admit that you actually had her that many times.

722
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,830
You know, at all.

723
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:21,270
Yeah.

724
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,010
At the age of 13.

725
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,930
Now, how many times did you bother that old Amish lady again? Remember...

726
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,490
How about the cover of the...

727
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,210
Extremely Harry.

728
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:30,210


729
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,410
You're on a brass album...

730
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:32,850
Oh, okay.

731
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:36,330
...with the gal bathing in the shaving cream or just...

732
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:36,530
Yeah.

733
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:36,890
Yeah.

734
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:41,890
What about the galvanized fuzz holster that you got from the extra meditation labs, man?

735
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:42,530
Griselda.

736
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,750
Yeah, Griselda.

737
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:48,670
Well, would you be a Ginger or a Mary Ann?

738
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:49,990
Kathy or Patty.

739
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:50,790
Or a peyoteen.

740
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:51,830
Or a peyoteen.

741
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:51,890
I don't know.

742
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,370
We already did that one. That's right. We decided Mrs. Howell.

743
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:56,570
Yeah.

744
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,150
The rich one.

745
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,530
No, but we didn't decide on Kathy or Patty.

746
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:04,070
Kathy or Patty, you're talking about sandwiches or are you talking about actually the food?

747
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,750
Oh, the crepe suzettes or the hot dogs.

748
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,090
Yeah, yeah.

749
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:10,370
Kathy adores minuet, belly troop and crepe suzettes.

750
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:14,130
Well, Patty likes the rock and roll. A hot dog makes her lose control.

751
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:17,370
Think about the triple innuendo going on there.

752
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,650
Oh, there. Right.

753
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,830
The American or the classy British chick.

754
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,710
Patty was a slut.

755
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:28,230
She was. She was a schizophrenic slut. And that's why she had not only two sides.

756
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:31,910
So then the question is, Kathy or Patty?

757
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,570
Who was a male or a female cesspool you're backing up into?

758
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:37,110
Hmm, Dave?

759
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,510
I think it's a...

760
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:41,870
You got some kind of problem with your own genderality? Hmm, Dave? Hmm?

761
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:47,550
I place my gender talia on the altar of sacrifice every night and I talk to the plastic whistle.

762
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:54,030
My boss would be rich too. And you have boss too. And his boss. See that dame over there in the car?

763
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:58,870
Oh my God. They keep on breaking my heart.

764
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:08,370
If only we could get out of this vile top stock. If we could only burrow beneath the barbed wire.

765
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:14,690
If only these... these vessels could get us out of here. These tiny little boats.

766
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:19,310
The sponge raft. Perhaps we can fashion some sort of crew device.

767
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:24,210
And maybe if we flap our arms very, very hard, we will go...

768
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:28,850
I can help keep you boiled up old Davey.

769
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:29,530
Yes, yes.

770
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:30,390
You don't think?

771
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,090
Yes, yes.

772
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,090
I have some idea of something wild.

773
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,690
I've been listening to you since you got on this island.

774
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:42,990
Some kind of craft things that we can float on. I think I know what we can use. We'll make a... We'll make our own ship.

775
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:45,050
No, no, no, no. There's no chance.

776
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:52,850
Yeah, yeah. We'll make our own ship, yeah. We have some mailing tubes and... and all kinds of marshmallow cream and...

777
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,750
It... it will be good. It will work.

778
00:31:55,650 --> 00:32:03,490
In order to sink, you have to lose your ship, my friend.

779
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:09,930
And in order to fly, you have to lose your little poo poo head.

780
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,650
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

781
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:16,050
Ben flies all around the world because he lost his little poo poo head.

782
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:21,550
They call this inappropriate laughter for those people confined in mental institutions.

783
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:26,530
Don't you know the walls around you have eyes and ears and nose and throat, doctors?

784
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:34,290
You must be aware that Dr. Ben no longer exists except for in your own febrile sexual organs.

785
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,510
You're contaminated.

786
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:38,410
The what? The Dr. Ben's no longer exist?

787
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,310
You're contaminated.

788
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,370
Then what do you call this?

789
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:41,530
He is contaminated.

790
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,870
And no one understands his point.

791
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:44,290
Then take him away.

792
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:49,210
Ah, yes, it is the most contaminated music of all.

793
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:55,730
Music made by doctors. True, enlightened doctors.

794
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:00,590
We're going to remove your hypothalamus with sound now.

795
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:10,490
Oh, now Dr. Philodrumon applies his saxophone to the patient's sacroiliac in this sacred act of love.

796
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,370
Yes, friends.

797
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:17,490
Surgery is a form of intimate love.

798
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:24,210
And the doctors of the airwaves will do this to your very ear mind and your ear brain.

799
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,950
Just trust the good doctor.

800
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:28,970
Now he's going to take out your spleen and your hava pancus.

801
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:34,650
He's going to replace the soles of those tired shoes with a brand new hardened belly button.

802
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,790
Just like the one you wanted to close.

803
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:38,830
I was scared, but then so was the doctor.

804
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,990
Sit down here on this barbed wire seat.

805
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:41,630
I was scared, but then so was the doctor.

806
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,150
I was scared, but then so was the doctor.

807
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:43,630
Don't worry.

808
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,910
Don't wink and knobble about those little winkings in your eyes.

809
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:49,270
Now they're just controlling your rapid eye movements.

810
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:54,350
Those doctors have powers you don't know about yet, but you're going to find out.

811
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:58,310
Oh, you'll find out soon enough, my good fellow.

812
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:01,450
My good little nurse girl.

813
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:05,310
Yes, come on into the operating room now.

814
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,250
The operating theater, we call it.

815
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,750
But on these rubber gloves.

816
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,250
Sit down, Dr. Clance.

817
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:14,690
Pour this alcohol into your lap and here, drink some of this.

818
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,270
And have some of this gas.

819
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:17,990
And take this pill.

820
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:19,290
And take this shot.

821
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:23,570
And then this night here, insert this deep into your chest cavity.

822
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:28,490
Now take these pencils and work them gradually into your ears.

823
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:32,510
Now put on these headphones and give me $20.

824
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:35,090
You notice the acrobatics we are doing now?

825
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,090
Look at me.

826
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:36,930
Look at me.

827
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:37,970
I am a monkey man.

828
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,750
Look at my strong forceps.

829
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,570
Look at my chin.

830
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,370
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

831
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,950
I bet you wish you could imitate this, but no.

832
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,490
You need more, more, more sound cut.

833
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:49,450
More.

834
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:52,730
There will always be a need for more.

835
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,350
More slack.

836
00:34:55,890 --> 00:35:00,870
And yet, more money, dear friends.

837
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,110
More money.

838
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:06,930
And how, how, you ask me, Reverend Stang?

839
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,330
You say, how should I get this money?

840
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:10,810
With what you speak.

841
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:12,050
Because it's true.

842
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:18,270
Sure, slack is what you make of your imaginary, your dream.

843
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,810
But let's face it, we need money.

844
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,630
We don't need a bunch of this hoo-ha, is it, damn?

845
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:25,950
A bunch of new age gobbledygook.

846
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:26,790
We need money.

847
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:29,190
We need money coming into this radio station.

848
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:31,290
We need money coming into this church.

849
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,390
We need money coming into this wallet.

850
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:35,310
The one I'm sitting on, on my butt.

851
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,430
Now I want you to get off your butt, my friends.

852
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:41,270
And get on down there to that sub.com thing.

853
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,670
And check out them.

854
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:45,450
Because this is a prosperity ministry.

855
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:53,430
We are not going to sit here and just hope that some magical monkey is going to start crapping money out of its butt.

856
00:35:55,250 --> 00:36:00,170
We want you to start crapping that money out of your butt.

857
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,890
So get with it, baby.

858
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:05,230
Oh, if only you understood.

859
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:17,630
If you were one of the brilliant shining lights of humanity, you would know that you can crap that money out of your butt as easily as flying saucers make planets.

860
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:27,090
You know that you can create a better world for you and your mutant clones by simply following this.

861
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:28,570
Oh!

862
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:30,730
Oh, my God!

863
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,510
I expected it to be so.

864
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:41,990
It was moving very close to some place I didn't want to go.

865
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:44,630
My head was throbbing.

866
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:47,690
Sure, I had been knocked on the head three times by a bowling ball.

867
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:48,790
What would anybody expect?

868
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,810
And of course, the dame was no help either.

869
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:58,170
Sticking that strange substance down my pants and also trying to clip my gonads together with a safety belt.

870
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:01,670
Yeah, I wasn't complaining though because I could still walk.

871
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:04,990
Unlike so many other Joes that passed this way.

872
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:08,010
Yeah, not only could I still...

873
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:08,990
I could still...

874
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:10,910
I could still...

875
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:11,810
I could still...

876
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:13,490
Walking...

877
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:15,790
Hey, you!

878
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,030
Hey, you there!

879
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:18,810
Lean on the corner.

880
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,310
Yeah, no, no, you there.

881
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:21,030
Lean on the corner.

882
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:21,650
Singing man.

883
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:22,770
Singing man.

884
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:25,750
Yeah, what do you want, buddy?

885
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:27,670
Hey, I need a little help.

886
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:28,930
You guys go ahead and keep singing.

887
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,550
I'll attend to this.

888
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,150
What are you, a cop?

889
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,970
No, no, I'm a private dickhead.

890
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:38,210
Listen, buddy, I've been out of the car for the last five weeks.

891
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:43,510
My pants are pretty shabby and, you know, I need a place to go if you catch my drift or...

892
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,490
Oh, you're looking for...

893
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:45,850
Huh?

894
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:46,970
You're seeking something.

895
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:48,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm seeking something.

896
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:49,210
I see.

897
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,210
Here, here, here.

898
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:50,950
Sit down.

899
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,530
Let me look into my crystal ball.

900
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:53,210
Thanks, I appreciate it, pal.

901
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:53,790
Close your eyes.

902
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:56,290
Let me look through this wallet of yours.

903
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:56,950
Oh, wow.

904
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,290
Hey, what you doing with my money?

905
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:58,710
I know, I see.

906
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,310
Hey, just leave the wallet alone.

907
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:02,230
Well, I tell you what we're going to do.

908
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,090
We're going to go see...

909
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:03,490
Thanks, sir.

910
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,010
Oh, we don't need to go see him at all.

911
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,310
Here he comes right now.

912
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,410
You're going to drink the water?

913
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:09,630
Here comes the man I wanted you to meet.

914
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,910
His name is Bob.

915
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:11,710
This is Christy.

916
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:15,790
And you're about to meet Cheyote Bob Dogg Sirself.

917
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:15,970
He looks like a...

918
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,270
Dave, here he is.

919
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:17,830
What a...

920
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,090
What a disgusting body.

921
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,070
What a...

922
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:21,810
Oh, my God.

923
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,930
I'm going to pass out from the fumes.

924
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:27,350
What a grotesque looking...

925
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:29,950
My pipe.

926
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,690
Where is my pipe?

927
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:33,470
Oh, my God.

928
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:33,470


929
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:33,470


930
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:33,470


931
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:33,470


932
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:33,470


933
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:33,470


934
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:33,470


935
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:33,470


936
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:33,470


937
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:37,170
Well, sure, it was the same pipe he's been smoking all along.

938
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,070
Of course, it was.

939
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:41,870
But Dr. Sue Man also knew that there was something special inside that pipe.

940
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:46,130
Something beside the usual habsopropolis that he had been smoking for the last five weeks.

941
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,390
Of course.

942
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,510
It was the demon sperm itself.

943
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:53,030
Inseminated by his archfiend rival, Lawrence...

944
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,690
Could you please...

945
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:55,690
Could you please...

946
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,970
Demon sperm, my friend.

947
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,150
Are you a victim?

948
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:03,070
Or are you a user of the demon sperm?

949
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:03,450
Bump into the pipe.

950
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:03,450


951
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:03,450


952
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:03,450


953
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:03,450


954
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:03,450


955
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:03,450


956
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:03,450


957
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:03,450


958
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:03,450


959
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:03,450


960
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:03,450


961
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:03,450


962
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:03,450


963
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:03,450


964
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,490
Are you addicted, my friend?

965
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:08,830
Are you lost in bondage to the demon's fur?

966
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,390
I'll send them down by the riverfront.

967
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,190
Come on, now, you can tell an old preacher.

968
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,990
They can't, and they can't do it, and they can't move their limbs anymore.

969
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,170
What about this demon?

970
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,110
They feed around disease.

971
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:19,530
Demon disease.

972
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:20,930
Most of them have eye problems.

973
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:22,690
Eye, eye, eye, eye, this.

974
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,650
You know, they're egocentric.

975
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:26,630
Of course, they are the old wino bums, but...

976
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,690
Aye, aye, sir.

977
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:28,990
We make good use of them.

978
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,830
So, Shanghai, Willie, Emily, I mean...

979
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,070
Shanghai Nelly.

980
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,030
Me?

981
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,750
That's right, you, Shanghai Nelly,

982
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:41,210
the girl in the frumpy suit and the 40-year-old haircut.

983
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,690
It's time for you to dance all night long

984
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,750
in the disc-shaped shack of your own design,

985
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,190
the most beautiful place you've ever seen in your life.

986
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,490
Can you imagine where this is?

987
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,250
I'm blushing right now.

988
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,990
It's on the Cabo de San Lucas,

989
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,630
here in Dobbstown, U.X.A.

990
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:55,790
It's party time!

991
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,310
I can't believe it!

992
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,630
Everybody get ready for the, uh,

993
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,370
for the swimsuit competition.

994
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,110
Marie...

995
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,070
Uh, Maria, what's your name, honey?

996
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:06,710
Al Damas.

997
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:08,150
Maria Damas?

998
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,230
Al Damas.

999
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,850
Where did you get the hot sweatsuit?

1000
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:11,270
Hot Damas.

1001
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:11,790
Hot.

1002
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,810
I'm talking about the bacon powder, baby.

1003
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,710
Where'd you get the glands?

1004
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,590
I made it myself.

1005
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:21,830
That is certainly hotter than anything I can think of right now.

1006
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,190
You want to take a little walk down the runway?

1007
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:23,670
I'm a designer.

1008
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,670
And they start...

1009
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:28,730
Dolmus.

1010
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:32,810
Dolly Dolmus.

1011
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:36,950
Come on.

1012
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:36,950


1013
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:38,850
Yes.

1014
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:38,850


1015
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:38,850


1016
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,290
The perfect time.

1017
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:40,490
We're soаны

1018
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:41,550
Crazy, are you?

1019
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:41,550


1020
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:41,630
We're still inT、

1021
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,790
Cannot

1022
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:43,730
Hey, don't you mind

1023
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:43,970
Show to her

1024
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:43,970


1025
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:44,870
we didn't necessary

1026
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:48,690
You sad

1027
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:49,270
Okay,

1028
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:51,790
So.

1029
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:52,350
Okay,

1030
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:58,070
You don't have any

1031
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,690
Only reason

1032
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:02,710
to have

1033
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,490
Can you come out of the closet?

1034
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,430
Honey, come on.

1035
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:07,690
No.

1036
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,010
Get the contraption off your head.

1037
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:09,290
No.

1038
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:12,470
You're not on the runway in Miami, honey.

1039
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:12,670
No.

1040
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,190
You're stuck in a closet back here in Cleveland.

1041
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:15,890
Come on.

1042
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:16,770
No.

1043
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:18,010
We'll talk about it.

1044
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:18,370
No.

1045
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:19,970
Okay, we won't talk about it.

1046
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:20,930
We'll just pretend it didn't.

1047
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:21,590
Please.

1048
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:22,050
No.

1049
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,650
Your mother's having a histrionic fit.

1050
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:27,690
You know what happens to your mother when she has one of those?

1051
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:28,050
Uh-huh.

1052
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,930
The vesicles come exploding out of her ass.

1053
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,130
Next thing she can't sleep for a month and a half.

1054
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:33,990
Please, honey.

1055
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,150
Peppy wants to play with you.

1056
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,230
Come on.

1057
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:40,630
Doggy wants to go salute.

1058
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:41,910
Wang, wang, ding, dong outside.

1059
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:42,830
Come on, honey.

1060
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:43,310
Please.

1061
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,550
I want to go play in the doghouse.

1062
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:49,970
I'm going to have to call up Dr. Zane.

1063
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:51,170
No.

1064
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,690
No, don't call Dr. Zane.

1065
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:55,470
All right.

1066
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,070
I got that.

1067
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:20,810
Me?!

1068
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:25,610
You just let me amortize all this dog food stuff.

1069
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:25,610


1070
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:26,170


1071
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:26,850
Smile.

1072
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:27,410
I don't think I'm getting take.

1073
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:30,010
Still look cool.

1074
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:30,010


1075
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:30,010


1076
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:38,170
spiritual powers that you can uncork by using this magic uncorking device.

1077
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:43,070
Oh very very interesting.

1078
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,230

Hey, hey, get your hands off the artificial wombat breast there.

1137
00:54:56,350 --> 00:54:57,850
Lung, chee-wim, whatever.

1138
00:54:57,910 --> 00:54:58,650
God don't care.

1139
00:54:58,790 --> 00:54:59,230
Just...

1140
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:03,970
Uh-oh.

1141
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:07,950
I think it's the old lady or something.

1142
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:08,990
What's she doing here?

1143
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:18,830
I didn't want to sacrilege your bums, sir.

1144
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:21,910
I didn't want to recorrect your list of little habits

1145
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:25,230
or the strange way you address the people around you.

1146
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:27,970
I'm talking about your family connections.

1147
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:30,470
The way you make your vowel sounds.

1148
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:34,410
It's clear to me, as clear as chocolate pudding,

1149
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:43,370
that you're one of my least remembered cousins from...

1150
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:48,330
I think it was the tubular year or it was the bad bassoon era.

1151
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:49,070
Oh.

1152
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:51,610
I know you now.

1153
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:53,890
You're a...

1154
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:54,750
Bueller.

1155
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:56,030
Bueller.

1156
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:56,630
Bueller.

1157
00:55:57,170 --> 00:55:58,550
Ashton Bueller.

1158
00:55:58,970 --> 00:55:59,610
Yeah.

1159
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:01,670
Named after a town.

1160
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:08,310
Well, child, just sit over here on top of this vociferous lightning razor like me.

1161
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:10,230
Ashton was my sister.

1162
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:11,170
Ashton.

1163
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:13,990
She was a fishy old woman, wasn't she?

1164
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:14,630
Yeah.

1165
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:16,810
Some menzies flowed like a river.

1166
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:17,930
I remember your daddy.

1167
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:18,610
Big box.

1168
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:20,070
Size ears, didn't they?

1169
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:21,730
Don't be talking about my papa like that.

1170
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:22,110
Okay.

1171
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:26,070
Well, at least I know you're related to someone who's almost related to me.

1172
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:26,470
Can you...

1173
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:31,970
Besides, you know in the Orient, the big ears, it means intelligence and wisdom, you know.

1174
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:33,250
So come on now.

1175
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:35,490
We're on the east side of this planet now.

1176
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:35,870
Talk about my father that way.

1177
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:38,570
Well, we call him figuratively a father.

1178
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:43,270
At least when we put him up on a pedestal, he didn't wax the way we...

1179
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:43,290
This man here now.

1180
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:48,730
Could you come and help me put some of this cottage cheese here on my pantyhose, child?

1181
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:50,450
I'm gonna touch nothing around there.

1182
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:54,590
Child, you know, great, great uncle grandma woman thing here needs help.

1183
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:55,190
Putting...

1184
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:57,050
Hepatitis.

1185
00:56:57,610 --> 00:56:58,830
Help is here now.

1186
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:01,690
Help is on its way.

1187
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:05,570
Help is here and on its way.

1188
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:08,830
Help is coming, friends.

1189
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:15,750
In the form of a well-dressed businessman carrying a briefcase, smoking pipe,

1190
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:18,430
and wearing a great big grin.

1191
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:19,250
And a little bit of a smile on his face.

1192
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:22,450
He's got something for you in that briefcase, my friend.

1193
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:23,530
It's a little...

1194
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:25,230
It's a little minister's card.

1195
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:29,870
You never thought of yourself as minister, preacher, any kind of a religious person, did you?

1196
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:31,090
In fact, the last...

1197
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:38,050
Last thing you ever saw yourself as was some kind of a holy man or holy babe.

1198
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,370
I tell you what.

1199
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:41,770
Maybe...

1200
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:45,270
Maybe this is a different kind of holy man.

1201
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:46,210
A hole...

1202
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,650
Hole in the head that we're talking about.

1203
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:48,810
A hole in the head.

1204
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:48,810


1205
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:55,250
What's that little considering?

1206
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:57,550
Well, it kind of starts with hoping that somebody régs on and beginssis to get the

1207
00:57:57,550 --> 00:57:57,550


1208
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:04,250
So the calvary guy that the creepy guy that's calling the callings, says good building

1209
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:04,250


1210
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:04,950
It's just a guy out there.

1211
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:05,530
Now he's nice.

1212
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:08,170
So he doesn't realize, what exactly is going on with this guy here?

1213
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:08,430
He's around.

1214
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:08,430


1215
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:09,590
Well.

1216
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:10,230
What you see, nhs?

1217
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:10,650
This is a major thing.

1218
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:15,050
One, there's a lot to do.

1219
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:17,670
That's aku?!

1220
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:24,230
Yeah, sure, it's easy. Easy. Easy. That's why everybody's doing it.

1221
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:29,070
Everybody's doing it right now. Everybody is doing it.

1222
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:31,810
Except for you, right, buddy? Right, pal?

1223
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:35,610
That's right. You're the only buddy, pal, right there.

1224
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:39,370
You can't do it. You can't make it. You can't make it real.

1225
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:43,110
You can build your own Instagram. You can build your own shit.

1226
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:46,670
You can leave this planet. You can do it, man. You can do it.

1227
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:49,350
If you don't like the band you're in, baby, move!

1228
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:51,390
Hey, the magic moment of resolution.

1229
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:53,430
Congratulations, buddy.

1230
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:58,690
Everybody's doing it. Everybody's doing it.

1231
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:01,390
You are waiting a moment of...

1232
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:05,870
Everybody's doing it. Everybody's doing it.

1233
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:07,670
Doing it. Doing it.

1234
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:14,070
Could you please put your hair just a little bit further to the left?

1235
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:19,330
I can't. I'm using your spirit hand again.

1236
00:59:19,370 --> 00:59:22,510
That line puts you in a real, real electric hand.

1237
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:24,330
Tastes like chicken.

1238
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:29,670
It tastes like rattlesnake.

1239
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:31,590
Smells sausage.

1240
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:38,570
Yes, baby, we're going back in time.

1241
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:43,370
In fact, we're going back in time to when this show ends.

1242
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:44,050
And another show.

1243
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:45,790
The show begins. This is ten years after.

1244
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:48,270
Live at the Fillmore East in the background, friends.

1245
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:51,290
And we're going to slowly groove on out of here.

1246
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:55,110
But Chaz will be back next Chaz Week.

1247
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:57,150
Chaz Time and Chaz Channel.

1248
00:59:57,290 --> 00:59:58,990
And Dave is still here.

1249
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:01,310
We'll be back next week.

1250
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:06,270
We'll be back in a lot better physical condition than we were next week.

1251
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:09,090
We're going to come back from a therapist.

1252
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:11,570
We're going to have to really solve some problems.

1253
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:13,690
Not just diddling our time's weight.

1254
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:15,370
Eating those weird cinnamon bites.

1255
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:16,790
And hanging with that shit.

1256
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:20,330
We're going to really find out what's making it tick.

1257
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:24,790
And then, once we pronounce ourselves deaf,

1258
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:29,370
we'll be ready to solve all the problems it's created for me.

1259
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:31,630
The son of a bitch.

1260
01:00:31,650 --> 01:00:35,750
I wish I knew who my mind controller was.

1261
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:40,090
I wish I knew who was pushing my click on the often clicking often button.

1262
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:42,830
I wish I could get out of this.

1263
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:44,350
I wish I could get out of this suitcase.

1264
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:47,870
