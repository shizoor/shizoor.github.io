00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,800
Saludos Amigos

2
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,660
And now the subgenius

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,440
Girls in bikinis, girls without bikinis, with e-remarks

4
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,880
Blow it out, Joe

5
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,400
The subgenius hour of slack that you are about to listen to

6
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,040
Is specially designed only to be played on radio station

7
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,600
KNON 89.3

8
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,840
And only in the city of

9
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,680
Dallas, Texas

10
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,580
Should any other shows be heard from or contacted in the course of this show

11
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,780
The listener is advised to remain calm and only contact listed or unlisted officials

12
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,980
In the event of any of these events

13
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,520
Any material from this radio or other listening device being inhaled during broadcast

14
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,800
Small animals or other children becoming exposed to the ultra-high or ultra-low shocks and brain frequencies

15
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,840
Constantly scanned throughout our program

16
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,300
Should seek shelter in an approved safety unit only

17
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,580
This is Walter Teasdale reminding you

18
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,540
That it's often a photon that light releases

19
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,800
But truth is, not everyone gets the picture

20
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,620
Hoping your time is all time

21
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,280
And all your unpermissible truths are happy truths

22
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,500
Here is your host

23
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,660
The Will of Dobbs

24
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,720
Yep, it's me again

25
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,280
I was here just last week and I'm back already

26
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,360
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight after last week's extremely live hour of slack

27
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,940
Tonight it's going to be sort of unlive

28
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,060
We're going to be tape heads tonight

29
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,540
Knob heads, tape heads, you name it

30
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,620
So sit back friends

31
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,940
And we hope you enjoy this one tonight

32
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,580
As the Church of the Subgenius presents another

33
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,600
33 minutes of condensed uraglic function

34
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,480
Yeah, that's right, that is off one of the Subgenius tapes that you've heard here before

35
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,100
But you know what, have you ever seen that movie Fahrenheit 451

36
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,860
By Francois Truffaut, the famous French film director

37
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,080
Remember how they burned all the books

38
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,300
And so all the old book lovers had to become those books

39
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,180
And they walk around in the snow just reciting books

40
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,700
Well friends, we know, we see the handwriting on the wall

41
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,060
We know it ain't going to be too long before they come after us

42
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:11,700
And when they do, friends, most of your favorite Subgenius doctors

43
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,080
Have actually become at least one Subgenius tape

44
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,740
And I'm a couple of doctors for Bob

45
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,180
I'm also the P-Dawg

46
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,080
We can't find anybody to be Neagie though

47
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,840
We're still looking though, we'll find somebody pretty soon

48
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,620
When somebody called a couple of weeks ago

49
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,400
And they...

50
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,160
And they...

51
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,240
They asked a fair question, you know

52
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,660
They said, well, you know, I don't understand

53
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,700
You guys talk about the, you know, the Subgenius-es

54
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,180
You know, the listeners and members and so forth

55
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,300
And it seems like we can't win, you know

56
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,800
It's like if we don't love Bob enough, we're pink

57
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,400
And if we love him too much, oh, we're damn Bobbies

58
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,140
And so what's the point?

59
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,760
Is it just the fact that we're not you?

60
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,520
Is that the problem?

61
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,840
Boy, I'm sorry

62
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,620
If we've given you that impression, we're sorry

63
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,140
We do not think that we're not you

64
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,120
We think your life is meaningless

65
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,080
Because, you know, thermodynamic miracles

66
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,040
Events with odds against...

67
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,060
So, astronomically they're effectively impossible

68
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,720
Like oxygen spontaneously becoming gold

69
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,160
But friends, in every human coupling

70
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,920
A thousand million sperm vie for a single egg

71
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,560
Multiply those odds by countless generations

72
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,280
Against the odds of your ancestors being alive, meeting

73
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,160
Siring this precise son, that exact daughter

74
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,120
And just think of that union of the thousand million children

75
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,600
Competing for fertilization

76
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,060
That it was you, listener, only you that emerged

77
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,340
To distill so specific a form from that chaos of improbability

78
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,820
Like turning air to gold

79
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,060
That is the crowning unlikelihood

80
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,700
The thermodynamic miracle

81
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,260
But the world is so full of people

82
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,240
So crowded with these miracles that they become commonplace

83
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,820
And we forget

84
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,720
We gaze continually at the world

85
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,380
And it grows dull in our perceptions

86
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,860
Yet seen from another's vantage point

87
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,200
As if new, it may still take the breath away

88
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,760
So come, dear listener, dry your eyes

89
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,520
For you are life

90
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,440
Rarer than a quark

91
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,060
And unpredictable beyond the dreams of Heisenberg

92
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,320
The clay in which the forces that shape all things

93
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,480
Leave their fingerprints most clearly

94
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,320
So dry your eyes

95
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,400
And let's begin tonight's subgenius hour of slack

96
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,420
The

97
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:31,420


98
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:31,420


99
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,640
The

100
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,900
The

101
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,620
The

102
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:53,860
The

103
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:53,960
The

104
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,320
The

105
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,740
The

106
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,100
The

107
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:00,500
The

108
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:00,720
The

109
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:00,740
The

110
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:00,780
The

111
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:00,780


112
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:00,840
The

113
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:00,840


114
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:00,840


115
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:00,840


116
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:00,840


117
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,260
The

118
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:07,260


119
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,620
Oh, my God.

120
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,160
Oh, my God.

121
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:47,720
Oh, my God.

122
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,220
Gentlemen, please remain in your seats.

123
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,500
I just had my consciousness raised.

124
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:55,680
I just had my consciousness raised.

125
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,440
Oh, my God.

126
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,960
Just a minute.

127
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,640
So, we are open for donations, of course.

128
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,940
Listen, I just have to ask you,

129
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,120
are there people out there who are involved and belong,

130
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,460
who are members who don't really understand what's going on?

131
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,780
Don't you think that's a real possibility?

132
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:25,360
Yes.

133
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,320
Well, we have done everything we can to...

134
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,140
We often have to deprogram our own members.

135
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,400
We don't want...

136
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,780
We do not want...

137
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,960
We don't want complete zombies.

138
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:37,780
This is...

139
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,820
We only take, as the tape said before,

140
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,800
we only take a portion of your mind,

141
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,020
and even that we give back to you when we're through with it,

142
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,420
as opposed to most any other mind-control cult.

143
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,660
When do you decide when you're through?

144
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,960
When is the end, and how do you know?

145
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,160
If somebody is...

146
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,640
If somebody is just mindlessly into Bob,

147
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,720
and all I can do is recite Bob's quotes and so forth,

148
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,960
and they've lost their own abnormality

149
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,160
and just sunk it into the overall...

150
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,340
It becomes a conformity of nonconformists,

151
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,280
and that's what we have to watch out for.

152
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,880
We call those people gimme-bobs or mal-aligned normals.

153
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,620
They're actually not subgeniuses,

154
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,340
but they think there's something cool about it

155
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,240
because there's a lot of celebrities attached to the church and so forth.

156
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,600
So they'll...

157
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,040
They'll wear the Bob t-shirts,

158
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,980
they'll spend money on the thing and so forth,

159
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,000
but they have no more of an idea of what slack really is.

160
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,360
So to handle these people,

161
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,860
we've had to go to drastic measures to...

162
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,240
As soon as they start to think they understand the church,

163
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,040
we'll pull the rug right out from under them.

164
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:44,640
...forged in.

165
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,060
...of a hundred million more hours.

166
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,580
...to be out.

167
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,040
We've done it, insane.

168
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,840
Jack Smith, some horas...

169
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,720
Dave Smith, some horas.

170
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,000
Anthony...

171
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,840
Smith, some horas.

172
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,300
Christopher Coleman, some horas...

173
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:20,220
You really showed us something.

174
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:20,220


175
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:20,220


176
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:20,220


177
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,580
and not just Congressional power works and not by the God of God وام

178
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:22,580


179
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:22,780
but by unethical deeds of Gates,

180
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,820
building blood for enjoyment...

181
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:23,860
if they plan on killing you 거기

182
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:23,860


183
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,340
How will yourasıína 싱

184
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:25,340


185
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:25,340


186
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:25,340


187
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,940
Oh, oh, oh.

188
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:55,940
It's gone.

189
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,300
It's gone.

190
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,660
Mutant.

191
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,760
Mutant.

192
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,620
Mutant.

193
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,400
Mutant.

194
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,140
Mutant.

195
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,840
Mutant.

196
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,440
Mutant.

197
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,140
Mutant.

198
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:04,180


199
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:04,640
Mutant.

200
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:05,560
No!

201
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,160
You say no?

202
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,620
You sniveling talker, you say no to Aldo?

203
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,380
Aldo, respect.

204
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,980
Respect me.

205
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:14,880
Oh.

206
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,140
Ape.

207
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,660
Shut up.

208
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,640
Kill.

209
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,620
Ape.

210
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,380
Too late.

211
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,080
You should have told me sooner.

212
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:23,340
Is that?

213
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,000
Fine.

214
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,340
Fine.

215
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:25,600
Fine.

216
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,820
You look like her.

217
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,520
You look like her.

218
00:12:59,260 --> 00:12:59,940
Fine.

219
00:12:59,940 --> 00:12:59,960
Fine.

220
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,660
Fine.

221
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:02,900
Fine.

222
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,140
Is your father there?

223
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,660
Pucker your lips and shake your shoulders

224
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,700
cause a man who might be hiding there.

225
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,280
Disco boy or the disco king of the disco thing?

226
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,060
You may just think someday that you just might go somewhere.

227
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,060
Thank you.

228
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,500
Thank you.

229
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:27,800
Thank you.

230
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,800
Thank you.

231
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:28,800


232
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,280
Disco girl, you're out of sight

233
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,400
You need a disco boy to treat you right

234
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,240
He'll do a dance, take you on a ride

235
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,220
Leave his hair alone, but you can kiss his phone

236
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,640
Disco boy

237
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,180
Run to the dwarf, comb your hair

238
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:55,400
They stole my portal mask!

239
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,580
Disco boy

240
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,320
Put your hands in the glint

241
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,140
So I stand in their hand

242
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,560
Listen!

243
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,060
Disco boy

244
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,860
Do the bump every night

245
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,700
Tell the disco girl who's really right

246
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,480
Run up all over your line

247
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,100
And feed you a box full of chicken delight

248
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,580
That's right

249
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,940
Then put your piece in so he has to eat it

250
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,840
Disco chit-chat, so it's in your

251
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,780
Pump that booty all across the floor

252
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,080
A disco dream, a disco wink

253
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,100
You never go doody, that's what you think

254
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,240
You never go doody, that's what you think

255
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,520
You never go doody, that's what you think

256
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,600
Doody

257
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,780
You never go doody

258
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,760
Doody

259
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,840
You never go doody

260
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,920
Disco Boys

261
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,720
One more chance to comb your hair again

262
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,240
Disco Boys

263
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,680
There's holes in the bar and she's leaving with your friends

264
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,800
That's right

265
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,800
Disco Boys

266
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,420
That's the way it goes

267
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,460
So wipe your nose and try it again

268
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,640
To get a little tomorrow

269
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,440
Disco Boys

270
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,760
No one understands

271
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,120
But thank the Lord that you still got hands

272
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,040
To help you think that you're gonna never find out your disco solo

273
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:57,660
Disco Boys

274
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,260
Oh, jerk it

275
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,100
Is disco love tonight?

276
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,160
Make sure you look alright

277
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,180
Is disco love tonight?

278
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,480
Make sure you look alright

279
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,960
You look alright, you really do

280
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,140
Yeah

281
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,420
Oh, yeah

282
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:46,600
Oh, yeah

283
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:46,600


284
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:46,600


285
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:46,600


286
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:46,600


287
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:46,600


288
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:46,600


289
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:46,600


290
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:46,600


291
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,460
I was driving along in my automobile

292
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:57,300
You've heard about these UFO contactee stories I know before but I know driving along in my automobile one day and out on some country road and was collecting shot crap.

293
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:03,980
forcibly wrenched from my car and manipulated by creatures from outer

294
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:16,780
space. Does that appeal to you? Pretty simple really. No, I don't believe it myself. Well what you can do, yeah I was gonna say, you probably wouldn't want to send us a dollar.

295
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:22,000
You know we don't insist that people believe us. We only insist that

296
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,920
they do what we ask them to. In fact we really we believe that the majority of

297
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:32,980
you out there won't believe us. Yeah, they're right here.

298
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:42,140
Hi I'm Rhodey. I wanna ask them two questions. The first question, they said they're into winning souls? Who are they winning souls for? Satan or Jesus?

299
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,860
Pals, Bob and Jesus are on the same side, they're just

300
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:56,200
not playing quite the same game. But there's only one game. That's right,

301
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:56,900
there's only one game, but they're in the same box. They're not silenced by their

302
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,900
game. That's all. We're not going to be able to tell you anything.

303
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,800
So play your game and keep on playing. Well, my second question

304
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,740
is, why are you deceiving everybody? We're not deceiving anyone.

305
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,080
We're not doing it for Jesus. It's going to be a lot easier to deceive

306
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,560
people once the government starts putting Valium in the water supply.

307
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,940
I probably won't even be here. That's probably right. Let me make

308
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,820
an important point here. A lot of the people that are born-again Christians now

309
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,480
are doing more to turn America against Jesus

310
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,020
than they are for Jesus. Do you understand what I'm saying?

311
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,540
Yeah, I hear you there. But what I'm saying is

312
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:39,600
why don't y'all try to turn people to Jesus?

313
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,840
We're just trying to take it from a slightly different direction.

314
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:47,180
Make people aware of the fact that they can make their own decisions.

315
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,080
We're going step-by-step.

316
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,880
Do you ever occur to you that you might be going in the wrong step?

317
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,140
We think about that all the time. Has it ever occurred to you?

318
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:58,840
No.

319
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,280
I think that says it all, friends. We wanted to play a tape we just got.

320
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,460
Hold on here. A local band.

321
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,300
Dallas, Texas. They're old friends of the Church of the Subgenius.

322
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:21,420
They're always kind enough to send their tour schedules and all the emotional stuff

323
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,620
whenever they come play. So we're going to play them now.

324
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,300
These are the Potatoes.

325
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,640
Potatoes.

326
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,260
Potatoes.

327
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:46,860


328
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,020
Potatoes.

329
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:49,540


330
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:49,560


331
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:49,560


332
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:49,560


333
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:49,560


334
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:49,560


335
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,260
Potatoes.

336
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,380
Potatoes.

337
00:19:55,060 --> 00:20:00,960
Well, I'm Sinbad the Sailor, so hearty and hailed, I live on an island on the back of a whale.

338
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:08,520
It's a whale of an island. That's not a bad joke. It's Lord and its master is this handsome bloke.

339
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:19,000
Hello, the most remarkable, extraordinary fellow. You are Sinbad the Sailor.

340
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:26,280
I scare all creation on land or on sea, but talk about women, they are far from me.

341
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:33,520
I take my adventures wherever they're found. I go on the brag, folks, but I've been around.

342
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:45,300
Who's the most phenomenal, extra special kind of fellow? You are Sinbad the Sailor.

343
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,980
From the Valley of Serpents to the Sea of Stars, I'm Sinbad the Sailor.

344
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:48,980


345
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,880
I took six of these diamonds. I cleaned up those serpents with one dirty look.

346
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,600
Serpents.

347
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,760
Well, look at this monster, so strong, so huge.

348
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,980
He'd frighten King Kong, but he's only man.

349
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:18,980


350
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:18,980


351
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,520
my stooge. The capture of Mola for me was just fun. Who ever said two heads were better

352
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,100
than one?

353
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:42,560
Who is the most remarkable, extraordinary fellow?

354
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,520
Wait a second. Who are you?

355
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,220
Who am I?

356
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,920
Who am I?

357
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,780
Who am I?

358
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,720
Who is the most remarkable, extraordinary fellow?

359
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:05,520
I am Sinbad the Sailor, that's who. What do you think you are anyway?

360
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,760
Well, I'm afraid of nobody under the sun.

361
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,240
Hey!

362
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,280
All I say is, move and my enemies run.

363
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:15,880
Hey!

364
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,480
Who's the most remarkable, extraordinary?

365
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,800
Who is the most remarkable, extraordinary fellow?

366
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,620
You are! Sinbad the Sailor, that's who!

367
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,420
Ha ha, that's right!

368
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,280
Touch of the ship, but bring me the woman.

369
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:44,500
Ah, those are again the potatoes in a fabulous rendition of one of the all-time great cartoon

370
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,480
songs of all time, Sinbad the Sailor.

371
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,320
But! But what's next?

372
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:05,400
subscribes to Tron

373
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:05,980
hope instead of

374
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,120
subscribing watch the next video

375
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,380
faut

376
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,760
I really didn't realize this.

377
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:14,100
It's just that I don't feel really stick with the game at all, it's nothing really. I got back to it as quick as this to do something.

378
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,380
I'm going to sleep, Tommy.

379
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,120
Parker, any answer to the line?

380
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,120
You're in contact.

381
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,760
All passengers, please stand by.

382
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,480
Tommy!

383
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,220
The first thing that happens is that the bones splinter.

384
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:51,820
Tommy!

385
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,320
We're moving over the conker.

386
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,380
Yes?

387
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,200
Yes?

388
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,560
Yes?

389
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,080
Press the button.

390
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,100
The door opens to let you in.

391
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,100
Parker, any answer to the line?

392
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,100
You're in contact.

393
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,160
Many of you out there,

394
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,840
we're going, who is this man, Bob?

395
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,860
I've heard of Bob, Reverend Stang.

396
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:51,080
I've heard he was, I agree, Bob's a good man.

397
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,560
He may be a prophet,

398
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,880
but I can't believe that J.R. Bob Dobbs

399
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,200
is the son of Jehovah One,

400
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,560
alien space god from some corporate sin galaxy.

401
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,020
They can't believe that

402
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,600
because they can't believe in anything nowadays.

403
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,160
Most of these kids,

404
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,960
but friends, I'm afraid it's true.

405
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,120
Now, they may point out,

406
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,900
now, no one's ever seen Bob, Reverend,

407
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:14,240
Stang.

408
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,780
How come all I've ever seen

409
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,420
is that clip art picture of a man with a pipe

410
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,680
grinning, looks sort of like Mr. Appleton

411
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,340
or Mark Trail or something.

412
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,140
Hugh Beaumont.

413
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,500
Or Hugh Beaumont or Dick Van Dyke

414
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,560
fropped out of his mind.

415
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,480
Friends, that's Bob.

416
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,520
You've seen him here and there.

417
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,800
Mutants get out and they paste up his picture

418
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,540
as part of this sick activism

419
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,660
that will someday result in the one world religion

420
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,260
foretold in all Bibles.

421
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,980
And on that day,

422
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:49,020
the waves will wash over the tops of skyscrapers

423
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,520
and the subgeni will float on high in their mobile homes

424
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,620
with their party equipment and secret herb,

425
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,840
the have a frob Zipulops that Bob gives them.

426
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,160
And the conspiracy will be no longer.

427
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,760
Big Bob.

428
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,580
Big Bob.

429
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,700
I got a mighty big Bob.

430
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,620
I got a mighty big Bob.

431
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,880
I got a big Bob.

432
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,440
I got a mighty big Bob.

433
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,880
And he's gotta come out.

434
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,660
Well, he must have got in.

435
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,420
He's gotta get out.

436
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,960
There ain't no room in the house.

437
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,560
He ain't got no room in my skin.

438
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,220
But there's a mighty big Bob.

439
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,920
In the inside of me.

440
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,860
He's a mighty big Bob.

441
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,260
You know he makes me be.

442
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,580
He's a mighty big Bob.

443
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,240
He's a mighty big Bob.

444
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,440
And he's really too big.

445
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,080
He's a mighty big Bob.

446
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,420
That will overcome Satan's powers,

447
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:17,120
or it's the anointing that will break the yoke of Satan's bondage.

448
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:23,840
And I want you to know that I have just been experiencing an attack on all sides.

449
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:28,200
It seemed like on every rift where we tried to advance,

450
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:34,920
the devil would just unleash literally hordes of demonic forces to stop us.

451
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,620
And after a few weeks of this,

452
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:42,860
I just began to feel a deep hurting in my belly.

453
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,680
Belly, way deep down in my spirit.

454
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,520
And some people said,

455
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,260
on top of what?

456
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,380
You mean you experience pain too?

457
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,140
Yes, I do.

458
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,640
I hurt just like you do.

459
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,200
I feel the pain of a Satanic attack just like you do.

460
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:01,720
But I really didn't even know how to pray because I didn't know exactly what the devil,

461
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,760
what was coming at me.

462
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,220
Satan was bombarding me from so many sides.

463
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,800
Actually, I felt kind of dumb.

464
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,800
Step in

465
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,880
to the wonderful world of autodynamics.

466
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,280
Step in to the swept wing Dodge of 1957.

467
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,240
If the last 50 years made such a change,

468
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,700
just imagine the New York of 1980

469
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,460
when everyone has a number instead of a name

470
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,040
and the government tells you whom you should marry.

471
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,880
Just imagine.

472
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,140
1980.

473
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,800
Oh, my goodness.

474
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,140
Oh, are you all right, doctor?

475
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,980
If that don't work, we'll bore you.

476
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,780
I'm healed again.

477
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,600
Right here, right in front of us, folks.

478
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,260
This ain't the highest quality slack I ever heard in my life either.

479
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,680
Yeah, well, it's better than that liquid slack we have to buy from you.

480
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,040
Hey, there's a caller.

481
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,500
We talked to Bosco Bear today.

482
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,160
Let's see what Bosco has to say.

483
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:06,660
Money.

484
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,800
Well, you know, it's a little known fact

485
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,460
that the soul is actually located in the foot.

486
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,080
Of course, it's not physically located.

487
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,500
It's not a physical thing.

488
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,320
It doesn't die with the physical body.

489
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,040
It rots, but it never actually dies.

490
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,720
It stays around.

491
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,820
Yes, the soul is the Strogebrug of the spiritual realm.

492
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,900
It wanders around trying to score a last bit of prop

493
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,360
before it passes over into the before life.

494
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:35,700
Diagram 7.

495
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,280
And, you know, a normal soul,

496
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,200
it just, when they get over into the before life,

497
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,040
they all just run together into one big slurry.

498
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:49,140
They get strained out and used in another normal in the next life,

499
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,320
but you couldn't really call it a next life because it's just normal.

500
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,060
Yes, but a subgenius soul becomes a dot.

501
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,300
They're hard to catch.

502
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,600
But what happens to a business executive's soul?

503
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,540
What happens to a business executive's soul?

504
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,920
Well, those are the ones that Bob will use as the main commodity

505
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:11,540
in his bargaining with the elder gods when the day of judgment arrives.

506
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,000
You should know that from looking at Prescripture 1714, Dr. Howell.

507
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:19,260
I presume you have been reading your prescriptures.

508
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,340
I was only making an inquiry on behalf of the many unenlightened listeners

509
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:28,500
who might be curious to know how vulnerable a business executive might be.

510
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,120
I've just noticed a certain lack of discipline around this.

511
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,900
I mean, this whole show thing,

512
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,760
I mean, just the fact that you call it a show.

513
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,760
Oh, don't eschew the show.

514
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,980
Don't eschew the show.

515
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,140
If the checks were bigger, the show would be better.

516
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,920
Oh, the checks, the money, I see.

517
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,080
Yes, if the checks were bigger, the balances would be greater.

518
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:56,620
Your love of Bob is in direct proportion to how much Bob pays you, right?

519
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,260
Oh, I think Bob's love of me is in direct proportion to how many souls I destroy.

520
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:05,400
Bob pays through the nose, and I've worn out many souls pounding the streets in his service.

521
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,660
That's right, and I've hurt my nostrils trying to receive those payments.

522
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,140
I had my third nostril forcibly opened by a crazed wino on Telegraph Avenue.

523
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,300
And that's the best way to do it.

524
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,700
That is really the best way, getting it on the street.

525
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,860
Don't forget that if you have any questions about the Church of the Subgenius

526
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:28,520
and our guru, J.R. Bob, quote, unquote, Bob Dobbs,

527
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:33,520
you may call here at the station, 823-7490, next week.

528
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,720
And we'll give you all that information.

529
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:41,700
Plus, don't forget the address we're going to give you at the end of the broadcast tonight.

530
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,220
And we are going to give you that address pretty soon, friends.

531
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,120
Get your pencils ready now.

532
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,320
Get to whittling that pencil down.

533
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,700
It's the same old address, but not enough of you seem to be writing it down.

534
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:03,640
So now we're going to take you directly, whoop, directly to the underworld, friends,

535
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,380
for a meeting with Bob.

536
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,940
Old Splitfoot himself.

537
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,020
Where are you taking me?

538
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,420
Where's Renee?

539
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,200
Where's Frenchy?

540
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,220
I demand an answer.

541
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,500
Ow!

542
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,240
Yoo-hoo!

543
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,120
Wait!

544
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,360
It ain't the new day.

545
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:35,800
I'm the new princess.

546
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,080
Come on.

547
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,940
Come on there, boy.

548
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,500
Gee, that girl was beautiful.

549
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,940
You said it, brother.

550
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:53,540
My boss is just dying to stick his fork in that there tomato.

551
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,260
Is your boss the leader of the sixth dimension?

552
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,420
No, that be the little midget king.

553
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,080
Ow!

554
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:07,560
Whatever.

555
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,260
You will never be as miserable as he is.

556
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:25,260


557
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:25,420
Promise me you say that one day.

00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:25,420


559
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:25,840

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:25,840


561
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,580
No good.

562
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,200
That's her favorite line.

563
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,200

Mike, you want to interject something here?

Because I don't want to get too abstract.

593
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,200

You haven't yet, but you haven't made any conclusion yet.

597
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,480
No, the conclusion is that like the corporate,

598
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,780
like the global world,

599
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,760

600
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,560

601

the super audience, the whole world works for itself.

00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:30,400
boy them was lean years brother and to wipe your ass with some genius

611
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:37,200
penitents back then and it was the only kind of paper there was no wonder there

612
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:44,720
was a bad bad depression all over the world kind of figures dateline for

613
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:50,140
dominance didn't mention that it would be caused by some genius Church and I

614
00:41:50,140 --> 00:42:01,300
can see why why Bob would not want to mention that in his his teachings to the

615
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,260
uninitiated they wouldn't understand

616
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:08,940
boy

617
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,580

618
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:14,700

619
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:14,700


620
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:20,820
we don't just sit here with our heads in our hands do we I mean can't they be stopped some way

621
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,280
any suggestions Bob

622
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,860
okay kids the car is packed now go and get your father and we'll look at some more new houses

623
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,620
you could have been a god

624
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:57,760
and we have two wonderful wiener stuff with eleven ingredients eleven ingredients

625
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,820
can you believe it we got to send money Bob that's all he care

626
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:04,400
is that little piece of your soul attached your money he doesn't spend the

627
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,340
money burns it but it's got your soul attach to a little bit of your soul is a

628
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:14,860
attached to your money because of the way the conspiracy set things up. You're spending soul

629
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:21,580
on the church, and that's the way you get some back. They say Jesus saves. Well, Bob invests

630
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:30,060
and gets interest. He spends, too. He spends, and he still lives. So get with it, man. You can buy

631
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:34,200
the tapes. You can become a member of the Church of the Subgenius and get the amazing

632
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:41,460
Quai yearly newsletter, The Start Fist of Removal. Yes, friends, it's 100 pages long.

633
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:50,860
It doesn't come out every month, but you'll get them. Uranus is a planet. It's very, very cold.

634
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:55,960
Show me Dr. O's. He's got a lot of stuff. He can't remember the red test fire, and he's got a lot of stuff.

635
00:43:56,020 --> 00:44:00,760
Oh, those fighting men of Uranus, they spawn when Judy calls. They got lava, rocks for gutters,

636
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,600
and they got little orbs to never find.

637
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,080
Oh, no!

638
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:15,220
You think the unthinkable. This radiation is beautiful. Yes, death is beautiful. Please, please, please, cover your faces.

639
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:25,680
That's the doomsday bomb. Do you know what that means? Do you know what that means? Do you understand? Do you understand?

640
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:33,680
Illusions, illusions, all illusions. Under a slack, a slack, slack, slack, slack mutant sheep projects paralyzing pop wings.

641
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,640
Look what they're worshipping. An atomic bomb.

642
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:45,980
Wow.

643
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,140
Captain, Mr. Spock, what's going on here?

644
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:57,620
No, you sniveling tucker. You say no to Aldo.

645
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,040
Aldo, respect.

646
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,620
Respect me.

647
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:01,400
Uh.

648
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,340
Uh.

649
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:03,460
Ape.

650
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:03,520
Ape.

651
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,120
I shall not kill apes.

652
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,040
Too late.

653
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:10,560
You should have told me sooner.

654
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,320
But it didn't hurt a bit.

655
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,120
Shall we try again?

656
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,820
Sure sign of social consciousness.

657
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,200
Sure sign of social consciousness.

658
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,640
Sure sign of social consciousness.

659
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:29,740
Well, um, why don't you let me get him down, and you talk to him about it.

660
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:30,820
Everybody wants to...

661
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,440
Your mother and I met.

662
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:33,440


663
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,000
I managed to accept it when you broke through the girl barrier.

664
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,300
I don't want him goofing things up.

665
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,460
Don't touch a thing.

666
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,580
I knew it was too good to last.

667
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,960
He's just come in, son. I'll get it for you.

668
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:46,320
I'll get it for you.

669
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:46,400
I'll get it for you.

670
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,980
There's this collar.

671
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,420
And it's long.

672
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:53,920
Dick and I know.

673
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:55,700
Yeah.

674
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,720
I guess you're right. It would take a man of iron.

675
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:03,420
Four hours left. I'll just keep reminding myself that she's married to my very own father.

676
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:03,420


677
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,740
And that she's a very old and very dear friend.

678
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:05,340
Huh.

679
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:09,340
If I know the Riddler, it'll be the biggest li-

680
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,040
Meanwhile!

681
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:13,180
Have you seen any unusual looking people around here?

682
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,060
Unusual? In what way unusual?

683
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:17,780
Their garb.

684
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:22,140
For instance, a man wearing a bright green suit with big black question marks on it.

685
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,700
Let me think a moment.

686
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,860
No, I can't say that I have, old man.

687
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:39,540
Such vandalism. Such vandalism.

688
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,100
Black museums are sure spooks.

689
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:43,800
That's drugs, my pet.

690
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:51,240
Why kill them fast when watching them die slowly is so much more entertaining, eh?

691
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,720
Well, what do you know?

692
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,160
Nukent.

693
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:04,940
Uh-huh.

694
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:27,180
Is he... Is he eating pee? Is he... Is he eating pee? Is he... Is he eating pee? Is he... Is he eating pee?

695
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,560
It was a twenty foot slender and incredibly fast...

696
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,020
Done!

697
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,980
The shark is coming under the boat!

698
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:38,420
That is very inviting, Mr. Holmes.

699
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,520
Sounds primitive, doesn't it?

700
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,260
I know this will sound funny to a scientist.

701
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,980
I can't do this!

702
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,000
Yuck!

703
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:00,840
Boo! Boo!

704
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:01,860
Ah!

705
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:03,900
Boo! Boo!

706
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:05,400
Boo! Boo!

707
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:07,660
Now, Space Cat 1!

708
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:08,200
Uh-huh!

709
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,780
I'm very space...

710
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:13,220
Oh, he's laying on the floor now.

711
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:17,680
What does Bob say about hardcore bands and about rock and roll in general?

712
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:32,420
Well, it's... You know, the conspiracy is pretty insidious and if it all sounds alike, that... That... That... You start to think now, is this getting me so... It couldn't be! Could my music, could my generation get...

713
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:37,160
Spawed out, sold down the river like the hippies?

714
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:42,300
Could it just be... End up old archaeological discoveries like the beatniks?

715
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:49,020
You know, could... No, that couldn't happen to... To my generation's personal style of grooviness.

716
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,120
That couldn't happen to punk.

717
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:55,440
That couldn't happen to new rage, hate, love music.

718
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,400
That couldn't happen to the next new thing, could it?

719
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:02,620
Friends, there's only one band that's gonna last through the... Through the 1990s.

720
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,840
And after. And that's Doctors for Bob.

721
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:05,760
Absolutely.

722
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:15,060
We've got some Doctors for Bob here, by the way. It's on that thing that says, church music that... Great Doctors for Bob tune. Can't hide from God. It's a religious song.

723
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:18,460
And you know what's really great about Doctors for Bob? They have no albums out.

724
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,240
That's not true. They have...

725
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:20,340
Oh, really?

726
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:26,160
Yeah. Dick... Doctors for Bob, Dick, comma, a girl is their first album.

727
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,220
Oh, they do have an album.

728
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:31,280
And then they've got another album out called, uh, We Could Have Saved Hank.

729
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,740
And that's, uh, but they... It's hard... They're hard to find up here.

730
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:40,640
Why did they do that, though? Why'd they put albums out?

731
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:50,380
Because they hate people. They hate the pinks. And they're... They're gonna deliver suffering and torment to those who can't understand them.

732
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:51,820
Praise Bob!

733
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:55,140
And meanwhile, the critics, oh, they love it! They love it!

734
00:49:55,460 --> 00:50:01,440
I tasted the hyperclete's vomit as it cascaded over me, they wrote in the New York Times.

735
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:06,540
And I refuse not to understand the statement on art that Doctors for Bob is making.

736
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:12,020
They said, uh-huh, yeah. They try to intellectualize the true word of Bob, friends.

737
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:17,600
Wow, that was close. He's a walking flame killer.

738
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,800
Shut up, you little...

739
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,900
Shut up, you little...

740
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:20,260
Oh, was he?

741
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:21,700
Smoke's the weapon.

742
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:22,240
Oh.

743
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,040
You can't work here, Newark.

744
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,420
You can't work here, Newark.

745
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:31,560
You're gonna die!

746
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,940
Shot that flame out of his mouth thirty feet away.

747
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,240
Ha, ha, ha!

748
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:37,460
Finley!

749
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:38,800
Ha, ha, ha!

750
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:39,800
There we...

751
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,660
Ha, ha, ha!

752
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,560
Ha, ha, ha!

753
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:45,200


754
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:45,500
Ha, ha, ha!

755
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:45,940
Ha, ha, ha!

756
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:45,960
Ha, ha, ha!

757
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,320
Uh-oh. Here come a few of Draco's pretty boys.

758
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,680
Robots? From outer space?

759
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:55,020
You know, this old Empire State Building is still pretty high.

760
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:58,320
And how clear the stars look from up here.

761
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:00,260
And how clear the stars look from up here.

762
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:01,400
And how clear the stars look from up here.

763
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:01,660
Hey, I see us!

764
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:02,960
Well, that was very good.

765
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,140
If you had been blind all this time, you'd have made it to Kelvin's

766
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:04,140


767
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:08,600
Because then, the leader of all the dragon men wasn't rhino, sunset us.

768
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:17,220
Though I've gotta admit you can tell us right now you're a non-intelligent

769
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:17,680
fellow.

770
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,200
Because come on, this is труbes!

771
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:18,580
T divergence, americans.

772
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:22,000
T巤 e cReMyP, teresa NeceC.

773
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,080
He's coming at me full speed. If he hits me, I'm a goner. Now!

774
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,040
Boom!

775
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,700
You know, I've been trying to win their bingo game.

776
00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:01,120
And, you know, if I dig a bunch of cans, well, they don't like that kind of thing.

777
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:05,300
And, you know, well, I could probably just pour all the beer out of it.

778
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,760
But, well, that'd probably kill my grass.

779
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:10,840
And, yeah, I don't want to do that.

780
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:12,900
And I could trade in for the aluminum.

781
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:20,640
But, yeah, it wouldn't be really worth the price of the gas of driving down to the aluminum recycling plant.

782
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:21,780
Yeah, they're probably.

783
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,020
It'd probably be worth, you know.

784
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,040
Yeah, that's what.

785
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,000
I could take them in for the aluminum, you know.

786
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:33,440
Because if I drank them, well, it'd probably be worth more if they were just the aluminum.

787
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:37,100
No recycling plant is going to buy aluminum with beer in it.

788
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:39,400
So I probably would have to drink it.

789
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:43,080
And, well, it, you know, helps wash down my food.

790
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:48,620
And it's probably, you know, if I, you know, didn't drink any today.

791
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:51,620
Well, five more days from now.

792
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:51,980
It'd be.

793
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:52,420
It'd be Sunday.

794
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:55,400
And I might want some and wouldn't be able to drink any.

795
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:59,640
So at least I could say, well, hell, I got blowed off my ass last Monday.

796
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:05,100
And, you know, well, these pop tops, well, some little kid could step on them.

797
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,880
Or, you know, even though they are still full beers.

798
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,420
And, well, yeah, they are in my refrigerator.

799
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:18,660
But, you know, by some twist of the imagination, this little boy's foot could conceivably.

800
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,520
I'm not saying that it's impossible.

801
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,380
But it.

802
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Could probably come into my refrigerator.

803
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,620
And he could, you know, cut his foot open.

804
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:32,920
And, well, if he sued me or something like that, the hospital bill would be far greater than this beer.

805
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:36,680
Is it probably even worth it if he did step on it?

806
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:46,660
And, well, as you know, so if I would drink it and properly take care of the beer cap, the beer can tops.

807
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,280
And that'd be one less thing.

808
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,480
One less thing on my mind.

809
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,940
That I wouldn't have to worry about.

810
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:57,320
And if I did get drunk, well, I probably wouldn't have to worry about it anyway.

811
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:02,580
Even though the fact that the beer can tops might be in, say, a trash can.

812
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:03,840
Along with the beer can.

813
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:04,540
Oh, yeah, but.

814
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:08,800
Yeah, I was going to send him, take him to the recycling plant so I could get the money for him.

815
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,020
That was another reason.

816
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:11,620
And, well, you know, these.

817
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:17,960
They went to all the trouble to paint the red, white, and blue Budweiser label on here.

818
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,820
And, well, I'd hate to, you know.

819
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,460
I like to support the office.

820
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:21,720
I like to support the arts.

821
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:22,980
I'm a patron of the arts.

822
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:25,480
I'd like to, you know, support them.

823
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,520
Well, Mr. Hobbs, how are we feeling today?

824
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:31,140
Oh, hello, Nurse Sandier.

825
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:32,360
It's so late.

826
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,520
I didn't think you were coming in today.

827
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:35,880
Would I miss a day with you, Mr. Hobbs?

828
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,280
Let me take a look at your leg.

829
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:38,680
Oh, careful.

830
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,360
Ooh, safe.

831
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,860
What are you doing down there?

832
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:46,020
What are you doing down there, friends?

833
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,140
Well, it's getting close to the end.

834
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,260
Before we go, let's play.

835
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:55,060
Let's play my favorite song by the great Zug's Rift.

836
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,760
Zug's Rift.

837
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:05,760
When my ship goes in, I'll be face down in the sand.

838
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:11,500
Burning in the sun on this distant island shore.

839
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:17,980
When my ship goes in, the captain will come to save me.

840
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:19,240
I'll give you a hand.

841
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:19,240


842
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:19,240


843
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:19,240


844
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:19,240


845
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:19,240


846
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:19,240


847
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,740
He's a bad news visit.

848
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,600
And see his face is mine.

849
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:31,080
When the spaceship lands, I'll be kissed by silver angels.

850
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:33,440
We'll drag you overboard.

851
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:36,700
For the jackal's quite my friend.

852
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,820
We'll take you to the leader.

853
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,400
Be a good man.

854
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,400
He's a bad news visit.

855
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,200
And see his face is mine.

856
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,220
Be a good man.

857
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:49,220


858
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:49,220


859
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:49,220


860
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:49,220


861
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:49,220


862
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:49,220


863
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:49,220


864
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:49,220


865
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:55,220
When I was stranded, I cried out for help.

866
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,640
Everyone ignored me.

867
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:00,780
They stood around in line.

868
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:06,160
When my ship goes in, to my lady of isolation.

869
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:09,040
There's a bad news visit.

870
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,900
And see his face is mine.

871
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:16,420
Free the people from the people.

872
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,260
From the basilica nation.

873
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:18,860
And the society.

874
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,720
Free the people from the people.

875
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:23,620
From the basilica nation.

876
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:24,380
And the society.

877
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:43,580
When my spaceship lands, the captain will come to save me.

878
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:44,960
I'll give you a hand.

879
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:45,880
He's a bad news visit.

880
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,240
And see his face is mine.

881
00:56:51,160 --> 00:57:00,880
When I was shadowed, I cried out for help Everyone ignored me, they stood around in

882
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:06,180
line When my ship was in, the captain looked out

883
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:11,720
to save me A gaze about his visit, and see his face

884
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:12,400
is mine

885
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:49,080
Here you go.

886
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:10,100
coloss về

887
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:14,300
friends that was of course

888
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:17,600
long time listeners I'm sure won't have any

889
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,420
question about that that was Zug's Rift singing

890
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:22,060
when my ship comes in

891
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:24,820
I bet one or two of you could relate to that one

892
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,680
well friends it's getting pretty close to

893
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,060
the end of our show and a good thing it sounds like

894
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:35,280
friends don't forget if you have any more questions about

895
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,360
the Church of the Subgenius and J.R. Bob Dobbs

896
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:43,000
you may write for free information
