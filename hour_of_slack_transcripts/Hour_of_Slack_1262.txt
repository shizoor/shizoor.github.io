I keep feeling and I hear shuffling noises all about me.
Shuffling?
Well, not exactly.
More like little sucking noises.
You know, a...
That's great.
Look!
I know who it is!
I know who it is that doesn't belong among us!
I swear, I know who it is!
It's...
The Self-Genius Hour of Slack!
Oh, that's not true!
Wake up, you...
Bob?
...forsaken people, you!
The best there is, this man here that works for you!
Your government, our country, the best country there is because of me like...
Bob?
I'm proud of you.
Bob?
They're gonna hear about this, not just in the territories, but in Washington.
Across the length and breadth of this nation, they're gonna know that name.
Bob?
Now, what do you got to say about that boy?
I was drunk.
I didn't know what I was doing.
I didn't know what I was doing!
I didn't know what I was doing!
Good morning and welcome to the Subgenius Devotional Hour here.
Um...
Before the normal scary time.
As the smoke of that burning goeth up forever...
...that was a stink-all.
But it had lots of prophecy involved.
You heard it right here on the Subgenius Hour.
And lots of few words.
Blood belches from the earth.
My lights in the sky rebuke thee.
The children of heaven.
and the angels from heaven are among these spreading lies and deception.
They turn not as they go.
Within five years, the United States, as we know it, will cease to exist.
We're living in terrible, perilous, chaotic times.
Praise the Lord.
And these times are not going to get any better, my friend.
Amen.
They're going to get worse and worse.
Love is free.
Okay, I know you all think you want to know what's going on.
That's okay.
So I saw this thing coming.
I saw this thing coming to me.
I didn't know what it was, but it looked funny.
There were deceptions which have surrounded our space program.
Spacecraft entered the moon's gravitational field in the sixth segment of the flight.
The gravity of the moon is one-sixth of that on Earth.
The orbit around the moon was flown 66 miles above the moon's surface at 6,000 miles an hour.
At 10 after 9, the beeping began.
It went down to the...
reserve fence, watched through binoculars, and we did see this thing.
Now, it's about the size of the moon, with a small crescent at the bottom that's well lit like starlight.
The top is a dark gray mass.
It came down through the trees, whatever it was.
Have you ever heard of one?
Have you ever been in one?
Have you ever seen one?
Have you, by television, ever seen one?
If you haven't, it's the greatest sight this side of heaven.
Good evening, everyone.
People from this Earth have already seen some of their spacecraft, which they call flying saucers, and other flying objects which they cannot describe.
These objects are real and are spacecraft.
I represent a group of scientists who work with but one purpose, to put an end to war.
Naturally, such a goal can't be obtained without
out experts of superior ability. Men of vision. Men such as you, Doctor. Gathered here, exchanging
information daily, putting aside all thoughts of personal success. We hope to achieve exciting
new techniques, leap years ahead of the others. I don't think I need to tell you how effective
our voices will be when the world learns of our achievements. Well, there you have it.
Nothing new, perhaps, but then, what is? They are friendly people and are by far more advanced
spiritually and physically than the people of this planet. At the present time, they are
observing us. They wish to help us to help ourselves to attain a higher understanding of life
and its meaning.
What do you think about Bob?
Who's Bob?
Alright, well, what do you think about the UFOs which are presently going to, which are
presently in formation to blitz the Earth and put particle beams through the head of
everyone that doesn't know Bob?
You're out of your mind.
And we're off this planet and out of this world soon.
Hey, friends.
Next week, in fact, July 5th, the world ends.
That's how we experts of superior ability decided to end war.
Anyway, that last clip there was a Reverend Stevie Hambong from ancient subgenius media
barrage tapes.
Before that, Leemur, penantanandi Leemur and Gartenius Alina, different cut-ups of openings,
mostly Leemur.
And I'm Bob.
And we heard some ancient KPFA puzzling evidence from Berkeley radio.
Really, a lot of stuff from the old media barrage, the lab explaining X-Day.
Later, we'll have documentary sex sounds.
Sex sounds from...
No one is ever safe on this hostile planet.
X-Day.
5X Day, actually, the last one.
By the way, this music in the background is from the original X-Day.



















The X-Day is the amino acids who are the headlining band for this X-Day.
The amino acids at amino acids at the amino acids dot com.
Now, friends, however, Reverend Susie the Ploosie brings us some of her X-Day love and expectation.
Enough to get me all expectorated.
I'm not going to lie.





Because nobody knows how to bring in the new end of the old universe like Susie the Ploosie.
It's getting late for the great planet Earth.
A storm of hail and fire mingled with blood is cast upon the Earth and a third of the
world is burned.
A fiery mountain is hurled into the sea and a third of the world is burned.





The sea and its creatures have perished.
A great star has fallen from heaven upon a third of the Earth's rivers and springs.
Their waters have become polluted and bitter.
The sun, the moon, and the stars are struck.
A third of the world is in darkness.
Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the Earth because of the risk of the trumpet blasts
which the angels are about to take.

The sound of the trumpet blasts are heard in the sea and the sea is broken.


It's a great sound.
It is done!
The final trumpet has sounded!
The mighty cities of the nations fall!
Islands disappear!
Mountains crumble!
As God's final wrath pours upon mankind!
As lightning flashes from the East to the West, so he comes.
The Son of Man, anointed in power, returns with majesty and glory to take his kingdom.
Bob, let's really have some smoke on this one, alright?
Alright!
Let's have some smoke, Bob.






Let's go.
Time is running out for the human race.
Get ready for the judgment day.
The sun is shining.
Come on, get happy.
The Lord is waiting to take your hand.
Shout hallelujah.
Come on, get happy.
We're going to the promised land.
And if she wants to get some white underwear, it might be best she get them in asbestos.
All right?
Might better get them in asbestos.
Listen, I'm teasing now, of course.
Don't let her put on asbestos britches.
All right?
It might be harmful to your breathing.
First, I want to remind you that in the last days, there will be some scoffers who will do every wrong they can think of and laugh at the truth.
If you are scoffing right now, in your heart, if you are not believing...
Bob!
...coming back, you are one of the signs of his coming.
If you're going to continue to scoff, will you do me a favor?
Prepare for the end.
Well, there's a day soon coming when the judgment of the world will begin.
When the sky will be darkened and the mountains dance like drunken men.
When the people of the earth will fall like fruit from the tree.
Oh, I wish you'd all believe me.
I wish you all could see.
I wish you'd all believe me.
I wish you'd all believe.
The truth will not hurt you.
Only the lie.
I wish you'd all believe me.
You don't really believe that, do you?
I don't know.
Impossible, fantastic, ridiculous, absurd. Really?
The ambush.
The set.
And it's working.
1998, the year of fear.
Jack, explain it way, please.
Now, these are not my dates.
We don't set dates.
This is one of the best intelligence sources in the world, along with Jane's defense out of England.
But let me tell you this, friend.
We believe things are going to come and happen sooner than we think.
The world must have seen it coming, right?
I'm afraid not.
Even though the technology had been around for years.
Nobody really paid too much attention to it.
Almost no one saw it coming.
Almost no one?
Yeah, almost.
Those of us who did express our concern were just branded as paranoid.
As people who hated technology.
People who just weren't ready to be part of a new, united world.
Don't listen not to this child of Satan.
Reverend, I gotta admit, this doomsday warning has me just a smidge twitterpated.
Oh, now be calm, Ned.
But be afraid also.
Tremendously afraid.
For the day of reckoning is upon us.
Oh, reckoning now!
We're heading across the river.
Wash your sins away in the tide.
It's all so peaceful on the other side.
Forget the troubles, come on, get happy.
You better chase all your cares away.
Hallelujah, come on, get happy.
Get ready for the judgment day.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
What about tomorrow?
Just four lives ahead.
Will there be a brighter future?
Or just how the world's gonna end?
Woo, woo, yeah.
Ain't gonna wait.
There's any length.
There's no time.
Ah.
Oh, what a horrible dream.
Ha, ha!
Oh, man.
Boy, that bitch was right.
I have fallen down on the job, ear seekers.
I've been pussyfooting and fiddle-farting around
at the most crucial juncture here of mutant existence ever.
Because this is a damn ministry here.
So from now until X-Day,
it's no more Mr. Nice Girl.
Oh, I've got to be more than just mere Reverend Susie the Floozy
to get this job done.
I've got to be the whore of Babylon on a three-headed pea dog, too.
Because it's time to sound the mutant survival call.
Too much is hanging in the balance here
because there are still unsaved subgenius souls out there.
Mmm.
I can wait.
I've freed your stench from here, baby.
Oh, yes.
It's the twilight of the elder gods for the Yeti Uber race.
And praise be the holy name of J.R. Bob Dobbs.
Because thanks to him,
we're scraping the crappy dirt of this planet off of our shoes, baby.
The doomsday clock is ticking down the final moments.
We're on a drunken chicken run with the end time.
And it's zooming up on us a lot sooner than they think.
Yes.
X-Day is coming up July 5th.
This very year, Seekers.
It's 7 a.m.
Think, if you haven't thought already.
Have you decided how you're going to spend eternity?
As a human pork rind screaming in the stinking wreckage of a dying planet?
No.
Or as a satisfied member of the fastest growing apocalypse cult,
snugly ensconced aboard the escape vessels of the sex goddesses,
en route through space and time to an idyllic future of sated lusts and mind-reaming pleasures?
Duh.
Tough choice, huh?
Oh, but there are some among us who aren't sure yet.
Maybe they can't.
I can't quite tell if they're pink.
Or if they're truly a mutated son of Dobbs.
Hell, just send in that membership fee.
And whether you're pink or not, chances are everything will be fine.
Hell, those saucers come with airlocks and torpedo tubes.
I'm sure we'll be able to do a little weeding out once we're airborne.
Oh, but that can come later.
And hopefully there won't be a lot of weeding to do.
Because weeding's hard on a girl's knees.
But I don't expect a lot of the wrong kind of people to be on board if you catch my drift.
Because they're going to be misreading the flaming signs in the heavens
and trying their brand-X apocalyptic solutions until it's too late to turn to Bob.
Oh, but they never have been able to figure out how to get it right anyway.
Oh, they screw it all up.
They can't tell a 999 from a...
666.
And I can see how they could mistake our triumphant subgenius Ragnarok for their cheesy bargain basement Armageddon.
Oh, but hey, you putzes.
Armageddon tired of waiting for you to get around to it.
Your god can't get it up to destroy the Sodom and Gomorrah that it has created for itself.
Oh, but Bob's going to clean house on his own.
This cat box, but good.
And the mighty wrath of Jehovah One and Negi and the elder gods and the sex goddesses are just for the overkill.
Oh, Bob, great is thy power.
Cream rinse us all in your sweet load and rupture us up into the heavens.
Yay, we strip naked and light the sacred froth and implore your mercy upon your believers.
Yay, yay, yay.
Yay, yay, yay.
In the days of the end, there shall come from among the race of men a new ruler.
From the chaos of the nations, he will forge peace and security.
As one risen from the dead, he will entrench the world with his sorcery.
And at the time appointed, he will take his place in the very temple of the Lord of Hosts.
Scattering the true children of the Father over the face of the whole earth.
He is Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
What makes Bob holler?
What makes Bob holler?
When I asked Bob, he explained this way.
And he said,
Well, when a little sweetie pie in a misker twirls by and rolls those big blue eyes,
Oh, I holler.
And when some pretty chick says she loves my fiddle legs,
Well, now then, that can do the trick.
Oh, I holler.
Oh, I holler.
And, uh, you know, even if X-Day didn't work out, we'll go for Sex Day.
We want you to have a dance into the new century.
Screw into the new century.
Sleep and eat your way into the new century.
And the baptism is basically to wash away that pink taint from rubbing elbows with and kind of purify them.
The baptism is a very beautiful event because, you know, it's a very beautiful event.
Most of us need a bath.
Okay.
And now, I want you to gently feel your neighbor's nipple to your left and to your right.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!

Oh!
Oh!


Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!




Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
I love you!
All of those flying saucers are my friends, cause there's so much!
I'm gonna see them again and again.
Is that before or after the bob pills?
Monsters like to men will be around the all about and gently need to look past a door which should be locked.
and thy sciences will terrify thee and bring thee not the devil,
for thine spirit is locked away inside the white stone,
which my angels have grieved from space.
Where are we, Bob?
The code is broken.
Trouble?
Big.
Security.
I have the lid on tight.
Well, take it off for me.
The message is, Mars needs women.
Oh, God.
This is so wrong.
I love it.
It's moments like that that make me think we're really all going to hell after all.
It's a way of getting back to all the slack you had when you were a little kid.
Remember when you were a little kid,
and you'd be able to do this?
You'd be able to just sit there with your little plastic soldiers.
You'd create a whole fantasy world around you.
This is it.
We've created our own fantasy world around us.
That's what religion's for, right?
To create a fantasy world.
But we live our fantasy world out.
We don't wait until we die.
Oh, man, John.
Whoop her, Andrew.
Whoop her real, Andrew.
I got exactly what I wanted!
I got exactly what I wanted!
I got exactly what I wanted!
All right! Praise Connie!
Bob's a small guy, physically.
I'm pretty convinced.
Uh-huh.
You seen the photographs?
So those are the autopsy photographs that were rearranged to look like choir photographs.
I'd never trust an autopsy photo.
Bob's only got getting back home on his mind now.
Hi, Bob.
Right, Bob?
Bob.
Bob.
I came as a visitor, not an invader.
I must get back to my ship, see if I can repair it.
And then I must leave.
No, wait!
What harm is there in hearing them out?
Other than being a salesman, what does Bob do for a living?
Other than being a salesman?
Bob is not on Route 80 with a bag full of brushes on his head.
Who has met Bob?
He seemed extremely paranoid.
He believed in conspiracies.
Uh.
He came on like a Nazi.
I was afraid of him.
Your tricks don't frighten us, neither do you.
We've come a long way in 5,000 years.
But you're still of the same nature.
I could sweep you out of existence with a wave of my hand and bring you back again.
I can give life or death.
What else does mankind demand of its gods?
Mankind has no need for gods.
We find the one quite adequate.
We shall not debate, mortal.
We shall not debate, mortal.
Say we cannot have non-發展面.
Next time we'll show you what was and will not be.
ласти
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.
At this very moment, there have been stories filtering into the studio
about other sports events being kidnapped and the entire thing taken to another planet.
That's right. These are aliens from another planet kidnapping our American sports teams.
It's not a legal problem. It's not a political problem.
It's an alien problem.
Oh, I've never seen one.
You know, the visits from aliens need not be a painful item.
It can be quite an exciting time.
I don't personally have any desire to have it.
It's like meeting Bob. I don't want to do it.
I just need to get you to understand exactly what's happening here at the Church of the Subgenius
and the organized crime fighting that we're doing here in California.
But as soon as we're gone, you folks who are here unsaved, you folks listening by radio,
you folks listening by record, once the church is gone, there's going to be a cataclysmic judgment
and millions will die in those next few years.
They'll be glued to their sets, watching rockets and jets,
blowing up schools and factories, putting an end to the birds and bees.
It's worth every penny to tune in and see
who wins the Emmy at the ruin of the Academy.
Watch World War III on pay TV
before your television melts away.
It's the end of the world as we know it.
It's the end of the world as we know it.
It's the end of the world as we know it.
I feel fine.
A-O, let's go.
You see them in the back now.
What they want, I don't know.
They're all ripped up and ready to go.
Turn around.
Go back down, back the way you came.
Can't you see that flash of fire?
Ten times brighter than the day.
And behold, a mighty city
broken in the dust again.
Oh, God, private man
broken in the dust again.
It's gonna be me
and it's gonna be you.
We're gonna do everything we want.
It's gonna be now.
And I can't wait.
To say goodbye to fear
and all that pain at hand.
Oh, like a flaming baton
that's burning us, whoa.
Like George Bush on acid
singing into the world.
Gonna be a new world.
Gonna be a new world.
Gonna be a new world.
I will stand
to anyone's last words.
There's nothing left for you to say.
Soon you'll pretend anyway.
Well, no one here is getting out alive.
There's someone really lost my mind
and I don't care.
So close your eyes
and get yourself involved.
It's gonna be me and I don't care.
And think about the times we've been and what they've been
To me it's nothing, to me it's nothing
To me it's nothing, to me it's nothing
We're only gonna die from our own arrogance
That's why we might as well take our time
Stop the traffic, stop the law, stop the law
I wanna get off, I wanna get off with you
One more job in the supermarket
One more kick to get me started
Everyone get on board
This ship is sinking
Looking for a way in, searching for the way out
Angels ride free in your mind
But you're never gonna find it if you're never gonna try
Get your eyes on the road and suck the wild
Hey man, get hip
Climb aboard our pleasure ship
Speed boy, we know
You're king of the real, yeah, come and go
You're the king of the real, yeah, come and go
Go Apollo 69
Rock it baby, walk the line
We feed the fire, now's the time
Fly Apollo 69, yeah, yeah
The beginning was the end
Of everything now
The ape regards his tail
He's stuck on it
Three pinks until he fell
Half a goon and half a dog
A man's not made of steel
See the fire sweeping
Our very streets today
Burn like a red coal carpet
Mad bull has lost its way
Born a shielded
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
Born a shielded
It's just a shot away
Shot away, shot away
When we were born into this life
We were destined to make it right
And it's predetermined
And this is our fate
We're singing this song
So you can read late
We are going to save the universe
We are going to save the universe
We are going to save the universe
We are going to save the universe
This part
We're all tied between
We made it man
There is no future
In England's dreaming
No future
No future
No future
No future for you
No future
No future
No future
No future for me
No future
No future
No future
No future
What?
Of the limitless sex and violence
in the wake of Ragnarok.
Welcome to the slaughter.
What are you going to do?
What will be your epitaph?
When we get done with you,
are you going to cry for your mama?
Are you going to have a good time?
Are you going to be a bohub?
When it's your turn to die,
don't get crazy.
Let them all around.
Anarchy here.
Rural streets in the Ragnarok party town.
Isn't it assumed,
when somebody is these religions suitable for you,
you will come closer to them just like they have to you.
There areumes of each pote,
and word curses the 🎄

Who says so?
I?
Experience?
Just put some bleachers out in the sun and uh, having out on highway 61.
Oh yeah!
Bye.
Bob?
Bob?
Really don't mind.
Bob?
Bob?
Next Day Song Collage.
They're put together by yours truly
with a bazillion different commercial bands.
And before that,
some old, young, glass madness
and puzzling evidence on the radio.
And now, with amino acids in the background,
me doing the credits.
No one is ever safe on this hostile planet.
No way, man.
Because that people will obviously
just look at Pope Black here.
Pope David Lee Black
preaching at the Euro X Day
in London last year.
I'm going to talk to you about the conspiracy.
Now the conspiracy
is that one world, one government,
one taco, one Pepsi,
one goddamn tight-knocky tight t-shirt,
one fucking football,
one football game world
that'll have a fucking Big Mac in your mouth
and a gas pump in your ass
begging you
and you'll beg them to give you a credit card.
But there's only one way
to get rid of it.


to get rid of this conspiracy.
And that is to burn money.
We gotta burn some money.
I want you to get out your money.
Get out your money.
Who's got money to burn?
We got some money to burn right here.
We got more money to burn.
Oh, hallelujah.
More money.
We got dollars.
We got rupees.
We got euros.
We gonna burn some money.
Hallelujah.
Smoke that money.
Woo.
Oh, yeah.
Burn money.
Burn.
Burn.
Burn.
Burn.
Evil money.
Burn it.
The dollars and euros.
Burn it.
I have a gold nose.
Pleased to meet you, sir.
They shot him in the foot just for his boots.
Well, here's your gold nose.
Thirty dollars cash.
You like this model?
I don't know.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, Paul, thanks a lot.
There ain't nothing better.
Oh, come on.
Where is it?
Where is it?







Here it is.
It's in the range, we heard.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But hey.
Hey.
Cash deal.
Cash.
It is better to have more and, uh, not need than to have more and, uh, not want.
Uh-huh.
I don't know.
We were in a cattle loon on a moonlit night when a group of flying saucers came flying
into sight.
Oh, no.
Ew.
Ew.
Let's get out of here.
They're getting too close.
And they're starting to close.
They're getting too close.






Oh, no.
I'm turning up the gas.
Come on.
Let's go.
Oh, no.
See you better.
Let's get out of here.
The heavy anti-magnetic hydrosuper saturated.
Cycletrated, adiopated bottoms that are corrugated.
Electroplated gyroscopic catalytic simulator.
Saucers in the sky.
Saucers in the sea.
Flying saucers everywhere.
Coming after me.
Slipping in the spite.
Unified saucer rack.
Look, sitting on top, it's a flying saucer rack.






It's a five-photonics tank.
Don't worry, kids.
Everything's all right.
Oh, no.
Ew.
Ew.
Get us out of here.
It's a rock and roll band from the back of the moon.
I don't think I've ever heard a prettier tune.
One, two, three.
Let's get on with the show.
We have anti-magnetic hydrosuper saturated.
Cycletrated, adiopated bottoms that are corrugated.
Electroplated gyroscopic catalytic simulator.
We have anti-magnetic hydrosuper saturated.



Saucers in the sky.


Saucers in the sky.

Saucers in the sea.
Flying saucers everywhere.
Coming after me.
Slipping in the spite.
Unified saucer rack.
The mutants must hear
The mutants must cry
The saucers will cry
And the darlings will cry
And that was Gary Gbrogfrag.
Mein Führer, we cannot allow like a mind-shaft gap, baby.
Und why not?
I mean, Mr. President.
That's Mrs. President to you, Danny.
I mean, Mrs. Show is.
Ms. President.
Ms. President.
President Princess Wee Ardo.
Presidentress of all the UFOs.
As we shall learn when they finally arrive here on Earth Farm 1.
This sunny July 5th, 2003.
Or one of these July 5th.
And I'm waiting for our lovely miss.
And here she is.
One of these 7 AMs.
The Princess of Wee Ardo.
Queen of all.
I'm just taking a look.
I'm taking all of the Bahamas in my ship.
That's all I want.
That's all?
Yeah, that's all I want.
Just that?
Just the Bahamas.
I'm taking all the bananas.
The Caribbean Islands.
All the Caribbean Islands.
That's my little chunk.
I'm just going to take that wedge.
I'm taking all the carabaras.
Well, you know, I still have dibs on the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.
Grand Canyon.
I'm taking all the treasures of the Iraqi National Museum.
I'm taking all the treasures of the Iraqi National Museum.
I'm taking all the treasures of the Iraqi National Museum.
Lost in questions.
Lost in time.
Lost in space.
Lost in a quest for holy grails and grace.
A wild cry cuts through the night sky below.
Another traveler's packed and ready to go.
I can feel more.
I can feel more down.
I can see more white, blue, green, and brown.
I can hear the lights of night turn to sound.
I can feel I'm out of town.
I can stop.
I'm falling down.
I can see the world spinning around and around
and around.
spinning around.
I'm spinning around spinning around and around.
Spinning around and around, and around.
Spinning around, and around.

Chaz Smith, a clip from his new rock opera.
There's more of that coming up, actually.
And, well, surprises in store.
I'm terribly sorry to intrude on your hour of slack,
but I eat plutonium, and subsequently, I fart radiation,
and I thought you ought to know that.
Now back to the end of the world.
Praise God.
And I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.
This is your last chance.
After this, there is no turning back.
You take the blue pill.
The story ends.
You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.
You take the red pill.
You take the red pill.
You take the red pill.
You take the red pill.
You take the red pill.
You take the red pill.
You take the red pill.
You take the red pill.
You stay in Wonderland.
You stay in Wonderland.
And I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.
Goes.
Goes.
And you can get that red pill.
His hands are bloody.
His head is unbound.
For the locals.
I have to take a break for the locals here.
And his brow is furrowed.
For the locals, you can take that red pill.
Coming up next week, Thursday night, I will not be here because I will be at Brushwood
awaiting the rupture, my friends.
Sitting in a pile of his own pieces.
Hoping against hope.
The X's will come down.
And Dave and Stang and Princess Wee and Legume and Ed Strange and Doc and Froppin and Sister D
and the whole litany.
We'll be there.
Beggars and thieves.
We'll be there.
A whole lot of the old timers and a whole lot of the new covers.
One big family of beggars and thieves.
X-Day.
The subgenius.
End of the world.
I'm going to grow a crab claw out of my left hand.
And you can get more information if you want to go to that there party.
I'm going to grab Legume's and I'm going to take Legume and grab him by the teeth.
Then I'm going to go back to the dinosaur age in a time machine.
I'm going to use that thing to make love to an ankylosaur.
I'm sure this talk of Legume's sex life is making us all bored.
I'm going to take that pussy.
I'm going to take that bit of a kitten ice cream.

I'm going to take that conversation hand and reach for a star and pull it down.
And there's Legume's shock parts.
So, stuck smelling.
Okay, well you can get more information if you want to go to that at...
At www.subgenius.com or at brushwood.com.
Hell, just find your way to Sherman, New York.
Ask the locals.
Ask the locals.
You won't even have to ask.
They'll take one look at you and go,
Oh.
You're looking for that.
Bailey Hill Road.
Bailey Hill Road.
Go down there.
Turn left at the Amish guy in the cart.
You'll see.
You'll know when you're there.
You'll with it.
The bags on your feet.
When they see those polystyrene bags on your feet and this other strange hazmat uniform.
The boys are going to be the shirts in this game of life, my friends.
And we'll let you gals be the skins.
And by their dudes shall they be known.
Now we're going to have a football game.
Touch football.
Football.
It don't count unless you leave a mark.
Oh, there's a whole special Olympics.
A game of Frick's Ministeria.
We're going to have a game of touch the donkey's foot.
And golf.
We've got like a whole.
Oh, there's a superhero ball.
Jesus is coming as money man.
Some extreme sports.
We'll be making soap out of pink rectums.
Dave, what extreme sport are you partaking in?
The blaster game.
It's two 300-pound howitzer or cannons placed at either end of a field pointed directly at each other.
With all of the pink boys and girls all assembled right behind them.
And at one fell swoop, they all expectorated.
Oh, there goes another one.
Frick.
And it again.
Bob escaped from hell.
He dug his way out using his entrenching tool.
He tricked the devil in a card game.
He cuckolded the devil.
He got kicked out of hell, friends.
Bob still flying that jet plane overhead.
He's protected.
See for your eyes.
You are a disbeliever.
For some genius menace, praise Bob.
That's all right.
Sit right down here on this stump.
We won't talk petty games or unusual behavior.
Now, your name is on the dossier.
Very clearly it is pronounced like this.
I know a bit of petty games.
We will discuss how you can get out of here in the most efficacious way.
You don't want to pay too much.
You want to be safe.
You want to be bad.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, my pleasure vessel where it's always a stadium concert.
It's a never-ending party in the stadium.
One after another.
I don't think we could describe what our pleasure vessel would be like.
Could we, Princess?
Mine is very, very hard to describe.
It's kind of interdimensional in nature.
You take one step one way and then the next thing you know.
You could lose it there, man.
You know, you could lose it.
Actually, you know what song I want to play since this is the end of the world and all that?
You know, finally, we just have to do it.
Because they always yell it out anyway.
So here you go.
Everybody yells it out.
I remember when they used to yell them all the time.
They would hold their little frustration fingers.
Up with the lighters in them.
Yeah, I remember.
I remember that time.
Do you remember when the bird went down?
It was so sad of day.
Oh, how can you forget those times?
How could you forget?
The whole band was pretty much gone in the one fell swoop.
But the memory keeps going back.
Oh, yeah.
Bad memory keeps going back on you.
Oh, yeah.
Sometimes you...
Hey, Dave.
Be a simple kind of man, would you?
Stop being so oblique.
Be a simple kind of man.
Be straightforward.
Say what you really mean.
Be a simple kind of man.
I want to...
I want to...
That's better.
...and in it
When the trumpet calls, X-Day
In a brother and sister band
When they blow the world away
We shall have paradise
Subgenie of the world unite
Alien sex every night
Subgenie of the world
Subgenie of the world
Subgenie of the world unite
Stay in hand
When the trumpet calls

I'll next time.
Our coming friends, and you are too.
They didn't take us seriously last time.
Hell, half of you didn't take us seriously.
Didn't take Dobbs' prophecy seriously.
But this time we've learned our lesson.
We can't rely on invisible monsters from outer space.
We can't even rely on Bob.
We have to learn how to escape Earth
without being dependent on the conspiracy
or any extraterrestrials or salesmen.
Sure, send in your 30 bucks,
but build your own ship!
You may not have to,
but just recover your ass.
Build your own ship!
Even better, go buy Hangar 18
or Area 51 or Cape Canaveral
or Studio 54
and steal your own ship!
Ah, yes.
Extract your own fuel.
And while you're at it, friends,
let's swab the deck on the spaceship
that we're already stuck together on.
We're already riding on the spaceship
and it's in bad shape.
And it's high time we cleaned it up.
Earth, we must get off!
Whether we leave it or leave it a cinder.
Whether we blow it off or blow it up,
just don't blow it, friends!
Do not measure this.

Without asking why
Footprints in the sand stretch for a hundred miles
And every now and then they're washed away by another tide
But the world still won't make sense for tomorrow's child
And the wind blows through your hair on the final ride
And you let go of all your cares because now it's time to fly
And your soul is left to bear no more to hide the child
No more to hide the child
No more to hide the child
Have you ever stood and prayed at the altar steps
Looking through steel eyes from an eagle's nest
And watched the waves roll right into the last lost soul
And take a breath and still your heart
Not to cry

weakestmpanel speakers
And you're born on the samers
In man's state
But don't function on us
And be afraid of the princely
Okie, so hear this
Stand strong
Let yourself be ins Dynamite
Let all these mushrooms squeezing away

Pretty little public

Cause now it's time to fly
And it's all is left to bear no more
To hide the child
No more to hide the child
No more to hide the child
To hide
To hide
To hide
To hide
To hide
Into the sun

You are trying to sterilize decent pink American humanity.
We're trying to sweep clean the filth and the trash that has ruined this planet.
It's a small project compared to those of our mentors, the exes from outer space.
They would have cleaned up the vermin, which we call humans, long, long ago.
