00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,160
The Power of Slack!

2
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:32,120
The Power of Slack!

3
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,560
The Power of Slack!

4
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,340
The Power of Slack!

5
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,020
The Power of Slack!

6
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,800
The Power of Slack!

7
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:22,340
The Power of Slack!

8
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:46,540
The Power of Slack!

9
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:22,680
The Power of Slack!

10
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,120
The Power of Slack!

11
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,180
The Power of Slack!

12
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:19,160
The Power of Slack!

13
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,740
The Power of Slack!

14
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,280
The Power of Slack!

15
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,720
The Power of Slack!

16
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,880
The Power of Slack!

17
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,560
The Power of Slack!

18
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,100
The Power of Slack!

19
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,100
Oh baby!

20
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,660
The Swingin' Love Corps is there,

21
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,720
a live version of The Fog and The Dew,

22
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,000
originally a Rudy Schwartz project,

23
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,140
originally a Rudy Schwartz project,

24
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,920
tuned by Joe Newman, the swinging love corpses, dear friend.

25
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,340
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

26
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:08,160
Let me try to explore a little cock in layperson's terms.

27
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,520
As I understand it, cock is really accurate.

28
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,260
Yes.

29
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,540
Is that correct?

30
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,960
That's correct.

31
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,440
And, I mean, I was thinking about my cock opening where he said,

32
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,940
A gentle lady from Colorado is recognized for ten minutes.

33
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,880
A little collage by Fernanda Nandeli-Mur.

34
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,600
And now, Brother Cleve Duncan.

35
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:38,500
Yes, dear friends, Brother Cleve Duncan himself will recite the legendary brag of the subgenius.

36
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,340
I picked the goddamn terror of the fucking gods out of my nose.

37
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,880
I'm implying my language, but...

38
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,280
Let the sons of God and man be a witness.

39
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,420
Even in the...

40
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,860
In the belly of the Thunderbird, I've been casting out the false prophets.

41
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,700
I'm busting a gut and blowing my O-ring, and I'm right to throw a loaf.

42
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,540
For I speak only the fucking truth, and never in my days have I spoke other than.

43
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,020
For my every utterance is a lie, including this very one you hear.

44
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,640
I say, fuck them if they can't take a joke.

45
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,320
By God, anything for a laugh.

46
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,180
I say, I am the last remaining homo correctus.

47
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,360
I am the goddamn man of the future.

48
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,900
I'll drive a mile so not just to walk a foot.

49
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,960
I am the human being of the first goddamn water.

50
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,320
Yes, I am the javelina.

51
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,420
I am the humping junkie that jumped the men from Mars.

52
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,480
I drank the devil under seven tables.

53
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,580
I am too intense to die.

54
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,620
I am shielded by acts of God and Satan.

55
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,700
I was shagged by bodiless fiends and alien Jews from a corporate galaxy.

56
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,760
And got away with their hubcaps.

57
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,720
I cannot be tracked on radar.

58
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,380
I swear nothing uniform.

59
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,680
I wear God no, God no, no goddamn uniform.

60
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,860
I tell you right now, I was suckled by a triceratopsis.

61
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,880
I gave the anti-virgin a high protein tonsil wash.

62
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,760
I'm a bacteriological weapon.

63
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
I'm armed and I'm loaded.

64
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,520
I'm a fission reactor.

65
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,960
I fight plutonium.

66
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,360
Power plants are fueled by the sweat from my brow.

67
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,920
When they plug me in, the lights go out and hong fucking kong.

68
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,580
I weigh 666 pounds and zero gravity.

69
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,400
Come and get me, motherfucker.

70
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,820
I sign retired space baby bastards across the cosmos.

71
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,140
I cook and eat my dead.

72
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:15,940
Yahoo!

73
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,760
I am the unshaven Thor.

74
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,060
The poetry of the Atlanta Zoo.

75
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,140
I pay no motherfucking taxes goddamn.

76
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,800
Shit, piss, pee your own damn ass.

77
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,380
The devil's hands are my ideal playground.

78
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,760
I hold the seven bladed windbreaker.

79
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,580
The wheels that turn are behind me.

80
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,400
I think backwards.

81
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,400
I do it for fun, motherfucker.

82
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,020
I do it for motherfucking fun.

83
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,020
My imagination is a fucking canter.

84
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,380
And I'll poke it before it pokes me goddamn.

85
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,080
They say a godzillion is the highest number there is.

86
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,640
Well, by god, do I do count to godzillion and one?

87
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,320
Yes, I'm the purple flower of hell county.

88
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,160
Give me wide berth when I drop my droll mother nature swoons.

89
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,100
I use a python for a prophylactic.

90
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,520
I'm thicker, harder, and meaner than the Alaskan pipeline.

91
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,720
And I carry more spew.

92
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,880
Yes, I'll freeze your seed before it hits the bathroom floor.

93
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

94
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,180
I kidnap the future and ransom it for the past.

95
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,380
I made breath wilt the tree of life.

96
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,760
I left my spore on the rock of ages.

97
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,700
Who'll tell me flesh with me?

98
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,080
Who'll split their juice?

99
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,320
Who'll guard with me?

100
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,020
Whose candy will I fight out?

101
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,340
Whoo!

102
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:24,780
Whoo!

103
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:25,800
I'm ready!

104
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,920
I'm ready, daddy!

105
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,100
Take the job, daddy!

106
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,720
I'm ready!

107
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,100
Step aside, all you butt-limb, neurotic, insecure, bespectacled slabs of wimp meat.

108
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,380
I'm a crime-fighting master criminal.

109
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,120
I am not insane!

110
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,880
You hear me, motherfuckers?

111
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,880
Not insane!

112
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,860
I'm a screamer and a laugher.

113
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,400
I make a spectacle of myself.

114
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,760
I am a sight!

115
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,340
I am a sight!

116
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,680
Goddamn, my physical type cannot be classified by science.

117
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,940
My familiar is a picture of exactly life.

118
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,500
I feed him dipshits.

119
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,640
I communicate without wires or strings.

120
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,760
I am a thuggy.

121
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,060
I ain't feeding the tongs.

122
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,960
I have the evil eye.

123
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,440
I carry the mojo bag.

124
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,220
I swam the Bermuda Triangle and didn't get wet.

125
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,200
I circumcised dinosaurs with my tips and make them leave a tip.

126
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,460
I change tires with my tongue and my tool.

127
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,220
Every night I hook up a lunger and extinguish the sun.

128
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,940
The sun goes right out of the atmosphere, you queer.

129
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,740
I'm the Bigfooted Devil at level 14.

130
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,680
Who will come shoot me?

131
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,060
Where's the robot child who tried to blow me down?

132
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,040
I package the brownies of the gods.

133
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,020
I leak the plague from my nether pods.

134
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,060
Opiates are the mass of my religion.

135
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,280
I take drugs!

136
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:31,960
Yes!

137
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,300
I'm a ripstone.

138
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,260
I grab coca leaves right into the arm veins before they pick up the tree.

139
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,780
Space monsters cringe at my tread.

140
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,740
I wipe the pyramids off my shoes before I enter my house.

141
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,900
I'm fuel-injected.

142
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,740
I live forever.

143
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,200
And remember, afterwards, I'm immune.

144
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,120
I'm radioactive.

145
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,200
Come on!

146
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,940
Give me cancer!

147
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,020
Give me cancer!

148
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,920
I'll spit up the tumor and butter my bread with the juice.

149
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,280
I'm supernatural!

150
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,880
I'm supernatural!

151
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,900
I've been crow-viled with my meat, axe, and thumb.

152
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,160
My eye droppings bolt through the earth and erupt because I'm China.

153
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:03,900
Yes!

154
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:09,460
I can drink more wine and stay sober than all the heathen Hindus in Asia.

155
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,780
Yee-hoo!

156
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,880
God bless you!

157
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,100
I am the world!

158
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,360
I am a moray eel!

159
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,780
I am a Komodo dragon!

160
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,340
I am a killer whale befitting of its pup!

161
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,160
I have a triple-track bone!

162
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,900
I was scythed by the wolfmen!

163
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,860
Give me all, all, all your slack!

164
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,220
I told Jesus I wouldn't go to church and he shook my hand.

165
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,280
I have my own personal savings.

166
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,500
I change them every hour.

167
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,980
I don't give a fuck if there's life after death.

168
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,340
I want to know if there's any fucking slack after death!

169
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,480
I am a god-damn visionary!

170
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,860
I see the future and I know there's a future.

171
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:43,860


172
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:43,860


173
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:50,280
past in comic books and wine bottles. I eat black holes for breakfast. I bend my jeans and whittle

174
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:57,240
in my DNA with the sheer force of my mighty will. I steal my own goddamn evolution. I ran out of

175
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,340
heaven and sold it to hell for a private goddamn praise bob. Praise bob. I am enlightened. I

176
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:11,580
achieved Nevada and took it home with me. I am so ugly the speed of light can't slow me down.

177
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:17,280
The gravity won't tug at my cuffs. When the rapture comes, I'll make them wait. They'll never clean my cage.

178
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:29,500
That was Brother Cleve Duncan doing my brag, my brag. And now, well, here's me bragging on

179
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:41,480
the great Reverend Saint Dr. Cleve Duncan. A mean son of a bitch. A crib fisherman if ever there was.

180
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:50,540
Yeah, you heard me right. A crib fisherman. Damn crib fisherman. And a skull farmer. A skull farmer

181
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:58,160
if ever I seen one. I've seen that goddamn Cleve farm over 80 skulls out there on the 840.

182
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,860
He was killing them and farming them down. Spreading that. He'd squirt that seed

183
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:11,560
all over the damn pasture. I don't know how he did it. He must have a damn seed bag the size of a

184
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:19,100
fucking watermelon or somethin'. He'd break for a goddamn beer every now and then.

185
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:27,200
Sucked down one of them damn malt things, shaking that damn hair of his all over the place.

186
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:33,960
And he'd go back to farming them dun skulls. He'd pull his pants down, you see. They'd he'd, uh,

187
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,420
he'd jump down into one of them furras. They'd plow this field first.

188
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,000
He never ran around to plow. Somebody else did.

189
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,560
The only one who ever ran around to plow was this three folks. That was the only one that wanted to do it, man. Such was the real marshmallow. My brother Bob Molto said to me that he would you know the best. Maybe in your own help he helped me get it. Sometimes be

190
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,180
jump down into this furrow, and then he'd start fucking it.

191
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,600
Just a dirt, you know, just a row of dirt,

192
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,420
and it'd be stretching out in front of him, oh, maybe like 300 yards,

193
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,680
you know, big old, big old, about an acre field,

194
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,880
and he'd start fucking that dirt.

195
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,660
He'd be humping on it and fucking on it,

196
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,500
and just, you know, he'd be getting all muddy and filthy and shit,

197
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,000
but, man, he'd see them damn furrows, and he'd be scooting along, you know.

198
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,540
It'd take him only about like five minutes to get all the way down to one of them furrows.

199
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,860
He'd be at the end of that furrow, he'd drink him a damn beer,

200
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,680
and he'd get back on that other furrow next to it,

201
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,360
going the other way, back the same way,

202
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,520
and start a fucking, and a fucking,

203
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,780
and behind him you'd see this furrow be filled up with the goddamn seed,

204
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:31,580
and then out of that they'd grow the children of the hydra's teeth, you know,

205
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,420
and then these skull farmers come popping up with their damn little hats on

206
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,980
and their pieces strung.

207
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,440
They'd be all hanging off their grin and teeth,

208
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:43,580
and then he'd fuck them, you know, after the end of the harvest.

209
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,480
Ah, yes, the harvest.

210
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,720
The Mess from Bad Doctors 1982.

211
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,900
In 1982, oh, the years, the years,

212
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:06,540
and now Einstein's Stardust Outlaws Radio.

213
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,460
From 20 years later.

214
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,360
You can donate to us and get a gift certificate for chain link addiction

215
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,080
and go have your penis pierced.

216
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,880
Wow, I want to be cool too.

217
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,120
Where can I get a mail through my pecker?

218
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,240
I want to show how smart I am.

219
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,180
How can I get a mail through my pecker?

220
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,520
Nah, you're smart.

221
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,280
Do I get a special gift certificate if I donate to the station?

222
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,100
You might be a smelt.

223
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,680
Get a shop.

224
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,820
Six was a brain.

225
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:45,220
And now it's time once again for meditations with non-contributional types.

226
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:50,560
When I was a kid, you know, to be cool, you had to grow your hair long.

227
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,720
That took a long time.

228
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,460
It took commitment.

229
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,380
But if the man was about to get you, you could cut it off real quick.

230
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,400
Nowadays, oh, to be cool, you stick a nail through your pecker.

231
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,340
That doesn't take long.

232
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,840
So it doesn't require that sort of commitment.

233
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,760
Not my problem.

234
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,100
You can get your...

235
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,000
Open your mouth.

236
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,620
And we're going to pierce your uvula.

237
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,800
Press like that.

238
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,780
And then we will attach it to your nipple clamps.

239
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,700
The only real way to be cool is to give up a chunk of your flesh.

240
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,600
The most important part of your body, which is your money.

241
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,780
Give it up.

242
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,460
That's right.

243
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,480
Give till it hurts.

244
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,080
Give till it hurts.

245
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,640
Give till it hurts.

246
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,440
What matters to you more?

247
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,080
What matters to you more than your children?

248
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,560
What matters to you more than your spouse or your job?

249
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,200
I'll tell you what, your money.

250
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,380
That's what matters to us, too.

251
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,100
I get a little horny and I'm on a little funky.

252
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,320
Give me something back, I won't make fun of it.

253
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,140
Roll around without a mind, I try to pretend it won't make any difference.

254
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:06,740
Make it fun.

255
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:06,740


256
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,040
Make it fun.

257
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,640
The pleasure face makes the kissy lips look so real, no one can tell that you're still thinking.

258
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,800
And when it's all over you, I can roll around in the slip.

259
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,600
Hunch butter, hunch butter.

260
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,060
Rub it in my back, rub it in my back.

261
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,840
Hunch butter, hunch butter.

262
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,600
Well, you look like you're clean and you smell like you're shaving.

263
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,560
Climb up on the cigarette and make it like a monkey, you pump your funky.

264
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:34,880
Yeah.

265
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,060
Hips until 100.

266
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,640
Starts.

267
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,740
Jumping and lapping up like a dog.

268
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,060
It's all over your chin and everything.

269
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,160
I can tell you like it.

270
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,100
I like it too.

271
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,520
I like it on my neck and chest.

272
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,220
Hunch butter, a hunch butter.

273
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,600
Rub it in my back, rub it in my back.

274
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,500
Hunch butter, a hunch butter.

275
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,220
Whoa.

276
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,540
You're on your own.

277
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,900
Youек.

278
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,900
On its mom table.

279
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,600
It's all done.

280
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:34,660
Awesome yourselves.

281
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,640
Have fun on your own.

282
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:48,300
Thank you.

283
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,580
Thank you.

284
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,600
Thank you.

285
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,580
Thank you.

286
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,740
Thank you.

287
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,900
Thank you.

288
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,420
Thank you.

289
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,300
Thank you.

290
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,320
Thank you.

291
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,780
Thank you.

292
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,360
Thank you.

293
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,140
Thank you.

294
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:21,200
Thank you.

295
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,040
That's a nice sentiment.

296
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,900
That's a nice sentiment.

297
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,440
It is.

298
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,160
Just if everybody, I think, would take those words to heart

299
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,620
and do as that person says in that song with all their heart and soul,

300
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,120
I think this country would be turned right around the other way

301
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,660
and we'd be looking,

302
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,360
and it's backside right quickly.

303
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,260
Hey, what kind of shit is this?

304
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,620
It's the best, man.

305
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,980
I got it from a Negro.

306
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,520
You're probably so high already you don't even know it.

307
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,120
Really?

308
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,900
We're at the Death's Grip in waiting for the class to fall.

309
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,460
And it's the first contestants from All Life and Chilliwets,

310
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,440
Henry Kiss and Troy on the Pinochet Five.

311
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,060
I'd like to start this song with a

312
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,800
brief explanation.

313
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,500
Oh, this is one of the philosophical songs.

314
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,300
They're talking about what is reality.

315
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,280
We can come in all our own way.

316
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,660
I hate you, Sherman Rice.

317
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,660
I hate you.

318
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:20,780
I actually hate you.

319
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,880
Ha ha ha, that is reality.

320
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,000
I hate you.

321
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:23,900
It's a fucking mess.

322
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,800
Thanks for the hate.

323
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,720
Everything's a fucking mess.

324
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,940
I hate you.

325
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:27,400
I hate you.

326
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:27,840
I hate you.

327
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,480
Ah, if lizards could think like men.

328
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,880
I hate you.

329
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,360
I hate you.

330
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:33,520
I hate you.

331
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,860
I hate you.

332
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:45,800
Iит's a punk Thanksgiving like customer for Perkinspies right?

333
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,720
We're all put together to provide entertainment for all people.

334
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,180
There's a packer, feed the army, and can go into the

335
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:51,180


336
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:51,180

00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:51,180

It's a punk Thanksgiving.

This is for our horror campaign!

I think he's funny.

351
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,620
He is the beast of the apocalypse.

352
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,900
Thanks God for a damn industrial nightmare.

353
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,660
And no jobs for the worthy.

354
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,540
I think he's mean and nasty.

355
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,140
Thanks Lord for coming.

356
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,880
Maybe this one will lighten the mood a little.

357
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,120
Thanks for college radio.

358
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,660
It's chaotic discord with a song called

359
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:33,800
Fuck religion, fuck politics, fuck the lot of you.

360
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,300
Thanks.

361
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:46,480
Thanks to Roy, lady, fucking Lord.

362
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,480
Fucking hell, fucking, fucking money.

363
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,920
And for some of those people out there who have given up the goat.

364
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,460
Poking, poking, poking, poking, poking, poking, poking, poking, poking, poking, poking.

365
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,820
You're on my foot.

366
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,980
You got some kind of punk collection.

367
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,140
Is that what happened here, Chaz?

368
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,380
20 years of greatest punk golden oldies.

369
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,520
Yeah, it's down to 43.

370
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,040
Remember these amazing hits.

371
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:24,160
The Sex Pistols, The Crabs, The Clears, The Fuck You, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks,

372
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,300
Doctors for Wotan, The Sarcomas from Greece,

373
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,820
Teeny and the Poopoos.

374
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,560
They're slaughtered.

375
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,080
Slaughter and the Dogs does a version of White Light, White Heat.

376
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,660
Let's hear this.

377
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,260
Oh, yeah, Slaughter and the Dogs did a good version.

378
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,840
Poo, Water, Towel.

379
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,820
Now, that was a...

380
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,640
Poo, Water, Towel.

381
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,340
Poo, Water, Towel.

382
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,080
Poo, Water, Towel.

383
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,740
They were the ultimate nihilistic punk band.

384
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,780
They hated everything so much that they would just destroy all their equipment.

385
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:55,160
Before they even did the start of the show, like in the truck out back.

386
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,300
That's how nihilistic.

387
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,880
So the audience couldn't even see them destroy their equipment.

388
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,340
Then they'd come on stage and just sit there.

389
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:01,820
That's punk.

390
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,980
They were totally punk.

391
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:03,780
That's punk.

392
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:03,780


393
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:03,780


394
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:03,780


395
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:03,780


396
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:03,780


397
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,860
They were so punk that they looked kind of like Bob, just real normal.

398
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,680
They didn't have tattoos or...

399
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,340
Because they didn't have time for that shit.

400
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,080
Yeah, because they didn't have time for that shit.

401
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,520
Yeah, because it was like a...

402
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,280
Fuck it!

403
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,300
Fuck the punk scene!

404
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,680
I remember those guys.

405
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,760
I remember them real well.

406
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,820
But the problem is, they don't remember us now.

407
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,700
Then everything got kinder and gentler with New Wave.

408
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,660
That was the Bush era.

409
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,520
That was the era of the hairy man, in fact.

410
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,500
It's hip to be square.

411
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,700
It is.

412
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,440
It's hip to be square, especially if...

413
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,460
Yeah, spazzy short hairs were in for a short time.

414
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,380
And I actually had girls come on to me during that brief period

415
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:48,420
when Elvis Costello, Devo, and David Byrne were the sexiest things in the world.

416
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,460
You know, those...

417
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,900
Like blue corn diapers or something.

418
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:56,200
You know, guys with goofy looking glasses and uncool haircuts and little suits.

419
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,480
The nerd look.

420
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:57,780
Yeah.

421
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,540
I just happened to...

422
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,080
Tiny pussies.

423
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:02,820
A lot of us happened to look that way for that six month period.

424
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,500
And we're cool.

425
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,560
I remember those days.

426
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,100
That was it.

427
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,040
Back then, it was something else.

428
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,440
Then it was long hair again or bald heads or little goatees or spike in the nose or a

429
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,760
broomstick in the butt.

430
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,120
That's the current fad, I noticed.

431
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,180
Have you ever taken a safety pin and shoved it through your cheek?

432
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:19,740
Oh, that's...

433
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,160
That was...

434
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,080
That's so 80s.

435
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:31,700
Yeah!

436
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,680
I'm going to make you come tonight.

437
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,320
Come, come, come tonight.

438
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,900
Come, come, come tonight.

439
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,860
You can...

440
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,280
Come, come, come tonight.

441
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,000
Girl, you'll make me come tonight.

442
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,520
Come, come, come tonight.

443
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,240
Come, come, come tonight.

444
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,960
Come, come, come tonight.

445
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:17,960


446
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,580
Come, come, come tonight.

447
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,780
Caller?

448
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,620
Hi, dear.

449
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,340
How are you?

450
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:28,560
Good afternoon.

451
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,500
Is there a gentleman in your life?

452
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,120
Yes.

453
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,620
Is he incarcerated?

454
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,660
Of course.

455
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,480
Do you suck nicks?

456
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,140
Yes.

457
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,980
Are you a Peter Puppet?

458
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,840
Of course.

459
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,600
I want you to answer my question.

460
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,060
Did you have a question?

461
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,540
My question is, what kind of work do you do?

462
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,660
Oh, my goodness.

463
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,020
I love you.

464
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,120
Good.

465
00:29:54,540 --> 00:30:01,380
A collage by Fernanda Nandeli-Mir and Al David Allen Coe.

466
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,440
Who are you teaching.

467
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:10,560
Serve the deck.

468
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,020
Yep.

469
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,640
I'm MITCH ALLENwert.

470
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:22,640


471
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:22,640


472
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:22,640


473
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:22,640


474
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:22,640


475
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,100
Rever fingers again.

476
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:23,100


477
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:23,100


478
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:23,100


479
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:23,100


480
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:23,100


481
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:23,100


482
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:23,100


483
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:23,100


484
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,080
Any pineapples and sure, it'll be Mm.

485
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:29,440


486
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:29,440


487
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,680

I'd like to slip my

00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,380

need to cry.

513
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,220
Cause you're leaving.

514
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,240

00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,460

00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,160

We both

00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,880
knew someday

519
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,820
you'd go

520
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,480

00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,160

00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:31,880

00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,020
I just like to fuck

546
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,020


547
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,040
Lord, I love it

548
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,640
when you call me daddy.

549
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:55,300
And I just like to fuck

550
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,600
you one more time.

551
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,140
And I just like to fuck

552
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:00,140


553
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,740
Come back when I've had

554
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,200
some sleep.

555
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:03,260


556
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:03,260


557
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:03,260


558
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:03,440
Baby.

559
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,260
Was it you

560
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,260
did the pushin'

561
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,580
Left your stains upon the

562
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:09,940
cushion

563
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,140
Left footprints on the dashboard

564
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,200
upside down

565
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,340
Was it you

566
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,640
you made these peckers

567
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,860
Who stole my

568
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,260
throwbackers

569
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,400
Or was I thinking

570
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,160
better leave this town

571
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,340
Well it was me

572
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,680
who did the pushin'

573
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,380
Left my stains upon the

574
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:27,720
cushion

575
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,900
Left my footprints on the dashboard

576
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,960
upside down

577
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,360
But ever since I

578
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,400
screwed your daughter

579
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,920
I've been trouble passing

580
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,580
water

581
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,420
So I guess we're even

582
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,060
all day around

583
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,740
There you go, you learned a song.

584
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,740
That's a song you go,

585
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,960
What'd you learn at Starwood?

586
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,160
Take that home and teach it to your kid.

587
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,580
Best Starwood for me yet?

588
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,180
No doubt.

589
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,400
So don't fuck it up for me.

590
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,520
Chaz Smith.

591
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,600
Professor Chaz Smith at Starwood.

592
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,560
2002, I think.

593
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,620
And now,

594
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,760
The Swingin' Love Corpses.

595
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,100
I need weed!

596
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,920
I need some blowjob!

597
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,900
I need some weed and some blowjob!

598
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,280
I need some blowjob!

599
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,140
I need some blowjob!

600
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:29,500
I need some blowjob!

601
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,880
I live from weed and blowjobs!

602
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,800
Life begins with blowjobs!

603
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,100
How does the tune go?

604
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,200
Like this!

605
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,040
I need some weed and some blowjob!

606
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,000
I need some weed and a blowjob!

607
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,860
I need some weed and a blowjob!

608
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,760
I need some weed and a blowjob!

609
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,140
I got a little song.

610
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,260
We had a blowjob.

611
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,560
We had a blowjob.

612
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,940
We had a blowjob.

613
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,120
We had a blowjob.

614
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,160
Maybe a little cocaine too.

615
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,720
Sixteen year old.

616
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,800
I need a sixteen year old car.

617
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,840
And some Colombian gold.

618
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,720
I need a ten dollar more.

619
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,740
To get me a big old nasty blowjob.

620
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,560
A big old nasty blowjob.

621
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,440
Big old nasty blowjob.

622
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,700
A big old nasty blowjob.

623
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,260
Blowjob.

624
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,380
Fuck that car.

625
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,300
Fuck my car.

626
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,440
Blowjob, blowjob, blowjob, blowjob.

627
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,840
Blowjob, blowjob.

628
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,340
Blowjob.

629
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,700
Ahhhhhhhhh.

630
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,420
Wooo.

631
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,300
Oh.

632
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,300
That was positively the most exciting display

633
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:52,700
we've seen.

634
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,820
So far here tonight at the Home and Garden Show.

635
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,580
The Royal Home and Garden Show.

636
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,220
And those were some quite enormous tulips we just saw.

637
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,320
Look at those gardeners drumming.

638
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,620
Those gardeners are going like that.

639
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:08,020
Well they come from a very specific part of Norway.

640
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,700
And most of them are caribou hunters in the winter.

641
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,700
And in the summertime they sprout their tulips.

642
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,340
Their pants jockeys as we like to call them there.

643
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:21,720
I wonder what those big Norwegian girls look like

644
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,780
without those furs.

645
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:27,920
Oh I've heard that they're clicking devices on.

646
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,400
It's a cool dance they're doing.

647
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,540
Some of them.

648
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,360
Oh look at the feet.

649
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,120
The poor children.

650
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,200
How can they dance with feet like that?

651
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,320
Oh look here comes out the funeral.

652
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,680
This is a Norwegian funeral.

653
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,740
Oh my goodness.

654
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,720
I would have mistaken it for a celebratory ride of some kind.

655
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,780
It's a funeral, eh?

656
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,380
And all the hair on their feet helps them dance.

657
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,020
It's bouncy.

658
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,580
What's that in the coffin?

659
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,620
Why it's a herring.

660
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,960
A pickled herring.

661
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,520
These are the people who died of...

662
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,280
These people died of the holy disease.

663
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,480
The sacred disease.

664
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:01,560
The priest disperses to the believers.

665
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:02,720
Dispenses.

666
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,220
Yes.

667
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,960
It hurries them along to heaven they believe.

668
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,480
Ah.

669
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,840
Then what exactly...

670
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,040
Much like our modern day cocaine.

671
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,240
These primitive people are so fascinating.

672
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,040
What's the meaning of the pickled herring in the coffin?

673
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,600
That represents the disease to be...

674
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:25,460
It's the grandfather who goes with him and will guide him through the afterlife.

675
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,280
The grandfather...

676
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:31,340
The Norwegians see as a great vat of urine, yak urine.

677
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:31,880
Ah.

678
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,020
Which goes on forever.

679
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,600
Well this is quite fascinating.

680
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,820
You know the people of Sumatra have a similar belief and it's amazing they're so many miles

681
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,200
away, well at least not as far as the new mall is concerned.

682
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,560
But that same tradition of the yak urine is...

683
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,680
Yeah they think the yaks eat these...

684
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,520
Some sort of mushrooms that grow in the snow.

685
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:50,760
No.

686
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,400
On the yeti droppings.

687
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,180
Well we've heard that religious cults also enjoy these droppings.

688
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,820
The church of...

689
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,480
You better believe it Dave.

690
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,100
The subgenius and some other...

691
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:00,520
Yes.

692
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,400
Yes that's right.

693
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,680
The subgenius cult...

694
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,000
It's funny it's...

695
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:11,320
As part of the survival expansion and advancement of the subgenius race does grow these yaks

696
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,980
and mushrooms and...

697
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,580
He's a big boy.

698
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,280
He knows what he said.

699
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:14,800
What did you say?

700
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,660
I said I drink the urine man.

701
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,060
Go...

702
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,640
It's okay.

703
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,660
It's what we do.

704
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,400
It's just our thing.

705
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:20,200
Just...

706
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:20,360
Just...

707
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,160
You're funny.

708
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,240
You mean...

709
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,860
So let me understand this cause I don't...

710
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,660
Maybe it's me I'm a little fucked up maybe.

711
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,100
But I'm funny how?

712
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,440
I mean funny like I'm a clown?

713
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,100
I amuse you?

714
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,000
I make you laugh?

715
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,560
I'm here to fucking amuse you?

716
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,740
What do you mean funny?

717
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,300
Funny how?

718
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:34,980
How am I funny?

719
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,560
That was Joe's finest hour.

720
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,000
And from then on it was all downhill.

721
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,720
He played a...

722
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,220
There it went.

723
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,540
There it went.

724
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,540
There it went.

725
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:48,560
There it went.

726
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,480
There it went.

727
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:49,520
There it went.

728
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,220
There it went.

729
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:50,220


730
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:50,240
There it went.

731
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:50,240


732
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:50,240


733
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:50,280
There it went.

734
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:50,280


735
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,000
There it went.

736
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,000


737
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,000


738
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,000


739
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,560
I tried to be good but all I was was bad.

740
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:01,660
I tried to be joyful and it made me far more stoned.

741
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,640
I tried to be fair but I knew I should be loud.

742
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:09,940
I tried to use my reason and it showed me that I'm f Mun!!

743
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:29,600
I tried to be smart, but I didn't want to think

744
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,540
I tried to be clean, but I was prepared to sneak

745
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:37,640
I wanted to soar, but can't do that thing that's neat

746
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:41,760
I tried to be in control, and it drove me to the plane

747
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,260
I tried to be warm, but I despise all others

748
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:06,420
I tried to be strong, but I hid under the covers

749
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:10,600
I tried philanthropy, but I couldn't think of others

750
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,380
I tried to be eloquent, and got reduced to six

751
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,180
Just a little

752
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,280
Fuck it, who cares, what good is it?

753
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,200
Fuck it, who cares, what good is it?

754
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,760
Fuck it, who cares, what good is it?

755
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:57,860
Fuck it, who cares, what good is it?

756
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:04,400
Little Theodore, the sexiest of the uber nerds.

757
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:11,240
In fact, that is from, I think it's from Beneath the Uber Putts, one of his oldest albums.

758
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:17,220
You can learn more from littletheodoreatyahoo.com.

759
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,620
That's an email address.

760
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:23,020
Little Theodore, Theodore spelled F-Y-O-D-O-R.

761
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,180
One word, littletheodoreatyahoo.com.

762
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,240
Who's driving you home tonight?

763
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,660
Is the devil driving you home tonight?

764
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,720
Or is Bob your co-pilot, my friend?

765
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:48,300
Who's blowing you?

766
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,720
The wheel as you go 90 miles an hour.

767
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,040
Satan or Bob?

768
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,480
I know who you'd rather have.

769
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,340
Of course, we'd all rather have.

770
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,620
At 80 miles an hour on a wet...

771
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:02,980
Cecil the Sea Serpent.

772
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,060
Cecil the Sea Serpent.

773
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,740
...that you really want because there's plenty of room inside there.

774
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:06,680
I'm coming, Beanie Boy.

775
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,480
Have you ever seen the end of Cecil the Sea Serpent?

776
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,440
You can stick it all the way in forever.

777
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:18,480
Once you start going into Cecil, if you can keep going,

778
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:19,380
he'll keep going.

779
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,160
Because there's no end.

780
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,060
He never came all the way out of the water.

781
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,520
Cecil the Sea Serpent.

782
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,100
You couldn't see the tail.

783
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:29,300
I'm coming, Beanie Boy.

784
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,560
On a toy.

785
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:32,960
The toy Cecil.

786
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:33,860
Sure, it had a tail.

787
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,040
They have a show.

788
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,520
Doctor, for your friends, listen to this.

789
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,920
Doctor Philodrumon has one of those porno shows

790
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,480
downloaded from the internet

791
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,720
that shows Cecil the Sea Serpent

792
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,520
all the way.

793
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,200
The end.

794
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:50,280
What?

795
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:52,540
Are you really...

796
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:53,560
Huh?

797
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,460
You could...

798
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,940
A puppet, you say?

799
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,400
Cecil was a puppet?

800
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,960
If Cecil the Sea Serpent was a puppet,

801
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:02,820
then...

802
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,900
How can you believe anything is real?

803
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,800
For all we know, Bob could be some made-up character.

804
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:11,300
For all we know.

805
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,840
Bob could be Beanie himself.

806
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,740
For all we know.

807
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:17,140
Do we really know anything?

808
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:17,620
No.

809
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:22,900
Cultural relativity stripped us of all solid knowledge?

810
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:24,240
You cannot know anything.

811
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,480
Are we now on a shifting, sandy beach of hypocrisy,

812
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:29,460
even in science?

813
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,060
Minneapolis International Airport information, Mike.

814
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,120
0053 Zulu.

815
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,800
Wind, 230 at 34 gusting to 65.

816
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,660
Visibility 2, heavy thunderstorm.

817
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,660
Holy fucking shit.

818
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,980
We are getting our asses kicked here.

819
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,600
Do not try to laugh.

820
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:50,200
Are you a dumb shit?

821
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:51,520
Save yourself.

822
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:52,980
Caution.

823
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:56,540
Pieces of mobile homes and dead cows on all runways.

824
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,200
Advise you have Mike.

825
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,120
Oh, Mr. Sister did that.

826
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,940
And before that, KPFA, subgenius business retreat,

827
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,400
sponsored by Don Joyce and Puzzling Evidence,

828
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,580
over the edge.

829
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,700
And now, from bad doctors,

830
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,400
Philodrummond.

831
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:20,560
Here's the tape of the tape.

832
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,900
Here's the tape of the tape of the tape.

833
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:24,500
Here's the tape of the tape of the tape.

834
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:28,200
The sound of it, the basic sound of the Earth's prize itself,

835
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,300
you couldn't see the explosion.

836
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:34,620
Initial accounts indicate they were shielded from the explosion.

837
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:38,240
Inside, what NASA claims to be an alien spacecraft.

838
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,460
As yet, there has been no official statement from the White House.

839
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,420
It was magnificent.

840
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:44,600
It's embarrassing.

841
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,040
It's moist.

842
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:49,840
It drips.

843
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,580
It squirts.

844
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:57,560
It's liquid warmth emitting from your body.

845
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,860
It's...

846
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:04,020
It dribbles.

847
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,460
It spits.

848
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,840
It's nasty.

849
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:18,080
But yet, it's beautiful in its own wet, slimy, squirting and embarrassing way.

850
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:18,600
It's beautiful.

851
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:18,600


852
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:18,600


853
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:18,600


854
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:18,600


855
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:18,600


856
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:18,600


857
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:18,600


858
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:18,600


859
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:24,980
It's... It's... It's... It is... It is... Just listen to this.

860
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:27,840
She leaks...

861
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:31,000
She leaks all over everywhere.

862
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,880
I'd like to pin her over like a 12-inch shack and put her over a couple of...

863
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,240
Yes, sir?

864
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,000
I think he should have an 8-inch shack.

865
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,920
And that is what we did.

866
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:47,600
We inundated her inner cavities with our own thicknesses of tissue.

867
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:55,620
Which was buried up her chute and rammed inwards and yanked outwards.

868
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:02,240
And one does have to yank these long tools because the head, the knob on the end is most

869
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:12,800
powerfully built and is kind of a barb almost, which it is easy to push it in because of

870
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,120
the flexible nature of the head.

871
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:21,860
And yet, the ridge around the edge of the head makes it very difficult to withdraw this

872
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,580
intruder, which we call the Avenger.

873
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,640
And here it is now.

874
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:36,760
Yes, you can hear it going in and out, squirting and farting.

875
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:43,720
Yes, air and liquid both emit from this new type of tool, which we have now begun to provide

876
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,680
to the ministers.

877
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,440
And those who would spread the seed of Bob.

878
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,500
The seed, my friend, of Bob.

879
00:49:51,340 --> 00:50:00,180
For we find that the nuns, snakes, the young women who, and men, who wish to, they wish

880
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:03,520
to be boogered by Bob, and yet Bob is too busy.

881
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,680
So they come to the...

882
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:06,640
Hello, Bob.

883
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:07,240
Hello, Bob.

884
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,240
And believe it or not...

885
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:09,860
Wait a minute.

886
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:10,440
Wait a minute.

887
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,160
Maybe Bob is here.

888
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,380
We may be able to get Bob in just a second.

889
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:15,280
I'm going to drop in on this.

890
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,180
I sure hope not.

891
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,600
I saw a little plant there, I know.

892
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,880
Goethe, Goethe, take off your knickers.

893
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:31,300
Goethe, slip the brassiere off of your pendulous sagging old breasts.

894
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:38,440
Goethe, Goethe, let me clean your teeth with my tongue.

895
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,920
Goethe, let me clean your armpits with my tongue.

896
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,240
Goethe, Goethe, let me clean your toes with my mouth.

897
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,160
Goethe, Goethe, let me clean your toes with my mouth.

898
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:52,160


899
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:52,860
Where's the bathroom?

900
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,980
Ask the woman where the children are.

901
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:05,020
The big daughter comes often, not the little daughter.

902
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,420
Ask, where is your daughter, where is the bathroom?

903
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:21,780
room. The big daughter does not come much. The big daughter comes often. Not the little daughter.

904
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:37,060
Yes, we have a big boy. The big daughter comes often. The husband is also coming. His wife is

905
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:56,420
coming also. Yes, not the little daughter. The big daughter or the little daughter. Yes, yes, we have a big boy.

906
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:06,940
The big daughter comes often. Not the little daughter. Where's the bathroom? The toilet is

907
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:18,840
there. I don't have much time. Come, family, by heart ignition. Step into the hazy, hazy phase.

908
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,700
Okay, I'm stepping out onto the ride.

909
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:30,760
Lift it up. I'm stepping out to get a surface over there.

910
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:36,760
Yes, an actual reenactment for your listered pleasure.

911
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:43,740
The walking of the moon. And now he's fucking Christ on the moon.

912
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:52,140
That's the part NASA covered up. Yes, the cover-up of the discoveries made on the moon.

913
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,740
Things you never wanted to hear.

914
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:02,980
Vast crystal towers and tunnels filled with burrowing, monstrous, grub-like lunar ticks.

915
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:06,780
Pools of chocolate pie and people who mispronounce their

916
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:06,920
identity.

917
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:10,740
No names. Yes, tick men of the moon.

918
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:13,940
Coming soon in Technicolor and Odoran.

919
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,240
Can you prove it won't happen?

920
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:22,620
Oh, they love to swim in the chocolate pond.

921
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,900
We love to not only swim in the chocolate pond, but this is where we place the newborn children.

922
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:36,880
We don't let them get past six and a half years around here. Once they get too big, they're too old for money.

923
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,840
We don't let them get past six and a half years around here. Once they get too big, they're too old for money.

924
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:37,840


925
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:43,480
And so we have to change the direction. Notice how we refuse the synapses on this little boy.

926
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:46,060
These people-sickles are yummy.

927
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:52,120
Ah, they're more than yummy. They're nutritious and help you to psychically enhance your luck.

928
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:57,540
Kids will enjoy their silent greens with people-sickles.

929
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:59,080
People-sickles.

930
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:03,900
Friends, you're listening to the X-rated version of the Hour of Slack.

931
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:06,760
And more is available.

932
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,800
From www.subgenius.com.

933
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:14,940
Or you can send your tapes and contributions in to me, Reverend Ivan Stanion.

934
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:18,640
Post office box 181417.

935
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,180
Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

936
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:26,180
44118, baby.

937
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:37,740
Bye-bye.

938
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:40,140
It was very hard to understand.

939
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:41,580
Why don't you just drop them pants?

940
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:50,280
That's right. Why don't you just drop those pants, Johnny and Tina, and come on over to the table.

941
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:50,740
Dave!

942
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:54,340
We've got some things that we want to show you.

943
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:59,900
And maybe you can ask your mom and dad what some of these things are.

944
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,020
They're like little tools.

945
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,980
See this thing here? It looks very, very harmless.

946
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:11,640
I went to confession today, and Father Riley showed me something.

947
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:15,040
Well, he's good at showing things.

948
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:17,900
He wants to show children his thing.

949
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,700
He's got a thing to show.

950
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,420
He sprayed me with his hose.

951
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:26,320
Well, he's trying to mark his territory like your little kitty Tom-Tom.

952
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,340
Don't you understand, Johnny?

953
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:31,140
Mommy, the father put white pee in my front butt.

954
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,680
Well, he's trying to communicate with the spirits through the top.

955
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:35,960
Are you ready?

956
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,780
Here, wait. No, I didn't play this last week.

957
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,920
But let me play it this week.

958
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,980
This is a cutoff of a Howard Stern show.

959
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:49,420
And here is some actual quotes from Mr. Rogers.

960
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,020
Howard Stern's having a little fun with it.

961
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,600
Take some of the actual quotes.

962
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,480
You know what Mr. Rogers always says?

963
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,300
You know what Mr. Rogers always says?

964
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,520
I don't watch Mr. Rogers.

965
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,200
Here's what he always says.

966
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,840
I get all soapy.

967
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:03,440
You know, soap suds all over me.

968
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,940
And my grandfather would...

969
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:06,900
Take this hose.

970
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,060
It would go like this with me.

971
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,800
It would squirt all over me until this soap.

972
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:12,760
So you were playing.

973
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,740
Yeah, my grandfather and I did a lot of playing together.

974
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,860
Children, watch that show.

975
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,380
I got cool Mr. Rogers clips.

976
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:21,940
Want to hear some more?

977
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:22,180
Yeah.

978
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,060
Here's some great ones.

979
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,020
Here's some cool Mr. Rogers clips for you.

980
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,340
People probably download these and put them on their computer

981
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:28,740
because guys are always doing that.

982
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:29,660
That's a guy thing.

983
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,340
Downloading stuff and sticking it on your computer.

984
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:31,780
I know.

985
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:32,980
Guys are into weird stuff.

986
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,600
I don't even know who they play these things for.

987
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:35,840
I guess when they hit a button...

988
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:36,580
On their computer, right?

989
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

990
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:37,500
They make some sounds.

991
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:39,520
Here's a good one.

992
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:40,240
Okay, I can go on now.

993
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,200
Here's a good one for you to download.

994
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:44,200
Mr. McFeely came over here last night

995
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,560
and asked if he could do something fun for me.

996
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:49,520
A kind of secret, he said.

997
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,320
I think that's a dangerous program.

998
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:55,480
That show's weird, man.

999
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:58,000
You know how religious groups are always going after me

1000
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,420
and taking things I said out of context?

1001
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,780
If you start taking some stuff Mr. Rogers said,

1002
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,860
you get that show thrown off the air, too.

1003
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:04,500
Absolutely.

1004
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:05,140
I'm ready.

1005
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:05,720
Here you go.

1006
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:09,040
Do you have a special something that you take to bed with you?

1007
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:12,800
Does it help you to go to sleep when you hold your special something?

1008
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:15,620
Okay, isn't that wrong?

1009
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:17,300
That is wrong.

1010
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:20,560
I have to agree with Howard there.

1011
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,040
I'll show you what's going to fit in that hole.

1012
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,100
It's in my pocket here.

1013
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,880
Well, that hole, it's going to fit in that hole.

1014
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,140
It's in my pocket here.

1015
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:29,020
Come on.

1016
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:31,060
My favorite, though, is his grandfather's soapy holes.

1017
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:31,980
He's got a good point.

1018
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,920
They sell this stuff to kids in the daytime

1019
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:35,820
when no one's paying.

1020
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:36,120
Paying attention.

1021
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:36,840
Soapy.

1022
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,500
You're going to have soap sites all over me.

1023
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:42,940
And my grandfather would take this hose

1024
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:45,100
and go like this with me.

1025
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,900
It'd squirt all over me until the soap...

1026
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:48,820
So you were playing.

1027
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,820
Yeah, my grandfather and I did a lot of playing together.

1028
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:53,880
What kind of man is he?

1029
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,680
I mean, doesn't he know what kind of message

1030
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,420
he sends out to kids?

1031
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,120
He's a voyeur of such perversions.

1032
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,040
You've got your hose squirting all over you.

1033
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:00,480
Right.

1034
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:03,380
Howard's having a fantasy about it here.

1035
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,360
I mean, don't you know that that's kind of sexual?

1036
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,780
Well, I'm sitting there saying to myself,

1037
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,340
why is he telling this story?

1038
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:09,400
He's Mr. Howard.

1039
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,440
He says that he didn't get hosed by grandpa.

1040
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:12,800
I'm the last one to criticize.

1041
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:15,240
Oh, there's no more.

1042
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,380
I thought he was going to play one more.

1043
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:19,040
My grandfather actually let gasoline go up the hose.

1044
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:20,540
You know what I mean?

1045
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,120
And then sometimes he would light it.

1046
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:22,780
Really?

1047
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:25,460
Like Le Petit Mane would light his own orphanage.

1048
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,560
Did he suck gasoline up his, quote, hose?

1049
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:30,300
No, he would blow it up my blowhole.

1050
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:33,020
My grandpa, no, no, boy.

1051
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:34,620
He'd take a huge...

1052
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:35,080
Wouldn't it, like,

1053
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:35,620
explode?

1054
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:37,180
Would I explode?

1055
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,120
Of course I exploded.

1056
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:39,180
Numerous times.

1057
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:41,840
Yep, there it goes.

1058
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:45,340
My only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me

1059
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:47,500
before the Germans can cut my dick off.

1060
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,380
Now, that is just ridiculous, dude.

1061
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,080
No one's going to cut your dick off.

1062
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,340
Thank you, Walter.

1063
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,820
It's not a five, anything to say about it.

1064
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:54,660
Thank you, Walter.

1065
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,400
That makes me feel very secure.

1066
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,900
That makes me feel very warm inside.

1067
00:58:59,220 --> 00:58:59,340
Oh, dude.

1068
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,740
This whole fucking thing.

1069
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,040
I could be sitting here with just pee stains

1070
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:05,940
on my rug.

1071
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:06,540
Yeah.

1072
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,360
But no, man, I gotta, you know.

1073
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:08,620
Fucking Germans.

1074
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:10,360
Nothing changes.

1075
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:12,620
Fucking Nazis.

1076
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:15,060
Say what Nazis do?

1077
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,320
Oh, come on, Donnie.

1078
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:17,580
They were threatening castration.

1079
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:18,360
Uh-huh.

1080
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,540
Are we going to split hairs here?

1081
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,200
No.

1082
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:20,860
Am I wrong?

1083
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:21,960
Well, he...

1084
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,140
Man, they were nihilists, man.

1085
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:24,520
Huh?

1086
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:26,260
They kept saying they believed in nothing.

1087
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,080
Nihilists.

1088
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:30,920
Fuck me.

1089
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,880
I mean, say what you want about the tenants.

1090
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,340
They're in charge of national socialism, dude.

1091
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,940
At least it's an ethos.

1092
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:38,480
No.

1093
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:40,160
And also, let's not forget...

1094
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,280
Let's not forget, dude,

1095
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:42,680
that keeping wildlife,

1096
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,940
an amphibious rodent for,

1097
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:47,060
you know, domestic

1098
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:49,220
within the city,

1099
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,680
that ain't legal either.

1100
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:53,860
What are you, a fucking park ranger now?

1101
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,700
No, I'm just trying to offer...

1102
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,780
Who thinks a shit about the fucking Marmok?

1103
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,460
We are sympathizing here, dude.

1104
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,320
Fuck sympathy.

1105
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:03,780
I don't need your fucking sympathy, man.

1106
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:04,940
I need my fucking job.

1107
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:07,580
What do you need that for, dude?

1108
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,280
You have got to buck up, man.

1109
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:12,440
You cannot drag this negative energy into the tournament.

1110
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:14,780
Fuck the tournament. Fuck you, Walter.

1111
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:18,820
Fuck the tournament?

1112
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:23,020
Okay, dude, I can see you don't want to be cheered up here.

1113
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,740
Come on, Donnie, let's go get us a lane.

1114
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:31,960
Another Caucasian, Gary.

1115
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:32,860
Right, dude.

1116
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,080
Friends like these, huh, Gary?

1117
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:38,400
That's right, dude.
