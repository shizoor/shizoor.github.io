00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,540
Bob.

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:10,900
But let's leave things of this world behind and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:18,360
Ah, yes, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Stang helping to answer the question, what is slack?

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:25,100
Now, alongside your normal everyday life, there's another life, one in which you have slack.

5
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:35,660
Man was born with original slack, yet most so-called civilized peoples don't believe in it, and their most learned scholars cannot even comprehend it.

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,260
And that, my friend, is why the idiot is closer to the divine.

7
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:47,920
Slack is something for nothing, that unreachable goal, that perfect hamburger towards which all seekers strive.

8
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:54,200
And to seek it, one must travel the path of least resistance and learn to try, never to try.

9
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,840
Now, friend, slack can neither be created nor destroyed.

10
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,000
If you don't have slack, it's somewhere it shouldn't be.

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,560
Who's got it, friend?

12
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:11,000
If you don't know, then, my friend, your only sane move would be to repent, quit your job, and slack off before you're too far gone.

13
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,920
Praise Bob!

14
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,620
Help me, somebody, let there be slack.

15
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,760
It's chaotic. It's chaotic. It's chaotic.

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,300
No slack, no slack.

17
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:45,160
No slack, no slack.

18
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:33,900
to me. There's a place down in Texas where the hip people meet. They got lots of slack.

19
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:43,580
Come along, you will see. It's the place called the Church of the Subgenie. Yeah.

20
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:54,040
Yeah. That's right, ladies. You want to live forever, you've got to sleep with Bob. But

21
00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:00,540
hey, after all, isn't there a little Bob in all of us?

22
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:18,220
The place called the Church of the Subgenie.

23
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:48,520
Those other religions, they want 10% of your income right off the top. They want you to

24
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,580
provide for them in your will. They want you to pressure your government for billion-dollar

25
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:57,560
contributions. They want you to double your taxes so that they don't have to pay any.

26
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,400
And what does Bob ask for? 30 lousy bucks.

27
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:13,300
They're the ones with the extravagant cathedrals, the lush synagogues, the giant mosques, and

28
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:13,560
what they want is a place called the Church of the Subgenie.

29
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:13,560


30
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,040
What do we have? One hour a week on non-commercial radio.

31
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,480
Now, forgive me if I go out on a limb here, but doesn't that sound just a little lopsided?

32
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:33,020
Of course not. It sounds a lot lopsided. But we got something they don't have.

33
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:40,720
It's called slack. And I don't mean the artificial slack they try to market for a profit.

34
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,220
Hey, folks, play the lottery and win free slack.

35
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:49,660
Uh-uh. I'm talking about real slack. Internal slack. Slack from within.

36
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:56,760
The kind that feeds on itself like a breeder reactor. It radiates a warm, fuzzy glow that

37
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:05,560
lights up our lives. It's an inner peace they will never know. And therein lies the basic

38
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:12,880
difference in our religious philosophies. They stress pain, suffering, and sacrifice because on

39
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,200
the outside, they're not going to know. They're going to know that they're not going to know.

40
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,200


41
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:18,200
On the outside, they have everything. But on the inside, they have nothing.

42
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:27,280
They're morally bankrupt. Empty shells. Just poor, pathetic souls tormented by inner demons of guilt

43
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:35,740
and self-loathing. But we Subgenie, we are the exact opposite. While on the outside, we have so

44
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:42,760
little, on the inside, we have everything. And that's why we're smiling.

45
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:53,200
And Bob Dobbs is smirking because we're rich with slack. And for all their money, it's not for sale.

46
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,160
Herein is the word of Bob. Praise Bob. Amen.

47
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,360
Here I come.

48
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,440
Please

49
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:33,480
.

50
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,020
.

51
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,080

52
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,200

00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,200

00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,200


55
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,200


56
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,200


57
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,200


58
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,260
The ball, the best of kids play

59
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,040
Johnny thinks he buys friendship that way

60
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,980
Johnny got beat, Johnny got mugged

61
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,800
Johnny got robbed, Johnny got slugged

62
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,100
Johnny got robbed, he's still the night

63
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,760
The head's at the look, the other way

64
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,400
Johnny got robbed, it's still the night

65
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,080
Johnny got robbed, it's still the night

66
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,800
The head's at the look, the other way

67
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,400
Johnny got robbed, it's still the night

68
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,140
Getting more gold, jewelry stocks and bonds

69
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,900
Johnny's got statues on his arm

70
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,500
Seven-inch, open, level, seen

71
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,580
Johnny's got the life of a true man

72
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,240
Johnny's got a tooth, he's got his bridge

73
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,200
The best part of him is he's got the best of it

74
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,660
Johnny's got all kinds of credit cards

75
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,340
And a life right through his backyard

76
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,780
Johnny got robbed, it's still the night

77
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,740
The head's at the look, the other way

78
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,280
Johnny got robbed, it's still the night

79
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,220
Johnny got robbed, it's still the night

80
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,920
The head's at the look, the other way

81
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,360
Johnny got robbed, it's still the night

82
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,180
He's got chicks on both of his arms

83
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,760
But not because of his manly charms

84
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,620
It's not the way, he likes to snort

85
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,580
It's the party that they find inside

86
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:09,760
And by the way, he's got a better life than him

87
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,180
Thank you.

88
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,160
It's School for Life!

89
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,180
This isn't a song about school children.

90
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,520
It's not a song about chatting.

91
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,200
This is a song about a class struggle.

92
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,640
This song is about the haves and the have-nots.

93
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,920
You know how it is.

94
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,740
When you're a have-not, you rip off the has for everything you can.

95
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:18,980
And when you're a have, you exploit the have-nots for every ounce of labor you can get from them for as little amount of money as possible.

96
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,720
That's why Johnny got robbed.

97
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:24,840
That's why.

98
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,000
Boys would be boys and boys can't be cruel.

99
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,800
Johnny shouldn't take his valuables to school.

100
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,520
Boys have hope and boys have heart.

101
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,040
Johnny and his money gonna have to pound.

102
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,820
Johnny's feet are stuck with a cricket bat.

103
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,540
His wallet was a little fat.

104
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,380
Now his broken body lays on the ground.

105
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,020
A Bible grade, a level bound.

106
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,620
Johnny got robbed.

107
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,700
It's School for Life!

108
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,560
Well, hey, that's a little bit of a yellow line.

109
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,340
Johnny got robbed.

110
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,900
It's School for Life!

111
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,420
Johnny got robbed.

112
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,620
It's School for Night.

113
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,360
The hands have to look the other way.

114
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,980
Johnny got robbed.

115
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,940
It's School for Day.

Oh!

127
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:14,900
Oh, the Swingin' Love Corpses, dear friends, live at Off-Broadway on May 11th, 1991.

128
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:22,460
Today, however, is October 18th, 2002.

129
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,840
And at least it is in my time here in recording past.

130
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,440
And this is Hour of Slack number 860.

131
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,300
Friends, before the Swingin' Love Corpses, we heard Papa Joe Mama preaching.

132
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:42,080
And before that, a place called Church of the Subgenius.

133
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,960
And I can't remember who did that.

134
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:54,740
That and other pieces in this show are from ancient Hours of Slack, taped off the radio by Dr. Humdinger.

135
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,800
Praise Dr. Humdinger.

136
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,840
He taped them off the radio back in the day and turned them into 13 CDs.

137
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:08,600
And his favorites, which he gave me at X-Day, which are easy for me to pull for this show,

138
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:12,220
instead of going back to the original master tapes, which I don't even know which ones they are.

139
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,900
And this, friends, is what we call Subgenius Progress.

140
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,500
Suppose someone cried,

141
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,600
Halt! Stop this progress!

142
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,140
Suppose I shouted to the world, make an end to this progress.

143
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,820
I could talk, talk.

144
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,460
Radio is everywhere.

145
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,460
This modern world.

146
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,380
Full of voices.

147
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,820
I'm a master craftsman.

148
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,760
I have the right to talk.

149
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,760
Yes, but will they listen to you?

150
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,640
They'll listen, just them.

151
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,960
If I shout, arise, awake.

152
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,900
Stop this progress before it is too late.

153
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,760
You want all the marvels because you're not supposed to be wrong.

154
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,760
Your answer will be in trouble when Big Daddy comes home.

155
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,880
You give them all to him and now you want them back.

156
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,060
You're the master performed by a hack.

157
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,980
Was it you who said to him that it was okay?

158
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,180
You bought yourself security by selling your rights away.

159
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,520
Was it you proclaiming there are only shades of grey?

160
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,580
What will you do now?

161
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,220
You think you're digging your own grave?

162
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,580
The lie you took for granted.

163
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,880
Is there anything left to save?

164
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,340
You put it out of your mind.

165
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,520
You chicken shit to save.

166
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,720
Then the fact of the matter is,

167
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,680
E.E.

168
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,900
Big Daddy's gonna grab you and lead you to the club.

169
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,980
The one that you gave him saying,

170
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,020
I don't need it, bub.

171
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,120
A heavy price to pay for an apartment and a meal.

172
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,260
What difference does it make if everything's unreal?

173
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,680
Was it you who said that he could kiss your ass?

174
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,700
Not if he's only four that can run.

175
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,820
Why not give it a try?

176
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,520
Now you find yourself kissing your own ass.

177
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:54,920
Goodbye.

178
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,420
Bon voyage.

179
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,880
Have a nice trip.

180
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,580
You were such a damn fool.

181
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,120
You lost your grip.

182
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,740
What the hell does it take

183
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,800
to get you to awaken?

184
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,140
No matter what you say.

185
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:22,820
A equals A equals A equals A equals A.

186
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,020
Black is black.

187
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,640
White is white.

188
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,940
Day is day.

189
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,460
Night is night.

190
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,740
Nature is what it is.

191
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,400
Regardless of what you would like.

192
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,980
Man, I'm sick of your nonsense.

193
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,080
Go take a hike.

194
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,880
I'm finally in the cap.

195
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,760
Sliting facing the sun.

196
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,860
Do you see theự

197
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,080
Once on a swimming boat?

198
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,420
Look like Amazon's

199
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:51,420


200
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:51,420


201
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,160
While you have heaven which might cause you sorrow,

202
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,600
that's where it's gonna take your soul.

203
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,480
guitar solo

204
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,940
guitar solo

205
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,800
guitar solo

206
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,260
guitar solo

207
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,040
Zug's Riff, dear friends.

208
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,580
Zug's Riff, dear friends.

209
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:06,900
Starting with this show, I'm going to play every Zug's Riff song in alphabetical order,

210
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,700
and that song was A equals A.

211
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:23,340
This is coming off of a 30th anniversary 2CDR set that has 175 Zug's Riff songs from 1971 to 2001.

212
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,540
The great, great Zug's Riff can be reached by you.

213
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,440
You, if you have a pencil ready, at, got that pencil ready?

214
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,060
Now?

215
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:42,680
Zug's Riff at, thank you, Fine Lying Brothers, at 6520 Platt Avenue.

216
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:49,720
That's Platt Avenue, number 184, West Hills, California.

217
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:57,080
9-1-3-0-7-3-2-1-8.

218
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,200
Again, that's...

219
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:02,940
9-1-3-0-7-3-2-1-8.

220
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:12,020
For Zug's Riff, also at Zug's Riff dot, uh, 4MG dot com.

221
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,600
That's Zug's Riff at, uh, 4MG dot com.

222
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,640
Don't let her know.

223
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,660
And now, friends, a word from Reverend Tesla Coyle.

224
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,000
There is concern.

225
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,960
There is concern and discussion this morning that maybe hypnosis is a shorter range weapon.

226
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,800
The Washington area sniper may have used it in his last shooting Monday night.

227
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,040
Police may have used more than one vehicle.

228
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,280
And or two shooters.

229
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:46,000
In previous attacks, but a witness to the seven corner shootings is using Colt AR-15 or Ruger Mini-14.

230
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,240
What does it mean and how does that whole scenario lay out to you?

231
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,600
Where's Tim Harvey McOswald when we meet him?

232
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,260
Good shot.

233
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,740
I was trying to conflagute those names.

234
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,560
I was trying to conflagrate them.

235
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,860
Where is he, though, now that we truly need him?

236
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,160
He's at sniper school, I think.

237
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,160
Don't let go.

238
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:07,580
Scary.

239
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,980
The suburban area.

240
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,100
No, we can't do that, can we?

241
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:18,700
You know, Mr. Sister pointed out that somebody gets killed in Washington, D.C. every day on the average anyway.

242
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,740
So why are they so upset?

243
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,020
Well, they usually know who's doing it to them.

244
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,660
Right, it's suburban.

245
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,860
So it's like normal people.

246
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,820
People who live in the...

247
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:27,980
Not crazy.

248
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:27,980


249
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:27,980


250
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,400
Crackheads.

251
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,780
Well, and anyone who lives around crackheads.

252
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,800
It's like, well, sir, is he right for being poor?

253
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,560
Well, sure, of course people get shot there.

254
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:37,840
Duh.

255
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,940
Or living in those neighborhoods trying to be multicultural.

256
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,100
Actually, he said...

257
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,440
What I wanted to do is get poor and start taking crack.

258
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:53,400
He said, I suspect what it is is there's a kind of a bag limit of about five or so per...

259
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,940
Well, they've moved the bag limit up to nine right now.

260
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,220
Predator.

261
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,520
That movie Predator.

262
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:57,980
I didn't know that.

263
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,920
I didn't think about it.

264
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,340
That's what they're not telling us.

265
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,540
These people are having their spines ripped out and their heads removed.

266
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,540
And their spinal fluids are...

267
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,680
Mysteries of the unexplained.

268
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,920
Their spinal fluids are drunk from cups of scour.

269
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:10,960
Mothbag.

270
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,000
As seen through the eyes of the Bob.

271
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,340
Mothbob.

272
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,520
The Predator.

273
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,080
The Trophy Hunter.

274
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,680
Cravenbob the Hunter.

275
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,380
Wes Craven the Hunter.

276
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,860
Wes Craven.

277
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,900
Bob Crane the Hump.

278
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,220
Hey, dude.

279
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,000
First rule of Sniper Club.

280
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,340
Don't talk about Sniper Club.

281
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:35,840
Right.

282
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,400
You will die.

283
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,840
There ain't no lie.

284
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,780
Won't do you no good to try to figure out why.

285
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,820
It may come at the hands of a beautiful girl.

286
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,700
It may come at the hands of an insane world.

287
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,660
It may be the result of an act of God.

288
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,480
It may be the result of an incompetent God.

289
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,500
It may come as you compression out of the sky.

290
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,120
But one thing is certain.

291
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,560
That is, you will die.

292
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:01,960
You will die!

293
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,520
You'll be dead.

294
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,020
Yeah, that's what I said.

295
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,660
Won't change a thing.

296
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,100
The jets go back to bed

297
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,960
It may happen as you're scrolling

298
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,080
Down the street

299
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,020
It may happen in the middle of a blissful sleep

300
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,460
It may come after years and years and years

301
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,140
Of pain

302
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,660
It may hit you too quick

303
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,060
To register in your brain

304
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,960
It may find you in a belly full of lead

305
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,460
But sooner or later

306
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,180
You will have to be dead

307
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,500
You'll be no more

308
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,900
Oh, what a bore

309
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,040
Can watch TV or even go to the store

310
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,280
You may find someone else's political blaze

311
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,320
You may walk into a lethal dose of cabarets

312
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,120
You may shoot up something that's a bit too pure

313
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,160
You might catch a disease that has no cure

314
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,640
You may walk into a lethal dose of cabarets

315
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,900
You could have lots of comedy

316
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,300
If it's the ultimate war

317
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,340
But eventually

318
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,440
You'll be no more

319
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:23,780
You'll be no more

320
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:42,000
You'll be no more

321
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:24,300
You'll be no more

322
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:54,280
You'll be no more

323
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,540
You'll be no more

324
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,680
You'll be no more

325
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,500
You'll be no more

326
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,240
You'll be no more

327
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,240


328
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,460
You'll be no more

329
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,580
You'll be no more

330
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,220
Life's been so boring lately

331
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,800
The days go by

332
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,500
And they're all just the same

333
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,740
I go to work and I come home

334
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,120
Just to learn the best Давай

335
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,560
And I come home

336
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:45,560


337
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,580
Life could be much more intriguing

338
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,680
If I could just make it a big lease

339
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:50,800
If I could just make it a big lease

340
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,860
Oh, I

341
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,200
Wanna be a football hero

342
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,420
I wanna hear the crowds cheering for me I wanna be a football hero

343
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:04,940
I want to be on the color TV All my friends will be talking about it

344
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:09,380
I'd be a star if there was no doubt about it But my life's such a drag

345
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,480
I wanna be a football hero so bad

346
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,720
Well I'd be so highly respected For my football play abilities

347
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,160
I'd get autographs and interviews And those stories in the newspaper about me

348
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:39,000
And these commercials on the television With running through emblems just like O.J. Simpson

349
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,480
Oh I wanna be a football hero

350
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:43,460
Oh I wanna be a football hero

351
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:48,160
I wanna hear the crowds cheering for me I wanna be a football hero

352
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:53,780
I want to be on the color TV All my friends will be talking about it

353
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:58,080
I'd be a star if there was no doubt about it But my life's so sad

354
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,340
I wanna be a football hero so bad

355
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,900
Oh the sound of the crowd is so enticing

356
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:12,200
Oh the thrill of it all would be so exciting

357
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,120
Yeah!

Another faceless name

378
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,840
Life could be much more intriguing

379
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,920
If I could just make it in the big leagues

380
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,420
Oh, I wanna be a football hero

381
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,580

I want to be on the color TV

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,100
I'd be a star if it snowed down

386
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,480
I'm bound to it with my life such a drag

387
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,760
I wanna be a football hero, so say

388
00:30:40,460 --> 00:31:08,460
I wanna be a football hero

389
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,920
Oh, Football Hero by the Pink Boys

00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:20,900
Led by Dr. X, one of the earliest subgeniuses

391
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:25,700
Friends, ah, well, enough of, you know, this war stuff

392
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,960
It just makes me wanna hide and escape

393
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,840
Come into your kindergarten tomorrow

394
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,600
Don't worry about it

395
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,120
The spirit of Bob Crane is speaking to your children

Hey, no problem, don't worry about it

397
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,420
He is dancing in the pale moonlight

398
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,240
You're not going to fight

399
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,920
Don't worry about it

400
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,660
Pointing to his hair and his glistening pubis

401
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,100

You are needed for Uncle Sam's war machine

407
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,340
Did you hear about, like,

408
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,820
They used to do LSD experiments on the soldiers

409
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:14,080
And I guess there's some secret Prozac experiments

410
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,340
That's what happened to Elvish

411
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,580
Yeah, and they didn't know what the proper dose was

412
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,980
So they were overdosing soldiers

413
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,640
Well, they were also giving them, uh

414
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,020
They had to give them LSD

415
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:25,860
Biological weapons

416
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,620
They had to break out the old stash of LSD to bring them back

417
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,880
Yeah, so they could withstand the biological warfare experiments

418
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,860
That's from that Prozac coma

419
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,500
Well, first we dosed them out of the tox

420
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,840
Now we're gonna give them some acid

421
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,180
And see how they took to it

422
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,240
Where do you think, Doctor?

423
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,220
Where did Doctor Legume came from?

424
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,220
I thought he was the spawn of hell

425
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,440
And came out from under a rock

426
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,500
That's what everybody says

427
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,400
He's used in those army experiments

428
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,360
Where they gave them these drugs

429
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,380
That they thought might give them psychic powers

430
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,760
Because the Russians were studying that

431
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,800
And were way ahead of them

432
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,600
They cannot make you fly, Corporal Leethook

433
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,760
Psychic warfare

434
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,800
Oh yes, you're gonna flip and fly

435
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,020
Like one of the little gods' children of the air

436
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,240
Look at your feet, they're already getting bigger

437
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,000
Like a pair of duck

438
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,740
Vrooom!

439
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,140
Unfortunately, the mutant power that Legume got

440
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:14,180
Was the ability to read guinea pigs' minds

441
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,040
Yeah, and also read backwards

442
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:20,500
And this is how he gleans the future from the minds of a guinea pig

443
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,960
He actually reads people's minds

444
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,600
This is a very, very arcane, very arcane skill

445
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,300
And only entrusted to a few

446
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,840
A mutated gene born into the

447
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,680
War guinea pigs

448
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,640
War pig

449
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,820
The pigs

450
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,880
Are you being fattened up to be a war pig, Private?

451
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,540
Private Pyle

452
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,560
Are you gonna wear those epaulettes like barbecue sauce?

453
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,460
Private Pyle

454
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,960
You know, what are they gonna do?

455
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,440
They can't

456
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,920
It's kinda hard to bring the

457
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,260
The kids, you don't have to worry about the draft coming back

458
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,320
You just don't have to worry about the draft coming back

459
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:55,740
Because

460
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,540
This American Army and Navy

461
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,540
They all know that

462
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,220
American children are

463
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,620
A bunch of little fat asses

464
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:06,300
They would never cut the training, you know

465
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,800
It's gotta be a volunteer force

466
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,820
You know, it's gotta be

467
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,600
Gung-ho people, you know, just do it

468
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,220
Nike, you know, shtick going

469
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,280
But this is how the corporate state has sliced our freedom

470
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,620
And the rest are all the little fat bodies

471
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,600
Disgusting little fat bodies in front of television sets

472
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,120
That's me

473
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,080
Soaking up

474
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,140
They don't want me

475
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,940
Nestle Crunch bars

476
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,580
I'm a disgusting fat body

477
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,000
Gray, flaccid skin

478
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,020
I'll stay home

479
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,820

The artificial light beamed in from the great centurion pacto

482
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:37,840
The artificial light beamed in from the great centurion pacto

483
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,260
There they lie

484
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,100
Eating television

485
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,440
Either that or they're gonna send the fat bodies over

486
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,260
And don't give them guns

487
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,240
Just give them knives and forks

488
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,080
Yeah

489
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,740
Yeah, give them silverware

490
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:51,880
Just give them computers

491
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:55,740
A wave of fat bodies rolling into Baghdad

492
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,460

We are not halal

Praise God.

515
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:40,060
Imagine the letter O like a star, like a sun, like a blazing beacon of bobness,

516
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:47,860
floating in the endless night of pink fear and pinker embarrassment and self-loathing.

517
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:56,200
Imagine the glorious letter O, floating like a donaty, bountiful,

518
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,520
beauteous beacon in that endless night.

519
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,880
Darkest night.

520
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:09,520
Imagine now another B, a brave and bold letter B,

521
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:15,100
chasing around and around that O until we have a blazing band of golden B.

522
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:23,040
Slice across this band, glance across this disc of B-ness into the heart of Onis

523
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,100
and emerge again and again into eternal B attitude.

524
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,420
And dive across.

525
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,000
Across the disc of Bobness again and again.

526
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:37,040
First B, then the eternal sinner of O-O-Bness.

527
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,020
And finally, as firstly, B.

528
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,600
Unending, unbeginning, B-O-B.

529
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,180
B-O-B, B-O-P, B-O-B-O-B-O-B-O-B-O-B-O-B-O-B-O.

530
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,040
B-O-B-O-B-O-B-O-B-O-B-O-B-O.

531
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,740
Now turn the record over.

532
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,460
Is there anything religion can do to help?

533
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:05,880
me find my friend? Well, we could join together in prayer. Uh-huh. But is there anything useful we can do?

534
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:15,940
No. It is the subgenius sacrilege. And yet, in the interest of open theological debate,

535
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:20,520
we will consider just this once, the question of what if we're wrong.

536
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:26,460
Now, theoretically speaking, not that it is statistically probable, but hypothetically,

537
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:32,500
imagine if you can, a world come July 5th, 1998, where there is no excess invasion.

538
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:39,060
Oh, it's painful. It's painful, dear friends, I understand. But remember, this is only theoretical.

539
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:48,740
A planet that is not surrounded by an angry alien spacecraft. A globe not littered. A

540
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:54,520
globe not completely polluted with the corpses of conspiracy dupes.

541
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:03,180
Oh, dear friends, it would be a sick society, still dominated by pigs and normals.

542
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:08,900
An earth where corporations, governments, and well-equipped armies still loyal to the system

543
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:16,660
continue to uphold the status quo. They fight to maintain their tight totalitarian grasp on the

544
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:21,960
very throat of freedom. Oh, it's a nightmarish vision, indeed, one that makes my head spin,

545
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,900
but one we will contemplate nonetheless in the interest of free and open debate.

546
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:32,140
Yes, dear friends, this dark future of Dobbsian defeat and conspiracy conquest,

547
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:38,400
this desperate future where the last of genius forces are holed up in the underground bunkers

548
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,880
awaiting the final onslaught by conspiracy mercenaries, is a vision we do not want to

549
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:51,260
contemplate, but we'll this one last time. As the Kelvin bombs explode far above on the

550
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:56,440
planetary surface, stay, and his subgenius generals huddle beneath the flickering,

551
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:00,920
flickering lightbulb, pouring over maps of subgenius tunnels, subway tunnels, and underground

552
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:07,880
sewers, examining any and all possible attack routes. They will be determined, determined to

553
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:19,940
fight to death and take the maximum number of normals with them. Why? Because we hate you!

554
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:20,740
Woo!

555
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,440
They will be dedicated to honoring Bob's

556
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:33,340
victory. Bob, through a dignified Dobbsian death, it is even, it is then that some weak

557
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:38,260
of heart heretic will step forward, probably some Bobby who always dreamed of being a real

558
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:43,040
subgenius warrior for a little time. But when the chips are down for Dobbs wants to cash

559
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:49,880
out, this weak-willed wannabe Bobby will show his first real courage when he steps forward

560
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,300
and whines, but Reverend Stang,

561
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,200
Bob!

562
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:56,440
You promised we'd have something to show for our victory.

563
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:56,440


564
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,840
Bob, you promised we'd pay us for our, for our membership fee.

565
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:07,140
The bunker will fall silent like a tomb. The collective gasp will cause the barrel of

566
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:14,860
Daniel Webster will proclaim the same answer I gave the Christian in the parking lot, and

567
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:23,720
that is this. Even in Hell, we'll have the one thing the conspiracy tried to deny from

568
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,900
us all our living lives.

569
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:26,420
Woww!

570
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:26,420


571
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:30,360
the one human right they'll never be able to take from us again,

572
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:33,960
no matter how much they lie about what we did or what they didn't do.

573
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,740
It's the one virtue Christians will never obtain,

574
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:42,080
no matter how much they beg, pray, or grovel to their God.

575
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,660
I'm talking about respect!

576
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,360
Self-respect!

577
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:51,980
The only commodity that can't be bought, traded, negotiated,

578
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,960
or stolen in any of the conspiracy marketplaces.

579
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,340
Appreciate it! Hallelujah!

580
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:07,780
It's a concept foreign to all pinks and normals who serve the system.

581
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:13,580
They may have stolen our freedom, our slack, and even our lives,

582
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:17,140
but by virtue of our very defiance to them and their ways,

583
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:20,100
we've earned a self-respect they can't even pretend to want.

584
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,060
And you want to know why?

585
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,880
Because they're religious!

586
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,620
Our religion is based on submission, while ours is based on independence!

587
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:31,920
Praise Bob!

588
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,120
Give me a praise Bob!

589
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,580
Praise Bob!

590
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,420
So that, dear friends, is our answer.

591
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,560
That's what we get even if we're wrong come Judgment Day.

592
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:54,020
The honor and dignity of self-respect earned through a lifelong fight for independence and freedom.

593
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,040
Only the devil could possibly resent a man for wanting to be free.

594
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:05,080
Any God that wouldn't want his followers to be free is no savior,

595
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:11,860
but a tyrant, an enslaver of souls, a devil in disguise.

596
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:23,000
And that leads me to my question to the Christian.

597
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,320
Among you wanted lives happening when the

598
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,520
It's terribly original, so brace yourself for it.

599
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:38,020
What if, what if you're wrong, come Judgment Day?

600
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,740
Please think carefully before you answer, dear friend

601
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:50,080
Because remember, your very soul dangles in the balance

602
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:53,020
And it is the word of our praise, Bob

603
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:53,620
Amen

604
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,900
Praise Father Joe Mama

605
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:02,860
Oh yes, dear friends, praise Father Joe Mama

606
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:09,340
Friends, what Father Joe Mama was saying about that one side of the conspiracy

607
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:15,320
It makes you wonder, it makes you wonder which side of the conspiracy is running things

608
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:24,120
I started getting paranoid about, well, the Masons, let's say, let's just say

609
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,000
For all I know, I'm really worried about the Illuminati

610
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,160
But, you know, it started with that Americo

611
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:37,560
Online logo, which is a triangle with a circle in the middle of it

612
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,260
Looks just like the old eye in the pyramid

613
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,260
Or the eye above the pyramid

614
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:48,140
You know, and I mentioned that to my friend Emot

615
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,960
And Emot said, oh, that's just the beginning of it

616
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,240
Haven't you noticed those triangles, the eyeball shapes are just everywhere

617
00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:01,580
And in fact, they've even gotten quite obvious about the names of these businesses

618
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:02,840
He goes, ever noticed?

619
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:02,840


620
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:09,320
The red arches that form a big M of the Sonic Hamburgers

621
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,480
Get it? Sonic? Masonic?

622
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:14,600
I think I'll have Masonic Burger now

623
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,640
Or, he goes, did you know that Philip Morris cigarettes and General Foods

624
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:23,220
Were both owned by this gigantic conglomerate, Kraft Foods?

625
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,400
Kraft?

626
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,020
As in, The Kraft?

627
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,320
Yes, friends

628
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,840
And not to mention, when they reported

629
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:39,140
That they were going to replace that Popeyes place next door with Church's fried chicken

630
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:39,920
Uh-huh

631
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,040
But it doesn't stop there

632
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,700
If you look around, next time you drive through town, friend

633
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,560
Just keep your eyeballs open

634
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:48,200
You may see things you didn't want to see

635
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,160
Buildings one after another that look like

636
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:54,000
Well, like the Temple of Solomon

637
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,440
If it's not the arches, it's that Temple of Solomon shape

638
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,320
That you see etched onto Masonic apron's and symbols

639
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,860
Uh, my old supermarket nearby here

640
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:07,100
Menards, I believe he pointed out

641
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,000
Looks just like that

642
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,020
All of the Sam Walton stores

643
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,300
Walmart, Sam's, Hypermart

644
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,480
They're in the grand Masonic design, my friends

645
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,780
Computer places

646
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:19,280
Computer City, Discovery Zone

647
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,520
The Best Buy stores

648
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,380
All subtle Masonic symbols

649
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:26,940
And go buy your local water pumping station

650
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,320
The Gas Company

651
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,860
Uh, the Gas Company in most small towns

652
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:32,840
Is in the same business as the M's and M's

653
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,020
And building as a Masonic lodge, my friends

654
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,780
The Electric Company

655
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,200
They all, all of them, my friends

656
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:48,160
Are part of one conspiracy or another, you know

657
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,320
And, but what do they

658
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,140
Well, you try to talk about things like this

659
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,480
And they call you, well, the polite term

660
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,780
Conspiracy researchers

661
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,780
Or conspiracy buffs

662
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,920
Or conspiracy nuts

663
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,880
Or conspiracy coups

664
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,420
Or conspiracy crackpots, my friends

665
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,120
Those are the real polite terms

666
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:13,220
For the folks who attempt merely to lift the veils

667
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,620
Peer under the rocks

668
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:18,460
And pry into the business of the authorities

669
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:20,220
So-called

670
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,480
What I want to know is, friends

671
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,900
How come the conspiracy researchers

672
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:29,760
Get worse pressed than some of the conspiracy perpetrators?

673
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:31,360
Heh

674
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:31,840
Yeah

675
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,220
It must be a conspiracy

676
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:38,640
And, you know, I can wax as sarcastic as the next guy

677
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,440
About some conspiracy theories

678
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,380
I like to think I'm skeptical to the bone

679
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:47,620
But I actually do believe a large percentage

680
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:51,160
Of those conspiracy theories

681
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:55,520
And worse still, I believe in the conspiracy

682
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,820
Yes, the plot

683
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:59,600
By ordinary, normal, everyday people

684
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,560
To label conspiracy researchers

685
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,900
As loonies

686
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,640
Or as a part of a conspiracy

687
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,560
Now, contrary to unpopular opinion, friends

688
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,760
It's still possible to use mass media

689
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,100
To expose mass media conspiracies

690
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,300
But you have to couch your expose carefully

691
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,020
You have to make it look like a satire

692
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,280
Or a comic book

693
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,700
Or a radio show

694
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,400
Like this one

695
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,100
Which is pieced together from the dead parts of history books

696
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:31,060
And, of course, some conspiracy theories are just that

697
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:31,920
They're just theories

698
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,540
Improbable, paranoid, predicated on few facts

699
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:38,880
Like the one about the masons creating the greys

700
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,620
They've obviously got it backwards

701
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,960
Others are founded on pure coincidence

702
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,960
And these, I would consider kooky, wouldn't you?

703
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:50,600
But then, you know, one man's a paranoid lunatic

704
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,200
Is the next man's dedicated researcher

705
00:48:55,540 --> 00:49:00,060
And, you know, the problem is the domino effect, though

706
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:00,580
And, you know, the problem is the domino effect, though

707
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:03,860
There's those who see conspiracies everywhere

708
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:04,960
Literally everywhere

709
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,520
The crazy old bircher lady who fears commies under her bed

710
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,880
Isn't just a stereotype

711
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:14,340
Nor is the religious nut who sees satanists everywhere

712
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:19,540
Nor the UFO cultist who mistakes something that could be cured with Prozac

713
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,640
For messages from the Space Brothers

714
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:28,620
But, you know, there might be something, a sum of it

715
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:30,560
And once you're fairly sure of that, you know, you're in for a good time

716
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:30,560


717
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,260
But once you're fairly sure of the conspiracy theory

718
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,520
That's you pretty fairly sure of one conspiracy theory

719
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:37,280
It starts to tie into neighboring conspiracy theories

720
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,500
And pretty soon you'll believe in quite a few conspiracy theories

721
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,000
And you start to sound like one of those nuts

722
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,340
Unless you're selective about who you tell it to

723
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:54,260
And that's one of the things that inclines you towards the conspiracy view of history

724
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:59,320
Is the way the more trusting people around you respond to the very idea

725
00:49:59,320 --> 00:49:59,900
or the fight is already broken

726
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:00,540
But, you know, one of the things that inclines you towards the conspiracy view of history is the way the more trusting people around you respond to the very idea

727
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:00,540


728
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:05,720
Don't try discussing the CIA's more heinous misdeeds in polite society.

729
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:07,420
People edge away.

730
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,980
Out somewhere.

731
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,440
Jump on the locked plane.

732
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:37,320
And you'll find.

733
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:42,680
You'll leave the conspiracy noose far behind.

734
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:48,360
And if you think this is all just a scam.

735
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:53,280
You'll be wishing you believed when the shit disappeared.

736
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:57,080
As we kill you.

737
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,360
It's so beautiful.

738
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:06,660
You've got a friend in mind.

739
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:12,140
You've got a friend in mind.

740
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:21,100
When the exits come out of the sky.

741
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:26,540
And all the media presence start to die.

742
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,220
All you fools with your.

743
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,060
Pathetic jobs.

744
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:37,660
Will wish they'd listen to the word of dogs.

745
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,880
And if you never said in your thirty bucks.

746
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:48,500
It's gonna look like you'll get royally fucked.

747
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:55,320
With a bone to live in a bar.

748
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,540
You've got a friend in mind.

749
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,220
You've got a friend in mind.

750
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:06,840
You've got a friend in mind.

751
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:15,740
Bugs revelations of a cyborg's pain.

752
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,560
Reveals the subgenius.

753
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,640
Destiny.

754
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,380
Cast out false prophets.

755
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:25,780
Extra meditate.

756
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,300
So set thirty bucks.

757
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,540
You've got a friend in mind.

758
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:32,100
Before it's too late.

759
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:37,120
For you've got a friend in mind.

760
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:42,320
You've got a friend in mind.

761
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:50,480
July 5th, 1998.

762
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,460
Seven a.m.

763
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:56,700
I can hardly wait.

764
00:52:58,540 --> 00:52:59,540
The sex goddesses.

765
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:02,000
Will take me away.

766
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:07,480
I'll party down with Jesus and JFK.

767
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,320
Sex hurt with the heart of a Babylon.

768
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:16,040
Front to the gills.

769
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,560
The party rages on.

770
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,160
For eternity.

771
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,720
And eternity.

772
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:27,820
And so will you.

773
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:29,260
You've got.

774
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,180
P 102.

775
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:36,860
One right now.

776
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,800
Two in every cell.

777
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:38,800


778
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:38,800


779
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,440
You've got a friend in mind.

780
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:47,800
You've got a friend in mind.

781
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:52,100
Three things you can get.

782
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:52,140
It's only after midnight.

783
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:52,140


784
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:52,140


785
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:52,140


786
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:52,140


787
00:53:52,140 --> 00:54:04,960
Well, I heard the American military, especially in the special forces guys, their likelihood of beating the crap out of their woman and creating domestic violence is five times higher than the national average.

788
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:05,900
Wow.

789
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:09,120
I can't believe there's that many uppity women around.

790
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,940
That's such a shame.

791
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,080
Especially on a military base like that where they ought to show their face and not their ace.

792
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,060
I mean, show their ace and not their face.

793
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:20,720
Well, they're just putting them through a little basic training, that's all.

794
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:26,320
They got to learn how to tear that M-16 apart and put it back together in five minutes.

795
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,160
They got to put the socks on the right drawer.

796
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:29,840
They got to put the socks on the right drawer.

797
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:30,500
Five minutes?

798
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:31,720
You get five minutes?

799
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:33,000
Oh, I mean it's five seconds.

800
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,720
You'll be dead in five minutes.

801
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,820
Yeah, you'll be dead in five minutes.

802
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:35,860
You'll be dead.

803
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:37,120
The whole state will be dead.

804
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,300
The whole North Coast will be dead and wiped out by the time you get that gun put back together.

805
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,100
I think that's what's going to happen to America.

806
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:49,380
I can just see millions and billions of soldiers unable to use their guns or put them together sitting around errantly going,

807
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:50,620
No, no.

808
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,180
This is wrong.

809
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:52,700
No, wait a minute.

810
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:52,900
I got to.

811
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:53,300
Oh.

812
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:55,180
Jeez.

813
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,320
No, that's just the reserves.

814
00:54:58,660 --> 00:54:59,520
We have reserves?

815
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:00,440
It's a regular army.

816
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,740
They don't know how to do it.

817
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:03,780
Private Lonesome, you make me sick.

818
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,740
You are the slowest soldier in this force.

819
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:09,080
Give me 25.

820
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,520
I'm going to cut your balls off so you cannot infect the planet.

821
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,840
25 reach arounds right now.

822
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:20,240
Down on your knees, Private.

823
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,760
Down on your face.

824
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:26,800
The man coined accordion of lonesome cowboy David placed on his duffer bag.

825
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:27,680
Fat body.

826
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:30,740
You're the Oreo cookie in this circle, jerk, Private.

827
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:37,700
He knew enough to wear his helmet on his ass so the flack wouldn't come up through the bottom of the helicopter and remove the top of his skull.

828
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:44,260
Like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like.

829
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:46,860
What kind of a sandbox is this?

830
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,160
I know.

831
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:48,600
I don't know.

832
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,080
It is a stinky sandbox.

833
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:50,600
I don't know.

834
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:50,700
I don't know.

835
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,120
It's like very, very bad kitties.

836
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,060
It's like really, really, really out there, man.

837
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,480
The kitties ate all the lamb chops.

838
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:58,320
I don't know.

839
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,400
And all of the tuna.

840
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:02,720
And now it is coming out the wrong type.

841
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:03,440
I'm calling you, Private.

842
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:05,300
Sir, 5 foot 9, sir.

843
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,080
5 foot 9.

844
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,960
I didn't know they stacked shit that high.

845
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:11,600
There is nothing more un-private than a private in the U.S. military.

846
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,780
You are about as public as they get.

847
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:15,000
We can always go back to this.

848
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:17,320
Private Dobbs, Ben Nolan's friend.

849
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,920
Pull that pipe out of there.

850
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:20,100
What have we done?

851
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:20,600
That pipe.

852
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:21,460
What did you put that pipe up in there for?

853
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,920
What did you get that pipe?

854
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,000
Let me take a look inside that box.

855
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:25,740
What do you got in there?

856
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:27,840
Look at that.

857
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:37,020
I can't believe he wrote that in such a, like in four and a half minutes.

858
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,600
Well, it's sad.

859
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,920
Well, the shackles are going back on.

860
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,560
It's time to fix some more road.

861
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,320
To clear some more levee.

862
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:50,500
And to drain some more deltoid.

863
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,540
I'm going to drain my deltoids all afternoon.

864
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,400
Come in there and drink a water.

865
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:04,780
No, I'm not giving you any water until you finish your work.

866
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,400
Lord, give me a drink of water.

867
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:08,860
No, no, no.

868
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,340
And no candy until you finish spinning the road.

869
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,940
Who's that riding?

870
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:18,440
Who wrote the book on the seventh seat?

871
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,460
You know crime.

872
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,540
Nice and 12.

873
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:22,620
A person.

874
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:26,160
And three he led away.

875
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:30,820
Say, what's with me when I walk?

876
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,160
Till I go yonder and pray.

877
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:36,320
Tell me who's that riding?

878
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:36,660
Who?

879
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:40,320
Tell me who's that riding?

880
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,060
Who's that riding?

881
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:45,680
Who's that riding?

882
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,660
Who wrote the book on the seventh seat?

883
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:49,380
I don't know.

884
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:50,580
Who's that riding?

885
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,360
Who's that riding?

886
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:51,880
I don't know.

887
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:54,680
Tell me who's that riding?

888
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:55,780
I don't know.

889
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:56,960
Tell me who's that riding?

890
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:57,060
I don't know.

891
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:58,300
Who's that riding?

892
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,240
Who's that riding?

893
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:00,360
Who's that riding?

894
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,700
Who's that riding?

895
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,040
Well, I wish we'd known how to call a sun.

896
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,100
At least the sun.

897
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,440
Till next week.

898
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,300
Through the clouds.

899
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:14,580
And the dark clouds are rolling away.

900
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,420
Just as soon as that blue sky appears.

901
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:19,520
Keep your head on tight.

902
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:20,440
You're back to the wind.

903
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,440
You're second to set.

904
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,360
You can see clearly.

905
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,960
From one end of the globe to another.

906
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:30,080
Your scope has grown.

907
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:33,220
Your eyes are bigger than those dishes.

908
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,420
Oh, yeah.

909
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:37,040
That's right.

910
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,580
The magic disinformation.

911
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:43,240
The kind that makes your genes swell.

912
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,880
You're too fat.

913
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:48,200
You're too small.

914
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,240
You're too everything.

915
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,140
You're too free.

916
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:54,500
You're going up to praise the beauty.

917
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:02,000
You have been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

918
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:09,680
You can get free information from Bob at Post Office Box 204206.

919
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:13,560
That's also the number for the Subgenius Foundation.

920
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:17,580
P.O. Box 204206.

921
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,260
Austin, Texas.

922
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:20,300
7.

923
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:20,700
8.

924
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:21,080
7.

925
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:21,880
2.

926
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:22,680
0.

927
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:30,400

928
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:37,560
