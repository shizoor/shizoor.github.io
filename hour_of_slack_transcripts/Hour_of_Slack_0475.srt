1
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:24,120
I've got to get this show going, I'm sorry, I'm really running late.

2
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:31,820
I got to the studio light here, and on top of that, to tell the truth, I'm going to try to do a Christmas show.

3
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,600
When I say the word start, the sound will be dead.

4
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,360
Oh no, I'm not ready to start yet.

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,620
Are you ready?

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,060
No.

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:37,880
Start.

8
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,900
Okay, oh, hi.

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,340
When was the last time?

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:52,440
Hello, yes, dear friends, we are starting up, oh man, welcome to the subgenius, where's that?

11
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:03,240
Welcome, dear friends, to the subgenius radio ministry, hour of slack.

12
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:15,100
Ah, yes, the Christmas special, even though you know and I know that it's not really Christmas anymore by the time the radio station gets this tape.

13
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,940
No, no, no, but that's all right, because it's Christmas here, where I am now.

14
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,840
In fact, when you're a subgenius, why?

15
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:33,900
Every day is tin tin day, yes, Christmas, and I have this special poem here to read to you tonight.

16
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,420
It's Christmas Eve, Eve night.

17
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,900
It's such a night, such an inspiring night for subgeniuses.

18
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,100
Well, actually, it's inspiring because of the, don't you hate Christmas sometimes?

19
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:53,820
I mean, it's wonderful, but the Christmas carols, you know, constantly running everywhere.

20
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,900
Everywhere you go, that's the worst part.

21
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,060
And, you know, the family stuff, too.

22
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,420
All I want to do is serve Bob, my friends.

23
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,960
That's all I ever asked out of life, was to serve, yes, to serve Bob and his other servants.

24
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,400
You, yes, you.

25
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:19,220
Oh, and, um, and towards that end, we strive to bring you the fullness of slack.

26
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,260
Oh, yes, even if we're running late.

27
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,800
Uh, we...

28
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:32,760
We try to bring you what we can of that which has dripped from Bob, uh, down his pants leg,

29
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:42,560
and into our cups, which runneth over with the joy and the love, yes, the love of the slack of that man Bob.

30
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,100
Yes, yes, yes.

31
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,960
And I want to, uh, read to you this...

32
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,020
Oh, excuse me.

33
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,240
We still have getting used to the mousetraps around here.

34
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,580
There's a lot of mice.

35
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,760
We may hear that again.

36
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,200
Oh, look at him.

37
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,420
Oh, he's not dead yet.

38
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:58,880
Hold it.

39
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:06,760
Uh, yes, yes, we are triumphant over the little mice, the bad, bad little mice that come into our radio station.

40
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:14,060
And, and we are triumphant over the bad little pigs, the normals who come into our lives somehow or another.

41
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,840
I have faith that we shall triumph.

42
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:23,800
And so, uh, I was, uh, uh, scanning through the, uh, subgenus.

43
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,980
News group on the internet, which is called alt.slack.

44
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,400
Uh, I was adoring him, Bob.

45
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,840
And so were all the other people who had left messages there.

46
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:45,980
And one, uh, Reverend S.B. Johnston, uh, sent him this, this, uh, lovely poem, this Christmas poem.

47
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,440
It says, well, I'd like to read it to you, dear friends.

48
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,460
I'll wait until this record gets to a more appropriate.

49
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,600
That's a little bit too.

50
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,020
Big, you know, for this one.

51
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,960
I just wanted some, some sort of Christmassy music.

52
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,260
Okay.

53
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,540
Okay.

54
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,100
Records.

55
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,640
God, so primitive.

56
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,320
Oh, yes.

57
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,940
The Night Before X Day.

58
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,200
An X-ist-mist poem by the Reverend Dr. S.B.O.

59
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:30,720
T'was the night before X-day, when all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.

60
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:38,400
The argyles were hung by the chimney with care, in hopes that Bob Dobbs soon would be there.

61
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:46,380
The children were nestled all snug in their beds, while visions of slack danced in their heads.

62
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,180
And Mom in her jammies.

63
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,480
And I in her muff had just settled down for some fun in the buff.

64
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,720
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.

65
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,420
There, that's better.

66
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,380
Away to the window I flew like a flash, tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

67
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:13,280
The radiation glow from the new-fallen dust was such a terrible sight, it dampened my lust.

68
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:19,180
When what to my wondering eyes should appear, but a gigantic flying auto, eight cylinders,

69
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:26,100
high gear, with a square-jawed young driver intent on his job, I knew in a minute, it must be old Bob.

70
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,320
On the seat next to him sat his eager young dame, and he whistled to her and called her by name.

71
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:39,640
Now Connie, you vixen, you prancer, you dancer, oh let me go, Cupid, you'll make me go crash her.

72
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:47,940
And from the top of the porch, and right through the wall, Bob's car smashed away, smashed away, smashed away all.

73
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,160
Wait a minute, this music, that sucks.

74
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:01,460
And in the process of landing, my house he did wreck, said Bob.

75
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,920
Sorry about that, I'll write you a check.

76
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,700
From next door came a bellow, keep that junk off my lawn.

77
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,520
Shut up, pink boy, answered Bob, you conspiracy pawn.

78
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,780
And then in a twinkle I heard on the roof the prancing of wingtips.

79
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,120
Was Bob on the hoof?

80
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,620
As I drew in my head and was turning around, down came Dobbs with a jump and a bound.

81
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:29,080
He was dressed nattily from his head to his foot, but his clothes were covered with ashes and soot.

82
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:36,660
His eyes how they twinkled, his brows how they arched, his cheekbones so prominent, his shirt likely starched.

83
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:43,920
His droll grinning mouth was drawn up like a bow, and the widow's peak on his forehead was quaffed, ah, just so.

84
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:51,060
The proudest of pipes he held in his teeth, and the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath.

85
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:56,660
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

86
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:02,420
He pawed at some paper he'd pulled from his flaps and held them up high like a gambler at craps.

87
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,620
He passed me the tickets, saucers, first class, oh joy, thought I, it's the rupture at last.

88
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,900
And laying his finger aside of his nose and giving a nod up to his arms, he said,

89
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:13,900


90
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,680
Otto, he rose.

91
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:21,100
He sprang to his machine, to his wife gave a whistle, and away they both flew like the down of a thistle.

92
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,640
But I heard him exclaim, as he drove out of sight,

93
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,000
Repent and slack off till tomorrow, good night.

94
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:40,360
Ah, yes, yes, yes, repent and slack off till tomorrow, good night, good night, good night.

95
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,720
A fine poem by the Reverend Dr.

96
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,240
S.

97
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,820
Boe, taken while Christmas shot.

98
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,120
No, well, actually, I was taken off of the internet.

99
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,620
The alt.

100
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,000
Slack or alt.

101
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,000
Period slack, as some of you might say.

102
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:55,960
Excuse me.

103
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:01,640
Oh, oh, oh, I love, you get to, you can do that maybe once a year.

104
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,560
What's that buzz coming from?

105
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,680
That's that phonograph.

106
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,920
Isn't that pathetic?

107
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,880
Let's see what else we got.

108
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,820
We, what?

109
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,740
Oh, oh, no, no.

110
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,540
My man, that's too scary.

111
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,260
We gotta put on, oh, here, this is perfect.

112
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,020
The Distant Galaxy.

113
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,960
You are obsolete.

114
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,320
No, you are obsolete.

115
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,400
That was OBE.

116
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,420
Here we go.

117
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,060
Some lively, oh, yeah, this is, this is good show-starting music, don't you think?

118
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,300
Yeah, yeah.

119
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:34,680
Oh.

120
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,620
Back in them days, all the music sounded like,

121
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,800
I don't know, like, sitcom intros.

122
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,020
Anyway, I was out Christmas shopping.

123
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,360
We'll get to some types and stuff presently.

124
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,440
But I was out Christmas shopping.

125
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,960
And, of course, you know, I always end up spending more time looking at stuff that I want for myself

126
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,980
than I do getting and finding stuff for other people.

127
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:10,140
But I was looking at the magazine section, trying to figure out the proper service to use

128
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,440
to surf the internet, as they say.

129
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,380
Oh, and I picked up this magazine.

130
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:22,920
I thought, wow, this looks cool and trendy, like Wired or Mondo 2000.

131
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,680
And it's called Dot Net, the internet magazine.

132
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,160
It has that sort of insane layout, but not too insane.

133
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:42,800
And I noticed on the cover there was an article about net cults from Far Eastern mystics to Wild Western wackos.

134
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,340
And I thought.

135
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,020
Well, you know, if they don't have something about Church of the Subgenius in here,

136
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,060
then I'm going to be insulted.

137
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,840
And I flipped it open.

138
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,120
I flipped through it a little bit.

139
00:09:51,160 --> 00:10:01,980
And lo and behold, on page 72 was a great big gigantic color picture of my savior, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

140
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:06,400
And, in fact, they had not only mentioned the church's news group in this magazine,

141
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,600
but they used Bob's picture without permission, even though it's a trademark, all through it.

142
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,840
And this interesting.

143
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,840
Let me turn that.

144
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,080
That's distracting.

145
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,300
The distant galaxy is too close.

146
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,280
I want something.

147
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,680
This may be distracting, too, but what the heck.

148
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,660
It's just.

149
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,520
It's more of a rug, you know.

150
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,520
Osric tentacles.

151
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:29,800
Okay.

152
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,760
And it goes with this modernistical, you know, psycho.

153
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:39,120
The surf in the world of the cyber pinks is what it mostly is.

154
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,600
Chris of Negative Land.

155
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,140
Submitted that new vocabulary word for you subgeniuses.

156
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:51,420
Cyber pinks, which refers to these so-called net heads,

157
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,100
which I'm in the process of probably becoming, I suppose.

158
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,340
But anyway, in this magazine, they mentioned all these different.

159
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,480
There's the pagan news group and the witches news group.

160
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:08,120
And, you know, the other fantasy unicorns and dragons news groups.

161
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,580
There's a Zen news group and Buddhism news group.

162
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,120
And so forth.

163
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,280
But here we get down to.

164
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,160
If you're not interested in the act, but like hanging around on cultural fringes,

165
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,240
there are plenty of half jokey, half serious cults on the net.

166
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,780
Followers of the Church of the Subgenius, a massive satirical.

167
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,720
And they call this satirical, Francis.

168
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,300
This this church is their idea of a joke.

169
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,120
They think it's so funny.

170
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:39,680
Oh, yeah.

171
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,400
They can't tell the difference.

172
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,460
They're laughing at it.

173
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,620
Well, we're laughing back at you, boy.

174
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,300
We're laughing at you, boy.

175
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:56,360
OK, a massive, let's say, religious outfit set up 15 years ago by a group of unhinged Texans.

176
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,040
Well, at least they got that part right.

177
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,660
Have their own news group entitled Alt Dot Slack.

178
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,360
Slack, you see, is what every subgenius chases.

179
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,980
Slack is what gets taken away from us by society.

180
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,860
Slack is a sort of going with the flow.

181
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,580
Oh, quality.

182
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,540
That we must try to regain.

183
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,880
These guys, you know, see to them, they don't take this seriously.

184
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:26,600
They don't realize that what they just said, they were accidentally printing the answer.

185
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:32,800
My friends, anyway, it says here the church worships Bob and they print it without the quotes.

186
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:39,600
A traveling salesman who smokes a pipe as if that's the only salient thing about our high epoc.

187
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,480
Bob, unlike other gurus, is whoever you want.

188
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,020
You want him to be.

189
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,960
Well, that's a lie.

190
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,100
That's a black lie.

191
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,600
That's a sickening lie.

192
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,760
He is not who you want.

193
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,800
Bob Dobbs is not who you want him to be.

194
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,420
Bob Dobbs is who he, whatever he wants to be at that time.

195
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,040
And you are whatever he wants you to be, which usually is a customer.

196
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,760
OK, so now that you've got that right, I hope.

197
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,100
Excuse me.

198
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,180
OK, then we worship Bob.

199
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,780
Unlike other gurus, he's honest about your intentions.

200
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,120
He wants your money.

201
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,140
Eternal.

202
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,000
Salvation or triple your money back is one of his top slogans.

203
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:22,300
All dot slack is fun, but unless you're at least passingly acquainted with the central tenets of the church,

204
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:29,340
you'll find it mystifying and risk being labeled a pink boy if you post a message asking what's going on.

205
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,860
As for a frequently asked question or fact, they're far too slack for that.

206
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,500
Well, it's not exactly that, sir.

207
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,220
It's that that chaos you encounter when you tune in to the.

208
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,820
All dot slack board is, in fact, is quite deliberate.

209
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:54,820
It's so it's to keep the foolish would be subgeniuses, the humans out.

210
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,540
It's to give them.

211
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:05,400
It's to present, just like everything else we do, that surface sheen of either confusion or frighteningly militaristic Nazi like horribleness.

212
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,260
And either way, you know, it keeps the riffraff out.

213
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,000
It's what it does.

214
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,120
We don't want to end up like those other.

215
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,320
Churches now, do we, dear friends?

216
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,060
I think not.

217
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,220
You know, this is an August assemblage.

218
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,600
We the subgenie.

219
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:27,360
And there's no point in just letting these, you know, get the kids, you know, humans and so forth.

220
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,320
They can hurt themselves with this stuff.

221
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,200
And I don't want to be the one that gets the lawsuit.

222
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,760
Well, what else do I have?

223
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,260
Let's just listen to Osric Tentacles for a minute.

224
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,460
Here we go.

225
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,480
Okay, that's enough pretty music for you.

226
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,140
Sorry.

227
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:18,800
Sorry.

228
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:20,180


229
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:21,980
Sorry.

230
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:21,980


231
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:22,800


232
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,120


233
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,520
Sorry.

234
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,560
Sorry.

235
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:26,560


236
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:26,560


237
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:26,580
Sorry.

238
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,020
Sorry.

239
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,280
Sorry.

240
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,100
Sorry.

241
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,660
Sorry.

242
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:34,900
Sorry.

243
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:35,940
Sorry.

244
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:41,260
Sorry.

245
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:41,420
Sorry.

246
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:41,560
Sorry.

247
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:41,980
Sorry.

248
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:42,560
Sorry.

249
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:43,620
Sorry.

250
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,700
Sorry.

251
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,200
Sorry.

252
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,200


253
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,240
Sorry.

254
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:47,240


255
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:47,260
Sorry.

256
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:47,300
Sorry.

257
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:48,800


258
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:54,820
Sorry.

259
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,060
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

260
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,180
You thought he was an idiot and couldn't write, right?

261
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:58,940
You're right.

262
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:08,000
He got this pretty slick girly magazine called New Rave to pay him to write an article about the church of the subgenius.

263
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,320
And he tried to work in a whole bunch of stuff about ESO radio and brain rot.

264
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,400
And then when they found out he was one of the people who did that, they cut those references and Dan got mad.

265
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,120
And so now...

266
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,740
Taz got mad.

267
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,300
Yeah.

268
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,640
But yeah, there's this magazine with two naked girls.

269
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,520
It's a girly magazine.

270
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,600
Let's call it what it is.

271
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,920
You write for a girl.

272
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:33,200
You might as well be, in fact, would you not, Senator DeLuca, a pornographer.

273
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,080
Yes, I guess.

274
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,800
I have no knowledge.

275
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:44,880
You wrote an article about a side religion in this pornographic girly magazine, New Rave, which has...

276
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,120
Let me show the committee.

277
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,120
I object to this line.

278
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,260
I don't see where this is going.

279
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,980
I don't see where this is taking us.

280
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,920
If this is taking us anywhere at all, I never posed for this magazine.

281
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,000
Senator DeLuca, did you or did you not write this phrase?

282
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:08,240
Underneath this photograph, Bob clergyman reveled with bleeding head of Arnold Palmer above,

283
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:14,540
while at right, a sexy normal models the latest in Bob Ware.

284
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,620
I believe that was an assistant editor that put that in there.

285
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,080
This shows Dr.

286
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:26,860
Hal Robbins apparently attempting about to have sexual congress with this decapitated head of a celebrity,

287
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:34,740
Jaina Hyperclete standing next to him, gazing at this lasciviously undressed human, female,

288
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:40,080
a female human in a subgenius article, Mr. DeLuca, a nude female human.

289
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:40,960
May I say one?

290
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,360
You're a nude.

291
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,420
I would like to say, just, could I say one thing, please?

292
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,820
I dare call it, none dare call it pornography, but we do.

293
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,020
I have no...

294
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:55,360
I had no knowledge of either the caption under the naked woman or the close shave there nearby,

295
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:04,500
and I certainly didn't, although I may have plagiarized and indeed lied a few times about what you may have said,

296
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,000
I indeed never did what you just said.

297
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,920
I did not say what you said that I said in this article.

298
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:18,040
I distinctly recall you making an allegation that I somehow was one of the women posing there in the boxer shorts, and I...

299
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,600
Now, according to this article,

300
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,580
I would claim that the church of the subgenius I quote here,

301
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,400
the penis gets bigger as your brain shrinks.

302
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:38,720
This is in a family magazine, an art magazine of youthful, health-filled nudists,

303
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,740
frolicking with bottles of KY jelly and each other.

304
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,980
I had no, again, I had no knowledge of the KY jelly.

305
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,620
I was told that it was merely a surfactant so that I could fall asleep.

306
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,000
Is that true?

307
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,000


308
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,300
It's easier, and I've been using it that way ever since.

309
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,820
I've never used it as an analgesic or a lubricant for any kind of...

310
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,900
Well, there it is.

311
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,560
I can't really deny that there's a large-breasted woman in that magazine.

312
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:08,900
Yes, you, Reverend Susie the Flusie, this so-called reverend of this so-called church,

313
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:15,560
you have printed, did you not print this photograph of Reverend Susie the Flusie of the WREK in Atlanta,

314
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,100
posing rather lasciviously, I might say,

315
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,840
Yes, excuse me.

316
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:25,040
appearing to bow down before this gigantic cult head of this so-called Bob?

317
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:29,320
Now, this was for a cult investigation we were conducting at the time.

318
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,040
That's what you claim.

319
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:36,000
As you know, Cult Watch has been gathering strength as much as MAD did over the last 20 years,

320
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:42,740
and I'm sure some sort of, if you know for a fact, there have been cases of satanic memory, possession,

321
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,600
and there's clearly some sort of...

322
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,680
You may sit down, Mr. DeLuca.

323
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,980
I would like to bring to the attention...

324
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:55,280
I would like to bring to the attention of the court this publication, this book, Revelation X, the Bobapocryphon,

325
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,680
a so-called...

326
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,060
Could you say the... I'm sorry, Senator.

327
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,060
Now, you say it, Senator.

328
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,480
Could you say the name again, Senator?

329
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,020
I don't think the members, the other members of the room got...

330
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,160
Oh, that's...

331
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,680
Revelation X.

332
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,600
The Bobapocryphon.

333
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,840
That's right, Bobapocryphon.

334
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,280
That's pronounced Bobapocryphon.

335
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,960
Yes, available at ordinary bookstores.

336
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,100
A child can walk in and purchase this book, could he not, Senator?

337
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,060
Now, I'm...

338
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,960
You're saying now that a child could go anywhere and buy a copy of this book?

339
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:19,960


340
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:19,960


341
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:19,960


342
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:19,960


343
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:28,500
A copy of the Bobapocryphon, the Revelation X, and this has merit material which may be hazardous to a child's minimum material and deformities.

344
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,080
Is this correct?

345
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:32,960
Now, Senator Lonesome here has...

346
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:43,320
That is correct, but Senator Lonesome has claimed to this court that he was merely conducting an investigation of this cult for, quote, this girly magazine, unquote.

347
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:49,440
And yet, here in this book, Revelation X, we find this self-same Dave DeLuca, a.k.a. Lonesome.

348
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:55,240
Lonesome Cowboy Dave, listed as a co-author in the self-same hideous publication.

349
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:12,380
And we just don't see how you can reconcile your testimony, your earlier testimony, regarding this so-called deviant sex cult of yours with claiming to have an investigation and writing it off with your Senate committee's taxpayer money.

350
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,220
And the girls.

351
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,000
What about the girls, Senator?

352
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,180
And the boys.

353
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,260
And the boys.

354
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:19,960
And the old, old...

355
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:19,960


356
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,100
And the old men.

357
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,680
What about the old men?

358
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,280
What were you using old men for, Senator?

359
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,800
Senator, now, this is outside the line of normal questioning.

360
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,360
I did what I was supposed to.

361
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:44,480
I was told that it was an assignment that ye had co-authored a bill to investigate certain, well, like, say, the Church of the Subgenius, various so-called satanic or bizarre cults.

362
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,500
And therefore, that's what I've done.

363
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,300
And anything else, it's all here.

364
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,880
It's all here.

365
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,240
It's all there in your books of pornography.

366
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,000
In your...

367
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,460
You...

368
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,560
To...

369
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,460
To think...

370
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:05,360
To have to show this man's face on CNN like this, displayed before children as a role model,

371
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:10,220
lonesome cowboy Dave, it turns out, Senator from Ohio...

372
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,040
That three-legged man.

373
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,200
Is a three-legged man and a pornographer.

374
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,120
Yes, a pornographer.

375
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,160
And has committed perjury.

376
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,580
Silence him.

377
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,440
Silence him now.

378
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,700
Silence him.

379
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:19,960
Silence him.

380
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:19,960


381
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:19,960


382
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:19,960


383
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:19,960


384
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,620
Take him away.

385
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:29,980
Senator, I do remember that you had mentioned that the Church of the Subgenius had used various funds, which had to get through the government.

386
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:37,460
And it used these funds to start a sort of boy's town or some sort of work project for children in...

387
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,340
The Home for Slackless Children in Malaysia.

388
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:39,980
That's right.

389
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,900
Now, have you done any research on a Home for Slackless Children in Malaysia?

390
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,880
What did you find?

391
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,720
Could you elucidate the committee on that?

392
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,040
We found at this so-called Home for Slackless Children...

393
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:56,140
It said that some people from Kuala Lumpur, lawyers with pipes, had come and paid him $20 to display this sign.

394
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:56,820
Now, wait a minute now.

395
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,620
Now, he's a lawyer.

396
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,820
And they...

397
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,960
Well, that's what he described these people as.

398
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,600
He said some lawyers had come from Kuala Lumpur to make this deal with him.

399
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,740
Now, you showed the slide.

400
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,420
It's merely a one-room farmhouse.

401
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:09,900
Am I correct?

402
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,300
This is what we're seeing right here, right now.

403
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:11,860
This was the so-called...

404
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:18,920
This is the Home for Slackless Children to which, I believe, dues-paying subgeniuses have been funneling their donations.

405
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:28,940
When Reverend Stang or Bob Dobbs or Philodrum get on the television and start soliciting funds for this so-called Home for Slackless Children,

406
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,320
which they then proceed to show videotapes of Mount Sinai or some hospital in Los Angeles,

407
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:43,700
it turns out that their actual Home for Slackless Children is, in fact, a one-room hut without plumbing in central Malaysia.

408
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,840
And these children are forced to live in this deplorable...

409
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,860
There are no children there.

410
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,560
We don't know...

411
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:48,800
The whole...

412
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,020
The whole...

413
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,840
The whole thing is a scam?

414
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,400
Are you saying...

415
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,120
We were told, and I quote,

416
00:23:52,440 --> 00:24:04,240
The children that you call lost have actually found themselves for the first time and are safe in our off-planet colonies, learning exciting new crafts.

417
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,800
This is what the...

418
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,220
The...

419
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:12,160
This was the memo that we got back from the Subgenius Foundation office, Senator.

420
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,940
Well, that's very inspiring.

421
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,000
You mean...

422
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,760
Then so when the church of the subgenius does too...

423
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,580
It's a good thing.

424
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:19,620
It's a good thing.

425
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:19,620


426
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:26,000
Although it's a rather oblique way of getting these children salvation, they do achieve it on their own, so to speak.

427
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,400
So there's no...

428
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,400
No, we don't know.

429
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:34,240
We have no idea whether they're actually shipping them off-world or if they're being stored in vats, sold to the...

430
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,900
To, well, our friends in...

431
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,020
Under Groom Lake.

432
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,560
I may believe Senator Hummock had a question for you.

433
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:47,860
The government has an obligation to our friends, the Grays, from Ora Reticulon.

434
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,660
They need human organs just as we need Gray technology.

435
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,920
I think that any...

436
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,760
This is a closed meeting, yes?

437
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:04,120
Well, there are some members of the media here, but they have signed the confidentiality affidavit.

438
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,980
Please strike all mention of the Grays from the transcript.

439
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,660
We don't want to have to get in right...

440
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,980
Do you understand what's going on here?

441
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,740
We don't want to get into a discussion of the Grays and this sort of thing in front of members of the media.

442
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,800
They signed a confidentiality agreement, but...

443
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,700
Okay, now we can begin again. I'm sorry.

444
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,840
All right, to resume the questioning.

445
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:30,400
Which of the Lee Harvey Oswalds, Senator DeLuca, did you send to Dallas, Texas on that fateful day?

446
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:39,400
Was it the 6'3 Oswald seen outside the embassy in New Mexico City?

447
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:46,280
Or was it the 5'3 Oswald who bought the used car on Beckley Avenue?

448
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,040
I'm just kidding.

449
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,800
I like that answer.

450
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:58,100
I never in my career sent a Lee Harvey Oswald or any man using that moniker or that tag anywhere in this country.

451
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,740
During my brief interim term there as a mapmaker for the agency,

452
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:11,460
I did send a man named Lee Oswald to Dallas to talk to Jack Ruby, a friend of mine at the time, about a gambling bet.

453
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:11,740
I see.

454
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,560
About some money I owed him, and that was the extent of our conversation.

455
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,240
That is the extent of your conversation.

456
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:17,840
Senator.

457
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,200
Now, you were a Republican at this time.

458
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,040
I was repugnant until la-la-la-la.

459
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:22,820
Yeah.

460
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,220
Well, let's see here.

461
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,400
How many times have you switched sides?

462
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,000
Oh, I'm not very succinct about that.

463
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,640
I'd like to go on to something else, if you don't mind, sir.

464
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,100
Oh, you'd like to go on to something else.

465
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:39,180
I suppose the cover-up of the assassination of the president is not worthy of our time at this august assemblage.

466
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,000
Which president are you referring to?

467
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,260
All of the presidents, sir.

468
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,340
I had no hand, and nor did I have any feet in any of the...

469
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:45,940
Squeaky Frum.

470
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,840
We would like to call Squeaky Frum.

471
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,200
Squeaky Frum to the chair.

472
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,140
We'd like to please call Mrs.

473
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,880
Sarah Jane Moore will be next.

474
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,780
Squeaky Frum, could you please fake the witness scene, please?

475
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,080
Squeaky Frum, do you recognize that senator over there?

476
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,800
Why, yes.

477
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,400
And how much money did he give you to shoot at the president?

478
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,800
I don't think I can say that. I don't think I can say that.

479
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,980
I plead the fifth. I plead the fifth.

480
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:14,860
I don't know whether that...

481
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,880
I can't say. I just can't...

482
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,840
Squeaky Frum.

483
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,360
Whoa, too squeaky in every possible way, dear friends.

484
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,240
All right, we'll have to call up Sarah Jane Moore.

485
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,120
And, yes, you're listening to the Hour of Slack.

486
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:35,120
In this case, a replay of our guest's stint on ESO radio there in Cleveland, Ohio.

487
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,220
Oh, I get it.

488
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,440
WCSB in Cleveland, yes.

489
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,060
The ESO radio show.

490
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,420
Look, miss. I pass. Look, miss.

491
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:50,480
It's a sad day, gentlemen of the committee,

492
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,100
when we have to drag a senator,

493
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,060
a once respected, a model for today's youth,

494
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,860
Senator Lonesome Cowboy Spaceman Dave...

495
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:02,500
I told you I did not model in any of those pamphlets.

496
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,860
...seen here in this photograph with Marina Oswald.

497
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,600
You didn't know he had this picture.

498
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,480
Gee, you, Senator.

499
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,880
Marxism is the wave of the future.

500
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,460
Ah, finally his true colors come out.

501
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,940
Pinko all the way with a yellow streak down his back.

502
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,820
Why, you yellow red bastard.

503
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,280
I'll stand... Listen, buddy, I'll stand for being accused of being a pinko.

504
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,820
But you called me a pink just a minute ago.

505
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,520
And for that, I'm gonna rip out your eye sockets.

506
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,480
Look at that.

507
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,240
I think I saw yourplin speed.

508
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,320
I got ya hired.

509
00:28:53,600 --> 00:29:00,060
That turned out to be too much for me.

510
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:00,600
What was UV?

511
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,580
A magic today.

512
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:03,580


513
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:03,580


514
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,440
I know seventy seven 성공 all together.

515
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:04,600
One triple one is already done for her.

516
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,700
Rizin made my day.

517
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,580
You think I'll change it someday to just now?

518
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:06,840
I love it.

519
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:06,840


520
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:06,840


521
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:06,840


522
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:07,060


523
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:07,580
I don't win turns, and this is the cowboy I once had.

524
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,080
I don't want to see him get streamed all over the place.

525
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,820
Eric, isn't itón well or something?

526
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:11,800
Okay financially?

527
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:11,800


528
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,040
Please.

529
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,700
Shoot the mothers in the head.

530
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,900
Poor Bob.

531
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,300
There's got to be a logical explanation for this.

532
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,500
Shut up!

533
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,860
Brothers, it's Christmas.

534
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,940
It's Christmas, man.

535
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,100
It's Christmas today.

536
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:30,240
I want you to put your hands on the table.

537
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,080
Who Killed Bob by Reverend Godzilla Bloat.

538
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,760
Beautiful piece here.

539
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,440
It's Christmas.

540
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,320
From the tape, the hairs in Bob's ears.

541
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,760
Or is that Bob's Media Pollution?

542
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,580
Yeah, that's from Bob's Media Pollution.

543
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,180
The difference between slack and no slack was the time you were 14 and finally called that girl up.

544
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,420
And when she knew who you were...

545
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,940
When you identified yourself on the phone.

546
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,260
That was the beginning of slack.

547
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,100
But then again, getting the date or anything like that was not slack.

548
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:23,300
It was that moment when suddenly something went the way you wanted it to go without you thinking about it.

549
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,320
It was something that was totally not involved when your feet were involved rather than your head.

550
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,080
Slack is getting things to run smooth without trying.

551
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,120
Without trying.

552
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,980
You give up and you get everything.

553
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,420
It's like a submission of the self to the water.

554
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,020
It's like over-lighting in Buddhism.

555
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:45,440
The Atman surrenders to the holy oneness without thinking about it.

556
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,680
It's not give to get, it's give up and get anyway.

557
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:59,600
Well I used to be a sinner cause I truly did believe

558
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:04,400
That the Virgin married Jesus and me worth the gas thieves

559
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,440
And I used to give my dough to tell evangelists

560
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,120
And I used to give my dough to tell evangelists

561
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:13,440
But then the light had shown upon me and I found J.R. Bob Dobs

562
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,900
And now my wallet belongs to Bob

563
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,560
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob

564
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:27,140
Well my heart is for my honey and my brain is for my job

565
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:30,780
But my wallet belongs to Bob

566
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,940
Thanks for watching.

567
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:42,700
Well, Bobby goes a-frappin' every chance that he can get

568
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:47,100
He can outperform the biggest without even breakin' sweat

569
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:51,680
So I gave him all my money, Reverend Stang said it was right

570
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:56,140
And for only $20, he did save my soul tonight

571
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,960
So my wallet belongs to Bob

572
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,340
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob

573
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,860
No more can the conspiracy my lowly wages rob

574
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:13,840
My wallet belongs to Bob

575
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:25,480
Well, Bobby's got a sweetie and Connie is her name

576
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,100
And her ways could put the sacred whore of Babylon to shame

577
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,720
She reaches in Bob's pocket, feels around for somethin'

578
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,320
Hard to get her to come back, but she's got a sweet heart

579
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:34,320


580
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:38,960
Then pulls her hand out, holdin' on to his mighty credit card

581
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,360
So my wallet belongs to Bob

582
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:47,220
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob

583
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:52,420
And I never have to fear, cause I know Connie's on the job

584
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:56,340
And my wallet belongs to Bob

585
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:08,540
Well, you may have your lady and your horny green man, too

586
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:12,820
Their elemental energy may be what's right for you

587
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:17,760
But someday you'll grow weary of those paganistic cults

588
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,780
And give away your money to the one that gets results

589
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:25,400
And then your wallet will be Bob

590
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,260
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob

591
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:30,140
Yes, your wallet will be for Bob

592
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:35,960
And you will be subgenius, not another stupid slob

593
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,640
Cause your wallet will be for Bob

594
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,880
Well, I believe I am much calmer

595
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,120
Got the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer

596
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,320
Sittin' on the dashboard of my car

597
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,200
Praise Bob

598
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,860
Praise Bob

599
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,180
Yeah!

600
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,920
Enjoy the rest of the concert, thank you very much!

601
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,000
Yeah

602
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,880
Oh, praise Bob

603
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,840
Kill Bob

604
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,140
If you meet Bob on the road, kill him

605
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,060
Yeah

606
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:26,940
If you meet Bob on the road, kill him

607
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,000
If you meet Bob on the road, kill him

608
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,320
If you meet Bob on the road, kill him

609
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:29,380
Well, I mean, I love that you actually have a problem

610
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,360
with the bleeding neck stump

611
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,980
Hey, that's disgusting

612
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,460
Well, and what a lovely tune

613
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,580
The infamous My Wallet Belongs to Bob

614
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:44,960
by the lovely sister Melodious Chops

615
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,120
Recorded there at Starwood Festival

616
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,900
sponsored by Ace, out of Cleveland

617
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,860
Yeah, it's smooth

618
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,940
It's a smooth and groovy time

619
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,040
And I'm just a little bit afraid of the fact that my wallet belongs to Bob right now

620
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:02,380
I love that song. I really do. Sister Melodious Chops has done some wonderful hymns to J.R. Bob Dobbs.

621
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,240
That is probably my very favorite.

622
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,540
The background singing there is by the beautiful Sister M.A.

623
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,320
Actually, I can't remember her subgenius name.

624
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:21,680
And the staggeringly gorgeous Princess Wee Ardo, queen of all the UFOs.

625
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,280
And let's see. What else?

626
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,000
What else have we got? I'm kind of on a musical kick for a minute.

627
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:32,860
When we'll get back to Einstein's secret orchestra on the radio.

628
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,840
Hey, what is this stuff in the background?

629
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,640
Is this something Nenslo sent?

630
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,540
Yeah, it's smooth.

631
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,440
I've got the title of it somewhere, but I'm not going to mess with it.

632
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:51,500
Let's see.

633
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,380
Oh, man.

634
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,020
Oh, man.

635
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:21,520
Oh, man.

636
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,260
Oh, man.

637
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,800
Oh, yeah.

638
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:40,060
This is Forms of Insanity, recorded live, I believe, at one of the Akron subgenius debibles back in 1993.

639
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,020
Back in them old days.

640
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,680
Forms of Insanity is an aptly, aptly named band.

641
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,640
Not very well recorded on this one.

642
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,260
Oh, boy.

643
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,300
Reverend Toth Wilder.

644
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,460
vocals are really something, aren't they?

645
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:14,240
It kind of sounds like somebody was using the mic stand as a drum at one point.

646
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:20,340
I wouldn't be surprised. At these subgenius shows, it can get pretty violent, it can get pretty lascivious.

647
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:28,720
At the most recent Akron Devival, which was some sort of a fetish outfit contest at the same time,

648
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:33,220
I saw things I've never seen at any subgenius devival, including...

649
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,600
Whoa.

650
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,920
Yeah, including money, and including...

651
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,500
Well, at one point, I looked at what was going on on the stage, which would have made Howard Stern proud.

652
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,060
Believe you me.

653
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,280
And turned around and...

654
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,100
And looked at what was being projected on the screens and kind of slapped myself in the forehead and said,

655
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:57,380
We could all go to jail for this!

656
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,620
And then, uh, we didn't.

657
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:06,800
So, the proof is in the pudding, friend. You can get away with murder with J.R. Bob Dogg.

658
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,700
And then, uh, we got a little bit of a

659
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,660
I can't get my boogie, I get it by hand.

660
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,820
Hey, my rebar.

661
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,960
Hey, my rebar.

662
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,020
Hey, my rebar.

663
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,400
Hey, my rebar.

664
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,300
Hey, my rebar.

665
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,020
Yes, my baby knows.

666
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:49,020
Now, I book it in the kitchen and I book it in the hall.

667
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,120
I book it in my hand.

668
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,200
And I'm plucking up the wall.

669
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,440
Hey, my rebar.

670
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,660
Hey, my rebar.

671
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,840
Hey, my rebar.

672
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,720
Hey, my rebar.

673
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,880
Hey, my rebar.

674
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:57,980
Hey, my rebar.

675
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,660
Yes, my baby knows.

676
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,700
Now, I take the person's butter and I take the person's heart.

677
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,720
I put it on my boogie.

678
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,320
Oh, man, friends, I'm sorry.

679
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:10,080
I just have to get out of it before it gets too late.

680
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,340
The traditional old song.

681
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,620
This is an ancient song written many, many centuries ago.

682
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:20,040
And, uh, the good Reverend Toth and his friends there.

683
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,060
In forms of insanity.

684
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,720
Have certainly adapted it.

685
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,960
In, uh, ways that could get us all in terrible, terrible trouble.

686
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,780
If we, uh, clearly played any of these lyrics.

687
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,800
Uh, thank you.

688
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,440
And, uh, oh, man.

689
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,700
I see.

690
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:35,580
I'm, I'm sorry.

691
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,060
I, I'm, I shouldn't even have started into it.

692
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:42,220
But I swore that we're going to play a different recording of forms of insanity.

693
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,400
Doing Hey Bob Rebob every show.

694
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,900
I got this tape.

695
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,520
It's got six tapes of, uh, Hey Bob Rebob.

696
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,260
And six tapes of, of Bob Rebob.

697
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:50,880
And Bob's money.

698
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,680
And, uh, it's going to be, I'm, I'm sorry.

699
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,040
That's just what it's going to be.

700
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,480
It's going to be one per show.

701
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,280
Okay.

702
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,660
I mean, I'm the preacher.

703
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,300
I can, uh, dictate these things.

704
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,960
And what, what's going on in this old deck here?

705
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,680
It's every kind of appeal and every kind of a drink.

706
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,800
And these fellows go out and turn these bottles up.

707
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,780
You know what they're doing?

708
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,640
They're looking for something that'll make them have a high feeling.

709
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,020
Oh, I want you to know you talk about a high feeling.

710
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,540
I've been high on Jesus for 39 years.

711
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:19,920
Hallelujah.

712
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,520
Glory to God.

713
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,620
And I'm getting higher and higher all the time.

714
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,040
And one thing about this high that I'm got it.

715
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:28,020
I only don't give me no illusions.

716
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,580
He meant the high that I get on is a reality.

717
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,420
Everything that I see is real.

718
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,320
That's where the blood came.

719
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,480
Now you need to make up in your mind.

720
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:38,820
Otherwise,

721
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,680
you're in for a shock.

722
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,180
Yes.

723
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,860
Go to some of the schools here in Irving and watch the kids take out their little vials of liquor and put it in their orange juice.

724
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:59,780
Or go to some of the classrooms that one young lady told me that the marijuana that they smoke right in the classroom is so strong it makes her sick.

725
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,380
What do you think about that, friends?

726
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,060
You want to do something about it?

727
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,820
Read this book, Education Time Bomb, The Hate Factory.

728
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,140
Yee-haw!

729
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,440
Spare the whole bunch of books of subgenie.

730
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,400
Spare the rod.

731
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,080
This rod is spoiled.

732
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,240
Did you leave it out?

733
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,240
Are you going to leave it out?

734
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,920
These rods are always supposed to be refrigerated with the children.

735
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,800
Keep the children in the freezer.

736
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,140
Raise your children well.

737
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:29,800
Freezer.

738
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,680
And hard as well.

739
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,680
So they'll be frozen.

740
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,300
Then lose.

741
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,220
Clear as a bell.

742
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,020
Him on the floor.

743
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,820
He'll there no more.

744
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:38,620
And then he fell.

745
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,540
And half a dozen.

746
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,760
Don't you ever make them fry.

747
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,420
Just render them into lye.

748
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,300
I see the music has changed.

749
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,100
So we're going to have a wonderful, wonderful change.

750
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:50,920
Change of pace here.

751
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,140
Don't go to the movies.

752
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,420
Don't go in the barbershop.

753
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,600
Don't go near the cellar.

754
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,860
Don't do anything.

755
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,200
Just stay home and watch TV.

756
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,360
The new horror film.

757
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,140
I cut off your eyelid and stomped on it.

758
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,140
I spat on your grave.

759
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:09,900
I took your luggage for a long trip that you would never go on.

760
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:12,100
And I took down your storm windows.

761
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:18,880
I cut your eyelids off and then tied you down in a bathtub and administered a Chinese water torture

762
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:27,920
in which one drop of motor oil is dropped into one eye every other 30 minutes and one drop of shampoo is dropped into the other eye every other 30 minutes.

763
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:28,900
Thank you.

764
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:29,380
Thank you.

765
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:29,440
Thank you very much.

766
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,260
Well, that's got me beat, Hal.

767
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,680
But I think the Church of the Subgenius is basically a benevolent organization.

768
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:38,980
It's hideously loathsome baby sacrifices and sick or dark rituals notwithstanding.

769
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:46,620
But I don't think they've ever taken a person and not given them anything to eat for two weeks in a row.

770
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,340
And, uh...

771
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,540
That's pretty good.

772
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,780
That's a good idea.

773
00:42:50,980 --> 00:43:00,820
And then cut his leg off and had it prepared by French chefs and then forced him to eat himself slowly limb by limb until there was nothing left but a mouth and a stomach,

774
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:04,880
which he then turns inside out and he completely eats himself.

775
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,700
Now, we seem to have missed a point here.

776
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:17,320
And I thought we were going to present some more, show some more slides and get on to a little bit more of the investigation of the Church of the Subgenius.

777
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:25,180
Well, slide number 273 here depicts the motorcade in Dallas.

778
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:39,140
Dobbs, the bottom occipital third, the third of the occipital lobe of Dobbs is seen here flying out of the limousine and into the face of the escaping First Lady.

779
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,840
Kennedy sitting next to him appears to be laughing.

780
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,320
This is the footage before the CIA took the footage from him.

781
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:48,320


782
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,480
This is the footage from Abraham Zapruder.

783
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,660
Now, you can verify this footage for sure.

784
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,180
Certainly, now, this has not been tampered in any sort of way.

785
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,820
It has, in fact, been tampered.

786
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,740
Now, what we are presenting now is the original footage, 8mm footage, film shot by Abraham Zapruder.

787
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:14,200
Now, until today, it was assumed that computer imaging technology did not exist until the late 70s.

788
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,240
However, we find here that in 1963,

789
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:21,040
the CIA did, in fact, have a Super Mario paint set,

790
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,860
which they got from the Greys, a crude computer imaging,

791
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:30,240
which was used to change the pictures of puzzling evidence and Oswald

792
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:36,620
to make him appear to be holding that Stark Fist magazine and holding the large golf club in his backyard,

793
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:43,980
as well as the Zapruder film changed to show that the president was killed instead of Dobbs.

794
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,360
Now, I...

795
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,520
Now, after what you just said here, I would like to remind you of your own confidentiality.

796
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,340
I'll get an agreement that you have made here.

797
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:55,660
Now, we're not allowed to go too far into the, uh, the direction of the occipital lobe...

798
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,240
The truth has to be told. They can't leave the sinner in the car.

799
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,280
It was Dobbs in the limousine, in the motorcade.

800
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,940
Dobbs got shot, not only through the wrist, but through the head and the buttocks.

801
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:13,440
And, and, and, and John F. Kennedy is happily driving a taxi cab in Argentina and must be brought to justice.

802
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,080
And his, his...

803
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,480
...hussey of a wife, Marilyn Monroe.

804
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,080
It's the least we can do for Jackie's memory.

805
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,980
Oh, Jackie, Jackie, you were, you were so beautiful.

806
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,380
Senator John F. Kennedy.

807
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,140
Senator Reverend Stank Jesus.

808
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,360
Imelda, where are you?

809
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,720
Honey, man, I'm...

810
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,380
Oh, your shoes. Your shoes.

811
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,500
That little monkey of a husband of yours, he was...

812
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:43,180
He was nothing compared to you. He was sweet, but you were so much better, Imelda.

813
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:44,500
...live the way you make them.

814
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:48,560
I love when you take the plantains and cook them like that, Imelda.

815
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:54,200
I was the monkey man for you, Imelda. For you.

816
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,660
I love you, man.

817
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:00,000
Jackie Onassis. I wanna wear a pair of dark sunglasses.

818
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:05,540
Now, Senator Reverend Ivan Stank, you've mentioned that Jackie was receiving...

819
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:06,700
That's Senator Dr. Reverend Ivan Stank.

820
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,340
...several, several head doctors in Reverendry, Stank.

821
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:09,780
Several.

822
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,640
Several Stank and Rang.

823
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:15,340
That you said that Bob Dobbs was directed...

824
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:18,880
...to protecting the signals emanating from some extraterrestrial vessel...

825
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,000
...into Jackie's pillbox hat or something.

826
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:24,280
I don't know if I made that up or if that's really something that never happened.

827
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,260
Oh, Jackie had the implants.

828
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,320
Say, did somebody flip the tape?

829
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:28,280
Oh, my God.

830
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:28,900
I don't know.

831
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:32,600
Jackie flipped the implants. The tape. She took the tapes.

832
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,840
He took the... Jackie had the tapes.

833
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,240
Jackie had the tapes.

834
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:36,680
Give it out.

835
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,660
That's why Bob wanted to hit on her.

836
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,700
He was trying to protect Jackie, actually, by killing her.

837
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,700
To save the implant in her head.

838
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,580
Oh, my God.

839
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,060
Don't you just hate it when that happens, friends?

840
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:55,220
When your tape of the radio show runs out and...

841
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:59,160
You can see why I got concerned there, right in the middle of the recording...

842
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,520
...about flipping the tape.

843
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,040
I guess it got flipped pretty quick there.

844
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,060
Oh, listen to this in the background.

845
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,920
It's the scene from the movie Plan 9 from Outer Space.

846
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:31,660
It's a story in which one takes a week to figure out how to get back in the being and to the past,

847
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:32,620
and does theirений back wherever they've been for many years.

848
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,200
We're doing a full-length cover of our opening songs.

849
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:37,200


850
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:37,200


851
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,600
I was taking this one behind my spot until I found the clip from This is What I Should Do.

852
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,460
If you have a good swing out of it, I'd just let you in because this was just a good shot,

853
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:41,320
and you're not going to have time to start taste it with.....

854
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:56,260
Well, that's just amazing.

855
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:02,160
Ancient tapes of the great Joe Newman

856
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,080
doing more ancient tapes of the ancient tapes.

857
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,280
Let's turn on the TV for a change, okay?

858
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:11,200
It's the Kool-Aid Get Involved with America contest,

859
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,800
and we have our biggest wiener right here.

860
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,960
Here, welcome Mr. Don Pumphrey of Pine Harbor, Minnesota.

861
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,580
Well, I just can't believe it.

862
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:20,520
I can't believe that.

863
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,000
I've never won anything in my life.

864
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,020
Speak up, Don.

865
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,640
Let's stand over by the microphone.

866
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,420
Now, for your special grand prize.

867
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,320
I might have freed something once.

868
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,560
We're going to introduce you to our mystery surprise guest.

869
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:36,880
Don Pumphrey, meet Janer Hyperclete,

870
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,480
all the way from Little Rock, Arkansas.

871
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,400
Bet you weren't expecting to see him.

872
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:42,700
Well, I sure was.

873
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,500
I've never...

874
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,540
I've never been a part of a show

875
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:44,840
that's been so much fun.

876
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,440
I've never been a part of a show

877
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:46,440


878
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:46,480
I've never been a part of a show

879
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:46,480


880
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,920
But here he is, Janer Hyperclete.

881
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,320
Thanks, ladies and gentlemen.

882
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,840
Okay, now, how do I impersonate Janer Hyperclete

883
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,560
when I'm already doing a redneck voice?

884
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,300
Well, I hate to be the one to tell you,

885
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,500
but it's...

886
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,860
Well, let's just say,

887
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,260
it's not that hard.

888
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,640
Well, I do Janer better than anyone.

889
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,960
I figured I might as well cash in on it.

890
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,200
I can lick any man.

891
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:10,500
And you can get rid of ugly plaque

892
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,440
by running this wonderful sandpaper strip

893
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,280
between your choppers

894
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:13,760
just the way you want.

895
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:13,780
Ugly plaque.

896
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:14,100
Ugly plaque.

897
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:14,900
Is there any other kind?

898
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:16,760
Now, you know,

899
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,260
they asked me to be a guest host

900
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,340
on a Johnny Carson show,

901
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,600
but I had to turn it down.

902
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,040
Why was that, Clem?

903
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,280
They wanted our people

904
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,860
to supply the nitrous oxide

905
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:25,820
for Ed McMahon.

906
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:27,940
Wee-wee-wee-wee-wee.

907
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:28,680
Now, come on, people.

908
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:29,420
I'm serious.

909
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:29,980
Now, come on.

910
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:30,440
Give me a break.

911
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,380
Now, come on, people.

912
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:32,980
Now, no, no, no.

913
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,000
Did you hear the one

914
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:34,600
about the comedian

915
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,420
who just kept saying,

916
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,200
come on, people?

917
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,280
No, no, no.

918
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:37,960
And he kept saying,

919
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:38,980
no, no, no, no.

920
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:39,860
Now, give me...

921
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:40,520
Come on, people.

922
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:41,760
I paid money for this stuff.

923
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,760
Now, money is to burn, right?

924
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,860
Money is to burn.

925
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:46,800
Pick Dominica Honda

926
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,900
sock to boondlay to you.

927
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,860
I do, I do.

928
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:50,540
Yee-haw.

929
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:51,860
I was epistemizing

930
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:52,540
when Papa T

931
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:53,460
dropped his metallic.

932
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,420
The caller's really

933
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:56,600
getting into the swinging thing.

934
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,720
Keep those donations

935
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,520
flowing, ladies and gentlemen.

936
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,120
That's right, folks.

937
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,520
Send all your money to...

938
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,180
Dr. Hell.

939
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,520
Care of this station.

940
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,080
P.O. Box 140306

941
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,160

942
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,520
And if you have any

943
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,420
leftover for Jane or Hyperglyphs,

944
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:21,900
send it to...

945
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:22,740
Sounds fair to us

946
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:23,480
here on the show.

947
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,280
And remember,

948
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,140
there's still time

949
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:26,300
to make fast tracks

950
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,680
to that snack bar.

951
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:28,900
There's ten minutes

952
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,040
until showtime...

953
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:30,800
That's exactly right.

954
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,160
...is over.

955
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,900
You are about to experience

956
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:33,220
Now, be serious.

957
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:33,900

958
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:34,700
subgenius show.

959
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,320
Get serious and call.

960
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,340
The way it was made...

961
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:37,620
Come on.

962
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:38,140
Give me a break.

963
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:38,660
Give me a break.

964
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:39,680
Yes, friends.

965
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,360
A full-length subgenius show.

966
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:41,960
The way it was meant

967
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,400
to be heard,

968

Phineas Narco

993
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,680
and his Best of Subgenius tape.

994
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:27,740
Now that particular thing

995
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:28,580
was starring

996
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,460
Dr. Hal Robbins,

997
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,760
St. Jane or Hyperclites,

998
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:32,620
Puzzling Evidence,

999
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,020
and oh, who else?

1000
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:35,380
Was Papa Joe Mama in there?

1001
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,220
I don't know.

1002
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,960
But before that...

1003
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:40,660
I'm going to have to go

1004
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:40,740
to the bathroom.

1005
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:40,860


1006
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:40,860


1007
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:40,860


1008
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:40,860


1009
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:40,860


1010
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:40,860


1011
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:40,900


1012
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,260
We were listening

1013
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:44,140
to ESO Radio

1014
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:46,140
from WCSB Cleveland

1015
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,240
starring

1016
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,800
Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

1017
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,360
Chaz Smith,

1018
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,860
mixing away

1019
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,880
and

1020
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,460
providing

1021
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,920
background instrumentation.

1022
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:03,000
It was so nice

1023
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,280
to be in Cleveland again

1024
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,360
to generate

1025
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,320
lots and lots

1026
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:06,820
of that

1027
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:08,280
lonesome,

1028
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,300
sad tape.

1029
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:11,200
Oh my gosh.

1030
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,520
And it touches me

1031
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,340
to think of

1032
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,780
the Flying Lemur Bookstore,

1033
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:20,280
which was the twisted

1034
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,720
Steve Bevilacqua there

1035
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,040
at Flying Lemur

1036
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:24,800
was the sponsor

1037
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,740
of those shows

1038
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:28,020
there in Cleveland.

1039
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,660
The Cleveland...

1040
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,660
Flying Lemur Devival,

1041
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,480
you might call it,

1042
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,600
which was a swinging

1043
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,360
and wild, wild thing.

1044
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,040
And too bad the tapes

1045
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:38,640
didn't come...

1046
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:38,940
Well, actually,

1047
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,540
the tapes did come out

1048
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:40,880
over the weekend.

1049
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:40,880


1050
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,900
And we'll be listening

1051
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,020
to the live

1052
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,420
Lonesome Cowboy Dave

1053
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:47,680
and Reverend Stang

1054
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:48,740
and Chaz Smith

1055
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:49,860
and all them

1056
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:51,220
show

1057
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:52,480
at some point.

1058
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:54,140
Maybe coming up next.

1059
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,360
I don't know.

1060
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,280
Maybe next show.

1061
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,220
Yeah, maybe next show

1062
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:57,980
because we're still

1063
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,240
on the radio tonight.

1064
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,180
Let's not get back

1065
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:00,900
on stage

1066
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:01,860
yet.

1067
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,200
Yes, friends,

1068
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:06,320
those of you in Cleveland

1069
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:06,860
go down to the

1070
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:07,980
Flying Lemur Bookstore.

1071
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,740
It's a wonderful

1072
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:11,920
hangout

1073
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,360
as well as a place

1074
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,220
of forbidden knowledge.

1075
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:17,960
And we thank

1076
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:21,080
the good Dr. Steve Bevilacqua

1077
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,680
for setting that whole thing up.

1078
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:25,100
Oh, what was it?

1079
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,980
One of the folks on,

1080
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:28,960
I think,

1081
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,140
St. Louis du Chez

1082
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:33,820
on the alt.slack

1083
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:36,400
subgenius internet news group

1084
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,140
said of that devival,

1085
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:39,960
imagine,

1086
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:40,720
imagine,

1087
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,080
all the who's,

1088
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,760
imagine Whoville

1089
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,500
with a lot of LSD

1090
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,640
floating around.

1091
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,040
That was his

1092
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,620
capsule description

1093
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:52,720
of his first subgenius devival.

1094
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,080
Of course,

1095
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,600
he was speaking metaphorically,

1096
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:56,080
but there were some,

1097
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:56,960
shall we say,

1098
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
trippy videos

1099
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
being projected

1100
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,500
over some,

1101
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,680
some ugly ranters

1102
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:03,680
and musicians,

1103
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:04,780
I must say.

1104
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,560
It was pretty distorted looking.

1105
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,200
And there was a man

1106
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:09,960
making art

1107
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:10,600
out of,

1108
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,700
out of masking tape

1109
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,060
on the walls.

1110
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:13,860
He would make,

1111
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:14,460
he would form

1112
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,520
huge life-size silhouettes

1113
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,580
of rhinoceroses

1114
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,880
and hippies

1115
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,080
out of his masking tape

1116
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:21,740
on the wall.

1117
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:22,380
There were,

1118
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:23,500
there were people sitting around

1119
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,200
checking out mind machines.

1120
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,020
Well, it was just like the 60s, man.

1121
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,020
It was like a swinging,

1122
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:29,760
crazed

1123
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,140
frock test

1124
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:31,920
or something,

1125
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:32,940
something like that.

1126
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:33,500
But,

1127
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:33,980
but,

1128
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,120
but the sad thing is

1129
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,800
there's always that dark side,

1130
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:38,360
you know,

1131
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,580
that it always comes back.

1132
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,220
Let me finish my log here.

1133
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:44,580
Credits

1134
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:45,620
and

1135
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,160
devival

1136
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,020
detail.

1137
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:50,620
Maybe I should play some tapes

1138
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,660
of that devival.

1139
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:52,820
I think I will

1140
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:54,360
now that I've described it some.

1141
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:55,240
This is

1142
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,880
a live version

1143
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:58,840
of the

1144
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:00,660
frightening,

1145
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,860
lonesome cowboy Dave

1146
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,420
and Chaz

1147
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:04,120
and so forth.

1148
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:04,800
Although, gosh,

1149
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,540
with the time coming up,

1150
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,080
I should give some addresses.

1151
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,100
No, I'll do that later.

1152
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:10,520
Here's,

1153
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:10,720
here's the,

1154
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,700
here's the devival.

1155
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:13,520
Okay, now,

1156
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:14,960
I should specify

1157
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,220
that this is not actually

1158
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:17,760
the devival section

1159
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,920
of the devival.

1160
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:19,800
This isn't the preaching

1161
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,500
that's coming up,

1162
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:20,880
but it's the,

1163
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:22,380
it's our attempt

1164
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,040
to do the freeform radio

1165
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,080
right in front of everybody.

1166
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:27,120
And, well,

1167
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,680
that's why we use the videos

1168
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,660
to keep the audience distracted.

1169
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,080
It gives them something

1170
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,680
to look at while we set up.

1171
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,160
Einstein's secret orchestra

1172
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,260
is indeed secret.

1173
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,100
Oh, hold on.

1174
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:44,340
What am I doing here?

1175
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,080
What are these lights

1176
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:45,940
doing to my face?

1177
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,260
The last thing I remember,

1178
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,320
I was in seventh grade

1179
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,320
trying marijuana

1180
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,420
for the first time.

1181
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:53,660
What happened?

1182
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:54,980
Where's Dave?

1183
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,120
Dave.

1184
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,580
Dave, please reconsider.

1185
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,760
I'm frightened, Dave.

1186
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,560
This is the special

1187
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,240
Malaysian breast need baboon.

1188
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,540
He is playing.

1189
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:12,440
You can actually,

1190
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,720
when the knee breasts

1191
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,720
are lactating,

1192
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,420
you can milk them.

1193
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,680
They're tasty.

1194
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,480
You can actually milk

1195
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,580
the breast knees

1196
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:23,720
of the baboons

1197
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,080
in order to extract

1198
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,000
the, oh.

1199
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,280
It's hard, isn't it, to do?

1200
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:29,320
Like that?

1201
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:30,260
You have to go like this

1202
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:30,380
to extract the lactate.

1203
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:31,380
They never taught me that.

1204
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:32,560
Now, remember,

1205
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:33,060
you have to,

1206
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:35,780
these guys have never been

1207
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,120
on microphones before.

1208
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:38,420
They've been doing

1209
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:39,460
this radio show

1210
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,520
every Thursday night.

1211
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,060
They've been on WCSB

1212
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:43,660
by yelling at the top

1213
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:44,440
of their lungs.

1214
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:45,160
Yes.

1215
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,200
So loud that you could

1216
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:47,980
actually hear them

1217
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:49,100
through your radio speaker.

1218
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:50,160
Do I have a microphone on?

1219
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:50,920
Yeah, but you have to

1220
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,200
talk close to it.

1221
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:52,980
Poor Dave.

1222
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:56,000
It's going to be okay, man.

1223
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:56,480
It will be?

1224
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:56,840
Yeah.

1225
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:58,460
Just be yourself.

1226
00:56:58,760 --> 00:56:59,400
Just be yourself.

1227
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:00,140
Just be yourself.

1228
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,240
Oh, no.

1229
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:06,940
But it's the new Dave.

1230
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,120
He's been corrected.

1231
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:09,840
He's been washed

1232
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:10,360
in the pee.

1233
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:10,580
He's been washed

1234
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:10,620
in the pee.

1235
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:11,160
Bob, yes.

1236
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:12,960
And friend,

1237
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:13,900
you can be too.

1238
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,260
You know,

1239
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,120
you can just stand

1240
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,120
right in front of that

1241
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,320
mountain of slime.

1242
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,100
You could drain,

1243
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:22,440
yes,

1244
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,700
you could be the very drain

1245
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,360
of the commode.

1246
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,840
And Bob can be reached

1247
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,160
if you get your pencil

1248
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,820
and write this address

1249
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:39,920
on the envelope.

1250
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:42,380
That's Bob

1251
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:43,540
at

1252
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:46,140
P.O. Box

1253
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:50,380
140306

1254
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:52,360
Dallas, Texas

1255
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:56,880
75214

1256
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,640
Yes, for free information

1257
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,980
on the Church of the Subgenius

1258
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:03,000
so you can know

1259
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:03,960
when these horrible,

1260
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:05,860
confusing events

1261
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:06,940
are about to happen

1262
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:07,700
in your town.

1263
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:10,260
Send the self-addressed

1264
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:10,980
stamped envelope

1265
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:13,580
to Bob

1266
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:15,520
at P.O. Box

1267
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,160
14306

1268
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,260
Dallas, Texas

1269
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:20,460
75214

1270
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:22,300
or

1271
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,040
for that matter

1272
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:24,740
you can write to

1273
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,060
ESO Radio

1274
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:29,300
P.O. Box

1275
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:31,840
14776

1276
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,500
Once again, that's ESO

1277
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,340
who's been a big part of this particular

1278
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:37,440
subgenius show at P.O. Box

1279
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:39,560
14776

1280
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:42,000
44114

1281
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,040
and yes, so far

1282
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,400
we've only heard the setups

1283
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,420
before the ESO radio performance

1284
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:50,360
but you know, that's a part

1285
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,420
and parcel of any subgenius show

1286
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:53,860
really, we try to make the

1287
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:56,540
technical conundrums and setups

1288
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:58,740
why, just as creative as we can

1289
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:00,200
and they become

1290
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,100
quite outlandish indeed

1291
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,900
those technical problems do

1292
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,320
and in fact, that particular creative

1293
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,280
technical problem was I forgot to mention

1294
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,540
the city that...

1295
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,600
that ESO is located in

1296
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,860
they are in Cleveland, Ohio

1297
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:17,660
okay, okay, okay

1298
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:18,740
see, we, we

1299
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:20,240
see, I planned all that

1300
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,260
that was something that we have done

1301
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,340
that was part of the script

1302
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:24,700
um

1303
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:27,200
could you dim the lights a little bit

1304
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,140
so I don't get too nervous and be myself

1305
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:30,500
as the Reverend said

1306
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,720
I may have a problem with my

1307
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:32,640
holding my bladder

1308
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:35,240
for the past seven and a half years

1309
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:38,080
I've been out of mental institutions

1310
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:39,540
and as a person

1311
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:40,520
from a therapy

1312
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,920
they put me on a radio station

1313
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,700
uh, well, I guess we'll continue

1314
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,480
with that next week, dear friends

1315
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:49,500
and uh, in the meantime

1316
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,860
fight the real enemy

1317
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:52,940
fight the real enemy

1318
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:53,140
repent

1319
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:54,760
don't you want to be saved
