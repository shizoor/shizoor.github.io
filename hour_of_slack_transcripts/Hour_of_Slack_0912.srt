And now this.

92
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:19,080
Dear Dr. Vegetable, you know I've always heard that old thing about how the grass is greener on the other side of the fence.

93
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,560
Well I looked over my fence at my neighbor's yard and his grass is greener.

94
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,860
But then I went over to the neighbor's yard and he said, well I'm not getting any grass, I just got my grass.

95
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:23,860


96
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:23,860


97
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,920
were there and I looked from his yard at my grass and my grass was greener. Can you explain what's

98
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:35,980
going on here? Sign me perplexed in podunk. Well, I can tell you one thing for sure, French. When

99
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,960
you get a grass that's so green that all your neighbors look over it hoping for a brighter

100
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,300
future, when they all start pointing at your backyard or looking up at your garage area,

101
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,580
you've got more than a singular problem. It looks to me like you need to move away.

102
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:57,520
You need to move away to the blue hills of Venus. That's right, my friends. Take on an

103
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,640
entirely different new persona in another world itself. Next caller, I'm sorry.

104
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:09,580
Wow, I always wanted to take a Venus dream vacation, but you know, confidentially,

105
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,980
just between you and me, it's all those, well, you'd have to be near all those

106
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:20,020
vinooks, you know. And all those hundred foot tall women with the enormous decobs and the

107
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,480
long bobbed hair.

108
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:26,580
Well, they aren't like our kind, and I hear those bastards can fry you with their eyes.

109
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,040
Yes, that's true. They not only can fry you with their eyes, they can also smote you with

110
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,380
their ears. But the wavelength is so strong, it knocks a man down.

111
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,980
Bob, Bob, Bob.

112
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:01,420
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time. The touchdown brings me around again to find

113
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,060
I'm not the man they think I am.

114
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,660
Oh, no, no, no. I'm Bob.

115
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,120
So CIA leaks at the top levels of the white.

116
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,340
No, it's done more than leak on us, buddy boy. It's urinated on our standard of living.

117
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,420
What are they bitching about Clinton? Something about moral issues and stuff like that?

118
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,040
Yes.

119
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,260
Here we have now federal criminal espionage laws.

120
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,480
I did not grope that woman. I did not grope that woman.

121
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,200
The hypocrisy man. The liars.

122
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,800
Man, I'm telling you.

123
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,920
But you shouldn't have taken it so seriously.

124
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,400
I sneeze on your sleeve.

125
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,580
Thank you.

126
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,980
Wipe it off.

127
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,760
I wanna go back to...

128
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:48,400
His father, Arnold's father was a reptilian fast coat.

129
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,120
Adolf Schwarzenegger.

130
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,200
Adolf Schwarzenegger.

131
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,020
He was like an SS guard or something like that.

132
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,920
Yeah, he wore a little skull on his neck and he was a snappy and I don't know about that.

133
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,180
He was the courier for Grandpa Bush.

134
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,880
Between Grandpa Adolf and Grandpa Bush.

135
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,980
Yes, between the true Lord and the...

136
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,040
He was a true Nazi.

137
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,660
A Schmegma-Schmoker.

138
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,640
It wasn't like something that, you know, the tabloid is just sort of make up.

139
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,060
No, that's like real truth.

140
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,680
He shined up.

141
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,340
Come on, you guys.

142
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,560
You know it's not the Nazis that secretly run the world.

143
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,680
It's the Nazi Jews that secretly run the world.

144
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,680
That's right.

145
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,640
Or the Jew-Nazis.

146
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,740
I never have been able to figure out which it is.

147
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,560
But it's one of those two combinations of opposite...

148
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,180
Gay Jew-Nazis.

149
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,060
I think it's the Jew-Nazis.

150
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,540
Well, now it is the gay Jew-Nazis because of Hollywood and all that, you know.

151
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,380
The gay Jew-Nazis for Christ were the ones who started nuking the whales for us.

152
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,020
I mean, you know, on our behalf.

153
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,540
At our behest.

154
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,440
Hey, man, that's not PC.

155
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,220
Shove that in your pocket.

156
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,000
Don't talk about whales.

157
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,560
I know, that's very old and smelly.

158
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,540
But it is a true thing, you know.

159
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,960
And we're kind of grateful for it.

160
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,580
A little bit.

161
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,140
I mean, we.

162
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,340
I always say we when I don't know what I'm talking about.

163
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,460
You know, trying to get acceptance from others, you know.

164
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,340
Oh, we, we just had a sandwich and vomited all over the place.

165
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,700
We just rammed our heads through the window.

166
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,420
What?

167
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,940
The man I'm about to introduce.

168
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:21,520
His history goes back, back, back into the primordial ooze.

169
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,380
Of the church's inception.

170
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,920
This man has seen it all.

171
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,540
And he's done a great deal of it, too.

172
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,180
And he has found time to run a business.

173
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,280
Start a family.

174
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:38,920
Save the damsel in distress from the villainous machinations of a shadowy villain doing villainous

175
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,160
things.

176
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,640
Played convincingly by Christopher Walken.

177
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:43,980
Anyway.

178
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,880
Since this man was introduced to J.R. Bob Dobbs many, many years ago.

179
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,460
His life has been a series of ups and downs.

180
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,600
Ins and outs.

181
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,780
Forwards and backwards.

182
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,780
Overs and unders.

183
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,100
And many fascinating prepositions as well.

184
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,480
Yes.

185
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,440
This is a mensch.

186
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,060
This is a real man.

187
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,420
The one thing he can say about his life is it's not boring.

188
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:15,320
Well, except for last night when all he could talk about was, you know, what the young kids

189
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,980
listen to today and how things were great back in the good old days.

190
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,440
Now they don't do stuff like they did back then.

191
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,920
Blah, blah, blah.

192
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,200
Yackety, smackety.

193
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,160
But anyway.

194
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:32,240
This next guest, this first guest, this next great speaker comes to us at great expense

195
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,660
to you, the citizenry of Indianapolis.

196
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,840
But I ask you, what cost your soul?

197
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,060
What cost salvation?

198
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,220
$40!

199
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:42,900
$50!

200
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,240
All right.

201
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,460
You've been reading the literature.

202
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,120
Very good.

203
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,740
Very good.

204
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,000
All right.

205
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,320
Well, I'm going to ask you to open up your hearts, open up your minds, and open up your

206
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,980
wallets for the one, the only, Ivan Stein!

207
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,040
Praise God!

208
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:15,960
Praise God!

209
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,660
Praise fucking God!

210
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,680
God damn, Bob!

211
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,420
Oh, that's Bob, by the way.

212
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,380
That was Pope Fred.

213
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,060
Actually, I thought he was describing Bob when he was talking about the thing.

214
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,740
Although Bob's life never did have any ups and downs.

215
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,800
It only had ups.

216
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,420
Oh, well, it's so great to be in Indianapolis again.

217
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,580
You guys are the greatest, greatest crowd here in Columbus.

218
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,740
It's just...

219
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,120
What Pope Fred was saying was actually true.

220
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,720
I preached the word of Bob for more than 20 years now.

221
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:08,420
But friends, a lot of the time, I was preaching slack, but I wasn't getting slack.

222
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,840
It is about slack.

223
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,560
And the great thing about this religion is we won't tell you what it is.

224
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,500
We'll let you figure it out for yourself.

225
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:24,280
It's just a great pep talk to remind you that it really is there, but nobody else can tell

226
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,120
you what it is.

227
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,560
Now, here's what's really bad, though.

228
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,400
When you're...

229
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,840
And some of you may be in this boat right now, where you're thinking, well, you thought

230
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,300
you didn't have any slack.

231
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,620
It was...

232
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,680
Everything was almost unbearable.

233
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,840
You were considering suicide.

234
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,720
Just to...

235
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,660
Just to teach them a lesson.

236
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,760
And you were really slackless.

237
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:54,740
And then, something happens, and you found out you weren't slackless.

238
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,160
You did have slack.

239
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,560
You were just a spoiled punk and couldn't appreciate it.

240
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,180
That's bad.

241
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,920
When you find out, oh, shit, you mean that stuff I was so miserable with, that was slack?

242
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,800
Because now that it's gone, I'm really fucked up.

243
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:19,000
Now that I can't shit the number four on the list.

244
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:27,660
But what's really good is when you thought you did have slack, and then find out that

245
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,880
wasn't slack at all, because what you've got now is so much better.

246
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,400
That's the good part.

247
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,820
So, just assume that you have some slack now.

248
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,660
Try to figure out what it is before it's gone.

249
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,020
That's the tricky part.

250
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,960
But surely it is not the luck of the Irish to be so messed with by a bunch of narcos.

251
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,380
It's the luck of the Portuguese, lad.

252
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,920
Look at yourself, come here.

253
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,140
Oh, man of war.

254
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,000
You're not Irish.

255
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,700
Look at your wallet.

256
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,720
I mean, not your wallet.

257
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,740
You need to look at your wallet.

258
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:00,960


259
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,540
Look at your driver's license.

260
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,300
Not your wallet.

261
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,980
It comes from old country.

262
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,020
Really old country.

263
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,660
Yes.

264
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,600
The very oldest country.

265
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,600
I'm sorry.

266
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,660
Country number one.

267
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,100
Gondwana land.

268
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,300
Gondwana land.

269
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,580
The old country.

270
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,600
The lost city of Kor, up above the Arctic Circle.

271
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,820
Kurva, we lost again by the Arctic Circle.

272
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:31,540
Where she, who must be obeyed, holds court with her high priest, Calicrates, and surrounding

273
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:36,260
this high but completely isolated civilization are the submen.

274
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,060
The bongo thumping.

275
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,160
Ukabala pongas.

276
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,180
A sub gum.

277
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,420
Back.

278
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:45,820
Back.

279
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,100
Me want slack.

280
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,020
Slack?

281
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,840
You'll get slack but get back.

282
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:51,980
Slack.

283
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,680
Slack.

284
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:52,680


285
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,420
Slack now.

286
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:00,680
Friends, if you don't know, this could be your last chance to learn how to cure that

287
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,340
ailment.

288
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,920
How to get that job.

289
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,820
How to quit that job.

290
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,660
What do you mean, serious job?

291
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,040
Where's the job?

292
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,040


293
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,040


294
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,040


295
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,040


296
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,080
Where are the money you spare?

297
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:14,200
Where Uncle Bert left the money before he left town?

298
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,280
Come on, I know you want to know where the will is buried, the secret will.

299
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,340
Oh, there's another one.

300
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:26,900
I hope there's money in these things because the truth is never free, you see.

301
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,140
Information wants to be free, they say.

302
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,760
That's a lie, actually.

303
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:36,780
Information wants to make money for Bob Dobbs.

304
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,660
True words were never spoken, ladies and gentlemen.

305
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,740
And now we will essay to do a brief version of the nightclub act,

306
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,480
which is performed every Wednesday night in San Francisco at the Odeon Nightclub

307
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,920
at the intersection of Valencia and Mission Street.

308
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:06,120
We usually have mind-breaking special effects, eerie music, and confusing projections,

309
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,940
but this is the naked essence.

310
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,960
of our show.

311
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:17,340
Reverend Stang will read the questions, and I will essay to give you the answers.

312
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,600
So let's start.

313
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,320
Essay.

314
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,000
It was essay, actually.

315
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:28,140
To essay is to judge the value, and that we will try to avoid doing.

316
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,320
Speaking of value, Dr. Howell, what happens if these cheapskates don't even throw in the slightest gratuity?

317
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,000
Well, that is sad.

318
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,560
But I would not call them cheapskates.

319
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,100
They have already paid to get into this event.

320
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,620
Indeed, my conscience troubles me to ask for money at all,

321
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,140
except that it makes the question and answer process better.

322
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:56,200
Because when you ask the toothless old crone to tell your fortune,

323
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,900
you always cross her palm with silver.

324
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,720
This has a twofold purpose.

325
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,020
First, the toothless old crone can buy groceries.

326
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,800
They eat baby food.

327
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,400
But secondly,

328
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,300
you must value the question itself.

329
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:18,780
And there is nothing that shows that you value it more than that you are willing to part with a little bit of money.

330
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:25,220
Let's remember, money has no value, but we give it what value it has,

331
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,420
by believing in it and accepting it.

332
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,740
So there is the value in an exchange for an exchange.

333
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,280
Back in San Francisco, we treat money,

334
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,100
moneyless questions,

335
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,940
by answering it with the magic eight ball,

336
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,120
which, though always infallible,

337
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,720
gives answers which are terse and laconic,

338
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,180
and without the flowery elaborations we usually provide.

339
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,820
So, money or not, let's have the first question.

340
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,880
Dr. Howell, who put the con in Connie?

341
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,080
Well, that's a very good question.

342
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,840
Who put the con in Connie?

343
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:07,860
Well, Connie Gobs.

344
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:16,640
Well, Connie Gobs assumed her own position by that law of rightness and appropriateness

345
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,480
in which all things fall naturally into their proper order and place.

346
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:31,240
But there is no coincidence in that Connie and conspiracy begin with the first letters.

347
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,600
The first three letters.

348
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,260
You see, one must have intimate knowledge of the law of the universe.

349
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:37,580
The second letter is the law of the conspiracy.

350
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,060
In order to achieve one's full manhood as a subgenius.

351
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:48,560
And Constance Dobbs, in the great game of singularities and coincidences,

352
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,420
epitomizes this well.

353
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,540
That is some answer!

354
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,600
Thank you.

355
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,700
Well, in that case,

356
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,280
this other George here asks,

357
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:07,120
Will the power of slack rain dollars uncountable

358
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,140
upon all subgeniuses soon?

359
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,100
No!

360
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,940
Well, the term soon is relative.

361
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,540
When we think of geological time,

362
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,880
the slow movement of continents,

363
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:27,360
the great stately progress of glaciers down from their Arctic fastnesses,

364
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,620
and how the wind weathers away giant mountains

365
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:34,780
into single grains of sand, one grain at a time,

366
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,180
we can use the word soon,

367
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,240
in this context,

368
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,020
and be accurate and truthful.

369
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:45,900
But it will happen when we are expecting it least.

370
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,920
This is in all the holes that fill the holy books.

371
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,720
And we believe in it wholeheartedly.

372
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,060
At least I do.

373
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,320
And remember,

374
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,340
if you see a coin on the street

375
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,400
and bend over and pick it up,

376
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,120
this is a portion of money that is coming to you.

377
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,880
Because reality,

378
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,760
has a sinusoidal nature,

379
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,060
and moves in waves.

380
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,920
It is a wave form.

381
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,800
And what you see is a fractal piece

382
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,660
of what you may either avoid or take.

383
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,000
Now my good friend Ivan Stang found a $20 bill.

384
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,260
This means that this is the fractal portion,

385
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,220
the preliminary,

386
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:30,100
of a nice chunk of change that's coming his way.

387
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,820
It's happened to me too,

388
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,540
and it's always worked out.

389
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,980
The only problem is that as you,

390
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,660
for the rest of your life,

391
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,460
as you walk by that spot where you found the $20 bill,

392
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,860
you can't force your eyes not to look on the ground

393
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,200
for another $20 bill.

394
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,900
Which you think might be there.

395
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,460
And it might!

396
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,680
If some doofus who frequents that area loses a $20 bill,

397
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,300
he might be equally careless and lose another one.

398
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,840
So you really can't help doing that.

399
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,280
As a subgenius,

400
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,040
when I found that $20 bill,

401
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,120
I didn't look around for one more $20 bill.

402
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,660
I looked around for a busted open gunny sack

403
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,700
of $20 bills dropped by a fleeing bank robber.

404
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,400
And if you don't look,

405
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,620
you're not going to find it.

406
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:15,820
That's right.

407
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,740
No, remember all the cash in the room!

408
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,680
Alright, the next question.

409
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,300
Uh, this one is signed,

410
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,660
and I'm going to give the name at the end.

411
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,020
That's fine, we like that.

412
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,060
We like that.

413
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:31,360
Why does my penis make a whistling sound

414
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,860
when I masturbate?

415
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,560
Asks...

416
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,960
David Capuro, girls.

417
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,540
David Capuro?

418
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,300
Is he really here?

419
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,480
There's a David Capuro who signed this.

420
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,540
Well, in San Francisco, there is a David Capuro

421
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,580
who is a yo-yo master.

422
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,280
He's a specialist in the manipulation of the yo-yo,

423
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,360
which in the Philippine Islands,

424
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,440
back in the day, was a deadly weapon.

425
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,240
But David Capuro wiggles his yo-yo

426
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,980
for the edification and amusement of the crowd.

427
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,720
But he always does seem to ask questions about his penis,

428
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,500
which makes me think he might actually be there.

429
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,160
Well, let's examine this question closely.

430
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,340
Why does my penis make a whistling sound when I masturbate?

431
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,620
Well, David, if it is you and you are here,

432
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,820
have you ever tried a simple experiment

433
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,920
of putting a hot dog or a sausage

434
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,780
in the microwave oven and turning it on?

435
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,180
If you listen closely,

436
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,960
you may hear a plaintive whistling sound.

437
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:37,140
As this piece of beef is brutalized

438
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,820
by the bombardment of microwave radiation.

439
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:46,380
Your organ, David, under too much self-stimulation,

440
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,440
may make a similar cry for help.

441
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,600
You need to learn to love yourself

442
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,960
not only wisely, but well.

443
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,580
Of course, I'm speaking of subgeniuses here,

444
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,420
and I know a great many of them, us,

445
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,240
qualify for frequent masturbator miles.

446
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,820
Too much is always better than not enough.

447
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,960
But I would say that a slight amount of care

448
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,300
will eliminate this annoying whistling,

449
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,260
and the fact that you choose to encapsulate it in the question

450
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,040
shows that the question is important to you

451
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,780
and that you have the stamina, the wherewithal,

452
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,180
and the get-up-and-go to take this edge

453
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,440
off your usual pleasurable practice.

454
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,840
Praise Bob and the whistling penis!

455
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,520
And the whistling wiener.

456
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,680
You should try this experiment of putting a hot dog

457
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,560
in the microwave oven.

458
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,820
It almost sounds as if it's trying to tell you something

459
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,720
with its whining and high-pitched cries.

460
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:50,440
How can I get the microwave oven door closed on my...

461
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,560
No, not yours.

462
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,080
On a sample.

463
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,800
A stand-in.

464
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,600
A succadenaeum, as it were.

465
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,220
Anyway, all right, here are two questions.

466
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,000
All right.

467
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,980
Both paid for, by the way.

468
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:02,400
Excellent.

469
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,520
Why do I have this feeling,

470
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,120
asks Reverend Sun Moon-Dude,

471
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,600
why do I have this feeling that everyone is insane

472
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,420
and I'm a damn idiot?

473
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,060
No, you're not.

474
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,100
Why do you have this feeling?

475
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:18,940
Let's see it.

476
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:22,640
Why do I have this feeling that everyone is insane

477
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,520
and I'm a damn idiot?

478
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,320
Well, Reverend Sun Moon-Dude,

479
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:32,240
perception is what all your organs do.

480
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,960
It's what you do simultaneously

481
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,380
to bring you a picture of the world.

482
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,040
And when you are in good health,

483
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,160
that picture is relatively flawless.

484
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,460
There are some things that human intelligence

485
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,220
and human perspicacity

486
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,280
can never really pick up on.

487
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,280
Strange vibrations and radiations

488
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,400
just beyond the ability of human perception.

489
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,600
But if you properly form a gestalt

490
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,300
with all your senses,

491
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,200
you will receive an accurate picture.

492
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,920
And you are doing this

493
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,040
because everyone is insane

494
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,700
and you are a damn idiot.

495
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,820
God damn it.

496
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,320
Well, I'm sorry,

497
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,460
but the second part of this question was,

498
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,340
if your answer is,

499
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,600
because everyone is insane

500
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,940
and you are a damn idiot,

501
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,120
then I want my five dollars back.

502
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,840
And then it says this will be worth

503
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,300
a million dollars someday.

504
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,060
Well, unfortunately,

505
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,800
this second part does not have

506
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,220
the interrogative quality

507
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,360
which makes it a question.

508
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,900
It is a statement,

509
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,700
what we call a side note or a footnote,

510
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,400
and though interesting,

511
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,320
cannot regrettably be acted upon.

512
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,380
Oh, my gosh.

513
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,140
Yes.

514
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,520
When is there going to be another DeVival?

515
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,120
Ah, when is there going to be another DeVival?

516
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,440
Hopefully around November 14th.

517
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,160
Around November 14th.

518
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,740
Keep watching the area.

519
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,560
What did you say?

520
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,360
And the location?

521
00:25:59,680 --> 00:25:59,980
What?

522
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,100
What should the location be?

523
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,980
Let's look through the mists of time

524
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,000
and see what the location of the DeVival is.

525
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,740
Could it be the Beachland Ballroom?

526
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,260
The Beachland Ballroom.

527
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,020
Was it the Beachland Tavern?

528
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,840
The Beachland Tavern,

529
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,240
the little old tavern on the beach.

530
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:18,980
Wonderful.

531
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,080
Well, good to know.

532
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,300
All right.

533
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,580
Death before dishonors,

534
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,380
drugs before lunch.

535
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:22,640
Later.

536
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,700
That's right.

537
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,780
Enjoy a work-free drug place.

538
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,720
Yeah, actually,

539
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,080
it's kind of funny.

540
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,760
We actually transmitted some information,

541
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,140
and it feels kind of good, you know?

542
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:31,440
It does feel good.

543
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,440
I feel a little bit cleaner now.

544
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,220
It feels really good.

545
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,020
The first DeVival I ever went to, actually,

546
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,680
was at the Euclid Tavern,

547
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,480
and I had a pretty good night, actually.

548
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,780
I got picked up that night.

549
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,040
Well, you know, Euclid looked on Beauty Bear.

550
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,760
What did you get picked up for?

551
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,800
Not picked up for, picked up by...

552
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,660
He was picked up for indolence, intransigence,

553
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,400
and inefficiency.

554
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,000
It was kind of crazy, actually.

555
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,940
I never expected...

556
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,680
You see, it really works, folks.

557
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,480
...that I'll promise to join our church,

558
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,260
and you will get laid.

559
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,840
I never expected that to be true.

560
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,180
It really does happen.

561
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,780
We offer benefits that no other religion can provide.

562
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,780
I can show you too many details.

563
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,080
I know too many details.

564
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,900
You have read the literature.

565
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,640
Oh, yes, and the pleasure saucers, and...

566
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,280
You do follow the controversy.

567
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,280
Y'all boys are wild.

568
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,440
I've been listening in.

569
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,620
You guys, you guys are special.

570
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,340
Thank you.

571
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:23,720
Wow.

572
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:23,780
Wow.

573
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,880
We're special.

574
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,540
Yes, they call me Special Ed.

575
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,280
We're special.

576
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,460
Wow.

577
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,840
That made my night to have a total stranger say that we're special, actually.

578
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:35,640
Well, we are.

579
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,200
We're each and every one of us.

580
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,180
We're special in here.

581
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:38,660
I wish I could work with you, maybe.

582
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,140
I don't think you need to say it.

583
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,120
I think y'all know already.

584
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,820
I think y'all know you're special.

585
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:49,560
Well, just don't lose your specialness on this special evening.

586
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,520
Please?

587
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,520
We are all special.

588
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,320
Oh, yeah.

589
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:55,940
We are special.

590
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,360
I'll have the special, too.

591
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,560
I ordered the special.

592
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,040
You ordered the special today, too?

593
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,340
I ordered the special, yes.

594
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,480
I'm still waiting.

595
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,300
We are all too special.

596
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,160
Sorry, I'm a too much on the back of the kitchen.

597
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,600
We are all too special, for we are all each one part of this whole universe.

598
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,480
We'll have two more specials, then.

599
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,420
And the universe will not be the same.

600
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:19,320
Just concentrate on the pure, bright, white light of imbecility.

601
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,500
Actually, I maintain that the birth of any person, uh, is a birth of a person.

602
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:22,500


603
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:22,500


604
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:22,500


605
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:22,500


606
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:22,500


607
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:22,500


608
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,420
It diminishes the value of all other persons.

609
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,900
Particularly the lower births.

610
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,720
Always try to get the upper birth.

611
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,840
Because, you know, it's just a matter of supply and demand, and human life has...

612
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,300
Or the afterbirth.

613
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,920
We had that special show on Ant-Man's birthmarks in Vivid Technica.

614
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,260
That's so tasty.

615
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:36,260


616
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,080
Okay, seven billion people on Earth.

617
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,520
How much, uh, how much is that per person?

618
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,520
How much is life worth?

619
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,520
Twenty-nine ninety-five.

620
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:43,980
I don't know.

621
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,340
What is the global per capita income on average?

622
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,620
That's something I never see.

623
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,820
Like, uh, you know, you see it for countries, but I wonder what it is globally.

624
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,480
Well, I don't know.

625
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:52,480


626
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:52,480


627
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:52,480


628
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:53,780
It's just a matter of supply and demand.

629
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,380
And can that even be a measure of the...

630
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:55,920
Well, I don't know.

631
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,320
Basically, it's just a supply and demand issue.

632
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,080
Human life...

633
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,780
Isn't that what we said last night?

634
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,180
Think globularly, act loco?

635
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,280
There's a colloquium.

636
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:03,480
Oh, yes.

637
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,560
I think the supply of human life value is the demand.

638
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,380
I'm sorry, cut.

639
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:09,760
Speak up.

640
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,260
What if you're a person who's special and it's really a demand for you?

641
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,240
Oh, man.

642
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,180
That's, that's something, too.

643
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,280
Some people, you know, some people are not that special.

644
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:17,780
Yeah.

645
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,800
And there ain't no demand for them.

646
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,180
But if you're special, you gotta be more valuable.

647
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:22,460
Yeah.

648
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:22,460


649
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,580
Because it's a demand for you.

650
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,300
Yeah.

651
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:30,160
Well, then you have to spread the specialness around into every crack and crevice and crevice.

652
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,340
Every crack and crevice.

653
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,180
Buttered up with specialness.

654
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,620
The supply of life outweighs the demand.

655
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:43,220
Too many people are following the story of Onan and not laying their seeds still because

656
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,880
they don't want to piss off God.

657
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,900
Pulling out does not work.

658
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,740
Because, you know, God laid the smack down on Onan after he pulled out.

659
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,480
You know, all he's doing is...

660
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,240
You know, all he's doing is...

661
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,500
All you public teenagers can't be wrong.

662
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,320
He's practicing...

663
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,480
Unless they're talking about pulling out.

664
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:59,000
He's practicing contraception, not self-abuse.

665
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,420
So Onan is tarred with the brush right from the start.

666
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:11,580
Unfairly charged with a crime he did not commit, although there was reason for God to be quite

667
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:17,980
angry with him and to hurl a thunderbolt which reduced him to a tiny grease spot in the margins

668
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,840
of the Bible.

669
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,300
God fucks us all in the end.

670
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:26,360
There we go, those seven magically malign words.

671
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,760
But that's what they say.

672
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,020
It is painful to come into this world and painful to leave it.

673
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:39,140
And in a blaze of irritable ouchness we live our lives.

674
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,600
That's true.

675
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,480
Unless you die in your sleep.

676
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:48,820
Well, we can't sleep now, but we can answer your questions if you want to call in and...

677
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:52,560
We'll do our best to tell you the answers to the things that are troubling you.

678
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,020
We've got a panel of experts up here.

679
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,420
Any question...

680
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,820
A church service...

681
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,520
Is possible.

682
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,180
There is no question off limits.

683
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,460
Provided by this radio station and the Church of the Subgenius.

684
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,180
Just think, any question.

685
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,760
For example, you might want to know how much the earth weighs or something like that.

686
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:16,060
So just call in and we'll tell you.

687
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:16,880
Actually, hey.

688
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,920
I think we're gonna take another call here.

689
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,640
You're gonna have to...

690
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,520
I'll show you my bacon.

691
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,140
I have a question.

692
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,560
Ask your question.

693
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,320
How much does Bob weigh?

694
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,280
Ooh, how much does Bob weigh?

695
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,620
There's a question for you, Dr. Howell.

696
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:36,880
Can Bob lift... make himself so fat that he cannot lift himself?

697
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,400
I think that...

698
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,340
I'm gonna guess before you answer.

699
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:39,860
Well, all right.

700
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,040
You're welcome to do that.

701
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,220
Guess Bob's weight.

702
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:48,340
My guess is that Bob travels at the speed of light and therefore his mass is infinite.

703
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:48,620
I'm gonna guess.

704
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,880
Well, if Bob were to do that...

705
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,760
Yes, but we're talking about Bob at rest.

706
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,220
Ooh, no, no.

707
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,440
Oh, look, the collar hung up.

708
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:56,680


709
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,240
I was going to say 265 pounds, too.

710
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,140
Well, that's just one of those mysteries.

711
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,020
Who's still with us?

712
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,220
I'm here.

713
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:05,500
I'm here.

714
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:09,260
Having a signal interruption, a little bit of difficulty.

715
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:18,140
You see, part of Bob's makeup is heavy matter from extrasolar planets, which, like deuterium,

716
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:18,620
is the...

717
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:18,620


718
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:18,620


719
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:18,620


720
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:18,620


721
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:18,620


722
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:18,620


723
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:18,620


724
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:18,620


725
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:18,620


726
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:18,620


727
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:18,620


728
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,640
is quite compressed, like the heart of a neutron star.

729
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,240
But a far more significant puzzle in the annals of the subgenius is the search for the missing

730
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,640
artifact, the holy grail of the Church of the Soul Genius, the scissors of sight.

731
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:39,960
What we need is to locate the famous scissors of sight, and we are stumped, since the true

732
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,300
scissors have been lost to mutant kind for many centuries.

733
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,180
In a private letter, Reverend Ivan Stang, I will now quote him, said,

734
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,600
No man to be found.

735
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,060
No man today has those scissors.

736
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:55,740
He also said that the scissors were most likely created from the remains of a huge Atlantean

737
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:01,960
crystal, the misuse and subsequent explosion which caused that continent to sink with a

738
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,480
watery splash beneath the waves.

739
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:10,300
As the Atlanteans were major contributors to the gene pool that eventually produced

740
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:15,560
the subgenius race, it does seem plausible that rather than trying to rebuild the lost

741
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,580
empire, the remaining Atlanteans would instead be the ones who would be the ones to be found.

742
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,160
The only thing that is more likely to happen is that the scissors were used to create the

743
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:26,380
power icons, before tragically diluting their seed, like Onan, by cross breeding with ancient

744
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,940
pink human slave tribes they themselves had helped to create.

745
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:36,160
It is from this distant epoch, 80 to 79 million BC, that the scissors and many other powerful,

746
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,020
but little known, sur dure perceives originate.

747
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,060
I hope you have been satisfied by this answer to your question.

748
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,820
Friends, George Bush wanted a faith-based religion.

749
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,580
Fuck religion!

750
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,500
Fuck the faith-based religion!

751
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,680
We need a face-based religion!

752
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,900
And this is the face to base your religion on!

753
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,700
Why?

754
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,980
Why should you worship Bob?

755
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,260
That's the dumbest question in the world.

756
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,040
The answer is, because!

757
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,680
That is the answer!

758
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,280
Why should you worship Bob?

759
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,100
Because!

760
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,780
Bob is coming!

761
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:17,580
Bob!

762
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:18,700
Bob!

763
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,440
Is!

764
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,560
Coming!

765
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,960
I'm actually excited about the new $20 bill coming out this fall.

766
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,680
The one with the peekaboo view of Andrew Jackson.

767
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:29,820
Oh yeah.

768
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,420
Like the fashion 20?

769
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,220
Oh yeah, it's multi-colored.

770
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,140
You can hold them up to the light.

771
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,800
They fluoresce and you can hear a little tune played.

772
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:40,140
All to defeat the scourge of counterfeiting.

773
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,920
Mammon comes in pretty colors now.

774
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,200
When are they going to come out with those Tamagotchi bills you have to feed and care

775
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,800
care for as long as you have them.

776
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,860
Oh Lord, another responsibility.

777
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,920
The future was supposed to be easier.

778
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,380
I don't understand why we have to make everything harder and harder.

779
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:01,520
Like to operate your telephone, you need an instruction manual thicker than a phone book.

780
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,200
Far larger than the actual telephone.

781
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,760
Well, this isn't the way Hugo Gernsback said it would be.

782
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,660
No kidding.

783
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,800
The only thing that really is up to snuff in the future is special effects in movies

784
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,780
about the future.

785
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,720
Oh, those are way better than I ever expected to live to see.

786
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,820
I don't agree with that actually.

787
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,160
Really?

788
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,080
I mean, some of them are pretty good, but...

789
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,760
Oh, you're a kid.

790
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,300
You don't know.

791
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,880
When you were young, Dr. Hall and I had to live...

792
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,480
We were weaned on Ray Harryhausen movies.

793
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,140
On the analog special effects.

794
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,060
Depends on how far back you're talking.

795
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:32,760
You are on the air.

796
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,820
Hey, can you guys play the Savage Revenge of Helen Keller?

797
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:42,340
I wonder what Helen Keller would think of that music if she were alive.

798
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,040
She could sense the vibration.

799
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:44,720
She would be able to hear it.

800
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,020
She would be able to hear her skin.

801
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,340
Well, it might give her a good gut feeling.

802
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,020
Yeah.

803
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,360
Yeah, she was a filthy commie actually.

804
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,620
It's something they don't really teach you in history class.

805
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,240
I was aware that she was a very angry child.

806
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,180
Enlightened and progressive individual.

807
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,300
Into polyamory way ahead of her time.

808
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,720
She could take on whole teams of her cricket players.

809
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,320
She was very violent.

810
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,040
Had cricket lighters.

811
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,560
But these days...

812
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,440
She liked to break things.

813
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,420
Well, it's only records.

814
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,800
Because of course she couldn't hear them.

815
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,700
She would always fall and...

816
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,800
But she did learn to communicate.

817
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,140
And to become a writer.

818
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,500
Whose words reached millions.

819
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,120
People used to trip her a lot.

820
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,440
No, no one would do that.

821
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,700
Because they liked the old girl.

822
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,200
Tired to string her together.

823
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,060
They liked her, you see.

824
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,200
She had that quality of likability.

825
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,400
And so you'd just like her and that was that.

826
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:43,420
Unlike some...

827
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,580
Like some people.

828
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,060
When you see them, well, you have the opposite.

829
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,620
I think I'm one of those people.

830
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,420
With the woeful countenance.

831
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,320
Listen, I hope...

832
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,020
They call it the mark of Cain.

833
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,100
God's brand.

834
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:59,460
To show the incipient evil.

835
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,760
I think I got that.

836
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,000
It's written as plain as day.

837
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,140
Right on your forehead.

838
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,220
As large as life.

839
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,800
As big as a barn door.

840
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,740
And there's no way you can scrub it off.

841
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,040
Neither.

842
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:16,140
Now I don't know if I've even come close to answering your question.

843
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,740
But you are connected and you have a chance to ask a question.

844
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,300
So...

845
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:19,660
Hello?

846
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,560
So ask if you have the stamina.

847
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,260
Oh.

848
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,640
Well, I guess the caller doesn't want to ask a question.

849
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:33,580
Nonetheless, like a green shoot of a plant that only blooms every 100 years.

850
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:40,620
This brief interval is open to those who want to ask questions and will receive answers.

851
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:45,460
Of course, I have to say I don't claim to have any supernatural powers.

852
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:50,520
But you might be surprised at how I resolve your uncertainty.

853
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:58,280
And tell you that the keys that you lost are in the left hand of the top drawer of the chest of drawers in the garage.

854
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,740
We make absolutely no claims to the accuracy of these answers.

855
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,780
But we do have answers.

856
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,540
We have answers aplenty.

857
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,440
What we don't got is questioners.

858
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,620
So come on, you sons of...

859
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,460
You sons of...

860
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,180
I won't even say what you all are.

861
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,540
You just don't have it.

862
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,800
Who's gonna fight the next war?

863
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,380
By God.

864
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,060
Dr. Howell, where is Uncle Wilbur's real will?

865
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,640
Well, now, I'm glad you asked me that question.

866
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:31,080
Of course, the will that was probated is everyone's idea of the real will.

867
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:38,380
But just between you and me and the gate post, there is an opportunity to retrieve another will.

868
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:43,320
So I'll see you about that opportunity when we're off the air and we can do a little bit of private business.

869
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,140
Yes, we got a live one here.

870
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,420
All right, speak your mind.

871
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,080
What isn't Bob?

872
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,100
What isn't Bob?

873
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,740
What isn't Bob?

874
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,060
What isn't Bob?

875
00:38:54,460 --> 00:39:00,940
Well, every piece of hair tearing tension and back breaking strain.

876
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,840
Everything that's scratchy, itchy and unpleasant.

877
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,160
Everything that's gritty, smelly.

878
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,360
Slimy and scummy.

879
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,700
That is the non slackful essence of the non Bob.

880
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,540
The domain of the being we call, when we have to speak his name at all, Neegi.

881
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,980
Oh, he's a little bit of a...

882
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,000
Interesting.

883
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,680
And you made us mention him.

884
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:30,340
You know, the thing is on the radio, what you talk about, you see in your mind's eye.

885
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,820
So now we're all looking at Neegi.

886
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,240
Thank you very much.

887
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,560
You're certainly not welcome.

888
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,340
Or you are.

889
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,200
Oh, stop it.

890
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,680
Oh, look what you've done.

891
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,240
I'm going to start a stick up here, man.

892
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,560
They're up chucking on the board here.

893
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:42,920
Oh.

894
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,080
Well.

895
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:47,880
Well, maybe you have another question which will make up for your last one.

896
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,960
Are you holy?

897
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,160
Well, this is a high holy day, so, hi.

898
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:03,920
Yeah, we are holy in that the word of Bob, the pollen of Bob, brushes off on our clothing

899
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,300
and makes us have a little of that insectoid Dobbs glimmer.

900
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,140
Hmm.

901
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,260
I just meant, do you have holes like the Swiss cheese?

902
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,940
We could turn off the lights in this studio and we could still see.

903
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,100
Let's put it that way.

904
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:17,960
Interesting.

905
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,280
Interesting.

906
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,900
I actually meant, I wanted to know if you had holes like Swiss cheese.

907
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,700
Well, I do and so do you and so does every man.

908
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,140
They're called pores.

909
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,100
Pores.

910
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:33,360
And through these holes, the skin breathes a hearty breath.

911
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,120
But why can I not see them?

912
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,240
Well, you can if you employ a simple magnification device.

913
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,060
Interesting.

914
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,180
I've never heard of this before.

915
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:43,660
Just believe us.

916
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,760
You don't have to.

917
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,480
You don't have to.

918
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,580
You don't need any evidence.

919
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,840
You don't need that scientific mumbo jumbo.

920
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,300
Proof.

921
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:49,420
Proof.

922
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:49,940
Proof.

923
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,360
You need to learn how to respect.

924
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,100
How did you know his name was Jimbo?

925
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,740
Authority figures and the words they tell you.

926
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,040
You need to learn how to take it.

927
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:03,340
But I fear that, like, in my personal flack, respect, it's not a good thing.

928
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:03,340


929
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:03,340


930
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,820
It causes me to go against my flack.

931
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:09,580
Well, the skin is to a limited degree porous.

932
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:13,580
On the other hand, it's a very good protector and keeps anything from penetrating.

933
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:19,340
So it's only penetrable on the micro level to a certain insignificant depth.

934
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,420
So don't worry about those little holes.

935
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,480
There's plenty to worry about in this world.

936
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,040
But the skin holds us back.

937
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:33,340
You know, one of the most horrible things the conspiracy ever did to us was, you know,

938
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:33,340


939
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:39,280
making it such that over a phone line and a radio broadcast and, you know, words kind

940
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:39,880
of get mumbled.

941
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:45,420
To say that, give me slack, it kind of almost sounds like give me flack, if you say it fast enough.

942
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,500
Oh, no, no, we don't want that.

943
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,360
That was a terrible thing to say.

944
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,540
The flub genius must be lax.

945
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:50,980
Yeah, there you go.

946
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,760
See how easy it is to misinterpret these essential slogans.

947
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,500
So listen carefully and we will attempt to transmit loud and clear.

948
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,320
Did he say there must be flack?

949
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:03,880
Yes, flax.

950
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,660
It's good for you, man.

951
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,500
That's got all the omega-3 fatty acids you need.

952
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,300
And lanolin, sheep oil.

953
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,940
It's better for you than the competition.

954
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,280
I warned you of that.

955
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:21,140
Now, if you want to ask one more question, we can squeeze you in.

956
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,920
We could squeeze you into a lot of places, man.

957
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,120
I've been squeezed into very uncomfortable places before.

958
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,240
Yes, all right.

959
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,780
Well, thank you for that thought.

960
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,960
And how about that question?

961
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:33,220
Yeah.

962
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,620
I have no more questions.

963
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,280
I think that you've answered everything and nothing.

964
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:39,260
So you're complacent and absolutely satisfied with things as they are?

965
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,340
I'm never satisfied and I always will be.

966
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:47,020
Well, then you seem to have achieved the slack essence on your own.

967
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,060
And we can do nothing more for you.

968
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:49,620
Thank you.

969
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,360
That will be $30.

970
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:51,940
$30?

971
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:58,080
Yes, that's how much you'd pay, you know, a couple of nights eating out and it would

972
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:58,560
be gone.

973
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,720
But here you pay for your subgenius essence.

974
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,860
That'll be with you always.

975
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:03,920
Believe me.

976
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,300
I have so much slack that I don't have $30.

977
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,040
It's slacked right out of my pocket.

978
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:13,840
Oh, well, it's unfortunate because you have set in motion what we sometimes call the Omega

979
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,080
Contingency Plan.

980
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:16,900
Oh, dear.

981
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:23,840
But if you'll send in the $30, we can easily turn even these cruel things aside.

982
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,940
I forgot about the Omega Contingency Plan.

983
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,620
It's mentioned, though, in the official recruitment.

984
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:29,380
It sounds apocalyptic.

985
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,840
We never should have even started that whole thing.

986
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,960
Omega Contingency Plan.

987
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:40,080
I know, but when they don't send $30, it's like the tumblers of a lock moving inexorably

988
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:40,640
into position.

989
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:41,920
It just happens.

990
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,340
It's like the bombers that have been sent to destroy the world not being able to be

991
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,680
called back because of a fail-safe point.

992
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:54,840
Yes, certain ignorant folks think that you can call those bombers back, but once set

993
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,660
in motion, they will do their job.

994
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,060
I kid you not.

995
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,820
But I'm sure nobody wants to think about that at this point.

996
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:03,680
Right.

997
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,880
It's all right.

998
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:28,380
I don't know what you're all곤

999
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:29,440
Okay.

1000
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,620
None of our nerd groups don't mind doing that, and like I said, they don't mind

1001
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:30,620


1002
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:30,620


1003
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:30,620


1004
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,460
Oh, it's not that sonic, escape is better.

1005
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:32,460


1006
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:32,460


1007
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:32,460


1008
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:32,520
It wasn't me, sir.

1009
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:32,520


1010
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:32,520


1011
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:32,520


1012
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:32,520


1013
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:32,520


1014
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:32,540
You're right, sir.

1015
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:32,540


1016
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:32,600
Thank you, sir.

1017
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:32,780


1018
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:32,800
Now then, judges, if you can put your...

1019
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,440
To deny me of the cross I bear

1020
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,080
That you gave to me

1021
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,000
And I'm here

1022
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,920
To remind you

1023
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,680
Of the mess you left

1024
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,240
When you went away

1025
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,180
It's not fair

1026
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,980
To deny me

1027
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,840
Of the cross I bear

1028
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,540
That you gave to me

1029
00:44:58,700 --> 00:44:59,300
You

1030
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,620
Wanna know why

1031
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:12,460
Oh, here comes the polka music.

1032
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:17,620
Oh my goodness, this is from Final Fantasy IV.

1033
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,180
Ah, when I was a young man

1034
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:24,460
I used to put on big, heavy, heavy shoes

1035
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:27,480
Much bigger than my actual size.

1036
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,700
When I get to heaven

1037
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,000
Gonna put on my shoes

1038
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,720
Walk down to the river

1039
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,980
Gonna stomp all over God's heaven

1040
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,260
Concentrate on

1041
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:38,080
A life that maybe I might have lived

1042
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:42,140
Perhaps if I had known what to do

1043
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:45,820
I'd been confused for so long now

1044
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:48,420
I'd throw those shoes in the river

1045
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,920
And stand back and laugh

1046
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,060
And if I could find them now I'd

1047
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:53,620
Be of stout heart

1048
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,700
I'd drink too much of that

1049
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,860
To have it anywhere near where

1050
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,520
What now?

1051
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,300
Well, you could throw them up over the telephone lines

1052
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,120
Near a kid's school in a drug-free zone

1053
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,760
And they'd see those big clodhoppers hanging up there.

1054
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:14,800
But I take it that you're not that kind of American.

1055
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:17,040
Yeah, well, I'm not that kind of

1056
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,540
Of tishnick creep.

1057
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,700
I don't believe in the doodads and sandwiches

1058
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:22,360
I'm a full-blooded

1059
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,080
That's right, you're a red-blooded hunk of

1060
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,680
He-Man, an asshole.

1061
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:26,900
And, of course

1062
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:26,900


1063
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:27,360
Yep.

1064
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,620
And we know that what we're doing

1065
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,780
In another part of world

1066
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:35,560
Hello, pagoda realts

1067
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:35,560


1068
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,000
Is it the psychic erection network?

1069
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,880
They're interfering with this

1070
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,260
On the radio again

1071
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,340
I'm so sorry

1072
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,820
We seemed to have lost the thread

1073
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:49,980
Which would have led us out of Ariadne's labyrinth

1074
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:52,620
But we all do have a psychic erection now

1075
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:53,520
To try

1076
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:54,800
Naughty datos

1077
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,260
halting steps through the unknown

1078
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:01,140
before the darkness of abyssal ignorance

1079
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,560
closes down around us once again.

1080
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,560
And in the distance we can hear the heavy breathing

1081
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,400
and snorting of the monster

1082
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,680
leading us into oblivion.

1083
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:15,340
The monster is much bigger and bigger than we ever dreamed.

1084
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,560
Most people don't even think that monsters are a problem.

1085
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,080
They'll find out all too late.

1086
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,000
And giant spiders, you know, we can make light of that,

1087
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,140
but it is a very real and significant danger.

1088
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,640
It's an enchanting possibility,

1089
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,320
but it also is a frightening reality

1090
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,160
in many parts of the world we live in.

1091
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,200
And we live in them all.

1092
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,680
I know that you may be troubled by the idea

1093
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,260
of withered mummies, snarling werewolves,

1094
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,480
dribbling saliva,

1095
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:46,340
and man-made monsters clumping about at night,

1096
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,900
perhaps coming closer and closer to your door.

1097
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:52,160
But, you know, we just have to live with things like this

1098
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,480
and not be cowed.

1099
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,020
We have to be brave and not whimpering cowards

1100
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:59,560
hiding in holes in the ground,

1101
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,220
smelling like dirt.

1102
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,300
We live with private monsters, don't we?

1103
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,140
Why don't we live with huge public monsters?

1104
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,660
That's right. Let's make a contest of it

1105
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:11,600
and we'll be keeping up with the Joneses' monsters.

1106
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,420
And we can become members of the board of directors

1107
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:15,980
of various different monsters

1108
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,000
that we have a kinship or a feeling for.

1109
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,140
That's right. It'll be good for the economy, too.

1110
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:23,780
I expect an immediate uprise in stocks and bonds.

1111
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,680
On the NASDAQ?

1112
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:28,340
And I think this is going to work for us.

1113
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,940
A chicken in every pot, a car in every garage,

1114
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:33,060
and a monster in every basement.

1115
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,000
Yep. And a chicken in every...

1116
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,780
Did you say a chicken in every park or a car?

1117
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,320
Oh, yeah. We're throwing in some chicken.

1118
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,100
Also, of course, our vegetarian friends

1119
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:44,960
can eat these large, congealing, floating blobs of tofu.

1120
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,860
It's all part of the platform.

1121
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,740
But we still have enough to stand on

1122
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,540
even when we break them off the edges.

1123
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:53,920
And, of course, the...

1124
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,980
The parkers are all 100% Gore-Tex.

1125
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:58,040
You don't have to worry about your chicken freezing

1126
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,680
or your tofu getting too hot in the sun.

1127
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,420
Neither the gloom of night

1128
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:06,080
nor the irritations of the day

1129
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,020
shall stay these couriers

1130
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,880
from their appointed ground rounds

1131
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,540
and chicken sandwiches.

1132
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:13,700
Yep.

1133
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:15,460
All right, this one.

1134
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:16,720
Slack?

1135
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:17,820
Question mark.

1136
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:20,440
To slack or not to slack?

1137
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,720
That's the question?

1138
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,020
I think everyone can answer that one.

1139
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:26,720
They don't need me.

1140
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,340
To slack, of course.

1141
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,200
This one has yet another question.

1142
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,320
Why subgenius?

1143
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:37,400
Well, why not?

1144
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,660
I mean, you like the Mormons better

1145
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:42,760
who were held up as an example earlier.

1146
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,340
You know, the Mormons got their name

1147
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:50,300
from worshipping the angel Moroni.

1148
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:51,400
Moroni, yes.

1149
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,940
But they can't call themselves Moron.

1150
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,080
So they have to call themselves Mormons.

1151
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,580
There are many religions

1152
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,900
which make the subgenius by comparison

1153
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,260
hardly look absurd at all.

1154
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,720
And when you say,

1155
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,980
why subgenius,

1156
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:07,360
we say because.

1157
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:10,020
As Ivan Stang said earlier.

1158
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:11,580
Because.

1159
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,860
One more quick one here.

1160
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:17,600
Who's the real Junior Bob Dobbs?

1161
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,200
Oh, Junior Bob Dobbs.

1162
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,900
Who's the real J.R. period Bob Dobbs?

1163
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:23,820
Well, I'll tell you something.

1164
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,520
Ladies and gentlemen,

1165
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,420
I'm very glad this question was asked

1166
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,160
because the fact is,

1167
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,440
like the Suriname toad,

1168
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,220
which has many holes in its back

1169
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:38,160
through which thousands of repulsive little toadettes emerge,

1170
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:44,520
or the scorpion who carries a seething mass of its infants on its back.

1171
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,880
Bob Dobbs has many children

1172
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,960
and you are all, each and every one of you,

1173
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:53,980
a son or a daughter,

1174
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,480
or a daughter of Bob.

1175
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,720
I am myself.

1176
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,520
I can give you the progression

1177
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,840
which demonstrates that I am of the Bobbly material

1178
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:07,760
and am essentially Bob and a son of Bob.

1179
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,420
Let me explain.

1180
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,960
Perhaps some of you remember something a long time ago

1181
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,820
called the Nixon administration.

1182
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,740
Does anybody remember that?

1183
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:21,940
Remember he had some creeps working for him?

1184
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:23,960
Of course he also had the creeps.

1185
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:24,100
He was the president of the Nixon administration

1186
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,660
which was the committee to re-elect the president.

1187
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:31,860
But operating those were H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman.

1188
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:35,700
Does anybody remember Haldeman and Ehrlichman?

1189
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:40,180
Of course these names are being swept into the ash heap of history.

1190
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,000
But try to remember, for a moment,

1191
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,540
that there was a Haldeman and Ehrlichman.

1192
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:47,600
Well, Haldeman was H.R. Haldeman.

1193
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:50,640
Just as there is a J.R. Dobbs.

1194
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:53,920
H.R. stands for Harry Robinson.

1195
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,700
Haldeman was H.R. Robbins Haldeman.

1196
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:58,500
Well, it happens that my given name is Harry Robbins.

1197
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,740
He was also known as Bob Haldeman.

1198
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,700
Well, if he can call himself Bob

1199
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,660
on the basis of being named Harry Robbins,

1200
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:08,900
which is exactly my name,

1201
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,580
then I, too, am Bob.

1202
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:13,140
I am Bob.

1203
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,820
And people ask me about this suit.

1204
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,000
I am one of Bob's children.

1205
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,420
I am Bob's big boy.

1206
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:24,860
I was wondering about that.

1207
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:26,240
Yes, let's go on.

1208
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:27,460
A burger for Bob.

1209
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,900
The pay is a cigarette butt.

1210
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,520
A soggy cigarette butt.

1211
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,660
And yet, I will answer the question.

1212
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:39,000
Because, as I said before, these people have already tithed

1213
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,660
to Bob in paying their admission fee.

1214
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,340
Here's the card that came with it.

1215
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:46,120
An absolute blank card.

1216
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,180
A blank question.

1217
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,100
Well, the blank...

1218
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,300
Are you sure?

1219
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,320
This might not even have been an official question.

1220
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,480
But let's assume that it is.

1221
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:58,540
The blank card demands an answer

1222
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:00,900
which is full of information.

1223
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,100
Enough information to fill a card.

1224
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:07,140
And, of course, if you write real tiny,

1225
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:10,860
this could encapsulate the entire Oxford English Dictionary

1226
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:14,000
and the complete works of Charles Dickens.

1227
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,440
Fortunately, there are municipal buildings

1228
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,560
in towns of this size.

1229
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,780
Libraries, we call them.

1230
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,220
And I recommend that you go there

1231
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,240
to receive the complete answer,

1232
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,300
which time does not permit me to relate,

1233
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,860
from the blank card.

1234
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:30,620
Very nice.

1235
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:33,040
And here's a very interesting one,

1236
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:35,860
signed by Reverend Nicky.

1237
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:36,960
Reverend Nicky?

1238
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:42,340
What does the subgenius essence taste like?

1239
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,920
What does the subgenius essence taste like?

1240
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,800
The subgenius essence.

1241
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,680
Well, it is a slightly salty flavor.

1242
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:57,040
With an undertaste of sweetness.

1243
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,800
Lasting sweetness.

1244
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,780
A sweetness that you might feel

1245
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,240
at the back of your throat

1246
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,100
after receiving a full blast

1247
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,560
of the true subgenius essence.

1248
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:10,760
Something as sweet as

1249
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,120
the scent of a new morn hay.

1250
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:19,220
Or rain after a long, parching thirst.

1251
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,260
But, of course, in order to taste

1252
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,000
the subgenius essence properly,

1253
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,180
one must drink deep.

1254
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:26,980
Woo!

1255
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:28,400
Woo!

1256
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,160
Woo!

1257
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:35,600
Now, can Bob create a rock so big

1258
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,520
that not even he can smoke it?

1259
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,960
If so, where can I find it?

1260
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,220
And does he take American Express?

1261
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:45,980
Woo!

1262
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,020
Bob does not deal,

1263
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,580
in the sense that you mean.

1264
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:55,940
Bob can, indeed, create a rock

1265
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,640
of this enormous size.

1266
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,680
But not by trying to.

1267
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:02,640
Bob doesn't do anything on purpose.

1268
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:06,600
Bob is simply a lucky son of a gun.

1269
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:08,980
He surfs the luck plane.

1270
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,140
And simply by being himself,

1271
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,760
the world's most perfect slackless man,

1272
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,840
achieves all.

1273
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:19,200
Woo-hoo!

1274
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,480
We must all try to be like Bob.

1275
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:22,880
And then we can receive

1276
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,100
enormous dumps of greatness.

1277
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,300
Oh, so poetically put.

1278
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:34,020
This question from someone named Probe.

1279
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:35,260
Probe?

1280
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:40,140
How can I get the cute straight guy

1281
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,860
sitting at my table to let me lick his feet

1282
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:44,720
and suck on his toes?

1283
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,520
Give me $40!

1284
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:50,840
Is that it?

1285
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:51,780
Yeah, that's it.

1286
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,760
How can I get the cute straight guy

1287
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,060
sitting at my table to let me lick his feet

1288
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:57,280
and suck on his toes?

1289
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,040
By trying over and over again.

1290
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,680
Practice makes perfect.

1291
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,760
You've got to wear down the sales resistance,

1292
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,160
just as Dobbs himself would do.

1293
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,240
Remember, you don't necessarily get it

1294
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,680
by trying too hard.

1295
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,080
Some wonderful things happen accidentally.

1296
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:21,760
And when you've given up expecting them to happen.

1297
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,420
But they won't happen just by mooning around

1298
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:27,460
and saying, I wish I would have such slack

1299
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:30,160
if I could only perform this disgusting act.

1300
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,200
No, you have to do it.

1301
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:36,060
And if you end up weeping and disheveled

1302
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,060
by the side of the road,

1303
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,480
consider this.

1304
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:42,420
If the fool will persist in his folly,

1305
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,440
he will become wise.

1306
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,180
He will be wise.

1307
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:53,800
Well worth the price paid for that answer.

1308
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,460
Now this one came with the...

1309
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:58,540
Yes, I see, with the long green,

1310
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,760
the kale, the cabbage.

1311
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:04,340
And it's asked by Princess Wee.

1312
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:08,040
Dr. Powell, why isn't life fair?

1313
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,180
And to follow that up,

1314
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,800
okay, why isn't life more fair?

1315
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,800
Why isn't life more fair?

1316
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,160
Why isn't life fair?

1317
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:21,820
And since, in case you say that it is actually,

1318
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:22,560
why isn't it more...

1319
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,220
Oh, I wouldn't say that it is.

1320
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:28,080
But I am put in mind of that great sage Archimedes

1321
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:31,340
who said in speaking of the lever and fulcrum principle,

1322
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:33,280
give me a place to stand

1323
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,340
and I shall lift the world.

1324
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:37,600
In other words, if you have the right place

1325
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,200
to put the fulcrum and a lever long enough,

1326
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:43,360
you can shift the entire bulk of earth.

1327
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:45,060
Now what was that question again?

1328
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:50,840
Ah, yes, life is not more fair

1329
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,780
because you are not standing in the right spot.

1330
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:57,700
You must align yourself with the forces

1331
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:00,840
which comprise life so that for you

1332
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:04,380
it will be exceptionally fair and rewarding.

1333
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:07,220
Of course, there's always going to be someone

1334
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:08,820
standing very near you saying,

1335
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,660
boy, you sure have a good place to stand.

1336
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,840
I wish I could stand there.

1337
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:16,780
And your answer to that question,

1338
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:17,880
that person must always be,

1339
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:20,240
yes, it is a good place, isn't it?

1340
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:16,780
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

1341
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,420
in every aspect of life.

1342
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,780
They come up with this definition

1343
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:22,140
of something that's perfect.

1344
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:23,660
Actually, friends,

1345
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:25,780
not only is there no such thing as perfect,

1346
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,500
there's no such thing as normal.

1347
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:28,840
Praise Bob!

1348
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,220
That's why it's best for us

1349
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:35,040
to let the aliens do our killing for us.

1350
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:36,940
Because when we start killing,

1351
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,400
we're subgeniuses.

1352
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,300
We might make a mistake.

1353
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,200
We might accidentally kill a rich subgenius

1354
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,460
who happened to be able to afford

1355
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:44,300
a decent haircut.

1356
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,580
Try to be perfect, friends.

1357
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:49,160
It's per-fucked.

1358
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,640
It's for per-fuck it.

1359
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:51,400
It's what it is.

1360
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:54,360
It's a word that's hard to deal with.

1361
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:55,880
I am Matt Gerard Smith.

1362
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,820
I am talking to you today

1363
00:59:57,820 --> 00:59:59,400
about my new type, Archita,

1364
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:01,040
and the fact that as of yet,

1365
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,880
you have not tossed my salad in.

1366
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:05,120
Why haven't you tossed my salad in?

1367
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,080
My puckered starfish is winking at you,

1368
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,260
all pink and brown.

1369
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,540
Maybe it's more of a taupe color,

1370
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,200
but it is a puckered brown eye.

1371
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,100
Toss my salad, please.

1372
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,920
If you do not enjoy tossing my salad,

1373
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,900
you can return it for a full refund.

1374
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,300
Keep the chamois as our gift to you.
