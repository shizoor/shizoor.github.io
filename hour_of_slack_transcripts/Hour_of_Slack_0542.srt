00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:07,880
Hello, my friends. So happy to see you again.

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,980
Swag Incorporated, how may I direct your call?

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,880
To the subgenius power of swag.

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,500
And it goes for everybody.

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,280
Hey, we would dedicate to the feedback family and all the human beings and you people.

6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,060
And if you all stand up, put your right hand across the way, if you could find to put it across.

7
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,560
Oh, oh, wow.

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,900
Oh, well, you know, you stand up and you're all.

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,960
And we don't want all these jokers up here on stage with us.

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,200
OK. All right.

11
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,800
Let's go. I guess this is.

12
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,860
Right. Right.

13
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,280
Right. Right. Right.

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,300
This is the.

15
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,840
Friend of the.

16
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,920
Right. Right.

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,280
Bob.

18
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,620
Yeah.

19
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:15,440
Yeah.

20
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,080
Yeah.

21
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:18,880
Yeah.

22
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,320
I'm in the United.

23
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:22,900
A religious.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,420
Fanatic.

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,400
Or whatever you want to call.

26
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,740
The old little paper.

27
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,220
Brain within my boy.

28
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,960
Grip and receive low goes.

29
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,360
And lay with the.

30
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,020
Leader.

31
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,720
We tackle.

32
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,520
Love for sin.

33
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,000
Low.

34
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,120
What do you mean by that?

35
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,140
I'm trying to tell you, sir, that it is very.

36
00:01:53,140 --> 00:02:03,560
Very possible that a very elite, very illegal and well funded command of special agents are operating as deep covers in this country and around the world.

37
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,800
And they are operating with full termination powers.

38
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,880
There's a pack of wolves in the lion's den.

39
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,440
They're licking their chops and making their plans.

40
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:21,860
There's a.

41
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,860
There's a pack of sheep on a nearby hill.

42
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,400
And tonight.

43
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,120
They're going to make they kill.

44
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,460
They're going to learn their lines talk real smooth.

45
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,760
Play the part of the rams and use dress like sheep.

46
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,660
So the flock proceeds.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,900
Then they go sweet.

48
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,860
Little and believe.

49
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,300
That.

50
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,100
Is when the sun goes down and they'll be hungry.

51
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:44,920
We'll see.

52
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:45,360
Keep.

53
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:45,900
The.

54
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,600
Have to see.

55
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,260
They'll pull the.

56
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:50,760
The.

57
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,120
The.

58
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,900
The.

59
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,800
The.

60
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:55,800


61
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:55,800


62
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,320
What does it mean?

63
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,900
Seems almost a message coming from space.

64
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,960
But behind the strange signal is an alien intelligence that knows all.

65
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,000
That was my efforts to expose them have been discovered.

66
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,040
So I the hunter become the hunted.

67
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:17,720
All my adult life through four presidents has been spent in a twilight world of covert intelligence for my country.

68
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,580
Where are the moles.

69
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:28,240
who cannot come in from the cold we call ourselves the 39 steps of fanciful code name our assignment

70
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,740
neutralized the three pied pipers of rock music jim morrison janice joplin and jimmy hendrix

71
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,200
come on let's act like we got some sense it's driven you know they get high and all that

72
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,920
but it's not like we got some sense while they do it all right let's just relax and just sit down

73
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,040
and dig the sounds and this won't start any more trouble because there's enough already all right

74
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:54,860
let us call the show before you ladies and gentlemen last june 11th five times this year

75
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,840
god has shown me we're fixing to have a racial war the cute trucks the skate heads the black panthers

76
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:11,220
the malcolm x all of these gang leaders and gang kings in these cities is fixing to start a war

77
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,740
in this nation and it's going to be quick you show me they'd be in 61 in this same revival

78
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,980
he showed me three heads would rise up in this country and this country would be split three times

79
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,760
this country is fixing to be divided

80
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:35,420
this country is fixing to go down in war if you can't walk through this racial war

81
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,580
and violent that our nation was weakened

82
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:46,340
duh we was terrible and our enemy took advantage

83
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,140
of our weakness came in

84
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,820
can't wait until it's time

85
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,140
when the sun goes down

86
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,640
to see

87
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,320
they'll pull the wool over the eyes of the sheep

88
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,900
will pull the wool over

89
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,000
the ass with her sheep

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,040
and bird

91
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,120
foot

92
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,380
foot

93
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:38,740
and

94
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:47,860
sand

95
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,020
please

96
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:48,020


97
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:48,020


98
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,360
In 1 Corinthians 6, verses 9 and 10, it says,

99
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,440
Surely you know that the people who do wrong will not inherit God's kingdom.

100
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,840
Do not be fooled.

101
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,040
Those who sin sexually, worship idols, take part in adultery,

102
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,880
those who are male prostitutes or men who have sexual relations with other men,

103
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,020
those who steal or greedy, get drunk, lie about others, or rob,

104
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,880
these people will not inherit God's kingdom.

105
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,400
We're given this gift.

106
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,360
Don't you know the ability to understand?

107
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,260
Yet no one wants to understand.

108
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,340
We're given the ability to read.

109
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,240
I mean, read Nietzsche.

110
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,600
Read Thomas Mann.

111
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,720
Read Spengler.

112
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,600
Joyce.

113
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,380
Rimbaud.

114
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,920
Everything's out of whack.

115
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,840
People just worry about money now and deny their inner self.

116
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,620
Money.

117
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,380
Money.

118
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,620
They walk through the night crowd protected by money, lulled by money, dulled by money.

119
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,400
No least single object anywhere that is not money.

120
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:15,840
Money.

121
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,500
Money everywhere.

122
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,480
Well, not enough.

123
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,980
And then no money, or little money, or less money, or more money.

124
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,780
But money.

125
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,740
Always money.

126
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,360
And if you have money or you don't have money, it's the money that counts.

127
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,240
And money makes money.

128
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,660
But what makes money make money?

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,200
I say, what the hell?

130
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,740
We gotta die to the world like the clowns.

131
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,520
Right, clowns?

132
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:34,820
Right.

133
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,400
Right.

134
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:37,620
Right.

135
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,160
Right.

136
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,360
Well, we'll just die to the world because we're clowns.

137
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,740
Just funny clowns.

138
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:43,900
Yes.

139
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,920
And despite the psychosomatic adversity,

140
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:54,040
why, which we can't talk about on the radio, why, we'll just forge ahead and just be funny.

141
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,780
We'll be funny and we'll spread mirth and laughter among all those slackless out there like you.

142
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,420
Yeah.

143
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,840
I know they're out to get you, friend.

144
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,220
They're out to get me.

145
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,880
They really are out to get you.

146
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,020
You're not imagining that.

147
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,760
And they will get you sooner or later.

148
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,500
But in the meantime, we can die to the world like the clowns.

149
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,160
Ho, ho, ho.

150
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,760
That's not funny.

151
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,420
That's not funny.

152
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:18,420


153
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,500
There's no end to this.

154
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:19,500


155
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:19,520
There's no end to this.

156
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:19,520


157
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:19,520


158
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:19,520


159
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:19,520


160
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:19,520


161
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:32,120
I'm sorry we had to run a rerun last week, although I think it was a good old, old show from the old, old station from the old, old creature.

162
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,580
And, oh, what have we?

163
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:41,540
Yeah, well, the subgenius mail order office has moved to the new factory.

164
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,540
It's true.

165
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,180
The Lord Jesus Christ, our new employee.

166
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:45,820
Thank you.

167
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,240
Thank you.

168
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:46,720
Thank you.

169
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:54,580
Um, oh, is that him now? No! No, that's just the clowns.

170
00:08:54,580 --> 00:09:05,000
Jesus is still at the factory with the many, let's just call them employees, and down the road.

171
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:10,220
Yeah, it was a hectic move, but it's caused some changes around here,

172
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:19,520
and some of you diehard subgeniuses will be most interested to learn that we now have a 1-800 number that you can call.

173
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,560
This isn't me. You're not calling me. You're not calling the Hour of Slack.

174
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,460
This is just for information for you subgeniuses.

175
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:33,560
If you have a dying urge to burn up your credit card or something like that,

176
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,240
they can give you instructions at this new toll-free number.

177
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,840
Now, this is not, get that pencil ready.

178
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,580
It's not actually an 800 number. It's an 888 number.

179
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,840
All right.

180
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,080
There's the other ear.

181
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:54,420
Okay, the 1-800 number is actually 1-888, and you'll like this coming up.

182
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,440
669-23-23!

183
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,700
Yes, 1-888-669-2323.

184
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,480
That's a toll-free call to the...

185
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,780
factory, the Subgenius Foundation Mail Order Department factory.

186
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:18,420
Okay, where you'll talk to, probably end up talking to Jesus or it, or else leaving a message.

187
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,680
And he's a lot more polite when you call than I am, because when people call here, I never pick up the phone.

188
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,620
That's just the way it is, and that's the way they made it.

189
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,140
No!

190
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,480
Okay, I told you that. 1-888-669.

191
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:39,280
See, that's kind of, we tried to get either 666 or 999,

192
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,640
2323.

193
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,780
But the closest we could get was 669-2323.

194
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,500
So, anyway, that's that.

195
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,040
And, uh, and...

196
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:55,160
I've got so many loads of tapes stacked up here, I don't even know where to start, as usual.

197
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:02,780
But I'm thinking that we may just sort of jump back and forth between Subgenius Preaching and our favorite kooks,

198
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:06,060
such as Joe, and our new kook, Wesley Willis.

199
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,940
Well, heck, let's play Wesley Willis now.

200
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,520
I've had...

201
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,360
Several people.

202
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,580
Pardon me.

203
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,220
I've had several people over the last couple of years come up to me and go,

204
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,100
Man, you've got to hear about this guy, Wesley Willis.

205
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:27,300
He's this maniac street singer guy that, like, walks up to you and does a poem for a dollar,

206
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,940
and then sells you a CD, and he's wild, man!

207
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,920
And we, actually, Wesley Willis started out doing that in Chicago,

208
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,000
and my good friends in Chicago at Run and Gun,

209
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:39,760
and, again,

210
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,580
ran into him, and, in fact, gave me a CD of Wesley Willis not long ago.

211
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:49,280
Apparently, Mr. Willis is a large black man,

212
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,180
and he does actually have many, many CDs out.

213
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,860
Let's just see what the first song on this one sounds like.

214
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:03,600
One thing I know about Wesley Willis is all the songs on the album sound alike.

215
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,880
This band's made at the Metro.

216
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,000
About 600 people went to the rock show.

217
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,320
The rock show was awesome.

218
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,900
The rock show was the same as.

219
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,660
The rock show was the same as.

220
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:26,000
Solar Drive, Solar Drive, Solar Drive, Solar Drive.

221
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,740
The band played it on.

222
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,820
The band got down like a magic kiss.

223
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,460
The crowd went like a lion.

224
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,560
The jam session whooped the ponies' ass.

225
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,820
Solar Drive.

226
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:39,820


227
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,620
Solar Drive.

228
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,340
Solar Drive.

229
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:45,960


230
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,600
Solar Drive.

231
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,820
Solar Drive.

232
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,440
Solar Drive.

233
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,020
Solar Drive.

234
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:53,860
Solar Drive.

235
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,900
Solar Drive.

236
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,880
Solar Drive.

237
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,940
Solar Drive.

238
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,820
Solar Drive.

239
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,460
Where's Wesley?

240
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,000
Come on, Wesley.

241
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,680
We wanted to hear you rap, man.

242
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,420
Well, let's just skip it.

243
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,900
See, that's the problem with crackpot rock and roll.

244
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,740
Now, I told you they all sounded the same.

245
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,880
That's the second song.

246
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,220
It sounds just like the first song.

247
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,800
Okay, I'm sorry.

248
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,020
Well, now, you see, friends, you can see why I've had so many people say,

249
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,400
man, you can't do that.

250
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:08,400


251
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,020
You've got to play Wesley Willis on the Hour of Slack because he's so weird.

252
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:17,100
And I could pop through the other 23 songs on this CD,

253
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,100
and they all start the same way and basically sound the same way.

254
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,920
And I think that that's a beautiful thing.

255
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,820
Now, while we're still on crackpots,

256
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,560
it's been a while since you all heard from our old friend Joe Offrecht.

257
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,500
So let's just see what he has to say this time.

258
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,620
This is the Pringstar.

259
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,860
The Pringstar.

260
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,660
Imagine being a fat, perverted prankster.

261
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,760
A bearded, fat, perverted prankster.

262
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,300
Yeah, the bearded prankster going,

263
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,100
The Pringstar.

264
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,360
This is the Pringstar.

265
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:02,400
I'd love to be really big and ugly like Gross Burger in the movie Stir Crazy

266
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,260
and come up to short, skinny chicks and say,

267
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,100
I'm going to...

268
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,540
Force you in that bed with me.

269
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,080
My mom caught me with some pervert pictures once.

270
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,460
Well, actually, they weren't porno pictures.

271
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,420
It was just drawings I made with guys saying stuff like,

272
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,940
I'm a fat, sadistic pervert.

273
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,540
I'm going on a surfing safari.

274
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,900
There was a short, skinny chick.

275
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,980
I forced her into bed with me.

276
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,400
And then I drew a picture of a guy,

277
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,680
seven foot six, weighing 600 pounds.

278
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,360
And he was saying how he forced short, skinny chicks into bed with him.

279
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,500
And then I put a big arrow to both of them and it said,

280
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,920
Nobody messes with these guys.

281
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,300
And she asked me, What's this?

282
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,100
And she got all concerned and worried about me.

283
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,500
And I explained to her,

284
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,980
Mom, when I grow up, I want to be a fat, sadistic pervert.

285
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,940
And she's like,

286
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,560
Well, why do you want to be a fat, sadistic pervert?

287
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,520
I start laughing.

288
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,460
She's like, Don't laugh or I'll give you a smack.

289
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,220
And she's like, Oh, you treat people like sticks.

290
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,960
They're just there for your pleasure.

291
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,780
You're going to do that just so you can be horny.

292
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,880
You're just going to be horny and have your fun.

293
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,360
And eventually she told me, You better not draw anymore.

294
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:36,920
Of the way.

295
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,960
I was pervert pictures.

296
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,900
But then a while after that, I said,

297
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,600
I feel like drawing some perverts, some more pervert pictures.

298
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,880
And she's like, What are pervert pictures?

299
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:56,420
And well, friends, Joe Offric did grow up to be a sort of fat bearded pervert.

300
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:03,780
Although to this day, as far as we know, the only perverted things he does are his tapes.

301
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,400
And.

302
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:14,600
Well, we know how you enjoy a glimpse into the mind of the strange and the bizarre and the diseased.

303
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,580
And so we continue.

304
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,280
Yes, sir. I'm the man with the legal notices in the newspaper.

305
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,900
So I've got the little bit of soul story in the sixties.

306
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,740
I say a little bit of soul live on the radio.

307
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,120
My family has restraining order for privacy.

308
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,860
Like my dad's side of family doesn't want attention drawn to his address.

309
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,520
What I do.

310
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,200
When I cross the sidewalk is my business.

311
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,660
Since the sixties, we're playing with another story.

312
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,580
Misinterpretation of my privacy.

313
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,560
I got a legal to steal and he wants to run to my bonus check and my bail and bond.

314
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,080
See my bail and bond and seven and silver is already there.

315
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:56,160
And the story misinterpretation restraining order for privacy.

316
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:03,900
And he will surrender due proceed on us and bonus bail about a seven silver without hesitation or reserve.

317
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,320
And then moving the direction most affable away from said.

318
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,060
And you remain under restraining order.

319
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,420
Silence unless otherwise authorized by me, of course.

320
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,980
And then and then they were supposed to.

321
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,080
There's a legal notice to Polensic and he's moving down here and his.

322
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:18,480
Read.

323
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,120
Yes, sir.

324
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,460
I'm the person with the legal notices in the newspaper.

325
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,120
I'm going to give you a couple more of them.

326
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,660
I've got one from a school teacher.

327
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,860
Such the Gerardo to whom they concern telling Polensic.

328
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,480
This kid was just invited.

329
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,180
His address is about to be cleared.

330
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,200
What he's moving in for.

331
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,220
Could you see if you could find the key to?

332
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,280
The property has been paid for.

333
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,080
Give it to him.

334
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,600
Don't approach any other reason.

335
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,600
And then I'm allowed to declare another address in the neighborhood.

336
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,700
Under a more active status as far as things.

337
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:56,540
I want to do one for privacy that I have oldest person in the country in the family family story.

338
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,420
And we need certain things.

339
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,900
We'd like certain things to match in the description of what's going on in this property.

340
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,500
Of course, you're allowed to approach me here.

341
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,400
No.

342
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,200
This is one of the reasons.

343
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,600
I'm here to get away from the family before I explore certain situations.

344
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,100
Privacy case starts at the sidewalk.

345
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,500
I got a couple more stories here.

346
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,960
Explain on text.

347
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,740
Government assistance is a mockery to power which belongs only to God.

348
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,940
We must use government.

349
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,280
End in the end.

350
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,480
We must topple government.

351
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,660
We must kill government.

352
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,020
Overthrow government.

353
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:30,880
Abolish law.

354
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,500
Destroy government.

355
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,320
An inevitable utopia.

356
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,880
There will be no need for government or death or killing or crime.

357
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,720
No need for law or class.

358
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,080
After the apocalypse, the city of God is utopia.

359
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,660
There is a door for each of the twelve tribes of Israel.

360
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,180
The city of God is utopia.

361
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,980
You know what's door to enter when you die.

362
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:52,180
You must have the mark of God branded squarely on your forehead to get into the city of God.

363
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,140
Angels of God will brand your forehead when you die.

364
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,800
Are the tribes separated when they come into the city?

365
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,920
No, there is no racism or sexism in heaven.

366
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,160
You lose your sex when you enter the city of God.

367
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,460
All angels are homophonies.

368
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,260
Everyone is free in the city of heaven.

369
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,780
And inside the walls there are laws and kings and dead and the need to die.

370
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,320
Torment, fear, suffering.

371
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,280
No flesh in heaven.

372
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,060
No Christ in heaven.

373
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,240
No abominations in Christ.

374
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,940
Here endeth the word of God.

375
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,900
Praise God.

376
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,520
Oh, yes dear friends.

377
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,560
That last there of course was Church of New Faith.

378
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,360
Church of New Faith.

379
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,600
Some of my favorite preachers.

380
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,020
I'm not sure if they're still there anymore.

381
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,440
We haven't gotten a tape from them in a long time.

382
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,820
But I'm going to give their address anyway.

383
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,840
That's CNF at, got that pencil ready?

384
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,240
P.F.

385
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:35,760
Go box.

386
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:43,620
9152 Virginia Beach, Virginia 23450.

387
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,660
That's an easy zip.

388
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,540
23450.

389
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:54,800
Well, I know that went by too fast for those of you who might be taping.

390
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,840
But what the heck.

391
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:05,200
And okay, it really is going to be the word of Bob now as delivered by Father Joe.

392
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,420
Mama.

393
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,780
As is so often the case as I step before this podium to speak.

394
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,020
I have a pretty good idea of what I mean to say.

395
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,140
Tonight, it's going to be different.

396
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:28,080
Because I feel something that I didn't feel before.

397
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,580
I feel someone out there now listening to my voice.

398
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,180
I feel someone out there now listening to my voice.

399
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,480
Who's crying on the inside.

400
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:46,200
They want the touch of Bob to fill their soul.

401
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,820
They may not even know it's Bob that they want to touch their soul.

402
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,840
They may just think that they want someone to love them.

403
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,920
Or even just to have sex with them.

404
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,600
Or maybe just give them a hug.

405
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:07,900
Or maybe just a little kiss.

406
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:07,900


407
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:12,560
Well, friends, there is only one real love.

408
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,580
And that is Bob Dobbs.

409
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:25,320
It's the only love that can never dry up, wither away, and blow off in the dust.

410
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:33,660
It's a love that you can have in addition to that lover's kiss.

411
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,180
It's a love that you can have in addition to that lover's kiss.

412
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,440
Or mother's embrace.

413
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,180
It's a love that's free.

414
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,960
It asks nothing in return except respect.

415
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:57,440
So I'm going to provide that love the only way I know how.

416
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:04,520
Which is to ask that individual to meet with me after the sermon tonight.

417
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,180
Which is to ask that individual to meet with me after the sermon tonight.

418
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:05,180


419
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,940
I'll be waiting for in my private chambers,

420
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,380
going through some important papers to be better prepared.

421
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,320
So, back on to the written word.

422
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,440
Tonight I wanted to share with you Psalm 69

423
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:30,200
from the Bible, which reads as follows.

424
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,520
Oh Bob, bender of time and maker of slack,

425
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,020
forget not your sheep who walk astray.

426
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,180
Protect those who stagger forth to seek your comfort.

427
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,400
For I am lost and the lions smell my blood.

428
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,500
Though I am blind, I look unto you.

429
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,540
Though I am deaf, I strain to hear thy voice.

430
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,000
Though my mouth is sewn, I long.

431
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,580
I long to sing thy praise.

432
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,940
Holy Dobbs, slayer of pinks and master of all,

433
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,100
part thee thy jungle to reveal thy path of salvation.

434
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,120
Deliver thee from the jaw that would crunch my bones.

435
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,800
Spare thee from the maggots that would consume my flesh.

436
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,520
For thy words are like fire unto the creatures of the night.

437
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,680
It drives them back into the abyss.

438
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,860
Thy insults pierce the jackal

439
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,180
like lightning.

440
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,980
Thy wisdom shoots the buzzards from the sky.

441
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,020
Their hungry shells hit empty shadows upon the ground.

442
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,220
Cast thy curse upon thy enemies.

443
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,180
Forgive them not for their transgressions.

444
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,880
Awake, oh Dobbs, rise with anger and storm.

445
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,120
The pink one mocks you and laughs.

446
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,800
The heathen evokes false powers to belittle thy name.

447
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,080
The normal worships gold and graven images.

448
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,660
Their hypocrisy knows no bounds.

449
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,180
Their hypocrisy knows no bounds.

450
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:00,180


451
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:00,180


452
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:00,180


453
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,460
Their hatred knows no limits.

454
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,780
Show thy forth and lay claim upon thy kingdom.

455
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,580
Your flock is stalked like the goat by the tiger.

456
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,960
The hungry ones conspire to consume our souls.

457
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,960
They removeth our hearts.

458
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,620
They destroyeth our minds.

459
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,080
They taketh our spirit before our last natural breath.

460
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,780
Let not our bodies feed the hunter nor nourish its young.

461
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,940
Take now thy vengeance, oh Dobbs.

462
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,780
Wreathe now thy punishment.

463
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,160
For the world is yours.

464
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,580
For the world is hollow and trembles beneath thy weight.

465
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,600
Defend thy servants and devour the beast.

466
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,760
Take their hides to form thy garments.

467
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,140
Take their teeth to adorn thy crown.

468
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,880
Take their claws to decorate thy throne.

469
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,040
Bathe in the warm blood of the wicked

470
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,240
to sooth thy just and noble wrath.

471
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,380
For thy has the power and the pipe

472
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,940
to fill the dark with thine light

473
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,040
and strengthen the weak

474
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,540
with thy might.

475
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,120
Hear in this the word of Bob.

476
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,900
Praise Bob.

477
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,400
Amen.

478
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,140
Yes, friends.

479
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:17,320
A particularly somber sermon from Father Joe Mama.

480
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:26,120
And here I think as an appropriate follow up to that is the Andy Griffith theme.

481
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,020
In Pyroflatulations, the theme is the idea of the world.

482
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,020


483
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,980
And it's written by Pope Lou Duche.

484
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,040
Do this what the Appels tend to do?

485
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,300
Yeah I didn't mean that by the way.

486
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:08,300
Please.

487
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:08,300


488
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:08,300


489
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:08,300


490
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:08,300


491
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:08,300


492
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,140
You know, in my mind the waiting ransom

493
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,300
is just some money giving you the todays in the cardio.

494
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,580
Mr. Cugger.

495
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,020
The protest goes down and the contest wins.

496
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,420
Now let's begin.

497
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:13,940
No music.

498
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:14,780
Let's join you.

499
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,060
Jobsen gets some weed.

500
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:29,000
Father'll start the afterwards.

501
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:40,080
The one, the god of wrath, that one who, to make man pull the triggers of his thousand

502
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:51,440
opposable thumbs, caused the apes of the ground to spill their siana dust.

503
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:59,900
I am the first and the last, which is to come, and which is, and which is, I am in the brain

504
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,480
pad of every human babe.

505
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:08,880
The left hand of light, the other in thy sight, the particle, the totality, for the careful

506
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,780
of the great is I own, and I stand the silly formula of man upon the wires, and I should

507
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:20,740
his spirit after the image of my own, or shall find something for God, and I will run it

508
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,260
on the last.

509
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:28,940
I am the alpha, I comb it with the gloves, I am the changer who rides the mere command,

510
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:36,760
and my face is like the Aztec chariots of decay, full of eyes round about, I turn on

511
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:43,120
as I go, it is the wheel of men on which I lips time, I am the cattle mutilator of the

512
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:51,040
Nescaplane, I am the award, I am the star fist of removal, the paracletoid, the delirious,

513
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:51,940

515
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,460
I am the alpha.

516
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:13,760
I act, and live on the heart of suggest damages.

517
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,480
I am the alpha.

518
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,040
I act, and shove knife in theinnen.

519
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,040

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,080
This is Bob.

533
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,800
This is Bob.

534
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:40,260
You can hardly concern us in our current society.

535
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,000
Is Michael Jackson a subgenius?

536
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,580
What an amusing suggestion, young man.

537
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,280
I think the world laughs as it considers you.

538
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,720
Is he too mainstream of a freak?

539
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,500
Well, you know, this is an entirely relative concept.

540
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,760
I wasn't attempting to discuss the abnormal, but rather the normal,

541
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:03,180
the genetic paradigm which occurred at the beginning of time.

542
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,700
If I could resume my sermon, I would explain to you...

543
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:07,980
Thank you.

544
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,400
They just don't take it seriously.

545
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,480
No, they don't, but you can be the one who does and benefit.

546
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,680
Benefit, exalt yourself to the stars, to the firmament,

547
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,860
and what a firmament it is.

548
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:23,240
Don't you think it's great that Michael Jackson affirmed his firmament?

549
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,120
He thumbed his what?

550
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,460
He affirmed his Teutonic manhood on television.

551
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:32,180
Hmm. Well, I never thought he was Teutonic myself,

552
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:38,140
but, you know, I wouldn't be surprised at any revelation about anyone's ancestry.

553
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,480
Thank you very much.

554
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,120
I myself go back to the ancient kings of Scotland.

555
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:48,220
So let's go back millions and millions of years through the fog of time.

556
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,600
No, doggy dog, scared.

557
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,040
Excuse me.

558
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,440
Well, this is before dogs even existed, or cats for that matter.

559
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,840
They all fused into the ancestral mammalian line,

560
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:02,680
and here perched upon the lower Cretaceous branch is a Crucifontia,

561
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:08,080
a primitive mammal which occupies the niche of today's squirrel.

562
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:15,120
And as we leave this squirrely little fellow who dodges the waving tail of the enraged Stegosaurus,

563
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:19,840
let's move back even further in time until we get to the beginning of time.

564
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:24,980
The king of all things, and the giant cosmic egg, which I mentioned earlier on our program.

565
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,960
There it is, gleaming like that fabled dome which Sinbad, when he first saw it from afar,

566
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:37,280
thought was the roof of some mosque, not realizing it was the cavernous egg of the enormous roof,

567
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:44,420
the gigantic bird who blackens the entire sky with the vast span of its wings.

568
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,740
Well, when God had manufactured all the eggs,

569
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:53,640
out of which the fishes and the serpents and the frogs and the birds and the mammals

570
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,140
and even the duck-billed platypus would eventually emerge,

571
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:01,760
he called the embryos before him and saw that they were good.

572
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:07,480
Perhaps I ought to explain that all embryos look very much the same.

573
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,100
They are what you are before you were born,

574
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:14,860
and whether you are going to be a tadpole or a peacock or a cameo leopard or a man,

575
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,840
when you are an embryo, you look just like a particularly reputed,

576
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,200
repulsive and helpless human being.

577
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:29,660
The embryos stood up in front of God with their feeble hands clasped politely over their protuberant stomachs

578
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:34,060
and their heavy heads hanging down respectfully, and God addressed them.

579
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:40,920
He said, now you embryos, here you are, all looking exactly the same,

580
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,820
and we are going to give you the choice of what you are going to be.

581
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,460
When you grow up, you will get bigger anyway,

582
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,840
but we are pleased to grant you the chance to be a human being.

583
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,960
We will give you another gift as well.

584
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:57,480
You may alter any parts of yourselves into anything which you think would be useful to you in an afterlife.

585
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,600
For instance, at the moment, you can't dig.

586
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,220
Anybody who would like to turn his hands into a pair of spades or garden forks is allowed to do so.

587
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:11,460
Or, to put it another way, at present, you can only use your mouths for eating with.

588
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,920
Anybody who would like to use his mouth as an offensive weapon

589
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:19,200
can change it by asking and be a corking drill or a saber-toothed tiger.

590
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,560
Or a tyrannosaurus rex, one of the finest of my creations.

591
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,600
Now then, step right up and choose your tools,

592
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:31,140
but remember that what you choose, you will grow into and will have to stick to.

593
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,580
Now, all the embryos thought the matter over politely,

594
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:39,100
and then, one by one, they stepped up before the blaze of the eternal throne.

595
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,220
They were allowed two or three specializations,

596
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,920
so that some chose to use their arms as flying machines

597
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,620
and their mouths as weapons or crackers or drillers,

598
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:55,060
while others selected to use their bodies as boats and their hands as oars.

599
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:59,600
For example, the badgers thought very hard and decided to ask three boons.

600
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,480
They wanted to change their skins for shields,

601
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,520
their mouths for weapons, and their arms for garden forks.

602
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,960
And those boons were granted.

603
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,600
Everybody specialized in one way or another,

604
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,780
and some of the creatures in very strange ways.

605
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:18,580
For instance, one of the lizards decided to swap his whole body for blotting paper,

606
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,600
and one of the two decided to swap his whole body for paper.

607
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,640
The toads who lived in the Antipodes decided simply to be a water bottle.

608
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,340
Well, the asking and granting took up two long days.

609
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,540
They were the fifth and sixth, so far as I remember,

610
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:34,240
and at the very end of the sixth day, just before it was time to knock off for Sunday,

611
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,580
they had got through all the little embryos except one,

612
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,980
and this embryo was man.

613
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,200
Man.

614
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,220
Well, our little man, said God,

615
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,680
you have waited till the last,

616
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,020
and slept on your decision,

617
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:54,340
and we are sure you have been thinking hard all the time.

618
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,820
What can we do for you?

619
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,380
Ah, please, God, said the embryo,

620
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,820
I think that you made me in the shape which I now have

621
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,660
for reasons best known to yourselves,

622
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,460
and that it would be rude to change.

623
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:12,160
If I am to have my choice, I will stay just as I am.

624
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,380
I will not alter any of the parts which you gave to me

625
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,260
for other and doubtless inferior tools,

626
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,420
and I will stay.

627
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,200
I have been a defenseless embryo all my life,

628
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,740
doing my best to make unto myself a few feeble implements

629
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,180
out of the wood, iron, and other materials

630
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,100
which you have seen fit to put before me.

631
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,540
If I want a boat, I will endeavor to construct it out of trees,

632
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:36,280
and if I want to fly, I'll put together a chariot to do it for me.

633
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,300
Probably I have been very silly in refusing to take advantage of your kind offer,

634
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,020
but I have done my best to think it over carefully,

635
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,760
and now hope that the feeble decision of this small innocent

636
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,660
will find favor with me.

637
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,400
I have been so grateful to have you here with yourselves.

638
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:54,200
Well done, exclaimed the creator in delighted tones.

639
00:36:54,540 --> 00:37:00,360
Here all you embryos, come here with your beaks and claws and whatnots

640
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,780
to look upon our first man.

641
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,600
He is the only one who has guessed our riddle out of all of you,

642
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:12,100
and we have great pleasure in conferring upon him on this auspicious occasion

643
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,180
the order of dominion over the fowls of the air,

644
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,080
and the beasts of the earth, and the fishes of the sea.

645
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,220
Now let the rest of you get along and love and multiply

646
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:24,460
and all that sort of thing, for it is time to knock off for the weekend.

647
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:29,840
As for you, man, you will be a naked tool all your life.

648
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:35,060
Though a user of tools, you will look like an embryo till they bury you,

649
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,380
but all others will be embryos before your might.

650
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:43,620
Eternally undeveloped, you will always remain potential in our image,

651
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,220
able to see some of our sorrows,

652
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,640
and to feel some of our pain.

653
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:48,640


654
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:48,640


655
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:48,640


656
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:48,640


657
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:48,640


658
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,420
And to feel some of our joys.

659
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:54,640
We are partly sorry for you, man, said Jehovah One,

660
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:58,260
and partly happy, but always proud.

661
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:02,620
Run along then, man, and do your best.

662
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,900
And listen, man, before you go.

663
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:05,780
Yeah?

664
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,740
Well, he made a request.

665
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:14,920
A certain request of the first human.

666
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,220
To find out what this request was,

667
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:48,280
and what it dream вел.

668
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:48,420
Malny?

669
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:48,640


670
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:48,640


671
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:48,640


672
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:48,640


673
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:48,640


674
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:48,640


675
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:48,640


676
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,620
Rempt of by the sensual and the proud.

677
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,440
Slack is the soft voice.

678
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,980
Slack the luminous cloud.

679
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,280
We in ourselves rejoice.

680
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,980
And thence comes all the charms or erosite.

681
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,180
All melodies, an echo of that voice.

682
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,100
All colors as a fusion of that light.

683
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,620
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.

684
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,240
Thank you.

685
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,640
The darkness.

686
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,040
The darkness.

687
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,000
The God.

688
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,860
The God exists in you to take on.

689
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,740
More likely a foot.

690
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,820
The God is a boy.

691
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,480
The boy is out of my mind.

692
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,380
Who's the God?

693
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,740
Who's the God?

694
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,640
He hates me.

695
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,520
He hates me.

696
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,440
He hates me.

697
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:58,440


698
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:58,440


699
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:58,440


700
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:58,440


701
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:58,440


702
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:58,440


703
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:58,440


704
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:58,440


705
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:58,440


706
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:58,440


707
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,720
And I am Lomeca.

708
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:06,380
and my names are

709
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,580
Eight hundred

710
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:10,800
and one

711
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,020
and my names are

712
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,120
without number

713
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:25,340
I've graduated upon a dinosaur's two-watch M.D.I.D.

714
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:30,960
I am the time, the age, and the span.

715
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,660
It is only for my own.

716
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,260
I am the only.

717
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,740
The always and almighty.

718
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,140
I am the weird.

719
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,900
The un-tied.

720
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,120
The only.

721
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,800
Yes, dear friends.

722
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:14,020
Now we're getting into a properly dense subgenius mix.

723
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:14,620
It seems.

724
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,760
With a little bit of the original dense mixers.

725
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,240
There was Dr. Howell there.

726
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,380
Explaining the creation of the cosmic egg and of man.

727
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,640
The great Dr. Howell on KPFA.

728
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:28,660
Berkeley.

729
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,820
And in the background here.

730
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,400
We hear Reverend Tommy Monster.

731
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,580
Who also did Going Out of My Mind over Bob.

732
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,480
Yes, Reverend Tommy Monster.

733
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,320
In Brooklyn, New York.

734
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,480
Finally we get around to playing that lovely CD.

735
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,120
And that's still what's on.

736
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:50,020
That was mixed, of course, with a little bit of the voice of Jehovah One himself.

737
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,540
Let's go back to that.

738
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,300
So then, paint boy of many colors.

739
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:00,880
Know that as many as I rule our death and bride with the drunkenness of faith.

740
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,760
I torment and rebuke.

741
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,940
Be zealous therefore.

742
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,340
And fanatical in thy madness of these the end times.

743
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,100
The time and half time.

744
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,180
And retrieve.

745
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:14,120
And be made slack on the ropes of life with which I bind thee.

746
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,960
And be made whole fulfilled with the soil of my droppings of manna.

747
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,380
Which passeth through thy bowel cleanly.

748
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,900
So, anoint thyself in the graven image tubes.

749
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,720
And my radiance of atoms shall split in twain.

750
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,560
And thy seat shall be broken as I decree.

751
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,300
And thou shalt therefore be fruitful and multiply.

752
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,780
That thy children will be remade in the image of their God.

753
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,420
And shall be over thou.

754
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,840
That thy tomb is.

755
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,820
Uh, yes.

756
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,100
It's so nice to hear.

757
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,580
The word of God recorded through a computer.

758
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,540
Yes, that was God himself speaking.

759
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:51,680
And now we'll go on to something else we're not quite sure what.

760
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,440
Missile.

761
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,440
At New York City.

762
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,320
In Manhattan.

763
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,660
Oh, at least it was only one.

764
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,940
This time I seen the eyeballs melted in the holes.

765
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,160
The flesh fell off the face.

766
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:06,560
I saw, it looked like five, ten million people in Manhattan.

767
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:07,740
Killed.

768
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,200
By this bomb.

769
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,180
I mean, New York City was destroyed.

770
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,260
I saw Washington, D.C.

771
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,360
A missile hit it it was destroyed.

772
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,280
Cincinnati.

773
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:20,340
Detroit.

774
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,860
Chicago, Saint Louis.

775
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,580
I saw Atlanta, Georgia.

776
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,940
The missile hit right at the...

777
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,340
That's a lot of missiles.

778
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:36,200
And I saw the Lord just let me have an open view of Atlanta

779
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,940
I seen it, Atlanta didn't have all the expressways.

780
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,760
Then, but...

781
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,160
That's it.

782
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:41,160


783
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:41,160


784
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,820
I saw Atlanta had all had expressways leading out of the cities.

785
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:49,820
Every direction Atlanta had huge expressways.

786
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,980
Interstate leading out of the city.

787
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:58,480
And I saw folks were trying to get out of Atlanta and ever toward Birmingham,

788
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,800
toward the south, toward the north, toward the west.

789
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:10,740
Every expressway was jammed in the traffic with bumper to bumper and the radiation.

790
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,600
It was catching up with them.

791
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,360
People got out of their cars and they started running.

792
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,840
And their legs had fallen off.

793
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:20,440
Whoa.

794
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,120
Their eyeballs had run out of their heads and their tongues had consumed away.

795
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,860
And their bodies would just burn.

796
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:29,040
While they was running, I'd see them running with half the meat.

797
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,880
The face just running down.

798
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,220
The face would be as flame.

799
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:34,420
Running.

800
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:38,680
Running.

801
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:40,560
You can't run from your own legs.

802
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:41,400
They was caught.

803
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:42,900
They was destroyed.

804
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,200
I saw it hit down the railroads in Birmingham.

805
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,040
Scrap mowings, keels, heads.

806
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:49,800
I seen heads.

807
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:53,240
I seen New Orleans, Louisiana hit the railroads down there.

808
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,980
And I seen human heads.

809
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,420
Arms and legs going through the air.

810
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:58,400
She ain't got no legs.

811
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,440
I saw it hit Houston.

812
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:00,220
Launch that head.

813
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,100
San Antonio.

814
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,980
Dallas and Fort Worth.

815
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:03,840
Costa, Oklahoma.

816
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,140
Yeah, I'm crazy.

817
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:10,600
As they messy bug about Jesus.

818
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,920
Christ my Lord.

819
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:19,020
He's the very best thing that's ever happened to this old country boy.

820
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,140
You may not want to hear what God's got to say.

821
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,880
You may think I'm something that.

822
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,580
But this thing's at hand.

823
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,920
This thing's at the door.

824
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,920
We're fixing to have that racial war that's gonna weaken us.

825
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:33,840
Bummer.

826
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,280
This thing's at hand.

827
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:40,220
Give him your life and you'll be crazy about Jesus like me.

828
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,520
I'm just gonna give you a little bit of a break.

829
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:48,860
Because the professional pornographers and smut dealers aren't gonna lie down and just give up.

830
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,740
They're gonna test every land of the law.

831
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:55,860
Yeah, I'm gonna test every land of the law if I possibly can.

832
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,640
I'll tell you that.

833
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:01,020
We're gonna try to get away with as much as we can possibly get away with.

834
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:07,140
While making as much money as we can possibly get away with.

835
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,320
Because when it comes down to it.

836
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,040
Like the feller there from that.

837
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,940
That movie June or whatever it was.

838
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,140
Was saying it's uh.

839
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:16,800
Yeah, Henry and June.

840
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:20,340
It's what it comes down to is the money.

841
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,500
Speaking of which.

842
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,280
We used to have a one.

843
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,880
Well, we do have a 1-900 number.

844
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,220
But I can't tell you about it.

845
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:32,180
I can play stuff that was cut from the 1-900 number.

846
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,300
For being too obscene.

847
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,340
But yet is probably just fine for the radio.

848
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,580
Friends, this is Mistress Connie's confidential.

849
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,020
I'm gonna go.

850
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:41,640
Hotline.

851
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,700
Uh-huh.

852
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,840
I figured you'd call.

853
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,920
I thought you were a masturbator.

854
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,700
Oh, don't try to deny it.

855
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,640
You have been bad.

856
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,200
Very, very bad.

857
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,880
Bad subgenius.

858
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:53,700
Quote me.

859
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:54,540
Book of the subgenius.

860
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,360
Page 132.

861
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:56,000
Paragraph 3.

862
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:56,600
Write this instant.

863
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,660
I didn't think you could do it.

864
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:03,060
And the ledger of souls here shows that you haven't spent more than $10 on holy church

865
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,360
products in two years.

866
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,420
Some high priest of sacred abnormality you are.

867
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:11,020
Well, bitch goddess Connie Dobbs knows just right.

868
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:11,020


869
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:11,020


870
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:11,020


871
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:11,020


872
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:11,020


873
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:11,020


874
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:11,020


875
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:11,020


876
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:11,800
What to do about that?

877
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,160
Don't try to wheedle your way out of this.

878
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,080
You're gonna get what's coming to you.

879
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,200
And I think you know just what that is.

880
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,600
That's right, you slackless backslider.

881
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,960
The punishment cone.

882
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,220
Go get it right now.

883
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,040
Bring it to me.

884
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,580
Not that way, you idiot.

885
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,700
Wipe off the Devo blood first.

886
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,520
Now, see this.

887
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,580
You know what this is, don't you?

888
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:37,160
Well, I want you to take those big red straps and strap it to your head.

889
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:38,880
That's right, your head.

890
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:39,900
Do as I say.

891
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:40,960
Can't you understand?

892
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:41,000
I'm not a priest.

893
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,000


894
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,000


895
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,000


896
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,000


897
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,000


898
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,000


899
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,000


900
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,920
I understand English, you worm.

901
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,280
God, you look ridiculous.

902
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,280
You have no idea how pathetic you look to me right now.

903
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,240
I wish your so-called guru Bob could see you now.

904
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,320
Some warrior of endless slack.

905
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:53,980
Wouldn't he be impressed?

906
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,000
Why, you'd make even Bob puke.

907
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:59,260
Well, I'm gonna beat the pingness out of your withered little soul.

908
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,460
And then after that, I'm gonna beat the Yeti back into it.

909
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,920
Now get down on our knees, you whining bobby.

910
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,820
Mindless, useless, little cult fanatic slack vampire.

911
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,420
You're not worthy of kissing Bob's mighty toes.

912
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,880
Assume submission posture number three.

913
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,740
Mistress Connie commands you now.

914
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,620
Get into those restraints right now.

915
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:17,400
Hurry up, that's it.

916
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:19,360
Just like a little doggy.

917
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,180
Grobby, you slutty little slave.

918
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,400
Worship me, beg.

919
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,700
Take that, and that, and that.

920
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,740
Now here's one for good measure.

921
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:29,560
You never know pleasure until you've tasted real pain.

922
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:32,000
You'll never know slack until it's been taken away.

923
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:35,380
So I guess that makes this your lucky day, doesn't it?

924
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,200
Silence that whimpering.

925
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,320
You're playing by my rules now, buster.

926
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,400
Put on that mask.

927
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:40,400


928
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,320
That's it.

929
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,100
Over your head.

930
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,200
Strap it on tight.

931
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:44,020
Ooh.

932
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,440
Now I'm gonna button those eye flaps shut so you can't see what I'm going to do to you.

933
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:51,040
Now bend down and I'll lock you into position.

934
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,040
Now listen closely to me.

935
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,600
I'm going to put something up against your mouth.

936
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,060
Something warm and hot and juicy.

937
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,900
And you're going to eat it, slave.

938
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:02,820
But you're not just going to eat it.

939
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,580
You're going to eat the hell out of it.

940
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,440
Now dig in, you pink little piglet.

941
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:07,400
Oh.

942
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,240
Oh.

943
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:08,960
All right.

944
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:10,800
That's enough.

945
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:13,400
I cook a pretty mean hamburger, don't I?

946
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,160
Say it.

947
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:16,600
You cook a mean hamburger, Mr. Skani.

948
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:17,020
Say it.

949
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,040
All right.

950
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,080
You're excused until next time.

951
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,860
Banish yourself from my presence.

952
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:29,480
Everybody will see you for what you are, some soft, slimy bottom feeder who voluntarily

953
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:36,300
lives in a cage of laws, sucking up crap and garbage filtered from the real world by

954
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,760
your screen of laws.

955
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:38,220
Oh.

956
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:43,740
I get it.

957
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:45,760
I feel like I'm being

958
00:49:45,760 --> 00:50:01,340
Who would you besehen

959
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,360
with killing God or tribes?

960
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:02,360


961
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:02,560
harm than slack entrees.

962
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:02,680
Then you.

963
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:05,020
Than eat your meat.

964
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,340
Within one or two hours.

965
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:11,100
Old man, your talent in life is keeping people convinced that they should feed, protect,

966
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,960
and obey you because of your flapping mouth.

967
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:19,240
You and your laws stink of lingering death, old man.

968
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:25,660
An old geezer who doesn't do anything but hang around a courthouse every day, all day

969
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:32,840
long, and who gets his power from those millions of laws, laws, laws, isn't gonna mind if they

970
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:38,440
pass more and more laws to restrict freedom because you don't want people to be free to

971
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,140
tell you, go to hell, old man.

972
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:47,700
Your laws perpetuate the rule of the over-aged and unfit.

973
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:54,320
You got everybody convinced that we need wise old men like you to run things and make decisions

974
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,780
because you have experience.

975
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:02,480
Yeah, well, the experience you got from World War I led straight to World War II.

976
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,460
You do, old man.

977
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,380
That's the value of your damned experience.

978
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,800
Who says you're wise?

979
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,020
You do, old man.

980
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:16,600
You have to keep reminding us that your age and learning have brought wisdom or people

981
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:23,240
might wake up and realize that the decisions, the laws, the orders of old men like you through

982
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:28,520
the ages have been the cause of every war, have been the cause of industrial wage slavery

983
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:29,820
and poverty.

984
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,380
Old men like yourself.

985
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:32,460


986
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:37,960
You pump poisons into the air and water for money, money, money, and all while you keep

987
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:42,660
your mouth flapping so nobody will notice that you're incompetent and screwing it all

988
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,260
up, old man.

989
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:52,100
Yeah, you sit there today surrounded by your armies and police and command a herd of sheep

990
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:58,660
who are even more stupid and wretched than yourself and your laws, your million and one

991
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:01,840
nitpicking, ponderous, stifling laws.

992
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:02,460
You're a million and one.

993
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:02,460


994
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:07,200
Your laws protect you from me, old man.

995
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,280
Suckin' on a young man's blood.

996
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:16,400
The body of his mother rotting in the summer ground, he fled the town.

997
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:19,460
Went down south and crossed the border.

998
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:27,860
Bob's Slack Time Funhouse is a product of the Atlanta Church of the Subgenius polymorphously

999
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:30,640
perverse local radio outreach ministry.

1000
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:32,440
And yes, I'm a fan.

1001
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:32,440


1002
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:37,380
My brethren and sistren in, under, through, and around, but never over, Bob.

1003
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:43,280
And Connie, this show right here is Bob's Slacktime Funhouse.

1004
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:55,960
And I'm your polymorphously indeterminate master of ceremonies and pastor for this Sunday morning of religious observances and related Bobfoolery, Reverend Dr. Nolan Void.

1005
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:59,060
This is a religious show, after all.

1006
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:09,820
And, in fact, I have even had a very much sort of a religious experience myself just recently, which I will share with you at incredible length and greater detail than you can probably stand.

1007
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:13,540
But that's the nature of this religion, my friends.

1008
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:19,360
You get to ranting and venting about all those cool things that Bob does to you.

1009
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,240
And, well, time just gets to fly.

1010
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:24,540
But before that, I've got some other things I want to share with you.

1011
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,240
Yeah, but you ain't going to.

1012
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:27,420
No, sir.

1013
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,020
Dr. Nolan Void?

1014
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:30,960
We're going to have to give you some more time next week.

1015
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,020
Yes, friends, from WREK in Atlanta.

1016
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:40,080
An excerpt there from Dr. Nolan Void's Bob's Slacktime Funhouse.

1017
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,640
Yes, dear friends.

1018
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,820
Or every law of the land, excuse me.

1019
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:48,820
They're going to find loopholes in ways and means to push the products that they want to push.

1020
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,940
And you've heard it said that the pendulum swings from one extreme to the other.

1021
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,580
Well, many people have been saying optimistically that we've had all the nudity.

1022
00:53:58,580 --> 00:53:58,800
We've had all the nudity.

1023
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,740
We've had all the filth and smut the nation can stand.

1024
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,480
Not quite.

1025
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,080
And that the pendulum is about to swing the other way.

1026
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:04,440
Yeah.

1027
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:07,640
Well, David Wilkerson says that he wishes that were true,

1028
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:12,660
but he fully believes from his vision that the flood of filth that he's seen coming

1029
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:16,120
is the same kind of flood spoken of by the prophet Nahum.

1030
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,520
Oh, the flood of Pernambuco.

1031
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:22,280
And in Nahum 3, chapter 3, verses 5 and 6, it says,

1032
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,820
Behold, I am against thee, saith the Lord of hosts,

1033
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:27,860
and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face,

1034
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:28,780
and I will show the nation.

1035
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:31,220
thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.

1036
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,320
And I will cast abominable filth upon thee,

1037
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:38,040
and make thee vile, and I will set thee as a gazing stock.

1038
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:39,940
That doesn't sound very good.

1039
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:47,020
I feel so pure, so strong, so new, Henry.

1040
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:50,960
You and I together, not any man or woman together.

1041
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:52,260
Yes.

1042
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:56,000
I'm gonna demand everything of you.

1043
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,040
Even the impossible.

1044
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:02,880
Because you encourage it.

1045
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:06,000
Maybe I should get down on my knees and worship you.

1046
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,800
I'm going to undress you.

1047
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:14,020
Vulgarize you a bit.

1048
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:15,520
Vulgarize?

1049
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,640
Lift up your dress.

1050
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,680
No, Henry, not here.

1051
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,140
I'll teach you things.

1052
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,260
And milliate you a little.

1053
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:25,840
I'll teach you a little.

1054
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,780
You're gonna have to wrap your leg around me.

1055
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:29,740
Yes, leg.

1056
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:34,560
This is getting a little bit too scary for radio.

1057
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:42,500
Reagan's polyp.

1058
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:55,280
I like to talk to waiters, or janitors, about pleasure.

1059
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:03,780
Any woman in a brown uniform vacuuming a supply closet deserves to hear of how I take my pleasure.

1060
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:16,560
I use products exclusively designed at the Colorado-Little-Town Institute of Technology, or CLIT, manufacturing personal devices of unspeakable filth since 1951.

1061
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,440
My favorite product is this.

1062
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:21,900
The call annulator.

1063
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:27,040
It gives literal meaning to the phrase, tear yourself anew.

1064
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:36,860
I have already installed four new orifices in my body so that I may interface with up to six creatures at once, transfixing my body with all men of religious impatience emanating from the depths of my brain.

1065
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,100
It's a source of pride.

1066
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,900
Pleasure is so important.

1067
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,300
Pleasure is so important.

1068
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:51,880
Pleasure is so important.

1069
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:57,000
Remove the ghost woman. Prepare her for our pleasure.

1070
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:11,480
And then there's the chicken bone love fetish.

1071
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:19,540
I got on top of a horse. I got on top of a horse.

1072
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:23,520
I got on top of a horse. I said I got on top of a horse.

1073
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,140
So what?

1074
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:28,680
Delicious little catties. Delicious little catties.

1075
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:32,360
Delicious little catties. All touching my body.

1076
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:38,380
This is what the Lord has showed David was there to be a temporary setback for smut.

1077
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:43,160
But again, the Bible seems to indicate in the last days that the hearts and intentions of men are towards evil.

1078
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:45,440
And they love pleasure more than they love God.

1079
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,780
So things are going to continue to deteriorate.

1080
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:51,860
In page 50 in the book On the Vision by David Wilkerson.

1081
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,100
Uh, yes friends, he may be right.

1082
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:03,240
And if you want more pleasure, then please write for free information from the Church of the Subgenius.

1083
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:07,320
You can write to Bob. Yes, Bob.

1084
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:10,000
Hey, where'd my background music go?

1085
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:16,960
At Bob at Box 140303.

1086
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:21,440
306 Dallas, Texas 75214

1087
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:25,220
Once again, that's Box 140306

1088
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:28,860
Dallas Texas 75210

1089
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:31,960
You can just drop us a self-addressed stamped envelope,

1090
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:37,860
and we'll send you some information about other subgenius information that you can get your hands on

1091
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:44,080
that we can't just advertise madly over a public radio station like this since we're not paying for it.

1092
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,360
Once again, that's Bob at P.O. Box 140303.

1093
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:46,480
Bob at P.O. Box 140303.

1094
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:46,940
Once again, that's Bob at P.O. Box 140303.

1095
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:54,960
Box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

1096
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:58,300
And if you already know what you want and have that credit card number,

1097
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:05,540
you can, of course, call 1-888-669-2323.

1098
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,380
Don't be scared.

1099
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:10,080
It's only a coincidence.

1100
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:17,120
He talks about the sin of Solomon is coming.

1101
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,540
Coming, coming, coming, coming.

1102
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:22,120
I feel so much better having done that.

1103
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:26,840
Well, we will dip back into some slack in a moment here

1104
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:30,560
after we've all kind of rearranged our clothing and that kind of stuff

1105
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,260
and kind of popped over the waves in the background.

1106
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:38,240
I feel inundated with slack myself.

1107
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:39,160
I feel it.

1108
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:39,840
Ooh.

1109
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,320
It's even flowing through my body.

1110
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,080
I feel like a sponge, and I haven't really absorbed enough yet

1111
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,100
to have a real good night.

1112
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:49,800
And I'm kind of wondering if folks out there are soaking it up or what.

1113
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:50,780
Are they saturated?

1114
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:53,980
I know that water in your ear isn't usually really good,

1115
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,440
but if you lie down and let it run out, it's kind of a pleasurable sensation.

1116
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:00,520
Yeah, almost like the trickle-down theory, but it really, really works.

1117
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:01,240
Right.

1118
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:04,020
So trickle-out theory, perhaps.

1119
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,900
One of the things that the Lord showed David Wilkerson

1120
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,880
is that the sins of Sodom will be repeated again,

1121
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:10,720
and our generation.

1122
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:16,480
And, of course, the homosexual attacks by the Sodomite mobs

1123
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,020
trying to molest innocent people.

1124
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:20,280
If you go back into the book of Genesis,

1125
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:23,280
and we remember Abraham and Lot, their relationship,

1126
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:24,800
and how Lot lived in the city.

1127
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:27,840
And one day the angels came to visit Lot,

1128
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:30,300
and the men of the city pounded him,

1129
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:32,140
tried to knock down the door of his home,

1130
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,200
trying to get in there and have relations with the angels.

1131
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,360
And, of course, that's one of the major reasons

1132
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,640
that God destroyed those two cities

1133
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:39,580
was because of their...

1134
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,120
sins.

1135
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,920
But the Lord has shown him that during our day and time

1136
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,760
that there will be wild, roving mobs of homosexual men

1137
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,560
that will publicly assault innocent people in parks and on the streets.

1138
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:57,160
And, again, you know, when this was written back in the early 1970s,

1139
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,520
that sounded pretty far-fetched.

1140
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:03,880
Who would ever believe that things could degenerate to that point in America?

1141
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,220
But, again, as we look at what's going on in the national scene

1142
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:09,140
and the news and radio,

1143
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:09,740
and newspapers,

1144
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:12,620
this is not as far-fetched as it once seemed.

1145
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,580
The groundwork is being laid for that.

1146
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:15,560
Laid for that.

1147
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:16,020
Laid for.

1148
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:16,300
Laid.

1149
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:16,680
Laid.

1150
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:17,020
Laid.
