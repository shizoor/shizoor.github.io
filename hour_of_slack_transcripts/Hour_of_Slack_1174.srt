1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
Boys and girls, your attention please.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:10,640
Presenting a new exciting radio program featuring the thrilling adventures of an amazing and incredible personality.

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,580
Bob the Self Genius.

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,180
Power of Swag.

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,300
Abnormal Perversion.

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:20,480
Uh-oh.

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,680
Most normal people enjoy a sacred pact with society.

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,780
Live a good life and society will take care of you.

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,980
But if society drops the ball, then someone else has to pick up the slack.

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,780
That's where I come in.

11
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:05,160
Some of you I know probably didn't hear the first program or the last program, I guess I had to say.

12
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,260
I did with Bob.

13
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,400
He is a fascinating guy.

14
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,620
Gee, Bob, you know what?

15
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,060
I'm going to start at the end.

16
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,940
How do you now remember that?

17
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,220
Do you remember it fondly?

18
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,520
Do you remember it as something you wish you hadn't done or what?

19
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:21,620
Hmm.

20
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,660
I have to place myself back in that time.

21
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,480
Well, there...

22
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,760
It's one of the...

23
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,480
That's kind of a loaded question because there was a lot of stuff going on at that time.

24
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,560
And I can't really say what the actual motivation was back then.

25
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,000
You know, specifically what made it...

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,700
You know, what made me snap on that day.

27
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:50,420
Do you have any idea how they sufficiently back-engineered Bob?

28
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,400
You could burn, you know, penetrate, destroy.

29
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,380
Who knows?

30
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,760
Maybe by this time research has continued and they've actually come up with something.

31
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,980
You obviously thought they were going to kill you.

32
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,160
Oh, no question.

33
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,240
So, um...

34
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,620
I already lost my train of thought.

35
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,640
Well, let me put you back in that chair.

36
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:24,100
Now, that must have taken great big ones to sit in that chair and say that on television.

37
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:24,920
Oh, God.

38
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,700
Giddy up.

39
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,020
Ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom.

40
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,620
Oh, mom.

41
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,360
Bob.

42
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,440
Good enough for me and Bob.

43
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:31,920
Bob.

44
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,520
Bob.

45
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:32,800
Bob.

46
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,240
Bob.

47
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:33,440
Bob.

48
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,220
Bob.

49
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,920
Bob.

50
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,300
Here, look.

51
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,240
Yeah.

52
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,500
Ha ha ha ha ha.

53
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,560
Just look around.

54
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,600
The smart money knows the truth.

55
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,980
Ha ha ha ha ha.

56
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,660
Fucker.

57
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,500
I'm getting on that ground floor.

58
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,920
The Soul Genius.

59
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,700
Power calls.

60
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:52,660
What?

61
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,000
What?

62
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,020


63
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,700
Have you looked at them?

64
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,720
Crooks.

65
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,240
Gangsters.

66
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:56,720
Bums.

67
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,260
Hobos.

68
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,900
Drunks.

69
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,460
And I don't know.

70
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:58,840
I don't know what.

71
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,860
They are a little picturesque, aren't they?

72
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,460
But what kind of a society are you going to start with them?

73
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,400
Snobbish are you?

74
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,820
To make a decent place, you need bums and alcoholics and criminals.

75
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,120
Oh.

76
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,340
Well, guess so.

77
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,420
Guess so.

78
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,280
Guess so.

79
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,780
Why calibrate chipped, unhip indexes needlessly?

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,600
Forget that old, whole, mole, mill dude, wheezing and ill-wheeling veco-cyclometer.

81
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,660
It's the innovation that needs no introduction.

82
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,980
Introducing the incredible invisible visualizer.

83
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,560
Imagine.

84
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,500
Reactive or reductive transduction.

85
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,960
Conducted individually for any given situation.

86
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,020
From simplistic to out and out ritualistic.

87
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,880
It's a tabulation fixation that's transforming a pixelated and fictitious nation.

88
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,160
Not a masturbation station, but a Haitian vacation situation.

89
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:46,020
That's an integration of elation unrelated to inflation or any other type of conflagration.

90
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:46,980
Turnation.

91
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,900
How does it work?

92
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,340
The invisible visualizer indivisibly integrates individual integers intelligently.

93
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,500
No more messy office.

94
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,480
Mutilate that rebooted too cute computer.

95
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,480
Fold that old, new, and old.

96
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,460
Recocked calculator.

97
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,740
Spindle your boss and give him the talks.

98
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,820
Don't miss the piss dish.

99
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,840
No more nose mess.

100
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,240
Dental floss crossed off.

101
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,500
It's the revamp champion.

102
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,500
Ample chapped apple samples for cramped grandma hampers.

103
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:09,780
Yes!

104
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,800
Trim fur-fat feces from creased, greasy leeches or smooth and teasy peaches.

105
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,200
Replaces braces in all sorts of places without traces in hundreds of cases.

106
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:17,860
And look.

107
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,700
Set fire to it, it consumes itself.

108
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,500
Tent mount to industrial sabotage.

109
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,820
Savage grace?

110
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,960
It can be yours instantly.

111
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,480
The invisible visualizer balances the biometric forces behind most things.

112
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:27,700
It can be used to make a good divorce.

113
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,160
Yins the yang chain between the brain and the anus.

114
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,820
And double bonus.

115
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,320
Removes the onus betwixt animation and animus.

116
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,220
Plus, double fucked on the bus or in the crux between waxed biscuits or extra crust.

117
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,900
It does the thinking for you.

118
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,960
Now how much would you pay?

119
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,120
But wait, there's more.

120
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,260
Order now and receive an extra ounce of Bob's Blessing on every steak you eat for the next 16 years.

121
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,140
That's every steak, diseased or not.

122
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,800
Plus the handsome penguin replica scissors that we talked about earlier.

123
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,080
My invisible visualizer gave my tweezers the breeze.

124
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,980
Now my unibrow intimidates the dentist.

125
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,380
And gets me bumped up in line at the supermarket.

126
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,220
Thanks to the all-seeing fourth eye of my invisible visualizer,

127
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,800
I replace lunch with hunch and now I'm always in control of everything.

128
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,120
Remember, if everybody on the planet gets just one invisible visualizer,

129
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,080
we will all live as gods and peace and tranquility will reign on Earth for thousands of years.

130
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,780
But until then, why not get your own and completely rule in every conceivable way

131
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,460
over your foolish friends and neighbors who are too stupid to get one themselves

132
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,120
through this once-in-a-lifetime TV offer. Order yours today.

133
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,020
And I'll be back with a new episode of the Invisible Visualizer.

134
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,000
And welcome to the hour of slack number 1174.

135
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:41,700
The Invisible Visualizer ad just then is from Reverend Lebo Abernathy with Cynthia King and D Street.

136
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:48,080
The titles are by Leemur and the Bob collage was by Reverend Chuck Key.

137
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,740
There are some subgenius events coming up in November which I might want to mention.

138
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:05,240
The second Baltimore Divival in Baltimore, Maryland happens Saturday, November 15th at Load of Fun.

139
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:10,520
For more information about that, see subgenius.com events.

140
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:18,940
This one features Reverend Carter LeBlanc, Priestess Pisces, the amino acids and fat free and yours truly and who knows what else.

141
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,640
Then in the Dutch city of Amsterdam,

142
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,720
during the week of November,

143
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,920
November 23rd through 27th,

144
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,480
the Fromm Cup and Divivals will happen.

145
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,340
I'm not sure where yet.

146
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,220
And meanwhile, there are two new stations carrying this show, the hour of slack.

147
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:47,100
KXUA in Fayetteville, Arkansas and Resonance FM in London, England.

148
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,980
Praise Bob.

149
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,580
This is a former captain.

150
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,380
Bob Jamison is with us.

151
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,920
And in Peoria, Illinois is Dr. Bob Jacobs.

152
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,700
All of our guests are named Bob.

153
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,200
Bob.

154
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,440
Bob.

155
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,500
Bob.

156
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,200
All of our guests are named Bob.

157
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,680
Bob Sallis is a former captain.

158
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,420
Bob Jamison is with us.

159
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,920
And in Peoria, Illinois is Dr. Bob Jacobs.

160
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,680
All of our guests are named Bob.

161
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,040
Bob Sallis is a former captain.

162
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,900
Bob Jamison is with us.

163
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,420
And in Peoria, Illinois is Dr. Bob Jacobs.

164
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,260
All of our guests are named Bob.

165
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,240
Bob Should Know Who's there.

166
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,660
K-üll-Reed J.

167
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:23,780
K-üll-Reed.

168
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:23,840
Thanks, K- ambigu.

169
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:23,840


170
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:23,900
Of course, Eva Tech.

171
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:23,900


172
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:23,900


173
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:23,900


174
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:23,900


175
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,480
Yeah, yeah.

176
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,060
I love Bob and I'm not ashamed of it.

177
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,460
Good.

178
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,760
Some people are.

179
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,520
Ooh, I love that Bob.

180
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,440
Our next guest, Bob.

181
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,640
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

182
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,300
All right, always good to hear your take, Bob.

183
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,940
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

184
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,200
Vote for Bob voting for Bob.

185
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:40,580
Oh my.

186
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,300
Back in a second with Bob.

187
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,360
Back in a minute with Bob.

188
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,700
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

189
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,280
Love for Bob.

190
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,020
Big on Bob.

191
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:46,720
Big on Bob.

192
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,040
Really?

193
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,560
Really?

194
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,420
Well, welcome back to the most politics in the world.

195
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:49,900
That was Bob.

196
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,800
Vote for Bob.

197
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,420
Vote for Bob.

198
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:51,820
Bob.

199
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,480
Bob2008.com.

200
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,220
Do it, Bob.

201
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,900
Do it, Bob.

202
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,340
Bob had a great sense of humor.

203
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,620
Bob was a great war hero and Bob.

204
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,580
And Bob always had a pen in his hand.

205
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,320
He's a heck of a guy, by the way.

206
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,400
Bob stood up.

207
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,980
Bob, great pleasure having you on.

208
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,340
All right, so what about Bob?

209
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,140
Bob ain't happy.

210
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,420
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

211
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:08,880
Bob, Bob.

212
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:09,860
Bob, Bob, Bob.

213
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,720
The next president of the United States.

214
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,500
Bob.

215
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,120
Vicey.

216
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,600
Vicey.

217
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,820
The marijuana for Bob.

218
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,380
Think tank.

219
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:15,840
Bob.

220
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,140
Thank you for your time tonight, sir.

221
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:17,880
Bob, Bob, Bob.

222
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,880
Be a spoiler for Bob.

223
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,840
Be a spoiler for Bob.

224
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,100
All right, let's talk a little bit about Bob.

225
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:22,740
Bob.

226
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,260
And then Bob.

227
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:23,940
And Bob.

228
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,440
It's Bob.

229
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,600
And he said to me, Bob.

230
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,220
Bob, I love you.

231
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,660
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

232
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,260
He's tight.

233
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:29,840
He's tight.

234
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,100
My point is, Bob.

235
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:31,920
Thank you, Bob.

236
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,560
Go, Bob.

237
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:32,960
Go, Bob.

238
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,360
Go, Bob.

239
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:33,760
Go, Bob.

240
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,300
Bob, Bob.

241
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,180
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

242
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,140
First time I ever met him, I was totally impressed.

243
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:39,620
Oh, my.

244
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,400
He's the worst kind of charlatan and raconteur you can imagine.

245
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:51,900
He's built a multi-million dollar empire out of duping the American public with this scheme.

246
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,820
Movement.

247
00:08:53,460 --> 00:09:05,180
And it's nothing more than a series of rambling, solipsistic musings about relieving oneself of all sense of personal responsibility and responsibility to the community, too.

248
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:16,600
And worse than that, we have information from inside sources that he's beginning to get a little off in the head and his business managers having to run everything for him.

249
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,880
I devoted myself to exposing this leader for the fraud that he's been doing.

250
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,280
And he is.

251
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,860
Are you all right?

252
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
I'm a tooth.

253
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,500
It's just Bob is what it is.

254
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,380
It's just, it's literally Bob.

255
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,840
Good evening.

256
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,060
This is an extraordinary period for America's economy.

257
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:46,820
Over the past few weeks, many Americans have teetered on the edge of collapse and they face imminent collapse.

258
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,520
And families and businesses have frozen and some have failed.

259
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,580
And this created a problem.

260
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,920
We must not let this happen.

261
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,980
Fellow citizens, large and small, I announced a plan on Friday.

262
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,340
Unfortunately, I'm a strong believer in government intervention.

263
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,480
I believe companies that make cars should go out of business.

264
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,260
Yet history has shown that in times of real trial, elected officials responding with decisive action.

265
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,100
As a result, our entire economy is in danger.

266
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:31,660
It is difficult to pass a bill that commits so much of the taxpayers hard earned money for many members of Congress for their own personal gain as soon as possible.

267
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,340
Most importantly, it will help American consumers get jobs.

268
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:43,680
And together we will show the world once again what kind of country America is, where people of every background meet great tests.

269
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,840
I know many Americans have questions tonight.

270
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,840
First, how?

271
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,700
Second, what?

272
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,780
These are good questions and they deserve clear answers.

273
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,720
Thank you for listening.

274
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,260
May God bless you.

275
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,600
From PR News in Washington, I'm headed for the northern Atlantic Ocean.

276
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,000
On Wall Street, 2-2-10-4-6-6-6-6-1.

277
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,120
But the numbers are a bit misleading.

278
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,240
Firstly, consumers continue to plummet.

279
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,760
Secondly, consumers falling at their steepest rate in years.

280
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:21,860
Yes.

281
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,040
And the

282
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,240
third-in-line, the

283
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,240


284
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,560
third-in-line.

285
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,380
The federal government announced today that in an effort to eradicate the national debt,

286
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:47,000
it will be selling the state of Rhode Island to a group of private investors for a reported $18 billion.

287
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,860
The investors plan to enclose the entire state with an all-weather route that will allow the state to continue to grow.

288
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,960
They also invite investors to purchase goods daily from neighbors once a month their

289
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,340
attached USDzer and CURT lighting and digital renting space are held high.

290
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:57,340


291
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:57,340


292
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,640
Thank you.

293
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,260
We can control Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

294
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,320
Continue to play.

295
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,920
The Federal Reserve Act to prevent the Federal Reserve.

296
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,260
My administration is focused on illegal market manipulation.

297
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,040
The American people can be sure we will continue

298
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,180
disorderly failure.

299
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,700
Financial markets weak.

300
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,700
Financial markets weak.

301
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,140
Financial markets weak.

302
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:34,900
Financial markets.

303
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,560
Financial markets.

304
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,220
Financial markets.

305
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,040
Financial markets.

306
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,080
A-A-A-A-A-A-I-U-C.

307
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,580
Thank you.

308
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,600
Bridge to Nowhere.

309
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,560
Bridge to Nowhere.

310
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,660
Bridge to Nowhere.

311
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,060
Bridge to Nowhere.

312
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:55,100
Bridge to Nowhere

313
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,140
Bridge to Nowhere

314
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:15,040
Bridge to Nowhere

315
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:46,040
Bridge to Nowhere

316
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,040
Bridge to Nowhere

317
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:28,620
Bridge to Nowhere

318
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,880
Bridge to Nowhere

319
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:45,400
Bridge to Nowhere

320
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:58,260
Bridge to Nowhere

321
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:32,180
Bridge to Nowhere

322
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:16,040
Bridge to Nowhere

323

Bridge to Nowhere

324
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:16,040
Bridge to Nowhere

325
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:30,460
Bridge to Nowhere

326
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,940
All the weights that keep me down

327
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,400
Seem heavier than before

328
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,660
They just take it by the pace

329
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,160
Though you feel confident

330
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,540
Only time will heal you soon

331
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,080
Your words must never be

332
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,960
But half of me is gone

333
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,160
My dearest treasure is gone away

334
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:05,360
I'll stick with you until the end of the world

335
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,860
I'll cry out loud but you hear nothing

336
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,120
I'll wait for you until the end of the world

337
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,300
My dearest treasure is gone away

338
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,780
All the weights that keep me down

339
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:39,800
That mashup came from a YouTube production by TheMaverickMJ

340
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,560
who is also heard in the background.

341
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,340
That video is called

342
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,780
There Is An Answer.

343
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,580
You'll be hearing more from TheMaverickMJ.

344
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,000
But now, let us drift back to Radio Synesthesia

345
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,320
from WCSB Cleveland

346
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,580
with Dr. Howell and Dr. Sinister

347
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,980
and Dave and we

348
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,400
just after 11X Day.

349
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,020
Well, let's take another caller here.

350
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,420
Hello, you're on the air.

351
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,540
Hello, you're on the air.

352
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,080
I just want to remind everyone that

353
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,540
Ted Ramey also played Lieutenant O'Neill

354
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,880
on Sequest DSV.

355
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,320
I actually played him on Sequest DSV.

356
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,380
I actually have his action figure.

357
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,860
That doesn't surprise me.

358
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,720
Ted Ramey action figure?

359
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,200
There was a J.R. Bob Dobbs action figure

360
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,500
displayed at X-Day

361
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,620
and what happened to that?

362
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,960
What happened to the Bob Bobbles?

363
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,580
The Bobblehead Bobbs?

364
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,960
It was laid upon the hood of the car

365
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,080
of I, Dr. Mr. Sister

366
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,380
when he was doing the

367
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,460
here in my car thing

368
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,260
and that was the last time that I saw it.

369
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,400
Well, I thought he was perforating

370
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,080
an ophthalmological operation

371
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,300
when he was sitting there.

372
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:43,680
I was sitting there for a while

373
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,200
and then I noticed a car levitating.

374
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,780
It was like a Dobbs homunculus.

375
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,040
A tiny baby homunculus.

376
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,420
The first step.

377
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,100
But there really was a large,

378
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,940
it was kind of a large action figure,

379
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,240
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

380
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,480
Most of them were about the size of a G.I. Joe

381
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,280
back when Hasbro was making them.

382
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,240
The Bob figures.

383
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,660
But this was some new,

384
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,880
I guess a Japanese company

385
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,080
must be making those.

386
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,180
They certainly never talked to us about it.

387
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,020
It jumped around just until it had a,

388
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,220
a groin spasm

389
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,260
and you had to sit down for a while

390
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,160
and I guess they gave it something to drink

391
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,080
and then the thing took off

392
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,340
and stole somebody's car.

393
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,180
I sure can't lie.

394
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,580
Perhaps it was a cleverly made Bob robot.

395
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,600
Bob's Action Bordello

396
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,400
sold separately.

397
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,620
He was holding his pipe

398
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,320
and not smoking it.

399
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,120
Now does the Bob Action Bordello

400
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,140
play set have a

401
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,580
Xavier Hollander action figure?

402
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,080
I think that should be in Bob's Bordello.

403
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,180
Why not put her smiling mug,

404
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,520
in the middle of Bob's Bordello?

405
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,740
The Xavier Hollander

406
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,440
Bordello, California.

407
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,400
action figure is an inflatable one.

408
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,140
You can have the young or old.

409
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:51,760
Shhh.

410
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,300
Shhh.

411
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,040
Shhh.

412
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,100
I'm having a little bit,

413
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,780
I'm having a high timer.

414
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,500
I can't get this side up.

415
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,060
It's not going to get it.

416
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,420
They want to get it a little bit closer to the water

417
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,360
so we can make it.

418
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,380
Now, Hal, be careful.

419
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,020
Be careful.

420
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,920
You could pass out doing that.

421
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,780
Don't over inflate her.

422
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:09,500
It's facing.

423
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,900
Oh, that's a good one.

424
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,280
Oh, that's a good one.

425
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:13,280


426
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:13,960
There's a sheep plant.

427
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,400
Look, there's a rip and it's in the wrong place.

428
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,640
That's rip in time, isn't it?

429
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,340
Or do we have to, what do we do now?

430
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,100
We have to do this show all over again.

431
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,100
Man, nice going.

432
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,760
Nice work.

433
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,660
Nice work.

434
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,920
You know what?

435
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,340
Listen, man, you screwed up the whole thing.

436
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,000
It was going down smooth as applesauce.

437
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,000
You know, I mean, things were working out for a lot of people, man.

438
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,200
You know what you jeopardized?

439
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,260
The whole Church of the Subdivision.

440
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,620
And you know what's going to happen to you when that dang guy gets a hold of you?

441
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,180
I don't have to tell you, man.

442
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,580
I don't have to tell you, man.

443
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,680
You're going to rip off your arms like a dead dog.

444
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,100
Rocknar, you know what happened because you weren't there?

445
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,180
I wouldn't want to be in your shoes when old man Stang gets back here.

446
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,940
It didn't rain.

447
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,220
Really?

448
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,860
Yes, because you were not there to have a tent full of expensive equipment to be ruined,

449
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,560
it never rained a drop.

450
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,660
You know, that's...

451
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,880
It was perfect weather.

452
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,600
So you can stay away.

453
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,320
For the last 15 years that I've been staying home from Brushwood, it actually rains in

454
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,520
Lexington now on the 4th of July.

455
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:24,200
A dark cloud follows Governor Rocknar wherever he goes, raining only on him, like that little

456
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,800
fellow in Fearless Fawcett's world.

457
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,240
Why's it always going to rain on me?

458
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,140
I thought that was Mr. Blitzel's physics.

459
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:36,000
No, Mr. Blitzel's physics was...

460
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,520
That's Joe Biffet's splink.

461
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,220
Joe.

462
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,740
Hal, I'm sure, can tell us all about that.

463
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,380
The world's most unlucky man, the opposite of Bob.

464
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:44,880
Right.

465
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:51,360
And with a name that was sort of the opposite of Bob's clumsy, if simple, name.

466
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,880
That's a schlamazel, as opposed to a schlamiel.

467
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,120
Wow.

468
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,500
Why, it's a little...

469
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,440
It's an action figure of Bob with...

470
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,400
Holding a book called X Day for Dummies.

471
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,000
Is this somebody going to read that damn thing?

472
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,160
How many years have we been trying this?

473
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,580
He's holding his pipe out of his mouth.

474
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,560
That's a really rare moment.

475
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,700
He attacked.

476
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,940
He tried to bite Dr. Hal.

477
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,860
He's got to get his slack somewhere, kids.

478
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,480
And like a mosquito who sucks blood, Bob sucks slack.

479
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,680
He'll fall out of the trees into your hair, lay eggs in your hair, and suck your slack out.

480
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,200
You think I'm kidding, man.

481
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,200
You'll see tomorrow morning.

482
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,920
Those poor chicken head people are right now getting their hair full of eggs.

483
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:38,960
Who made this?

484
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,040
Where did this come from?

485
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,680
Was it Dr. Dark?

486
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,500
Dr. Dark?

487
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,660
Some friends of ours gave it to us for Christmas.

488
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,800
For Christmas?

489
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,680
Your same friends with the funny names that helped make the Turd Awards?

490
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,260
No, no, they're different ones. They haven't joined yet.

491
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,840
They haven't joined the church and yet they've made graven images of Bob?

492
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,980
Now that's some nerve.

493
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,580
I know a woman who did a 6x12 painting of Bob.

494
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:06,120
Oh, that insight guy. That must be it.

495
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,480
There you go.

496
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:16,420
Oh, but Bob's eyes look like Bowie where he's hanging and that part in Ashes to Ashes where he just looks damned hopeless.

497
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,860
Startling apparition of the Dobbsian homunculus.

498
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:27,540
I don't like Bob Hopeless. I'd rather have him laughing at me than looking at me through the...

499
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:32,280
You wouldn't want him crying with his head all the way up your shawfugish.

500
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,880
Yeah, Bob Hopeless was really funny.

501
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:42,600
Some live X-Day show there with Suzie the floozy, Dr. Howell, Lonesome Cowboy Dave and the mini Bob.

502
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:49,940
Now we are honored to present a clip from the Ask Dr. Howell show on Pirate Cat Radio

503
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:58,600
for which Dr. Howell was able to get as a guest Presidential Candidate Senator John McTaint and his wife Cindy.

504
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:05,760
By the way, this audio is from a YouTube video of Dr. Howell's show by Puzzling Evidence.

505
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,480
TV.

506
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,440
You don't listen.

507
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,080
Your wife is calling for you, sir.

508
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,360
Yes.

509
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,640
Go right in there, sir. In the red door, sir.

510
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,620
This place smells like a stripper joint.

511
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,520
Secretive services surrounding Senator McTaint. He's re-entering the studio.

512
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,840
And what a crowd.

513
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,240
All right, everybody.

514
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:35,740
We are talking in the studio with Presidential Candidate Senator John McTaint.

515
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:42,060
And he and his posse have crowded into our Pirate Cat studio.

516
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,760
And it's a thick as molasses.

517
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,400
This is such a pleasure, Dr. Howell. This is such a pleasure.

518
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,400
We've listened to you every night for the last 20 years.

519
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,860
Well, the honor is all mine, Senator.

520
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,140
I'm glad that our little broadcast could do something to inculcate patriotism in a great American such as yourself.

521
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:03,340
Or the theme music from House of Frankenstein. What could be more patriotic?

522
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,120
Dr. Howell, I have a quick question for you.

523
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,580
Yes?

524
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,020
My dear.

525
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:10,880
I'd like to know if you may be interested in having a little menage a trois with my husband tonight.

526
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,940
Well, I suppose he may tire out and fall asleep early, eh?

527
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,980
Cindy, that doesn't have anything to do with fundraising. I told you to focus before you...

528
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:26,940
I'm afraid my funds are somewhat low, but I'm sure I could leave a sawbuck on the night table.

529
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,840
I mean, that is to say, I...

530
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,520
Well, let's talk about this further after the program.

531
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,780
The reality is we do need money.

532
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,460
That's right.

533
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,320
We do need some money.

534
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,420
That's right.

535
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:44,460
My money only goes so far. So if you would like to give, please look at the website, johnmctaint.com.

536
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,100
Dig deep down into the bottom of your wallet.

537
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,240
The more money you give to my campaign, the less you'll have.

538
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,220
That's right, and the less you can spend on frivolous expenditures.

539
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,360
That's right.

540
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,400
Which bleed the body politic joint.

541
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,040
To be honest, I love being me. I love my husband. I love our children.

542
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:02,620
That's right.

543
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,160
She went to Africa, okay.

544
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,960
I went to Africa. Our children are here in the studio tonight.

545
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:07,940
That's right.

546
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,440
We brought our six-month-old with us.

547
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:15,760
My kids were lined up against the wall right here. I see one crying right now.

548
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,480
Loyal.

549
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:24,620
Perhaps we'd like to put one of the McTaint youngsters on the air and see what their take is on their old man.

550
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,160
Mom, Dad.

551
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,900
We love you, baby. We love you, baby.

552
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,560
Billy, Billy, get back in the corner. Get away from the mic.

553
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,360
.

554
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,380
Have you had any fun with your dad today?

555
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,700
I haven't.

556
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,980
I think that's what's wrong with you.

557
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:39,520
.

558
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,400
Are you my daddy?

559
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,940
Oh, confusing thing. Say, did your mommy fix your hair?

560
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,800
Yeah, I wanted pigtails.

561
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,800
Oh, well, what a literal interpretation you received.

562
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,740
Okay, um, uh...

563
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:04,140
I'm not going to talk about my sex life with my wife on the radio.

564
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:11,240
You know what? Honey, any fool can be uncomfortable. And you don't have to talk about this because there's nothing wrong with that.

565
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:19,120
All I can say is that we do have some videos on the website, JohnMcTaint.com. JohnMcTaint.com.

566
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:27,140
And more, we need the money. We really need the money. Cindy... it's just beer money. It doesn't go far.

567
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,360
Yes, uh...

568
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:29,720
American.

569
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,660
Would you like to feel them, Dr. Hal?

570
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:36,160
Certainly. Yes, bring them right over here and I will palpate your subluxation.

571
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,920
On the air? You want me to do this? All right.

572
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,340
Okay.

573
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,720
Everything is there. All prisoners are accounted for.

574
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,960
Now, that is a natural breast. Is that not, my friend?

575
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:45,420
Yes.

576
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:51,220
That's the kind of healthcare we want for every American. There's nothing wrong with wanting a futon.

577
00:30:51,420 --> 00:31:00,660
Well, in your book, Follow the Law of Our Fathers, you talked about how you avoided a futon torpedo only to be tortured by Albanians while in custody

578
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:05,540
by repeated immersion in the litanies of Ross-Bagdas area.

579
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:16,480
I didn't whine. I got in the car when people told me to. You know, and we believe here at JohnMcTaint.com, we believe in green immigration policies.

580
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,660
Yes, if you're green, you can get in.

581
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:26,140
If you're green, if you get caught, you run on a treadmill and you electrify the fence to keep you away from your family that's trying to...

582
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,540
Ever fished under the electric fence?

583
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,960
I think we digress.

584
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,440
Yes.

585
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:34,420
So let's get back to the nitty-gritty, the masculine given case.

586
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,060
I just want to say a little something about the torture, actually.

587
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:37,600
Yes?

588
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,300
That improved our sex life.

589
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,800
Well, yeah.

590
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,420
Now, a little torture can go a long way.

591
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:51,640
And the reality is that my husband learned things that he has used to tantalize me in the bedroom.

592
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,740
And I look at that as a blessing.

593
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,280
We have done menage a trois.

594
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,220
Yes, that's right.

595
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,140
People called in.

596
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,480
Right, right, right.

597
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:04,140
Well, of course, they said a Mormon could never be president.

598
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,640
But what about an orgyist?

599
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,200
They have to be represented, don't they?

600
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,600
There's no reason to exclude anybody just because their genitals don't look like yours.

601
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,220
And few people do look like mine.

602
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,200
Tell them about the barrel, baby.

603
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,140
Tell them about the barrel.

604
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,280
One day, I took my clothes off.

605
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,440
I got in the barrel.

606
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:26,600
And when Cindy came home, I jumped out and there was oil all over me.

607
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,420
Oh, whoa.

608
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,400
Oh, yes.

609
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,240
These videos are most explicit.

610
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,380
Ron, please.

611
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,000
Here.

612
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,660
We discussed not discussing.

613
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,920
Oh, now you're shy, Cindy.

614
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:39,180
Cindy, I told you we're here to take money.

615
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,960
You were letting the DJ feel your breasts.

616
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:42,520
It's okay.

617
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,060
It's okay.

618
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:44,880
It's okay.

619
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,500
Thank you so much, caller.

620
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,220
Okay.

621
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,260
Yes, sanctuary.

622
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,080
Cindy, don't talk to him.

623
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:51,980
Like that?

624
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,240
If they don't give money, don't talk to him too much.

625
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,800
I will be looking for the check.

626
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,280
Gotta go.

627
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,840
You're boring me.

628
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,340
Can you please cut the call out for me?

629
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:58,360
Yes, that's all right.

630
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,720
Now, another question from the press pool.

631
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,680
Pete Goldie.

632
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,720
Yes, you, sir.

633
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,180
Yes, Senator.

634
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:12,140
Your presumptive opponent, Senator Obama, has a motto saying, it's change we can believe

635
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,380
on.

636
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:17,140
And my question for you, Senator, is what sort of change are we going to get from you?

637
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,260
We're not going to get change.

638
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,680
Change is slow, like a glacier.

639
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:25,440
When I take off my clothes at night, I just don't jump out of my clothes.

640
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,620
I slowly unbutton each button.

641
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,180
Look, it's easy.

642
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:28,560
It's a video.

643
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,160
It's a big, tall, red hot stuff.

644
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,680
We're looking for real legal Americans.

645
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:43,340
If your picture is not on a dollar bill, I'm not sure ... Cindy, help me with this.

646
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,800
Boy, what a party this is.

647
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,940
Even you can get a barrel of sweet crude oil.

648
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,180
Oh God, baby, talk about coming out of a barrel again.

649
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:54,280
Oh, in your state, maybe that's what you need is a big barrel of sweet crude oil.

650
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,200
Talk about coming out of a barrel again.

651
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:55,960
All oil's up.

652
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,780
This is Dr. Hell.

653
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,860
Cut the mic there, please.

654
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,340
Yeah.

655
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:58,340


656
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:58,340


657
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:58,340


658
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:58,340


659
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:58,340


660
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,300
Come to my house and you're the sweet prince.

661
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,580
Oh, look what they're doing now.

662
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,780
This can only help you, sir.

663
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,320
People, give us money.

664
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,280
We need it.

665
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,700
Give us money to John.

666
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,440
John McTain.

667
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,260
Go around to it.

668
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,240
Go around to it.

669
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:17,780
You know, they really are on message here, the McTain campaign.

670
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,620
Well, you have to be.

671
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:22,820
You know, the political pounding of the pavement is grueling.

672
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:29,040
It wears out more than the shoe lever here in the cities of America's hope and promise.

673
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,500
Dr. Howe?

674
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,360
Yes, ma'am?

675
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,240
Can you talk a bit more about the pounding?

676
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,680
I've really gone downhill today.

677
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,160
How do you mean?

678
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,520
I just...

679
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,920
Cindy, what are you doing?

680
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:44,920
I don't know.

681
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,720
I don't know what I'm doing anymore, Johnny.

682
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,760
My rod and my staff...

683
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,400
Two months to go and I am...

684
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:52,540
Oh.

685
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,580
Losing it.

686
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,400
Uh-oh.

687
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,740
One of the most amazing...

688
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,380
Hold it together.

689
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,160
Hold it together, Cindy.

690
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,360
Hold it together.

691
00:34:59,420 --> 00:34:59,920
Hold it together.

692
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,000
No.

693
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,500
I'll give you 20 bucks to take your top off.

694
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,600
Yes, I'm rapidly reverting to a state of infancy here.

695
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,300
The important part of it all is that my child is exposed to America.

696
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,900
Pregnant with emotion.

697
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,000
I am happy and in love.

698
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,880
And with patriotism for our great country.

699
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,020
And that's what happens when you are happy and in love and your husband has a really nice cock.

700
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,400
This is not even gonna...

701
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,280
No one's gonna hear this.

702
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,440
No one even listens to this goddamn station.

703
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,440
Oh, no.

704
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,260
This is a highly-branded program.

705
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,860
This is just a pit in our little hole.

706
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,160
They won't provide us with wonderful luxuries.

707
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,980
We're on NPR tomorrow night.

708
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,640
That's the liquor talking.

709
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,400
In vino veritas.

710
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,060
I heard a cat in my ass.

711
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:38,700
Meow.

712
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,460
Johnny, I love you too.

713
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:41,980
You know that.

714
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:48,920
One more question for Senator John McTaint, who's happily visiting us here in the studio.

715
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,080
Don't make it tough.

716
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,580
What are your thoughts?

717
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:57,440
If any, on the presidential power to deploy America's entire nuclear arsenal?

718
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:05,900
I think every legal real American should have a personal nuclear weapons launcher in their house at all times.

719
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,480
Right on.

720
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,340
If a boy scout comes to the door and wants to sell you cookies, no, you don't use it then.

721
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,480
You use discretion.

722
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,080
No, you're right. You're right.

723
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,140
Cindy, put the clothes back on.

724
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,960
Yeah, well, this is a great way to go out.

725
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,600
It's hot in here.

726
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,140
Yeah, it is. It is rather hot.

727
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:21,480
Because...

728
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,640
Because of the interested humanity pressing in.

729
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:28,440
But thank you, Senator John McTaint, for appearing on the Ask Dr. Hal show.

730
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,380
I'm sorry.

731
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,620
I'm out of control.

732
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,700
I'm out of control.

733
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:32,960
I know.

734
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,720
I am afraid such corrective things are necessary.

735
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:44,140
If some of you can actually keep your thoughts on the Akashic record and cash in whenever you feel like it, then go ahead.

736
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:51,460
But we're having problems, so any kind of sheaf paper, things you'd like to write on your underwear, on your...

737
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,380
I notice most of you have done some kind of scrawlings on your pants.

738
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,000
I notice a lot of the current generation write on their hands.

739
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,440
And you can...

740
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,060
Oh, you notice that?

741
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:00,660
Sure.

742
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,840
They write on their hands, huh?

743
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,820
Well, it's cheaper than one of those blueberries or whatever.

744
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,560
They call that cheating at Dave's masturbation camp, writing on your hands.

745
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:16,680
Besides which, it's almost like denying the sacrament of paper, which is such a wonderful substance.

746
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,940
But paper is plausible.

747
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,080
There's my mind.

748
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,940
I'm glad you've got those sheets.

749
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,300
Yeah.

750
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,240
I have mine, too.

751
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:27,220
Tucked away, those molding sheets of notes that one writes to oneself.

752
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:36,600
Oh, and also, I have, besides that, some cards, some official subgenius active member cards.

753
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:41,860
If there's anyone who doesn't have one of these cards, you should come up and receive one.

754
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,140
Sign your name on the back.

755
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,200
And this...

756
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,200
How many of those do you have?

757
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,860
There'll be Kino and Bingo later.

758
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,020
Those are very few and far between.

759
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,440
I don't think we just do it.

760
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:51,940
No.

761
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,420
No.

762
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:52,680
Really?

763
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:56,680
Jesus created the gold card seen here.

764
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,360
The subgenius gold card.

765
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:58,720
Right.

766
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:05,240
A few years ago with the brilliant idea that people would spend $1,000 just to have that gold card.

767
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:12,100
And believe it or not, five or six of them did, but they later wanted their investment back with interest.

768
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,560
So that's why we can't give them away?

769
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,140
Well, I'm trying to do something generous here.

770
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:16,400
Well, no.

771
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,440
The reason we can't give them away anymore is because Jesus gave them all away in a funk of a way.

772
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,020
In the funk of bitterness.

773
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:27,080
One dreadful, one horrible ex-day about five years ago.

774
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,860
You were there.

775
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:28,800
Well, what did he do then?

776
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,060
He was suddenly just...

777
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:34,060
He had a box of 1,000 subgenius gold cards.

778
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:39,460
And since his idea for it hadn't worked out, he was like, whoever wants these, just take them.

779
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:47,960
And some people, somewhere there are many stashes enough to gold card everybody here many times over.

780
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:51,040
But that stash is no longer in subgenius foundation.

781
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,800
Which makes those quite, quite precious.

782
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:59,620
And maybe you should think about not handing them out to the broad eye.

783
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,400
No, we need to tell Dr. Lagune got his first gold card this year.

784
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,240
A generous ecumenical gesture.

785
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,520
And look what happened.

786
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,580
I think we should mention the legal aspect of this.

787
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:06,720
I was going to give them away.

788
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,500
That some people have actually used them to charge large, large, large amounts.

789
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:10,600
Oh, well.

790
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:16,020
Maybe one who does an exceptional service for me can still receive such a gift.

791
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,300
Right.

792
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,560
You can award one.

793
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,440
Friends, you hear that?

794
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,020
Think what it is.

795
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,100
Think what exceptional service means to Dr. Howell.

796
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,380
That's going to be pretty damn exceptional.

797
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,600
It hurts me.

798
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,860
You'll have to tell you what he means by service.

799
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,080
It's probably not what you're thinking.

800
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,500
It's not being serviced either, but it's kind of like that.

801
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:40,480
Oh, service with a smile, but let's not linger on such matters.

802
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,560
So that always seems to be God's response to a criminal business.

803
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,960
You know, we got after our Voldemort Western service.

804
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,380
We got after him for the entire of thepractice.

805
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:05,480
We got after him for the psych.

806
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,840
Dr. які forward MY SMS THAT SOMEONE actual is waiting no INTERNAL SYMBOWLS

807
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,240
DelivenLY everything was certainly.

808
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,220
Well, I'm going to seriously shock her.

809
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,380
I will alone.

810
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,400
I'm ready for.

811
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,820
A love contract.

812
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,360
Well, should I do it?

813
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:17,360


814
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:17,740
Well, it sounds like you've got a command and I'm ready to do it.

815
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,240
Well, do you want to?

816
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:23,980

820
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,180
Not crazy by John McCain.

821
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:43,580
Thank Bob.

822
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:50,080
So Bob lit up his pipe, and he puffed lots of smoke.

823
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,680
What terrible smoke.

824
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,900
And everyone choked.

825
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,140
And he puffed, and he puffed.

826
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,400
And he puffed, and he puffed.

827
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,160
And the people, they choked.

828
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,340
And they said, please, enough.

829
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:07,720
But Bob only grinned, and he smoked his pipe more.

830
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:12,660
And Cindy Lou Who ran away in the store.

831
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:16,800
So he puffed, and he puffed, until he choked.

832
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,220
And he choked, and he choked, and he choked.

833
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,800
I don't like this one.

834
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,280
And Bob turned around with a big old frown and said,

835
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,840
beep them if they can't take a joke.

836
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,820
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

837
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,100
I hate little kids.

838
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:30,720
Get out of here.

839
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,600
Yes, Bob's daycare center was a new direction

840
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,700
for the Church of the Seventh.

841
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,220
Subgenius.

842
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,880
Really, it's an expanding operation that's happening all the time.

843
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,620
There are new departments, new department heads,

844
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:47,520
promotions, perks, and, of course, that dental plan.

845
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,740
Basically, you've got to get them while they're young.

846
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:53,200
I wish you hadn't mentioned the nude department heads.

847
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,640
That was terrible.

848
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,500
That was new department heads.

849
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,980
Especially Dr. Cosgrove.

850
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,340
I think I'll never have any libido again.

851
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,820
Dr. Cosgrove, could you please come over,

852
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,860
just come around the corner for a second

853
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:05,820
so no one can hear.

854
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,200
I need to talk to you.

855
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,500
Have you been bothering some of the female patients again?

856
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,560
Hey, I don't know what you're talking about.

857
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,980
I have heard my third complaint.

858
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

859
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,800
This is the third complaint this week.

860
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,540
Hey, here's the good one.

861
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,300
You hear about the kid who ran down the street

862
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,220
with his teeny weeny wagon head?

863
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,140
That's about it.

864
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,240
I'm trying to make some sense with you

865
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,440
and you don't want to listen to me.

866
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,300
Hey, hands off, buddy.

867
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,380
I've got a right to be here.

868
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,500
I'm tired of this.

869
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,100
I'm telling Dr. Mellon-Schmeller,

870
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,140
and you're done for.

871
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,760
If you don't come in and talk tomorrow,

872
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,020
two o'clock, two o'clock, that's what time.

873
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,420
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please.

874
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,540
We have to start.

875
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,280
This meeting now,

876
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,440
you can take your personal problems outside.

877
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,800
We have quite a bit of new material to go over

878
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,540
and some old material as well.

879
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:51,140
I think first, Miss Feebles will read the minutes

880
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,440
of the last meeting.

881
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,000
Now, I just want everyone to remember

882
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,620
what we went through at the last meeting.

883
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,300
If you can all just stretch your minds back.

884
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,660
Listen, if you don't have something new to add,

885
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,940
please don't open your mouth.

886
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,400
All right.

887
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,540
Now, that's...

888
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,980
That's the extent of the minutes for this.

889
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,380
If you'd like to make a call,

890
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,560
please hang up and call again.

891
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,700
Or screw you.

892
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,100
There are important people of importance.

893
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,700
I think probably one of the most highly acclaimed

894
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,720
and highest regarded true American is Bob.

895
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,320
Hello, Bob.

896
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,560
Bob and I will be right back.

897
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,040
Bob and I will be right back.

898
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,460
Yeah, fantastic.

899
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,700
Oh, yeah, yeah.

900
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,080
I don't have much to think about.

901
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:36,800
Oh.

902
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,060
Oh.

903
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,080
Well, Bob wrote that.

904
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:39,480
Oh.

905
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

906
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,380
Well, yeah.

907
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,680
You think that means anything?

908
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:43,240
No.

909
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,080
This might, you know, whatever.

910
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:47,800
Yeah.

911
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,620
Yeah, yeah.

912
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:50,340
Oh.

913
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,780
We'll be right back, Bob.

914
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:52,180
Yeah.

915
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,640
Bob is Maserati.

916
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,560
Bob is swinging Maserati.

917
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,280
Ah.

918
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,100
Listen, how does it feel, Bob?

919
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,660
And there are thousands of people jamming.

920
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:01,580
Feels marvelous.

921
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:02,500
Splendid.

922
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:02,900
Swinging.

923
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:03,420
Delicious.

924
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:03,960
Groovy.

925
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:04,720
Marvelous.

926
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,000
Fantastic.

927
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:05,440


928
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:05,840
Mm-hmm.

929
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,240
Mm.

930
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,160
What is your main message?

931
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:08,920
Eat.

932
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,180
Yeah, Bob.

933
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,080
Beep.

934
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:11,600
Beep.

935
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:11,900
Beep.

936
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:12,120
Beep.

937
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:12,600
Swing.

938
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,080
Swing.

939
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:13,620
Swing.

940
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:14,520
Swing.

941
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:14,780
Swing.

942
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:14,960
Swing.

943
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:15,160
Love.

944
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,240
I watch television.

945
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,880
Hey, Bob.

946
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:18,760
Bob.

947
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,500
You're really cracking up.

948
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,460
Bob, I think that he has a tremendous future.

949
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,700
No, I was never familiar with Bob, and I'd never seen him.

950
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,880
And he's very funny.

951
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,020
Mm.

952
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:32,700
Extolling the virtues of marijuana, we ought to legalize pot.

953
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,120
Ooh.

954
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,040
Can I ask you a question, Bob?

955
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:36,640
Sure.

956
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,880
Uh, and that's soul.

957
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,020
And he's got so much soul.

958
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,880
Let's see what this caller here has to say.

959
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,480
Hello, you're on the air with, uh, Dr. Howell and Reverend Stang and, uh...

960
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:46,920
Howdy.

961
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:47,780
Howdy.

962
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,520
I'd like to speak on behalf of my fellow president.

963
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:53,700
No, I'm sorry.

964
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,760
It's Lonesome President George.

965
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:56,400
Here.

966
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:57,300
Lord.

967
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,080
Okay.

968
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,260
Hey, thanks for that stimulus package.

969
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:01,480
Oop.

970
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,920
I spoke on what I should not have said.

971
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:06,240
Something has happened in the motorcade route.

972
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,360
All right.

973
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:07,740
Roll call.

974
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:08,260
Something is happening here.

975
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,020
Something is very wrong here.

976
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:10,480
Rocknarr here?

977
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:10,980
Yes.

978
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:11,620
Mark here?

979
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:12,660
I'm here.

980
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,020
Dave here?

981
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:14,420
I'm here.

982
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:15,260
Hmm.

983
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,060
Someone buzzing in their head.

984
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,580
Mrs. Kennedy jumped up.

985
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,080
She said, oh, no.

986
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,480
When you hear that noise, that means you have to type in those numbers.

987
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,540
4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42.

988
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,900
Well, I would, but these nosebleeds keep me on my back.

989
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,400
Every 808 minutes.

990
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,360
Now, are we supposed to be paying attention to the numbers in the nosebleeds, or are we supposed to give them...

991
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:40,220
That's for our minions and myrmidons to do in the control center.

992
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,860
It is up to us simply to give orders and have them instantly carried out.

993
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,120
You ever get, like, a nosebleed and you stick, like, a tissue up there and you pull it out and...

994
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,560
And you're on.

995
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:55,120
And it's kind of like a Rorschach test, or sometimes it looks like the flag of Japan, actually.

996
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,620
It's a work of freaking art.

997
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,340
I ought to sell it.

998
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,640
Radical free expression.

999
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:01,640
Yeah, that's right.

1000
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:06,340
Who are you to say that my bleeding effulgences are not...

1001
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,200
Are not art of the highest kind?

1002
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,320
I'm sure they are when well-preserved and...

1003
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:17,220
You know, here's something sobering and perhaps disgusting thought.

1004
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:25,720
There was some feminist artist years ago who defiantly put up on the gallery walls the shitty didies of her baby, saying,

1005
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:32,020
Don't tell me this isn't art, what comes out of my body and passes through the fruit of my body.

1006
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,440
It's art, and don't you say it isn't.

1007
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,260
Or if you do, you'll be...

1008
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,380
Defiling my personhood.

1009
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,620
Dr. Hall, now, don't be resentful.

1010
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:42,100
It's true.

1011
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:43,200
I read about it.

1012
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,040
It really happened.

1013
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,440
That was Mrs. Drummond, wasn't it, that did that?

1014
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,520
Oh, I'm sorry.

1015
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:52,060
I didn't mean to be stepping on anybody's toes so close to home.

1016
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,280
No, it wasn't that.

1017
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:53,920
It was earlier.

1018
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:59,460
It was some crazy lady, if I may use a most incorrect term.

1019
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:00,620
It wasn't a Robin Robin.

1020
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:04,100
We prefer the term differently saying.

1021
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,240
Well, you know, and I know that...

1022
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,020
Art is what you can get away with.

1023
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:11,560
So I'm not going to rain on anybody's parade here.

1024
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,920
Perhaps her fallopian tubes were the kind that made true art.

1025
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:16,980
You know, we shouldn't be so...

1026
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:17,460
That's right, Dave.

1027
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,520
You've hit it on the head, as usual.

1028
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,820
You know, if you've got the tools to create...

1029
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:25,340
Some women do not have the fallopia to create good art.

1030
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,020
Generally, when someone says something's art, they're right.

1031
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,980
And when you deny it's art, you're wrong.

1032
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:31,780
Generally.

1033
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,200
It's just, you know, it goes back and forth.

1034
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,080
If you say it sucks, automatically...

1035
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:40,080
Exactly the next day, everybody will be proclaiming its beauty and grandeur.

1036
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,980
Just to make you look bad.

1037
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,720
The book of the subgenius really sucks, friends.

1038
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:45,960
Remember that.

1039
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:50,140
So get ready to proclaim its grandeur, now that I've said that.

1040
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:51,020
Yes.

1041
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,680
I'm just trying to stick...

1042
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:56,080
Now, the Watchtower, the Jehovah's Witness magazine, that rocks!

1043
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,380
But the book of the subgenius sucks!

1044
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:03,780
You know, I have to say, I always enjoy the copies of Watchtower in a way that I find that...

1045
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:04,320
I like them some.

1046
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,160
I collect them.

1047
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:05,760
I do.

1048
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,220
Weird, wacky ones.

1049
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,300
Actually, we're the basis of the genesis of Revelation X.

1050
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:11,860
Right.

1051
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,000
Some of the artwork on those things is amazing.

1052
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:15,080
Like, you know...

1053
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,720
Well, we tried to beat them in that department.

1054
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,100
Showed all these people in a diner watching a nuclear explosion on TV,

1055
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,540
and all these different people, you know, it's like the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker,

1056
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:28,920
and the cop on the street, and all these people were sitting around in the diner just looking at the screen like,

1057
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:29,080
Oh!

1058
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,300
A cross-section of American life.

1059
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,560
Well, it doesn't look good.

1060
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,160
You better have another cup of coffee.

1061
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:35,640
All in moon pants.

1062
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:39,660
All in moon pants, prepared to go, ready to take that last dive before they dip.

1063
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,800
And I think the time is growing nigh, but it always grows nigh.

1064
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:44,600
Get down into your...

1065
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,780
And every year it grows nigher.

1066
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,040
Government shelter, of course.

1067
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,440
Government is the problem.

1068
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:53,500
So I'm not getting in any socialist syphilis shelter down there.

1069
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:58,220
I'm just going to rot up here in radioactive decay with all the good Americans.

1070
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,940
Well, there are no syphilis-ridden shelters anymore.

1071
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:03,360
They've all been decomposed and recontaminated.

1072
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,360
They've been turned back into subway stations.

1073
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,100
And YMCA basements.

1074
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,960
And nobody's riding anymore.

1075
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,300
Well, that'll change.

1076
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,700
Soon everybody's going to have to get on the bus,

1077
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:17,200
now that the era of public transportation is on us, whether we like it or not.

1078
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,520
Think of blue-ticket Sundays.

1079
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:23,580
Specials throughout the land where you can ride the bus four blocks for only a dollar and a half.

1080
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:24,500
Ride the bus?

1081
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,440
Hell, you'll end up living on the bus.

1082
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:29,320
Or you might end up getting thrown under the bus.

1083
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:30,780
That's like that new catchphrase this year.

1084
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:34,640
Thrown off the sleigh to the galloping wolves who are behind.

1085
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,120
Or sold into bondage in Dobbstown.

1086
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:38,980
That's right.

1087
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:44,160
Forced to build those pyramids with overtime and no extra pay.

1088
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,400
Some people buy their way into bondage at Dobbstown.

1089
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,240
We get all kinds there.

1090
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,600
That's the beauty of it.

1091
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:55,120
They'll pay to know what they really shouldn't be doing.

1092
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:02,620
But the ones who join willingly, who look for such trouble and stuff, usually climb the ladder quite quickly.

1093
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,620
But they have condemned themselves out of their own rascality.

1094
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,080
They're not rascally mouths.

1095
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:10,140
For subgeniuses, true subgeniuses, as we know, are not joiners.

1096
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:16,540
Nor, of course, are they carpenters, coopers, churners of butter and eaters of clabber.

1097
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,820
Hewers of wood and drawers of water.

1098
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:24,040
Instead, they are slackful, bulbous, comfortable parasites.

1099
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:29,140
Feasting on the body politic like so many rotund tumors.

1100
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:33,440
My father is a hewer of wood and a subgenius.

1101
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:33,820
There I go.

1102
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,360
Every time I shoot off my mouth.

1103
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,420
I commit some unpardonable solecism.

1104
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:39,700
No, but you're talking about...

1105
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:40,900
I'm a lumberjack and I'm okay.

1106
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:41,960
There you go.

1107
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:49,540
You're talking about those who are controlled by those single neuron impulses that come out and that create their doings.

1108
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,560
We tell them what and they do what.

1109
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:59,460
But, Dave, how can we make this change evolve to something more wholesome from our perspective?

1110
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,160
Why do we want to, though?

1111
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:05,280
Well, just to make it more slackful.

1112
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:12,460
For us, you've got to move over so I can sink my mandibles into that succulent host body.

1113
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,640
That sounds good.

1114
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:19,500
See, I can't resist that part where I get to stick my mandibles in a succulent host body.

1115
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:26,240
Yeah, well, you have to have a specialized proboscis and you have to know when to pull out, like many things,

1116
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:33,140
or else you might explode from the hydrostatic pressure of the blood which upwells from below.

1117
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,080
I'm getting all turned on.

1118
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,280
But, Dave's been giving me the...

1119
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,380
Sorry, Stank.

1120
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:41,960
So that it will grow slowly and there won't be any constriction in my midbrain or anything.

1121
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,280
Well, there's room for us all in this synthetic society.

1122
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:51,760
One.

1123
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:56,280
One.

1124
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:57,020
To be different.

1125
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,120
To be different.

1126
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,320
To be different.

1127
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:00,680
One.

1128
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:02,360
Spire.

1129
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,060
Spire.

1130
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:03,560
To be different.

1131
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:04,480
Conspiracy.

1132
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:04,940
Conspiracy.

1133
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:05,260
Conspiracy.

1134
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:05,260


1135
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:06,800
Conspire.

1136
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:07,480
Conspire.

1137
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,000
To be different.

1138
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:09,580
Conspiracy each one.

1139
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,240
Conspire.

1140
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:11,920
Conspire.

1141
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,440
To be different.

1142
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,920
Conspiracy each one.

1143
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:15,700
Conspire.

1144
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:16,320
Conspire.

1145
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:16,840
To be different.

1146
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:17,760
Conspiracy.

1147
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,840
Our thoughts are all our own.

1148
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:24,940
Unless we write or speak.

1149
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,360
Just remember.

1150
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,580
Silence is strong.

1151
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,960
Mostly sound becomes a beat.

1152
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,240
So keep your secrets to yourself

1153
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,940
If you're different, carry on

1154
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:48,840
When the world is conspiring against you

1155
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,800
Be a conspiracy of one

1156
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,120
One

1157
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,620
Conspiracy of one

1158
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,980
Conspiracy of one

1159
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,560
Conspiracy of one

1160
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,220
Conspiracy

1161
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:14,180
Our thoughts are all our own

1162
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,260
Unless we write or speak

1163
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:23,920
Just remember, silence is strong

1164
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,300
Mostly sound becomes a beat

1165
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:31,580
So keep your secrets to yourself

1166
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:32,960
Conspiracy of one

1167
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:36,320
If you're different, carry on

1168
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:42,140
When the world is conspiring against you

1169
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:45,120
Be a conspiracy of one

1170
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,440
One

1171
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,880
Conspiracy of one

1172
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:56,460
Conspiracy of one

1173
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:59,140
Conspiracy of one

1174
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:00,700
Conspiracy of one

1175
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,260
Conspiracy of one

1176
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:08,140
Conspiracy of one

1177
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:09,840
Conspiracy of one

1178
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:14,200
Conspiracy of one

1179
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,960
Conspiracy of one

1180
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:17,320
One

1181
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,580
Conspiracy of one

1182
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:18,960
One

1183
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,960
Conspiracy of one

1184
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:29,540
A Reverend Max Slack did that song, Conspiracy of One

1185
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:32,540
He is one prolific Bob songster

1186
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:36,540
Before that, some radio synesthesia from WCSB Cleveland

1187
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:40,020
and some X-Day live show with Dr. Hal Lux of Cowboy Dave,

1188
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,620
Reverend Susan D'Fluzzi, and Princess Pisces,

1189
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:48,760
interspersed with some nice collages by Reverend Norrell Preff of norrellpreff.com.

1190
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:52,680
This is the Hour of Slack from Church of the Subgenius.

1191
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,900
For more information, see subgenius.com.

1192
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:01,000
For more on our moron books and DVDs, etc.

1193
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:08,920
And by the way, the background music here is by Save Yourself 7598.

1194
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:14,520
That's Save Yourself 7598, also known as The Maverick MJ.

1195
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:21,760
Lee Murr will help us close the show after this great cover by The Psychoskeletons.

1196
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:34,420
Oh yeah, baby, baby, baby

1197
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:37,760
Now if there's a smile on my face

1198
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,000
It's only that I'm trying to fool the public

1199
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,920
But when it comes down to fooling you

1200
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,220
Now honey, that's quite a different subject

1201
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:50,020
So don't let my glad expression

1202
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:53,260
Give you the wrong impression

1203
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:54,960
Cause really I'm sad

1204
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:58,040
Oh, sad to the sad

1205
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,540
Cause you're gone and I'm hurting

1206
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:00,980
So bad, sad to the sad

1207
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:00,980


1208
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:00,980


1209
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,260
Like a clown, I appear to be glad

1210
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,480
Woo, woo, woo, yeah

1211
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,800
Well, there's some sad things to demand

1212
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:12,120
But ain't too much sadder than

1213
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,920
The tears of a clown

1214
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:16,980
When there's no one around

1215
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,480
Oh yeah, baby, baby, baby

1216
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,580
Oh yeah, baby, baby, baby

1217
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:27,740
So if I appear to be carefree

1218
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:30,520
It's only to camouflage myself

1219
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:30,840
With my sadness

1220
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,380
In order to shield my pride

1221
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:35,660
I've tried to cover this hurt

1222
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:37,500
With a show of gladness

1223
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,700
So don't let my show convince you

1224
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:45,040
That I've been happy since you decided to go

1225
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,200
Oh, I need you so

1226
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,380
Cause I'm hurting, I want you to know

1227
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,420
Just for others I put on a show

1228
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:56,700
Yip, yip, woo, yeah

1229
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,120
Well, there's some sad things known to man

1230
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,280
But ain't too much sadder than

1231
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,080
The tears of a clown

1232
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:07,140
When there's no one around

1233
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:12,460
Just like Pegliacci did

1234
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:15,640
I try to keep my surface head

1235
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,000
Smiling in the public eye

1236
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,380
But in this lonely room

1237
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:22,900
I cry the tears of a clown

1238
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:26,000
When there's no one around

1239
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:30,460
Oh yeah, baby, baby, baby

1240
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:34,060
So if there's a smile on my face

1241
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:36,700
Don't let my glad expression

1242
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,000
Give you the wrong impression

1243
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,040
And don't let that smile of wear

1244
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,280
Make you think that I don't care

1245
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,840
The tears of a clown

1246
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,980
The tears of a clown

1247
00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:00,280
