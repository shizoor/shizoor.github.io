And now, a dramatic report well calculated to keep you in...

Just know that this is all going to be lost

Du sourire de ta jeunesse

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,280
Out on the space.

56
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,080
Won't go to your place.

57
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,880
It's all a waste.

I won't read.

69
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,740
What's in your news feed?

70
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,400
I've got no interest.

00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,900
But there's yet another new album that I just got.

00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,360
Why does he lactate so often?

133
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:40,040
It makes me angry but he yields a delicious pancake

134
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:59,740

00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:14,400
I cannot buy your moist talent

153
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,040
I'm a man with simple needs

154
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,540

Please, sir, I know we can reach an accord

00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,800
My moist towelets are priced

159
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,660
In a way you can afford

160
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:55,320
Each one is sealed in its own protective sleeve

161
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,540
They're lemon-scented, antiseptic

162
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:08,720
Lemon-scented, antiseptic

163
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,920
By the way, I think that's an ant

164
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,200
No, over there

165
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,860
Crawling up the back of your right sleeve

166
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,200
Or maybe it's a Hymoceros

167
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,840
Myrmecores

168
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,400
They look so much like ants, you know

Na na na na na

180
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:31,500
I don't want your moist outlets

181
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,260
Why don't you go fuck yourself?

182
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,460
I don't want your

183
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:44,180

I would not buy them from you

187
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,520
I would just take some for free

188
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,960
When I eat lunch at Barbie's

189
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:11,000
Why don't you go suck the maggots

190
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,720
From the deckhouse at home?

191
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,860
No really, you really took the�es and arrived here

192
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:50,860


193
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:50,860


194
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:50,860


195
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,480
I said fuck you all

196
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:52,500
Happy messing with women

197
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,960
You're gonna fuck your Launch Band

198
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,520
All your diss概 lock balls

199
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,900
Dry tongue

200
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,420
When I'm half asleep

201
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,640
Flanky crusty tarts

202
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,720
Of yesteryear

203
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,420
Asbestos shingles

204
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,820
Tiny spikes of death

205
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,180
Black lentils strewn

206
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,520
Across the rubber suit

207
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,840
That holds

208
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:49,880
I enjoy having personal eggs

209
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,340
Pumped through a faucet

210
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:52,700
From the bottom of my mouth

211
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,620
In my personal keg

212
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,620
Creamy and moist

213
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,940
Dripping from a hole

214
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,140
Personal eggs

215
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,360
In my personal bowl

216
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,100
Giant flicks

217
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,900
Of personal eggs

218
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,860
I'll tell you

219
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,040
Giant flicks

220
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,180
Of personal eggs

221
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,920
In my personal bowl

222
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,940
I'm very sure

223
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,680
That you'll like

224
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,980
You should join

225
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,040
Every curse

226
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,080
Of this personal list

227
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,740
I enjoy having personal eggs

228
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,360
That surprised

229
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,880
Your closed glance

230
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:33,880


231
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,320
streams

232
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:34,320


233
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:34,320


234
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,020
We've never been

235
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,460
So lonely

236
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,080
And always

237
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,340
Asian

238
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:40,920
American

239
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:50,700
A lo quarterback

240
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:52,500
And always

241
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,260
boys dripping from a hole.

242
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:16,420
Now that Hugh Beaumont's brain has complete control of the universe, I'm hoping it'll

243
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:20,120
begin addressing some of these zoning issues we've been having in my neighborhood.

244
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:26,040
Bill Clanton built that goddamn barbecue pit less than six inches from the property

245
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:31,460
line, which of course means there are several dozen horseshoe-shaped, generously-bedicked

246
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:36,640
protoplasmic slimes queued up in my backyard with their attendant cuss-mouthed,

247
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,600
dinable mantises and sunny walkmans strewing their feces in the zucchini bed and damaging

248
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,440
the posts where I tie up the red wattle hogs during feeding and mating sessions.

249
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,440
I've raised this issue before.

250
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,380
I've worked with city council, but apparently my property values aren't of much concern

251
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:59,680
to them, what with the recent outbreak of Southeast Asian butthole cholera, which has

252
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,880
led to endless waits in emergency rooms in Waldron-Mathow County Hospital.

253
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:09,420
Back in the 60s, people used to come in from as far as Akron or Ashtabula.

254
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:14,680
They'd take off all of their clothes and strut around naked amongst the bistros and boutiques,

255
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:19,480
sipping cocktails and lining up for Marty Engel's film retrospectives.

256
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,200
Then around 8 o'clock, just as the sun was setting over the rendering plant, they'd

257
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,620
all march into these narrow trenches that line the principal boulevards, and they'd

258
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,380
take turns vomiting on each other.

259
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:37,240
There was a big write-up in popular mechanics, but eventually they ran out of penicillin,

260
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,940
and the goat fever changed everything.

261
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,620
That's why Hugh Beaumont's brain would be wise to focus on issues closer to home.

262
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:50,680


263
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:50,680


264
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:50,680


265
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:50,680


266
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:50,680


267
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:56,580
Before construction begins on that 800-kilometer-wide waiting pool of delicious Alexander Haig

268
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:02,620
ass butter located on the dark side of Uranus, I look forward to the first instructional

269
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,100
podcast.

270
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:41,980
I would just as well go on set and remind them Considering he was family to me when

271
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:41,980


272
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,000
Let's listen to the this incredible research we're told is a simple testament to the

273
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,020
medical conditions and healings, nearby forests and hens and wild animals.

274
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,080
This TV show takes place during four weeks.

275
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,820
The female screenwriter is taking a quick rapidlyosaI workbook from the vault that they

276
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:42,820


277
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:50,680
Theserobyeoncook lö iPhoneB amateur channelerson

278
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,120
If you have got a turkey leg

279
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,580
A turkey wing will do

280
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:20,100
A turkey wing will do

281
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,560
A turkey wing will do

282
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,060
A turkey wing will do

283
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,560
A turkey wing will do

284
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:28,320
A turkey wing will do

285
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,860
A turkey wing will do

286
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,920
A turkey wing will do

287
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:38,100
Of that new Rudy Schwartz Project album.

288
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:44,860
I think I left out one song from the first half.

289
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,720
The names of the songs we heard, I think you'll enjoy these.

290
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,120
The first two instrumentals were

291
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,180
Fasten Thee Thy Swathings

292
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:59,280
and Space Medicine Girl.

293
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,020
We then heard the

294
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,120
uh

295
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,940
fairly obviously named

296
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,400
Miraculous Diaper Creatures

297
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,060
and a lovely song called

298
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,560
Moist Towelettes

299
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,920
that actually had singing

300
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,920
by someone besides the great Joe Newman

301
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,180
who is usually the vocalist on these things.

302
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,000
Somebody named David Morrison.

303
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,940
We heard Personal Eggs.

304
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,240
I skipped over Flux Bap

305
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,500
Builds Stout Irction

306
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,940
and we played

307
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,200
Hugh Beaumont's Brain

308
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,200
and the instrumental that followed it

309
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,900
Temporary Housing Has Been Arranged by

310
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,340
Tor Back.

311
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:46,560
So those are the first seven or eight songs on

312
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,360
They Saved Grandpa's Gauze.

313
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,480
And if you need to know more about the Rudy Schwartz Project

314
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,480
and you probably do

315
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,740
then you should uh

316
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,300
you should Google it.

317
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,920
Because I don't think I don't I don't know.

318
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,300
I don't know who actually sells these things.

319
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,920
There you go.

320
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,800
There you go kids.

321
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:15,680
And I hear the beast from 20,000 Fathoms in the background.

322
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,260
But until further notice

323
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,640
I'm going to tell you about

324
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,300
the secret history of Bob and Reagan.

325
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,880
Ronald Reagan.

326
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,580
Who was secretly a very heavy pot smoker.

327
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,480
Which caused his Alzheimer's.

328
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,860
He and J.R. Bob Dobbs had been friends since 1951

329
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,920
before Dobbs' Immaculation.

330
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,080
When they met on the set of

331
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,220
Bedtime for Bonzo.

332
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,720
For which of

333
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,540
Dobbs is listed as of all things

334
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,120
genetics consultant.

335
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,140
Hm.

336
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,020
After his Immaculation

337
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,260
Dobbs' rising star matched Ron's

338
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,280
and they shared a meteoric ascent

339
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,540
through the conspiracy ranks

340
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,900
until Dobbs dropped out of the show.

341
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,220
And went rogue.

342
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,580
Followed by the appearance

343
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,420
or disappearance of

344
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,040
lonesome cowboy Dave himself.

345
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,160
Cow pokers.

346
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,740
The real Dave?

347
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,840
It's about as real as it gets.

348
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,000
I was going to ask you a very furious question

349
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,660
before I began arguing with you.

350
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,900
Do you hear

351
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,800
moderate buzz?

352
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,300
Because if so I'm using

353
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,800
the regular phone which has been working

354
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,480
just fine.

355
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,700
And uh

356
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,520
the more I step on it

357
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,320
and crush it with my tiny little fingers

358
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,000
the more noises it makes.

359
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,460
Well here let's listen to the buzz

360
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,040
of Dave.

361
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,160
Let's see if there's a real buzz there cause

362
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,640
if so I'll call back with my machine gun.

363
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,500
With my uh

364
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,440
There is a buzz but it is quite a

365
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,420
subtle buzz.

366
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,140
I wouldn't worry about it Dave.

367
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,240
Okay there's more important things to worry about.

368
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,480
Yeah there's more important things than you getting a buzz.

369
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,860
Oh you think so do you?

370
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,100
Well there's something more important than me getting a buzz

371
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,160
especially at this particular moment in time.

372
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,060
Well it's not the be all and end all of life.

373
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,500
Getting a buzz isn't

374
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,160
isn't what everything is all about.

375
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:09,800
Or wait

376
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,020
now wait a minute.

377
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,500
What did my dad

378
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,240
My dad asked me what the meaning of life

379
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,760
or what was the purpose of life

380
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,720
and I instantly said to have fun.

381
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,020
Cause I had actually thought about that.

382
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,040
And Pappy said

383
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,460
I didn't know you were that into it.

384
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,080
I thought you were advanced.

385
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,520
I thought you were stupid.

386
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,380
I thought you'd say something like to help others

387
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,000
or some ridiculous lie.

388
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,180
Everybody knows

389
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,100
that's stupid.

390
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,280
Well it's not necessarily stupid

391
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,200
but it's not

392
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,180
I mean if that's how you have fun

393
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,340
then that's smart.

394
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,420
Yeah you're the flowers of

395
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:48,820
hedon.

396
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,400
However if you're helping everyone and

397
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,080
meanwhile griping bitterly to yourself

398
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,800
about what ingrates they are

399
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,040
that doesn't really help.

400
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,400
If your teeth and your buttocks are clenched

401
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,180
your mind is made up

402
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,260
you're not having enough fun.

403
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,660
I can clench my teeth a lot better

404
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,800
than I can clench my buttocks.

405
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,580
That's all I know.

406
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,960
Are you losing the power?

407
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,380
The old whiz bang power of the buttocks clenching?

408
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,760
Well you know

409
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,960
well it's hard to discuss on

410
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,820
live radio.

411
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,400
You call this live?

412
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,120
I think we...

413
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,760
But you know

414
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,680
butts doing crappy jobs

415
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,880
that's what old age is all about.

416
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,920
Doing crappy jobs

417
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,140
with crap.

418
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,180
Crap related jobs.

419
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,660
That's not what it's supposed to be about.

420
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,740
It's supposed to be having a

421
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,880
merciful jolly time.

422
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,440
I'm talking about butts

423
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,520
not the owners of the butts.

424
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,460
I guess the butts have to be having...

425
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,500
They just kind of rent it.

426
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:52,880
You know?

427
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,360
Well...

428
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,460
It's my monogram.

429
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,520
It's what I say. It's what I believe in.

430
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,680
So therefore I...

431
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,320
Okay you win.

432
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,020
Thank you.

433
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,780
It feels good doesn't it being a winner?

434
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:09,980
Yes it does.

435
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,900
You can feel the clip of my planking boot heel

436
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,840
all across Europe.

437
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,360
Because there is such a place.

438
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,620
I didn't believe in Europe until

439
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,780
I think it was like

440
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,100
two or three years ago.

441
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,440
Somebody showed me a map and I

442
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,620
scoffed and said if I can't go there

443
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,560
right now in five minutes it doesn't exist.

444
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,940
Right. If I ain't seen it

445
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,960
then I don't believe it.

446
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,980
Show me. I'm from Missouri.

447
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:36,640
Show me.

448
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,320
You and we were one of the...

449
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,140
We're two of the individuals who

450
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,580
convinced me there was Europe because you had been there

451
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,200
and I actually believe you

452
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,080
so I had to.

453
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,460
We brought back photos to prove.

454
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,340
He doesn't know those photos were

455
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,400
really from that fancy rich

456
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,460
people's shopping center down there.

457
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,840
Over there in Pepper Pike.

458
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,840
Don't tell him. Don't tell him.

459
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,420
You're blowing it.

460
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,200
There's nothing like blowing a hole in good old

461
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,380
Cayenne Pepper Pike. Especially if you

462
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,900
can't reach the original blowhole

463
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,060
which is somewhere north of Shibibu.

464
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,100
And that's what you told me before

465
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,860
when you had me believe in all this stuff.

466
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,220
Now you know a lot of people think

467
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,200
the blowhole is located right

468
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,860
where you live in Ashtabula.

469
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,180
Oh that could well be.

470
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,840
That's the blowhole of America

471
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,280
when the great

472
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,960
Moby Dick of America

473
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,900
rises and spouts.

474
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,060
The stinky gravy spouts.

475
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,560
Right, the snot comes out at Ashtabula

476
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,440
flies way up into the atmosphere

477
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,720
and then rains down

478
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,540
on Cleveland.

479
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,280
Call me Ismail

480
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,140
or call me later because I'm busy

481
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,760
right now.

482
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,220
And my furniture's talking to me.

483
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,980
You know what's actually a pretty funny book

484
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,140
at least the first part of it? Moby Dick

485
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,320
by Herman Melville. I've been reading

486
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,360
that. Have you really? Yes on my

487
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,360
phone because it was a

488
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,740
free book. I could get

489
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,360
one of any of about a hundred different

490
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,920
editions for free on my phone.

491
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,520
And so I started writing. I'd never read Moby Dick.

492
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,340
I started reading it and by golly it's pretty

493
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,400
funny. It is. It's quite

494
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,380
mirthful at least at the

495
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,280
beginning towards down near

496
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,660
the end it gets a bit grim.

497
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,120
Well which is it? Queequeg

498
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,360
or Pequod? Which is the one that has

499
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,760
tattoos all over his ears?

500
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,240
Queequeg is the harpooner from

501
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,220
the South Seas

502
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,300
and the Pequod is

503
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,340
the name of the ship.

504
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,640
Ah the Pequod from

505
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,860
Maine. And

506
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,320
Moby Dick is one of the

507
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,640
most famous

508
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,460
monster hunter

509
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,360
novels but it's certainly not the earliest

510
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,380
because the first

511
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,220
fiction and all the most

512
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,140
popular fiction has been in the

513
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,500
monster hunting genre.

514
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,360
From Beowulf in the

515
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,280
English language,

516
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,860
the legends of Siegfried

517
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,960
in the Germanic world,

518
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,140
Ulysses with all his

519
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,280
cyclopses and sirens and

520
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,120
stuff, Gilgamesh

521
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,360
the world's first science fiction book

522
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,280
about

523
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,120
3,000 years old. They're all

524
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,040
heavy on monsters and perhaps not

525
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,160
coincidentally sex because

526
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,820
the two go hand in hand.

527
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,000
Monsters chase girls

528
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,160
and boys chase monsters

529
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,160
and the girls fall down

530
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,420
and then the boys make the monster

531
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,560
fall down and then finally

532
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,320
the guy gets to kiss the girl

533
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,260
at the very end while they talk about what man

534
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,960
was not meant to know.

535
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,260
And then you got your

536
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,980
modern day monster

537
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,480
hunts like the hunting of Bin Laden

538
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,320
and Saddam Hussein and

539
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,120
Bob and Hitler and all those

540
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:44,880
bad guys.

541
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,420
It's monster hunts all the way down.

542
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,080
Heck,

543
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,360
we even had one, we hunted

544
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,200
Bob at Ex Day that one time

545
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,360
but of course he got away. And then there was the

546
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,160
long salubrious arguments and

547
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,220
contentions and the

548
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,680
different beliefs about Bob's motivations

549
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,420
just like with Moby Dick and all the

550
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,300
other famous novels and books

551
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,500
that you mentioned. How they deal

552
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,360
with the innermost parts of the

553
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,280
human spirit and there's

554
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,940
Bob sitting there with a

555
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,220
slack faced,

556
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,620
why am I smoking a pipe?

557
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,420
And we have to try and figure out what he

558
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,520
really means by his monster chase.

559
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,180
Well, he's got

560
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,320
the cliff notes of Moby Dick in one

561
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,820
hand and the classics illustrated

562
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,560
version in the other. And a playboy

563
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,040
wrapped around you know where.

564
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,320
His neck.

565
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,200
There's Connie and in so

566
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,200
few of the other ones there's never a female

567
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,040
figure which outshines

568
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,000
the male questor

569
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,320
as we might call it.

570
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,740
Well, not in the traditional

571
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,000
monster hunter

572
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,120
hunting legends but actually

573
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,200
there are lots of non-traditional ones.

574
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,440
Wasn't Diana

575
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,340
the huntress or something?

576
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,740
We met her the other day.

577
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,180
She was wearing a

578
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,820
Peas of Mind t-shirt.

579
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,040
And one titty was showing because she was

580
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,140
Amazon like because she was the huntress.

581
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,880
She was Diana or Tana.

582
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,300
She did offer us tea twice.

583
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:11,820
Yes.

584
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,620
She said tea, tea.

585
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,180
That explains all of that right now.

586
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:16,740
Yeah.

587
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,800
I understand

588
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,040
there's some sort of comic book

589
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,180
hero-esque called Wonder Woman

590
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,300
who has appeared

591
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,300
even in the movies lately

592
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,060
but I never really

593
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,280
followed those.

594
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,420
Her personal motivations in terms of

595
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,040
the spiritual quest.

596
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,100
Oh yeah they did.

597
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,280
They always explain them in terms of the female

598
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,300
what girls need to be girls

599
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,760
better than boys are

600
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,720
and why girls should stick together.

601
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,040
You know there's nothing like her

602
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,400
actual she was scared of

603
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,140
rotten tumors and

604
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,980
be shot with fish

605
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,460
and things like that that bothered the average woman.

606
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,600
Well but the other

607
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,340
girls of Monster High would

608
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,360
you know they'd get together and talk

609
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,920
about these things pretty seriously

610
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,320
and work out their problems.

611
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,500
Their

612
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,460
sex and

613
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,560
monster problems.

614
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,180
What would the world have been like

615
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,240
had in the old days

616
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,200
of the great Greek philosopher

617
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,120
schools of southern Italy and Greece

618
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,580
and Sicily

619
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,640
and stuff like that there

620
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,000
what would they have been like if they were all females

621
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,000
instead of Plato's and Socrates guys?

622
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,860
Well they may have been

623
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,080
it may have been that way at one time

624
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,080
but then the Plato and Socrates guys

625
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,100
came along and said burn those books.

626
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,400
We never should have let them learn how to read.

627
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,140
That's probably true.

628
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,160
Burn it down and start over.

629
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,280
I joked about that the other day

630
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,800
and it made a womanly person all angry I think.

631
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,520
I was just joking

632
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,660
I said look what happened

633
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,220
when we let them have the vote

634
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,200
and even worse we let them learn how to read.

635
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:56,460
I mean it's just so funny.

636
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,540
She didn't think that was funny.

637
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,540
I was trying to be funny

638
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,380
but you know

639
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,560
sometimes you hurt somebody's

640
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,360
little sensitive bone instead

641
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,420
of their funny bone.

642
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,200
Maybe we shouldn't ever talk about anything

643
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,380
that might hurt somebody's sensitive bone.

644
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,400
Maybe we should just turn off

645
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,700
these microphones and just shut up

646
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,440
because somebody out there might

647
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,080
just get a, I don't know

648
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,440
they might think of something bad

649
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,560
something we say might remind

650
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,440
somebody of something bad so we better not

651
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:26,920
say it.

652
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,580
Well that's why flatulence is a good thing

653
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,380
because it has no political flavor.

654
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,700
It's just merely like oatmeal without the cookies.

655
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,280
And it's not always loud.

656
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,200
It doesn't have to be loud for people to notice it.

657
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,440
And everyone loves it just the same.

658
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,340
It's mom and dad's favorite thing

659
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,940
and everybody gets a little giggle.

660
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,140
Flatulence?

661
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,460
Flatulence.

662
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:54,900
One of the world's oldest visual gags

663
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,620
they showed

664
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,640
well they, who's they?

665
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,120
Well they're a lot funnier if there's a lighter involved.

666
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,480
That's the subgenius art of pyroflatulation.

667
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,020
I tried to have a pyroflatulation

668
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,460
contest the next day

669
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:12,140
in combination with the chili cook off.

670
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,160
Only two

671
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,520
other people made chili

672
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,780
so therefore my chili won.

673
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,080
And I was planning to have

674
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,900
the pyroflatulation contest

675
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,260
like six or seven hours later in the day.

676
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,220
Who showed up? Just me.

677
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,300
With my yardstick and backdrop

678
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,120
and camera.

679
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,420
And lighter.

680
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,940
The backdrop went six feet

681
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,480
just in case we had a real power

682
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,400
explosion. We actually had a big meet

683
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,300
in high school

684
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,360
when we were seniors in high school. There were two teams.

685
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,620
We gave ourselves

686
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,340
funny names and stuff like that.

687
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,460
Really? A pyroflatulation meet?

688
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,800
We had a competition

689
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,100
and some people yelped

690
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,220
as it burned some hairy parts.

691
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,920
Yeah, it can backfire.

692
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,300
Yep. Yeah.

693
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,040
That can be dangerous.

694
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,000
You better be careful.

695
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,020
It's not a sport for the weak hearted, that's for sure.

696
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,040
Right.

697
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:06,840
Right.

698
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,040
Pate a diamond only weak hearted.

699
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:11,980
It's tough.

700
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,120
It's a tough old world out there, Jack.

701
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,680
Especially if you're talking to Jack Kerouac.

702
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,560
He's been dead for

703
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,760
34 years now.

704
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,360
And that's even after cutting his mule open

705
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,340
and getting inside and getting warm.

706
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,340
Oh no, that was Jack London.

707
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,020
I'm sorry, I was thinking Jack London.

708
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:30,400
Wrong Jack.

709
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,760
One of those guys named Jack. Jack something.

710
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,160
Reverend Jack Knapes.

711
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,640
That's my buddy.

712
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,160
Not Jack the Bear either.

713
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,920
No, Jack of Knapes.

714
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,580
Jack O' Knapes.

715
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,460
Reverend Jack O' Knapes.

716
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,320
The real Jack of Knapes.

717
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:54,120
The only true artist is the

718
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,240
Jack of Artist.

719
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,380
Oh, come on now, man.

720
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,220
You're making my socks smelly.

721
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:01,860
Geez.

722
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,240
This is the kind of humor

723
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,480
that you hear and, well, you used to

724
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,320
hear in the days of the working class world

725
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,220
and bars and football fields.

726
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,000
Well, yeah, now there's no

727
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,460
working class, there's just the lower

728
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,120
class and the slave driver class.

729
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,960
Just slaves and slave drivers.

730
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,240
Ain't nothing else.

731
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:23,780
Ain't nothing.

732
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,440
There's fewer and fewer slave drivers

733
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,700
and a lot more slaves.

734
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,880
Ah, the

735
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,680
buzz covering music.

736
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,140
It's always good to have

737
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,160
some music to cover the buzz

738
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:36,720
in the background.

739
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,180
Is the buzz unearthly and bad

740
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,800
now because I can call back on my

741
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:42,720
.

742
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,640
No, it's not too bad.

743
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,480
No, it's just quite subtle, Dave.

744
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,840
Well, as long as we have the music in the background,

745
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,880
as long as we keep talking, then no one hears

746
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,000
the buzz. James. James.

747
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,700
.

748
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,100
.

749
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,780
.

750
00:42:59,780 --> 00:42:59,780


751
00:42:59,780 --> 00:42:59,940
.

752
00:42:59,940 --> 00:42:59,960
.

753
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,280
.

754
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,060
.

755
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:01,180

758
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:07,260

759
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,520

762
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:24,280

763
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:33,200

764
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:33,220

765
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:33,220


766
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:33,300
.

767
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:33,340
.

768
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:33,340


769
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:33,360
.

770
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:33,360


771
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:33,380
.

772
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:33,400

773
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,120

775

776
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:49,860
.

777
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:50,120
.

778
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,640

779
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,940

780
00:43:59,060 --> 00:43:59,900

781

782
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:00,320


783
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:00,360

784
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:00,380

785

786
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,080
.

787
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:05,140
.

788
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,680

789
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,320
. .

790
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:23,860

791

.

792
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:26,880
.

793
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:26,880


794
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:26,920
.

795
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:26,960
.

796
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,420
.

797
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:27,440
.

798
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,560
. .

799
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,700
Just sign here, Mr. DeLuca.

800
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,580
Yes, in that red fluid I drew out of you.

801
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,320
I'm standing at the crossroads.

802
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,040
Yeah.

803
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,500
God help me.

804
00:44:54,860 --> 00:45:13,160
Yeah, the problem is it was popular investment banker Dave that signed that contract and got rich and famous and had a little clone, all the clones, like Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Unpopular Garbage Man Dave and so forth.

805
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:17,060
And all those other names that you'll come back to are so famous.

806
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:21,020
Bad breath cowgirl Daveena.

807
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,500
Wincing, jumping monkey man Dave.

808
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,360
Right.

809
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,780
Yeah, there's a lot of clones out there.

810
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,680
But Dave, you're the only one that we let call the show.

811
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,580
All the other Daves, they just forget it.

812
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,620
They've tried to get in, you know.

813
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:40,020
They may be more popular, but they're not as funny as you are, Dave.

814
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:42,980
Nice.

815
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:43,420
Looking.

816
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:51,120
So, are you guys, I heard that we made some weird kind of psychedelic cookies the other night at the old Stang Hostel.

817
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,660
And somebody got pretty hostile.

818
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,900
Didn't you have a very colorful guest recently?

819
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,540
Are you psychic or something?

820
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,980
That's kind of weird that you should say that.

821
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,140
It was very peaceful.

822
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,060
It was actually a very peaceful little gathering.

823
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:07,480
It was.

824
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,760
It was a quiet and peaceful evening.

825
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,540
Nobody even knew what was in the cookies.

826
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,060
Until it was.

827
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:13,540
Until it was too late.

828
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,160
Yeah.

829
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:18,300
That's the way I like it.

830
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,980
We got those cookies from the devil, you know.

831
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:22,640
Yes.

832
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,980
From the graveyard at midnight.

833
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:28,900
The graveyard.

834
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,300
The graveyard.

835
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:40,960
Even a man who is pure at heart and eats his beans by night may become a buttock when the wolfbane blooms.

836
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,100
And autumn moon.

837
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:43,840
And autumn moon is bright.

838
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,180
May we all become buttocks when the wolfbane blooms.

839
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:55,040
I hope to never become a buttocks.

840
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:59,100
Hey, speaking of buttocks and X-Day, X-Day is coming.

841
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,140
The world's going to end.

842
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:03,420
But first, we'll have a big party out there at that campground in Ohio.

843
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:08,480
And there was something that was important I wanted to tell people about.

844
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,020
Oh, well, one important thing is.

845
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,020
It's a wistary.

846
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,460
It's a wistary.

847
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:13,320
It's a wistary at Wisteria.

848
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:20,540
And I put new artwork on subgenius.com and on all the X-Day events pages.

849
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:24,420
New artwork by none other than the great illustrator Dr. Howell.

850
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,940
Dr. Howell.

851
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,760
Actually, these aren't drawings.

852
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,640
They're collages and written things.

853
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:36,460
There's even a whole newspaper called the Dobstown Nanoheliograph with articles about

854
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:41,380
the pathetic attempts of the humans to fight back against the aliens.

855
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:42,680
It's actually pretty funny.

856
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,200
It's an ongoing struggle, though, isn't it?

857
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,420
It hasn't been terminated by...

858
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:48,460
But what else?

859
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:48,780
Okay.

860
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:55,540
There was the new pictures on subgenius.com that are good and fun.

861
00:47:55,580 --> 00:48:02,120
Oh, and they've got pictures of little Miss Baby Bear there, too, in her space girl outfit.

862
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,260
But I'm confused.

863
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,240
You're talking about the party before X-Day?

864
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:06,820
Isn't there...

865
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:07,060
No.

866
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:07,920
There's a party after X-Day.

867
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,220
Well, no.

868
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,500
Before the world ends.

869
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:10,220
Oh, yes.

870
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,360
Before the world ends, we have a party.

871
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:11,360


872
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:11,360


873
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:11,360


874
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:11,360


875
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:11,360


876
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:11,360


877
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:11,360


878
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:11,360


879
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:21,680
After the world ends, there's a somewhat less snooty party called Starwood, but we'll

880
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:28,860
be having that aboard the escape vessel of Princess Wee and myself, because it's Princess

881
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:29,520
Wee's baby.

882
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:35,560
We promised those people, I mean, they paid to have a Starwood, so even if they're not

883
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:40,340
subgeniuses, we'll beam them up, show them a big party, and if they haven't wised up

884
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:41,340
at the end of that week...

885
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,300
We can become subgenius ministers.

886
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,260
Out the airlock!

887
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:47,440
And down to Earth to burn!

888
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:53,060
Now, aren't you having a special Spanish speaking day called Dia del Crrr?

889
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,000
Dia del Crrr.

890
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:56,420
Dia del Crrr.

891
00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:00,620
That's the clean up after the end of the world.

892
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:01,540
Oh.

893
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,620
Some people are into that.

894
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:03,360
Oh, I see.

895
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:09,220
Well, I thought it was, you know, the Spanish way of saying X was Crrr, Crrr, Crrr, Crrr,

896
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:09,280


897
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:11,340
So it was Dia del Crrr.

898
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:12,020
Dia del Crrr.

899
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,340
Dia del Crrr.

900
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:14,780
Oh, I know how to do it.

901
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,900
It shows how little I know, for sure.

902
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,600
Everything's kind of speculative.

903
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,000
Dave, we've got to get you to X day somehow.

904
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,420
How are we going to do that?

905
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,400
Well, let's make sure my health is incoherent first.

906
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:26,700
Right.

907
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,020
We have to have a stretcher.

908
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,080
I may have sacrificed my vacation time.

909
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:30,100
And cats.

910
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:35,180
We need at least two cats, probably four cats, to carry Dave on a stretcher from northern

911
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,740
Ohio down to southern Ohio, or I suppose somebody could drive him.

912
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,320
But it ain't us, because our car's full.

913
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:41,920
Right.

914
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,540
We could put him on top.

915
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,620
And also, we have to go down there for a whole week or more, you see.

916
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,200
That's all coming soon.

917
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:50,560
Real soon.

918
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,620
When is Dia del Crrr?

919
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,480
It's the end of the world, July 5th, 1998.

920
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,280
I know it's El Julio del Cinco.

921
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,860
But the party happens way before July 5th.

922
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:04,020
Yeah, we'll start on like the 28th or 27th.

923
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:04,480
It ends actually.

924
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,720
June 28th.

925
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:09,160
Yeah, Dr. Howell's going to be here in the station.

926
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:09,700
Yay.

927
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,300
The Sunday before we leave.

928
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:11,300


929
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:11,300


930
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:11,300


931
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:11,300


932
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:11,300


933
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:11,300


934
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:11,760
Yes.

935
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:19,300
And he can give Dave a run for his money, lip-flappin' wise.

936
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,660
Yes, I speculoos that will be quite an evening.

937
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:27,800
Dr. Philo Drummond's going to be around, and our band will reform, the Doctors for Wotan.

938
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,300
That's the band of Philo and me and our wives.

939
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,080
And eventually, this time, we're going to let the whole audience up.

940
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:41,280
We're going to bring enough of what they call fart pianos that we can hand each member of

941
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:41,280


942
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:46,220
the audience an instrument and ask them up, cluster them around microphones, and when

943
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:51,640
all of the audience is up there banging and jumping up and down and stomping and whacking

944
00:50:52,220 --> 00:51:00,160
coffee cans with spoons in time to the music no one else can hear, Philo and I and our

945
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,160
wives will sit down where the audience used to be and watch.

946
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,720
With our feet propped up.

947
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:09,280
Yeah, that's how Doctor music is really supposed to work.

948
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,260
So if you join us.

949
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:16,240
If you joined our band, Dave, you wouldn't really play for long, but if you stayed in

950
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,200
the audience, you'd probably end up doing a whole concert for an hour.

951
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,740
That's what we're hoping.

952
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,780
Yeah, I understand that part.

953
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:26,240
I don't understand, like, when you're saying a fart piano, these, like, keyboards are sampled.

954
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:26,680
Google it.

955
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,020
Google it.

956
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:27,880
You'll have one.

957
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,280
Oh, you don't have that kind of phone.

958
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:33,720
But modern-day phones, all you gotta do is just type in fart piano, and about a minute

959
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:34,740
later, you'll have one.

960
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:35,360
Mm-hmm.

961
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:40,200
Which will be a keyboard with various different .

962
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,180
Yeah.

963
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:41,920
Right.

964
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:47,820
It has rattlers, rump splitters, fizz, the fuzz, the fizz fuzz, the fuzzy wuzz.

965
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:49,760
It's got all of them.

966
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,020
And the, well, the frosted fernander.

967
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,160
You can't hear that one.

968
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,700
Frosted fernander?

969
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:55,180
Yeah.

970
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,220
That's the silent but deadly.

971
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:04,720
Well, didn't your dad give you the, it's different in every state and region of the country,

972
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:08,480
but down south, it was the types of...

973
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:14,640
...expulsions, gaseous expulsions were named by the sound they made.

974
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,540
And I'll do it again.

975
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:20,200
The fizz, the fuzz, the fizz fuzz, the fuzzy wuzz, the rattler, the rump splitter, and

976
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,960
the frosted fernander.

977
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,480
The brish, the pish, the piffer.

978
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,480
The blarter, the splatterer.

979
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:30,500
Oh, no.

980
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:31,760
The lubrifart.

981
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:34,180
The weezer.

982
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,940
The princess we invented.

983
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:39,000
The weezer and Mr. Sister invented the lubrifart.

984
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:39,440
Yes.

985
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,520
Well, they named them.

986
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:43,860
No, you know, Adam and Eve invented them.

987
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:44,980
And better words...

988
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,520
6,000 years ago.

989
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:54,240
Did you know that on our ranch in Texas, we've got the footprints, fossilized footprints of Adam and Eve?

990
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:57,440
Adam and erstwhile Eve?

991
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:57,860
Yeah.

992
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,680
I don't know if I believe that yet.

993
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,860
Oh, well, seeing is believing.

994
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,460
And when you see the Photoshopped photo, you'll know that it's real.

995
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:10,680
So it's Adam and Eve on the dinosaur, just as predicted by the evangelical movement?

996
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:19,320
Actually, you find their footprints inside the dinosaur footprints, because the dinosaurs were faster and ran away from the flood first.

997
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,760
And then Adam and Eve followed behind the dinosaurs.

998
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,440
And their feet sometimes would land in the dinosaur footprint in the mud.

999
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,480
It was mud then.

1000
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:31,700
And the dinosaur footprints made the Great Lakes and the many great...

1001
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:35,440
Those were really big dinosaurs that couldn't fit on the earth.

1002
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:35,440


1003
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:35,600
They were really big dinosaurs that couldn't fit on the ark.

1004
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:46,920
But yeah, if you come to our ranch place, the new Mega Fist Temple Lodge in Texas, we'll show you fossilized ghost tracks.

1005
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:50,120
We've got the ruins of Noah's Ark.

1006
00:53:50,300 --> 00:54:00,120
We've got the skeletons of the cave subgeniuses where they were tossed off the ark as it floated down the Paluxy River, which is flooding.

1007
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:00,420
The Paluxy?

1008
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,100
Yeah, the Paluxy River in Texas.

1009
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:03,720
That's where...

1010
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:09,120
It's famous for dinosaur tracks and Adam and Eve tracks and giant ape-man tracks.

1011
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,680
Because you know there was giants on the earth in them days.

1012
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:12,380
Yep.

1013
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,840
It says so in the Bible 6,000 years ago.

1014
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:17,580
Giants that lived 900 years.

1015
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,840
Where there's no blue, pink giant...

1016
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,560
Princess, we got that fart piano.

1017
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:22,820
She did just what I said.

1018
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:25,800
She did not have one on the way to the station.

1019
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:26,780
And it's...

1020
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:28,400
Here, go ahead and play it some more.

1021
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,600
Oh, what a beautiful sound.

1022
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,200
It's like a fart piano.

1023
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:38,200


1024
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:38,200


1025
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,840
Well, that microphone definitely works.

1026
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:44,820
Yes, this is someone playing classical music on fart pianos.

1027
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,100
Oh, that's like a player fart piano.

1028
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,840
Yes, this is a player fart piano.

1029
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:52,440
It's got a little tape and roll running through your phone there.

1030
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:52,780
Yes.

1031
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:53,180
That's clever.

1032
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,560
Play Johannes Bach's Fugend D minor.

1033
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:03,700
Now, that's a good one.

1034
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:03,700


1035
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,780
That sounds more like an elderly person doing raspberries.

1036
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:09,020
Heil, Heil, right into Führer's face.

1037
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:13,600
Bring me herr, herr, ses, be esch, a masker, esch, and be Heil.

1038
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,480
Heil, Heil, right into Führer's face.

1039
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:23,120
Well, that was pretty groovy, man.

1040
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:27,060
Now, it's a piano sound.

1041
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,020
There we go.

1042
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,680
Now, it's a piano sound.

1043
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:44,840
maintenant

1044
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,060
ContRA Sacramento

1045
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:53,260
Where is Silesium?

1046
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:56,040
Because I was always wondering when they did in Silesium...

1047
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:00,940
Graham-style beans are better than wolf brand chili any day.

1048
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:04,360
So go out and buy that wolf band

1049
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:07,400
If you want to be sick that day

1050
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:12,580
Ranch style

1051
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,600
Oh, ranch style

1052
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,520
Oh, how I am

1053
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:22,260
God, thank God there's only about three minutes left of the show.

1054
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:23,360
Isn't that wonderful?

1055
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:25,380
Yeah.

1056
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,980
Oh, that's another lovely sound effect.

1057
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:40,960
Princess Wee has become a sampler artiste.

1058
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:44,940
In five minutes, just because I said Google fart piano.

1059
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:48,560
See, we got a band. We got a band now.

1060
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,040
Let's see.

1061
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:51,980
Okay.

1062
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,600
When the band was...

1063
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:59,300
Dave and Wee, it's called Mondo Retardo Band, right?

1064
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:00,000
Yes.

1065
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:04,260
And when it's just Wee and Me, it's called Poo Water Towel.

1066
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:04,580
Right.

1067
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:06,160
Poo Water Towel?

1068
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:09,100
If it's us and Philo, then it's Doctors for Wotan.

1069
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:13,080
But what is it if it's Dave and Wee and Me?

1070
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,180
The band that was just here tonight.

1071
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,880
Mondo Retardo Poo Towel.

1072
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,520
Yeah. I like it.

1073
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:22,740
How about Cool Bummer?

1074
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:23,360
Cool Bummer. Okay, Cool Bummer.

1075
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,040
That was a band named Philo.

1076
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:25,320
Cool Bummer.

1077
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:26,260
Cool Bummer makes a little bit more sense.

1078
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:27,080
I'll go with Cool Bummer.

1079
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:28,760
That's a good band name.

1080
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:30,940
It's easier to say.

1081
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,040
Well, okay.

1082
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:40,920
This, in some ways, this radio program we've been forced to listen to and participate in

1083
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:44,700
has something to do with something called the Church of the Subgenius.

1084
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:45,700
Somehow.

1085
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:46,360
Yeah.

1086
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:53,680
A mystic fellowship, a secret society founded by the great J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1087
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:58,280
And it's shortly after he broke up with Ronald Reagan.

1088
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,820
Master of the Arcane Handshake.

1089
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,480
And for more information, that's it.

1090
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:09,660
For more information about the Church of the Subgenius, you would have to look at subgenius.com.

1091
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:10,460
If you want to.

1092
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:14,660
If you want more information, that would be one way to do it.

1093
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:16,940
And there's a lot to look at there.

1094
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,160
I'm not sure what to do.

1095
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:20,040
Click on events first.

1096
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,520
That leads to the naked pictures.

1097
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,840
Because there's naked stuff that happens at our events.

1098
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,460
I'm not saying that's good.

1099
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:33,720
It may not be the kind of nakedity that most people seek out.

1100
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:36,480
But, eh.

1101
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,580
Well, I think it's quite thoughtful.

1102
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,340
Worthy of sounding.

1103
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,980
She's seeking out.

1104
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:45,920
Especially in the case of Baby Bear.

1105
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:47,760
Who I believe.

1106
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:53,020
I don't know because I've never been a part of the Rumpty Organist.

1107
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:53,540
She.

1108
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,160
I've said that she might not be able to be there for very long.

1109
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,260
But she is bringing the Bob effigy for us to burn.

1110
00:58:59,480 --> 00:58:59,920
That sweet one.

1111
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,180
We always burn Bob.

1112
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:06,940
And we would burn the real Bob if he wanted us to.

1113
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:09,600
But he usually doesn't stick around for that.

1114
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:13,640
So we get various qualities of dummies.

1115
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,140
And kidnap them.

1116
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:17,860
Drug them.

1117
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,480
Put a Bob mask on them.

1118
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:20,740
Tie them to a chair.

1119
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:23,520
And surround them with.

1120
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:24,800
Faggots of wood.

1121
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,500
And dump some gasoline on it.

1122
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:30,200
And call a pagan who knows the secret of fire.

1123
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:32,080
It's usually that Jason guy.

1124
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:32,560
And then.

1125
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,020
Fire him up.

1126
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,880
Last year people were roasting.

1127
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:40,340
And this is not just something I'm saying.

1128
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:41,020
It's not a fable.

1129
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:44,840
People actually did roast hot dogs off of his burning feet.

1130
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:46,140
Last year.

1131
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:48,960
They light cigarettes off of his burning face.

1132
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,320
They'll walk up to the face of Bob.

1133
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:51,860
Scream.

1134
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:52,760
Well, it's not really Bob.

1135
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:53,240
Obviously.

1136
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,720
It's just some dork we found usually on the way there.

1137
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:57,800
Hitchhiking.

1138
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:01,580
And he's screaming under that mask.

1139
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:05,480
And people walk up and light their cigarettes off of that.

1140
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:06,660
Hey, you know what?

1141
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:07,220
We have to go.

1142
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:07,920
We have to go now.

1143
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:14,240
And I'm going to end up playing a piece of music by our friend Reverend Basil of the Psychoskeletons.

1144
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:17,120
Ah, Basil Metabolism.

1145
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,000
I love his works.

1146
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,400
I saw a picture of him for the first time.

1147
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,880
He sent a picture of his last email.

1148
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:22,960
He has a tons.

1149
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:23,420
He sent a picture of it on his creation.

1150
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,460
See this donít hair dryer?

1151
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:25,920
It was on myах import is used.

1152
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:25,980
It has to be cast on your YouTube mark.

1153
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:28,540
With a name like Basil you've got to have a monkish haircut.

1154
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:29,520
Mm-hmm .

1155
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:30,320

Thank you.

1158
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:58,260
Thank you.

1159
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:37,080
Thank you.

1160
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,600
Thank you.

1161

Thank you.

1167
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:33,900
Thank you.

1168
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:44,700
Thank you.

1169
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:53,500
Kill me!

1170
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:55,420
Get money, Bob!
