1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Turn that thing on! Put on them headphones.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:15,080
One hundred and eleven years ago, when I was thirty-three years old, right after the atomic wars,

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:22,520
my church was rubbed out by a band of wild pink boys.

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,140
Wait a minute.

5
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:29,640
It's showtime. Time for the subgenius hour and a half.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,420
The show that dare not even exist.

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,320
Join us now as we rocket away out of normal time into showtime

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,120
with your favorite horrifying horror host, Mobius Rex.

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,740
And you'll hear the voices of puzzling evidence.

10
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,900
Gary Bobram lies in a cast of thousands more.

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,680
It's mysterious, evil, spooky, eerie, creepy, wacky, kooky, fun.

12
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:59,360
It's loads of chuckles and chock full of gags and novelty.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,540
It's stuff that your boyfriends will want and that all your girlfriends will secretly admire.

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,920
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

15
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,980
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

16
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,980
The subgenius hour of swag!

17
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,540
Ooo.....

18
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,860
I'm going down to the river car.

19
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,320
There is a man I want to see.

20
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,640
Yea.. he's a ferryman.

21
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,260
He'll recognize me.

22
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,800
I'm going down now.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,640
to the riverside

24
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,120
there's a place I want to be

25
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,160
gonna talk

26
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,520
to the ferryman

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,160
he'll be expecting me

28
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,720
I'm crossing over now

29
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,620
to the other side

30
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,560
guitar solo

31
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,800
life is better there

32
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,200
on the other side

33
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,020
the grass is greener there

34
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,100
on the other side

35
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,940
and I, I'll get even there

36
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,940
on the other side

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
and everything will turn out alright

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,880
on the other side

39
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,840
I'm crossing over now

40
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,860
to the other side

41
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,600
the other side

42
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,300
guitar solo

43
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,020
I walked by the church house

44
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,620
late last night

45
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,840
yeah I walked by the church house

46
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,220
but I didn't go inside

47
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,340
cause I, I once slept

48
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,520
with the preacher's wife

49
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,980
she handed me a dime

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,240
ticket

51
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,100
to the other side

52
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,940
I'm crossing over now

53
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,600
guitar solo

54
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,020
to the other side

55
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,720
guitar solo

56
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,740
to the other side

57
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,500
guitar solo

58
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,920
music

59
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,700
guitar

60
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,200
guitar solo

61
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,480
blues

62
00:04:59,480 --> 00:04:59,980
chords

63
00:04:59,980 --> 00:04:59,980


64
00:04:59,980 --> 00:04:59,980


65
00:04:59,980 --> 00:04:59,980


66
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,680
guitar solo

67
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,860
Friends, it's real late at night here.

68
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,660
I've got to do this show, but I've got to do it real quiet.

69
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,220
We can't let that happen again.

70
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,780
This music in the background is a band called

71
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,580
Morphine. It's just drums

72
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,260
and a sax and a slide bass.

73
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,920
We're going to mostly just do a music show.

74
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,480
I've got this tape of Devo

75
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,340
cover tunes that you won't believe.

76
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,640
But first, I do have

77
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,540
a rant on tape here from

78
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,540
Reverend

79
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:32,260
Reverend Ipsissimus John Shirley.

80
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,320
So, hang on.

81
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,920
Stay tuned for the only words.

82
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,580
But we have to be real quiet.

83
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,780
Oh, yes.

84
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,420
Oh, yes.

85
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,240
Ladies and gentlemen,

86
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,820
I'm here

87
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,100
to talk about sin

88
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,020
and the payment for sin.

89
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,340
And I know sin.

90
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,920
I know it intimately.

91
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,220
My name is the Reverend Johnny S.

92
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,460
E for every,

93
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,180
S for sin, and

94
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:28,520
S for sin.

95
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,900
S for certainly.

96
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,840
And sure, that's kind of funny.

97
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,580
You can laugh. I'm just a damn hick.

98
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,480
Now, there's no need to wince

99
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,520
with embarrassment.

100
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,380
You see, folks, Lord knows it's true.

101
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,220
I'm just an Arkansas po-bucker.

102
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,240
My daddy kept a ruckus.

103
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,520
He kept a dodge up on the cinder blocks

104
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,860
in the front yard.

105
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,900
Some nights we had to steal chickens to eat.

106
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,200
Our situation wasn't so bad, though.

107
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,500
We all got it bad

108
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,920
in our own special way.

109
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,300
The Lord tests us all

110
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,240
and makes us all suffer

111
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,020
with great particularity.

112
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,640
Each to his best

113
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,060
in deepest capacity

114
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,360
we will suffer.

115
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,100
The Lord tests us and tests us

116
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,420
and there ain't no cheating on that test.

117
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,260
Now, when I look out at y'all

118
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,240
and I say sin,

119
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,780
some of you, when I say sin,

120
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,680
are almost licking your lips.

121
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,600
Now, I ask you,

122
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,700
is that the appropriate response?

123
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,080
Well, sure, with some of y'all,

124
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,960
it's the way it was with me.

125
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,100
There's no relief without sin.

126
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,320
There's no relief without sin.

127
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,200
And there's no real party

128
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,680
as is bereft of relief.

129
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,060
And relief,

130
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,520
it comes from big-time fun.

131
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,840
Fun with weightlifter muscles on it.

132
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,280
Fun that concentrates first

133
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,760
in this part of the body

134
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,200
and then that part.

135
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,520
I guess I know about sin.

136
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,520
Well, now, let me tell you,

137
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,060
something, Lars.

138
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,920
Sweet Lord's eternal life.

139
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,580
Now, that is no fun.

140
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,740
And it's not supposed to be.

141
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
No fun, my baby, no fun.

142
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,860
Are you thinking that this

143
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,400
redneck Bible thumper

144
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,860
don't know turkey droppings about sin?

145
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,320
Is that what you think?

146
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,940
Well, let me tell you, my friend.

147
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,580
Let me tell you,

148
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,200
good Lord,

149
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,100
well, the good Lord,

150
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,320
he forgave me

151
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,660
for a great deal of sin.

152
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,780
I have been up to my neck

153
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,300
in sensuality.

154
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,200
I have sunk myself

155
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,200
in that particular

156
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,800
La Brea tar pit of life.

157
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,440
And it is only thanks

158
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,300
to our sweet, precious Lord

159
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,400
that I have escaped

160
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,780
that ravenous suction,

161
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,660
that tar pit suction

162
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,060
that seemed to fasten itself

163
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,500
in my lower parts

164
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,360
and suck and suck

165
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,500
until it drew the life out of me.

166
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,200
Yes, I know sin.

167
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,260
And I won't tell you

168
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,260
what my sins were.

169
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,160
Yes, I could talk about my time

170
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,080
as a counselor at a girls' summer camp.

171
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,820
Well, hell, 14, 15-year-old girls

172
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,940
soft as little kittens,

173
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,220
and there on the aching side

174
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:07,840
of that mountain

175
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,120
where the smell of the pines

176
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,060
seemed to call me out every night

177
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,260
to prowl the cabins like a cougar.

178
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,820
But no, it's best that sin remains hidden.

179
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,200
Neither will I befoul your ears

180
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,160
with the long nights

181
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,540
in bars and brothels.

182
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,280
Yes, of rutting with marijuana-dreaming whores

183
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,520
in puddles of vomit.

184
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,700
But that was my life

185
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,940
before I came to the Lord.

186
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,880
I cannot bring myself to mention it.

187
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,160
Got an urge, got a surge,

188
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,120
and it's out of control.

189
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,860
I got an urge, I want a purge,

190
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,620
cause I'm losing control.

191
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,920
I got enough control,

192
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,580
I'm gonna tell you all about it.

193
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,480
I got enough control,

194
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,080
I'm gonna make you feel it shouting.

195
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,140
Got a problem,

196
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,640
I got a problem,

197
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,420
I got enough control over it.

198
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,680
I got enough control over it.

199
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,120
I got enough control over it.

200
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,900
Sky glass, sky sky,

201
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,260
so good at that, that last.

202
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,820
Tell you all about it,

203
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,660
I wanna scream and shout it.

204
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:15,940

215
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,260
.

216
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:00,920
.

217
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,160

.

224
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,760
Ho, ho, ho

225
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,460
There's a pinfall somewhere you can't see

226
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,140
Ho, ho, ho

227
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,180
The tooth's in the top of a finger's tree

228
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,820
Ho, ho, ho

229
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,980
She's bent down in a row by a one-to-five-er

230
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,680
Ho, ho, ho

231
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,440
The tooth's gone down in a whistle-mower

232
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,240
Ho, ho, ho

233
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,280
She's just a girl, she's just a girl, the girl you want

234
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,080
She's just a girl, she's just a girl, the girl you want

235
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,840
You live upon every word you've done

236
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,640
Ho, ho, ho

237
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,360
You know you're headed for the pleasure of

238
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,100
Ho, ho, ho

239
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,380
The words can't stop on the tip of your tongue

240
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,180
Ho, ho, ho

241
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,260
She's a little thing but you knew it all along

242
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,680
Ho, ho, ho

243
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,680
She's just a girl, she's just a girl, the girl you want

244
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,140
You're meant for living for why doesn't it look right

245
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,460
To just the girl, she's just the girl, the girl you want

246
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,320
To just the girl

247
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:48,220
You're meant for living for why doesn't it look right

248
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,000
Just the girl you want

249
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,200
guitar solo

250
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,180
guitar solo

251
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,080
guitar solo

252
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,180
guitar solo

253
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,340
guitar solo

254
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,920
guitar solo

255
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,820
Can I bring myself to mention them numberless, faceless whores?

256
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,260
My name is Legion, cried the whore of Babylon.

257
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,540
Excuse me.

258
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,280
I never think of those whores now.

259
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:34,040
Them whores whose urgent hair and their ebony pubes

260
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,960
seem to shine out at me.

261
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,700
Eyes that wander the space between you like midges

262
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,400
flying in the air.

263
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,860
Yes, I know the devil's snow.

264
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,300
Yes, I know the devil's snow,

265
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,160
that crystal lily, that medicinal-tasting temptress.

266
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,520
Yes, Lord, I know the devil's snow.

267
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,820
I have flown through clouds of cocaine in a high turbulence.

268
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,840
And yes, I know sin.

269
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,320
Are you convinced?

270
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,700
Well, I cannot tell you about it.

271
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,420
I will not tell you about that night on the tar roof

272
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,820
of Blue Street Billy's.

273
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,360
I will not tell you about that night on the tar roof

274
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:14,360


275
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:14,360


276
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:14,360


277
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:14,360


278
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:14,360


279
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,520
That crazed, mightily pierced, teeny-bobsterous and I,

280
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,600
the both of us gone wild on Angel Dust,

281
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,740
the irony of that name, Angel Dust, can you imagine?

282
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:30,900
And mad with PCP driving my degraded but engorged manhood

283
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,600
again and again into that hysterically laughing

284
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,620
punk rock bitch whore.

285
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,280
1979 it was.

286
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,180
As the rain lashed us and the lightning on us,

287
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,080
we zipped the sky.

288
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,380
I will not tell you of it.

289
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,080
But you can take my word for it.

290
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,060
I know sin.

291
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,580
I know sin.

292
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,460
In the end, in the end.

293
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,360
The folks impressively

294
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:23,360


295
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,800
Table that should be.

296
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,920
See, .

297
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,520
Are not responsible .

298
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:42,580
Yeah, at thelamontadress.net

299
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,180
And Mr.

300
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,820
Maybe just another rap

301
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,200
But you're running out of sap

302
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,980
Yes, you're running out of sap

303
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,560
Well, you better take the rap

304
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,920
Dying under daddy's cap

305
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,580
Dying under daddy's cap

306
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,520
It's at the top of the list

307
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,660
That you can't get pissed

308
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,340
No, you can't get pissed

309
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,180
It's rule number one

310
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,360
Living right isn't good

311
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,080
Living right isn't fun

312
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,720
Time tested and true

313
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,580
You gotta put it through

314
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,420
You gotta put it through

315
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:32,920
Through

316
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,980
Through

317
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,200
Through

318
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,720
Through

319
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,220
Through

320
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,320
Through

321
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,820
He was a mongoloid, mongoloid

322
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,620
Happier than you and me

323
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,140
Mongoloid, mongoloid

324
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,040
When he turned and what he could see

325
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,660
Mongoloid, mongoloid

326
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,200
Mongoloid, mongoloid

327
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,420
Born from a son of a deke

328
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,980
Mongoloid, mongoloid

329
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,700
When he turned and what he could see

330
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:55,300
He wore a hat and he had a job

331
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,580
And he brought home the breakers

332
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:05,500
So no one knew, knew, knew

333
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,640
He was a mongoloid

334
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,940
Mongoloid, mongoloid

335
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,700
Friends were unaware

336
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,620
Mongoloid, mongoloid

337
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:20,260
But he even cared

338
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,980
Mongoloid, mongoloid

339
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,560
What's a mongoloid?

340
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,360
Grow old with sovereignty

341
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,380
Mongoloid, mongoloid

342
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:33,100
When he turned and what he could see

343
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:37,840
He wore a hat and he had a job

344
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:43,920
And he brought home the breakers

345
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:49,720
So no one knew, knew, knew

346
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,460
He was a mongoloid, mongoloid

347
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,260
Happier than you and me

348
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,940
Mongoloid, mongoloid

349
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,200
Mongoloid, mongoloid

350
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,680
When he turned and what he could see

351
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,040
What he could see, what he could see

352
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,620
What he could see, what he could see

353
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:13,120
What he could see, what you could be

354
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,660
What he would like to be

355
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,220
It could be, what he could be

356
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,280
What he would like to see

357
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,360
It could be, what he could be

358
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,720
What he could be, what he could be

359
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,400
It could be, what he would like to see

360
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,600
It could be, what he can be

361
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,740
What he could be

362
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:28,680
But you can take my word for it

363
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,760
I know sin

364
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,860
And I know the devil personally

365
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,300
I know the devil personally

366
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:44,120
And you feminist ladies, you postmodern homo-homo feminist ladies,

367
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,320
you think there's a patriarchy here on Earth?

368
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,880
Well, you don't know phallocentrism till you get to hell,

369
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,780
because Satan is going to make you dance around a steaming phallus

370
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:01,540
in the green and gold flames of retribution, ladies.

371
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:15,080
Satan, ladies, is no sensitive Berkeley male.

372
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:22,740
But get up to heaven, and you find that Jesus and Mother Mary are receiving equal pay.

373
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:31,060
And do not, do not fool yourself into thinking there's no money in heaven.

374
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,200
Was there ever any place worth being for long without money?

375
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,340
You see, money and faith, well, sir, one's a unit of the other.

376
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,420
Money is a unit of faith.

377
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:46,180
And if you give the ministry of the Reverend Johnny S. one dollar,

378
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,740
then you have one dollar's worth of faith.

379
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:52,380
And when you give him five hundred dollars, that's five hundred dollars worth of faith,

380
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,140
redeemable at the gate of heaven.

381
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,800
And I don't mean heaven's gate. I mean the gate of heaven.

382
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,380
Now, as in Luke, verse 44,

383
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,200
And turning to the woman, hey, Jesus said unto Simon,

384
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,480
Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house.

385
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,780
Thou gavest me no water for my feet,

386
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,980
but she hath wetted my feet with her tears,

387
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,420
and wiped them with her hair.

388
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:26,120
Thou gavest me no kiss, but she hath not seized to kiss my feet.

389
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,940
Well, folks, that's nothing less than the right attitude.

390
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,520
And if you think that's the right attitude,

391
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,300
then you're wrong.

392
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:36,140
A faith payment is a questionable investment, ladies and gentlemen.

393
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:41,380
You forget that I have the God-given power to say into your souls.

394
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,840
And right here I can see your heart before me like a devil's dinner on a plate.

395
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,900
And I can tell you, you sir, that the heart I see within your breast,

396
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,880
the soul quivering on that plate, it makes me sick.

397
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,720
They tell us that we lost our tents.

398
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,040
Giraffes and nips all jumped the fence.

399
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,340
Just to brought up ladies and gents.

We are zeo.

405
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,420
We have red hair that stands up straight.

406
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,620
We have a red nose that's so ornate.

407
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,780
Are we not clowns?

408
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,660
We are bozo.

409
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,240
Are we not clowns?

We are zeo.

Are we not wangs?

412
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,320
We are dildos.

Oh, oh.

Green acres is the place to be.

00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,800
For living is a lot for me.

430
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,200
Land for an hour so far and wide.

431
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,580
Gee, man, and just give me the good news.

432

455
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:26,900
Sorry

456
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:37,840
What are you guys doing?

457
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,980
What is this?

00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,400
What is this?

459
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,400
What kind of...

460
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,320
What is this?

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,160
why am I there?

472
00:31:54,900 --> 00:32:05,500
I'm proud to be an Ogie from Muscogee, a place where even squares can have a ball.

473
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:13,620
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse, and white lightning's still the biggest drill

474
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,220
of all.

475
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,840
And your boots are still in style for manly footwear.

476
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,920
Beads and Roman sandals just won't do.

477
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:31,660
Football's still the roughest thing on campus, and the kids still respect the college team.

478
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:40,480
I'm proud to be an Ogie from Muscogee, a place where even squares can have a ball.

Together, you and I.

For united we stand.

488
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,720
Divided we fall.

489
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,960
And if our backs should ever be against the wall,

490
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,180
we'll be together.

491
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:31,680
Together.

492
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,260
You and I.

493
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,180
Who am I united with on my phone?

494
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,780
Chris, this is Ken.

495
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:42,160
I'm calling in from the Slovenia X-Day drill.

496
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,480
Oh, already the good folks are checking in from all over the area.

497
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,900
You're calling from the X-Day drill,

498
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,640
the subgenius X-Day drill to my program.

499
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,720
It is July 4th, by the way,

500
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:00,180
and you're listening to Aerial View on WFMU.

501
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,100
My name is Chris T,

502
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:05,720
and on our lines is Ken checking in from the subgenius X-Day drill.

503
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,740
Ken, you want to give us some details?

504
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,140
Well, I was going to put the Ivan Stang on the floor.

505
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,400
I'm going to let you talk to him for a while about the details of this event.

506
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:21,440
We got the mugwag, mom's dumps, and a UFO right outside of our window here.

507
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:25,280
You've got a UFO outside the window, and you've got Reverend Ivan Stang standing by?

508
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,900
It's almost as out of breath as you are,

509
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,200
because we just made it up from our excrementation trip.

510
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,400
I don't even want to know what that was.

511
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,980
It had the word excrement in it, did it?

512
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,460
Yes, it's excrementation.

513
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,100
Is Reverend Ivan Stang there?

514
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,380
Can I speak with him?

515
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,180
Yeah, let me put him on the phone.

516
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,480
All right.

517
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,600
Praise WFMU.

518
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,400
Praise Chris T.

519
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,600
This is Reverend Stang.

520
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,100
Reverend Stang, you and I have never talked before,

521
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,300
yet you're a man that I've admired for years.

522
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,900
Well, you're a man that I've admired for years,

523
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,960
ever since you put down that Bob Dean shirt that you used to call every now and then.

524
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:05,420
Oh, so I hear that my friend Ken mailed you that tape, by the way, of that program.

525
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,600
And what is that guy's deal?

526
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,280
Oh, he's just a pink.

527
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,360
What can I say?

528
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,660
I just do not even talk about it.

529
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,500
Okay, let's talk about the X-Day drill.

530
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:21,760
Well, you know, we're not really celebrating the 4th of July.

531
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:28,260
We celebrate the 5th of July, because next year, July 5th, 1998, is the end of the world.

532
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,800
July 5th, 1998, is the end of the world, and you've heard it on this program.

533
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:38,160
Well, you hear it on the hour of slack every week, probably more than you'd ever care to.

534
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,320
Absolutely.

535
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,220
Unlike the Heaven's Gate.

536
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:45,660
Like people with their, you know, kind of half-assed approach to mass suicide.

537
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,400
What we're trying, we're going to do it right.

538
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,940
You don't believe in flesh vehicles?

539
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:50,860
Is that what you're saying?

540
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,560
We're not leaving anything to chance.

541
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,900
Those people, well, they had the date wrong and everything else,

542
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:03,700
and we have never felt like we had to, in order to catch a ride on the bus,

543
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,920
that we had to jump in front of the bus and let it hit us.

544
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:11,340
We're happy to wait on the corner with Jingle,

545
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,700
and we're not feeling our change in our pockets until the bus arrives to pick us up

546
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:18,340
and take us to Planet X or wherever it's taken us.

547
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,660
We actually don't know where we're going yet.

548
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,080
So you're not willing to...

549
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,700
But by God, the trip is half the fun.

550
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,260
You're not willing to trade in your flesh vehicle?

551
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,360
Is that what I hear you saying, Reverend Stang?

552
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:36,040
No, we're not going to leave our containers until we've got a better container to jump into.

553
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,220
I think that's probably a wise move.

554
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:38,740
Yeah.

555
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,040
I think that's a wise thing to do.

556
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:40,640
That's why...

557
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,340
Yeah.

558
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,820
You are so much wiser than Doe.

559
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,440
Doe!

560
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:45,900
Doe!

561
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,140
Well, no, we never said that.

562
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,800
Remember, the church is a sub-genius.

563
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,760
We're not geniuses about that.

564
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,020
We're not trying to...

565
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,380
We're just better.

566
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,360
We're not smarter.

567
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,760
We're just better than everybody else.

568
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,180
Yes.

569
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,080
They love to hear us say that, too.

570
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:06,320
So let me get an insight into what's happening right now around you.

571
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,520
Can you describe the scene as it's unfolding?

572
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,980
What are you looking at?

573
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,960
Is anybody naked?

574
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,560
Drinking beer?

575
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:18,720
Actually, where I'm standing, I can't see the naked people because I'm up too close to the road.

576
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,820
But the naked area is a little bit further down the hill.

577
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:23,540
So you...

578
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:30,960
If this fake, gigantic UFO hanging from the trees wasn't in the way, I could probably see some skin.

579
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:34,460
Someone has hung a gigantic UFO from the trees where you are?

580
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:34,740
Yes.

581
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:40,000
It is a fake UFO, but it looks more real than most of the fake...

582
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,340
most of the real ones I've ever seen.

583
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,300
To tell the truth.

584
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:50,460
And, yeah, we're at Brushwood, which is a campground in far western New York State.

585
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,220
Far western New York State.

586
00:37:52,320 --> 00:38:01,440
There are several bands here that are, I guess, Jehovah Hates Fred is going to be playing pretty soon.

587
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,060
And the Swinging Love Corpses are here, of course.

588
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,880
Doctors for Bob.

589
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:07,820
But...

590
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:10,720
And there's all the top preachers of the church.

591
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,880
Sister Susie the Floozy is getting...

592
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,320
She's getting ready for a hot oil mud wrestling.

593
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,080
That's part of our rehearsal for the end of the world.

594
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,920
Are you telling me...

595
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,020
Let me see if I have this right.

596
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,240
Sister Susie the Floozy is there?

597
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:22,880
Yes.

598
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:23,520
Wow.

599
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,320
Okay.

600
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,120
All the subgenius topless preacher babes are here, and they're oiling up.

601
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,520
I'm serious, by the way.

602
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:35,900
Nothing that I'm saying is in any way an exaggeration.

603
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,500
Stang, can I ask you something?

604
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:40,180
Has Hank Williams, Jr. ever showed up at any of your festivities?

605
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,100
Because I think he'd be right at home.

606
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,180
I can barely hear you.

607
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,460
I'm wondering if Bo Cephas has ever showed up there.

608
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,900
You know, Hank Williams, Jr.

609
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,080
Has he ever shown up at any of these festivities?

610
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,880
You know, if he had, we could have saved Hank.

611
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,240
We could have saved Hank Williams, Sr.

612
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,720
If we'd only had the chance to turn him on to Bob.

613
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,120
I just know. I know.

614
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:07,800
You know, you can tell by listening to that guy's music that he was a subgenius who lacked only Bob.

615
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:08,540
Slack.

616
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,540
He lacked slack in his life, is what he lacked.

617
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,040
Yeah.

618
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:11,780
So how...

619
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,960
He was chasing false slack.

620
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:14,360
Right.

621
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:19,140
And I gotta admit, you know, if you don't have real slack, false slack is certainly better than nothing at all.

622
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,920
I guess false slack will have to do.

623
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,280
But let me ask you this.

624
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,260
What is...

625
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:30,960
How should we go about achieving slack on this July 4th, 1997?

626
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,840
I mean, the rest of us.

627
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,420
Because I hate to think that when the normals are...

628
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,300
When the normals are taken away...

629
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,460
I hate to think that I'm gonna be among them.

630
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,020
Well, the normals aren't gonna be taken away.

631
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,300
The normals are gonna be slaughtered like pigs a year from now.

632
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,300
Not by us.

633
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,920
The aliens will handle that.

634
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,500
We're not nearly as blood...

635
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:55,080
Well, actually, we are as bloodthirsty as any other religious nuts.

636
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,700
I'll grant you that.

637
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,920
And I'm sure that some of the subgeniuses are count...

638
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,020
Have a list of enemies that they're gonna slaughter as soon as they're on the escape vessel.

639
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:05,680
But...

640
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,040
Ha ha ha.

641
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:20,860
You know, personally, I like to look at the joy and slack aspect of all this rather than the fact that I can, if I want to, have my fifth-grade teacher, Mrs. Darden, tortured for years...

642
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,520
Years and years and years.

643
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,340
...reporting me to eat that pimento cheese sandwich that one time in 1965.

644
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,080
She thinks I've forgotten if she's even alive.

645
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,120
But you are a man with a mission.

646
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,080
If...

647
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,900
She...

648
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,860
If that fifth-grade teacher of mine is not alive on X-Day...

649
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:40,580
...we will bring her back to life so that I can torture her.

650
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,180
Wow.

651
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,700
I was just saying that I didn't care, but I wasn't interested in the torture stuff.

652
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,260
Hey, wait a minute.

653
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:44,760
So X...

654
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,240
Just let me get this straight for a minute.

655
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,800
X-Day is gonna be July 5th or July 4th of next year?

656
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:50,800
July 5th.

657
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,500
July 5th.

658
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:51,580
Okay.

659
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,960
July 5th is our Independence Day.

660
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:54,540
Right.

661
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,280
The normals and, you know, the regular...

662
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,800
You know, the Americans celebrate July 4th.

663
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:06,020
I guess that's when they celebrate the Kennedy assassination and Wounded Knee and, you know,

664
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:06,200
the...

665
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,680
The invasion of Panama and the Gulf War and all those other...

666
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,900
Vietnam War and all those other glorious moments in our history.

667
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,200
But we...

668
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:15,680
No.

669
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,040
We...

670
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,100
I...

671
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,920
To tell the truth, I kind of forgot that today was a holiday for everybody else.

672
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,080
We're concentrating on the fifth.

673
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:22,780
It is.

674
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,480
Today is a holiday.

675
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:28,360
And I'm actually enjoying my day so far, Stang.

676
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,100
I'm glad you called.

677
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:33,580
Well, we know that you got there late to the station, so you must be getting either some

678
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,080
kind of slack or anti-slack.

679
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,180
I've got to go.

680
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:36,180


681
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:36,180


682
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:36,180


683
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:36,180


684
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:36,180


685
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:36,180


686
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:36,180


687
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:36,780
I've got slack today.

688
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,120
Well, you better get to it.

689
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,540
I'm sure the people need to hear some music and hear from other Fourth of July...

690
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,880
What you're really saying, Stang, is you want to get a beer.

691
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,160
Am I hearing you right?

692
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,020
Lips that have touched the bottle will never touch mine.

693
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:49,820
I don't...

694
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:52,200
I consider alcohol to be false slack.

695
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:52,640
Oh, okay.

696
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,560
I'm strictly a frop man myself.

697
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,360
A frop man?

698
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:56,940
But I'll tell you what.

699
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,480
If you've got any frop you want to shoot my way, boy, I'll be sure to take a little

700
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,420
slug off of that.

701
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,220
I'll pack it up my exit wound.

702
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:04,940
I'll eat it.

703
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:05,680
I'll smoke it.

704
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,180
I'll do anything.

705
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:06,180


706
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:06,180


707
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:06,180


708
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:06,180


709
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:06,700
Anything you want.

710
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:06,980
Frap.

711
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:07,960
You want some frap?

712
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,620
Is that what you're saying?

713
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,520
Yeah, I'm fine.

714
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,040
I'll take my fair share of frappy.

715
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:11,940
Frappy?

716
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:15,920
I'm not putting down anybody who's getting drunk off their gourds this weekend.

717
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,740
Believe me, I would if I could.

718
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:22,820
Well, you know, I'm asking people today to check in from the various Fourth of July celebrations

719
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:26,300
all around this great area, the listening area at WFMU.

720
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,040
I want people to check in and let me know how their celebrations are going.

721
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,780
Well, ours...

722
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:36,160
We're taking our clothes off even though it's freezing cold up here in the...

723
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,780
In the hills and it's drizzly, horrible weather.

724
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,840
We don't care.

725
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,780
You're taking your clothes off?

726
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:42,440
All our equipment's broken.

727
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,760
That just means we have to yell louder.

728
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,500
Is there any sex happening yet?

729
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,720
Now, what kind of a question is that?

730
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:55,580
If I answered you that, everybody in the whole state would head this way.

731
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:56,340
Well...

732
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:01,180
If I told you what was really going on, this would suddenly turn into Woodstock all over

733
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:01,480
again.

734
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,120
Now...

735
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,880
I'm afraid that the Brushwood can't handle it.

736
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,220
The Brushwood?

737
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,040
The Brushwood.

738
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,280
That's the campground where...

739
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,020
Oh, okay.

740
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,680
You don't want people trampling the campgrounds up there.

741
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:10,880
Right.

742
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,500
So what you're saying is to stay away from the X-Day trial.

743
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:21,280
Well, unless you've spent your $30 church membership fees, I would definitely stay away.

744
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,520
Now, is that fee payable in cash upon entry directly to you?

745
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:25,660
Yeah.

746
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,260
Okay.

747
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,100
Well, see, that makes it easier.

748
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,880
I believe in cutting back on bureaucracy wherever possible.

749
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:35,140
Oh, actually, if anybody wants to know about...

750
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:35,300
Well, I think there's a...

751
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:35,760
I mean, the...

752
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,120
There's a...

753
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,260
Brushwood has a website.

754
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,920
I think it's www.brushwood.com.

755
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:42,540
Okay.

756
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,720
www.brushwood.com.

757
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,940
Brushwood is one word.

758
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:47,520
Uh-huh.

759
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,920
So you can check out the other things happening out here.

760
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:58,520
And, or you can always check www.subgenius.com for the nude photos from last year.

761
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:05,020
And, by the way, in about three weeks, we'll have an hour of flak on WFMU that should...

762
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:05,120
It's a joke.

763
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:05,120


764
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:05,120


765
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,520
Whoa!

766
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,420
Theme song!

767
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,040
Oh girl!

768
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:12,040


769
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:12,420
Gershwin is there one.

770
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:13,240
He said, ah.

771
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:13,240


772
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:13,240


773
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:13,240


774
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:13,240


775
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,100
Daily.

776
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:14,360
You just said, you're, got the D momentum.

777
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,660
I'm like a V超 R disappears just, and then, I picked it out.

778
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:18,660


779
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:18,660


780
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:22,900
I'm excited that said launch was Sachen,ble很 крут, that-

781
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,360
Larry Ding.

782
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:24,560
Two of you are waiting on the sweatshirt.

783
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:24,600
I think that's...

784
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,220
No, no, sorry.

785
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:25,600
To you, Larry is here to...

786
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:25,680
I'm sorry.

787
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:30,680
I'm actually, it looks like that it has to leave.

788
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,080
We'll do that shortly.

789
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,480
S, sir.

790
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:35,960
it under the rain.

791
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,200
Ah ha!

792
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:37,740
Okay.

793
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,920
That's what everybody else is doing right now.

794
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:43,240
That's, that's a, I appreciate the suggestion, Reverend Stang.

795
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:47,960
You've been, you've been very kind and generous to spend this time with us on the phone here.

796
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:52,300
I appreciate you calling from the X Day Drill and letting us know what's going on up there.

797
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,860
Um, alright, well thanks, Chris.

798
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:55,900
Did you need to say anything?

799
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,900
Okay, that's it.

800
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,460
Listen, Reverend Stang, just, I want you to remember one thing.

801
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,680
To be careful out there.

802
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:09,420
Uh, I'll remember that the next time I'm flipping the breaker switches while standing in the

803
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:12,160
puddle to get the electric guitars going.

804
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,440
Yeah, you don't want to go, man, like that.

805
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,860
That, you know, the guy from the...

806
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:15,960
Hey, I'm not afraid.

807
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,040
The guy from the Yardbirds went like that.

808
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,540
Just, he just fried right up.

809
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:21,020
Got all fried up.

810
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:24,680
So, Reverend Stang, don't you fry this Fourth of July.

811
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,400
Okay?

812
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,140
Don't you fry.

813
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,420
Praise Bob, praise Chris.

814
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,880
And, uh, thanks, Stang.

815
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:31,540
Praise FMU.

816
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,100
Ha!

817
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,160
Kill Bob.

818
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,060
Oh, God.

819
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:42,380
The number here is 201-678-7743.

820
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,320
You're listening to Aerial View on WFMU.

821
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,620
Fourth of July spectacular.

822
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,400
Spectacular.

823
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,060
Spectacular.

824
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,820
talking about Ocean Everything I Have to say.

825
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:14,820


826
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,980
Sweet talk.

827
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:31,980


828
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:32,440
Bop.

829
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,140
Evil.

830
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,460
Are we not men?

831
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,140
E-E-E-O-O.

832
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,420
God created man.

833
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,460
God created man.

834
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,320
God created man.

835
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,940
God created man.

836
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:57,100
But he needed the monkey to do it.

837
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,480
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

838
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,680
Oh, my funky man.

839
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:07,000
In business suits.

840
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:10,960
Teachers and critics.

841
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,620
All dance the flute.

842
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,600
Are we not men?

843
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:20,880
We are demons.

844
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,640
Are we not men?

845
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,860
E-E-E-O-O.

846
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:34,380
Are we not men?

847
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,540
E-E-E-O-O.

848
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,980
We are demons.

849
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,380
Yes, are we not men?

850
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:46,600
E-E-E-O-O.

851
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,300
E-E-E-O-O.

852
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:48,300


853
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:48,300


854
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:48,720
Oh, oh.

855
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,500
Oh, oh.

856
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:50,560
Oh, oh.

857
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,320
Oh, oh.

858
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,720
Oh, oh.

859
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:55,020


860
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:08,820
Thank you.

861
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,600
Thank you.

862
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,440
Thank you.

863
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,520
Thank you.

864
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:26,660
Thank you.

865
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,440
Thank you.

866
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:01,380
Thank you.

867
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,680
Thank you.

868
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,260
Thank you.

869
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,460
Thank you.

870
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:31,300
Only not men.

871
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:33,760
D-E-V-O.

872
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:47,120
Yes, friends, and as always,

873
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:47,600
remember,

874
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:51,380
Dob's Spelled Backwords

875
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:52,880
is still

876
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,280
sbbobobbed.

877
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:09,960
Yes, and it's been an interesting, different kind of an hour of slack tonight day, hasn't it, Bean?

878
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:14,340
I'm going to tell you who all those bands were doing those Devo covers.

879
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:32,000
You know, we didn't do that much Bob talking tonight, but Devo is probably about as close to being the ultimate subgenius band as any band ever was.

880
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:43,320
Then we heard from the beginning there, with Reverend John Shirley ranting about sin in between,

881
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:44,320
uncontrollable.

882
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:47,280
Uncontrollable urge was done by The View.

883
00:53:48,060 --> 00:54:00,520
That unique version of Girl You Want was Devo from a live bootleg, November 1982, doing Girl You Want Aeneo Morricone style.

884
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:08,820
Mongoloid, the other version of Mongoloid there was by Jupiter.

885
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:12,460
Oh, and I almost forgot, Shrivel Up by Knife Lust.

886
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:17,020
Jaco Bozo is by The Fireman.

887
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:22,200
The second version of Mongoloid that I played is by The Deadliners.

888
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:28,300
And Oki from Muskogee was performed by the Bakersfield Bougie Boys.

889
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:42,440
We heard a long clip of Yours Truly on Chris T's show, Aerial View, on WFMU during the X Day Drill, followed by Jaco Homo by Lonnie and the Boys.

890
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:43,880
And the Devotions.

891
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:51,400
Blockhead as rendered by the Doguloids, or the Doguloids.

892
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:56,900
And the final Jaco Homo by the Touch Tone Tuners.

893
00:54:57,140 --> 00:55:06,380
And all of those came from a thing called the Devo Cover Collection, which I got from the Devo fan...

894
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,600
What you might call the Ultimate Devo Archives.

895
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:12,440
And the guy who started the Devo Archives first heard...

896
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:19,420
the band Devo on the Hour of Slack about ten years ago.

897
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:30,460
And the gal who runs the Firesign Theatre fan outreach first heard of the Firesign Theatre on the Hour of Slack.

898
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:34,380
Or actually, through the church. I sent her a tape, let me put it that way.

899
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:37,340
Praise Bob, friends.

900
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:40,580
And let us now give finally...

901
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,380
I've got some kind of background.

902
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:43,100
I've got some kind of background music here.

903
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,540
I can't... I'm shaking, man.

904
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:50,220
I can't do the P.O. Box without the background music.

905
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,000
Okay.

906
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:56,340
And friends, you can write for free information from B-B-B-Bob...

907
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:58,720
at...

908
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:04,100
Post Office Box 140306.

909
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:08,920
That's P.O. Box 140306.

910
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,740
In the lovely Dallas, Texas.

911
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:14,920
75214.

912
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,280
Once again, that's Box 140306.

913
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:22,680
Dallas, Texas 75214.

914
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:26,200
This is huge voodoo in the background.

915
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:30,160
Although, I think I'm gonna switch over to Hate for a Pink Planet.

916
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:32,500
Why not?

917
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:36,000
And friends, you can always email for information.

918
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,300
We'll email it back to you.

919
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,040
Just email to Slack at Metro...

920
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:40,860
No, man.

921
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:42,100
I keep thinking of my old one.

922
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:45,120
It's Slack at subgenius.com.

923
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:48,160
Slack at subgenius.com.

924
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:53,920
If you want to email me, I'm i.stang at subgenius.com.

925
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,260
www.subgenius.com.

926
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:57,960
It's a worldwide...

927
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,340
I told you.

928
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,320
Did I not?

929
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,280
And the system's gonna fail.

930
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:07,960
Subgenius.

931
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:10,720
You must always be given a chance to step...

932
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,460
...to liberate themselves from the...

933
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:13,080
Normals.

934
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:14,000
...before the...

935
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:14,540
Normals.

936
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:15,160
...are executed.

937
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,900
When you see you and I getting together,

938
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:23,280
it is because we have begun to realize that we have a common enemy.

939
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:27,920
And the only time we'll be able to come together with a common objective

940
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:32,780
and a common goal is when we first develop a common motive.

941
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:37,700
And that motive is best developed by recognizing the common enemy.

942
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:40,520
And that common enemy is the...

943
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:41,760
...the one.

944
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,780
I say that common enemy is the...

945
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:44,260
...the one.

946
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:51,020
When you see you and I getting together, it is because we have begun to realize that

947
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:52,200
we have a common enemy.

948
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:58,640
And the only time we'll be able to come together with a common objective and a common goal

949
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,700
is when we first develop a common motive.

950
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:06,600
And that motive is best developed by recognizing the common enemy.

951
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,460
And that common enemy is the...

952
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:09,680
...the one.

953
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,740
I say that common enemy is the...

954
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:12,960
...the one.

955
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:16,340
This crowd is wild!

956
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,840
If you join, I'll let you sank my bottoms.

957
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:25,380
We're waiting for this humble place against the forces of...

958
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:26,240
...insert.

959
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:28,260
We don't want to be...
