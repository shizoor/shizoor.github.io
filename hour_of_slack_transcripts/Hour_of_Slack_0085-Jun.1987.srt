1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,580
It's 9 o'clock, coming up right, ding, right now, KNON 90.9, Dallas, time for the hour of slack.

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:17,820
Oh, yes, dear friends, it's time to open your heart, close your mind, unzip your lips, and bend over,

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,020
because you're about to receive the word of Bob.

4
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,660
And pull out that wallet, friends, because it is pledge drive time.

5
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,180
Praise Bob.

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,560
Bob, it's either the last pledge drive for a while or the last hour of slack.

7
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,240
This could be your last chance, folks.

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,880
823-749-0828-9500.

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,720
But the first song has nothing to do with money.

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,260
Beware you men, where'er you go, the cherry tree must stand.

11
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:54,320
The glory of your fatherhood is threatened near at hand.

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:02,100
The maiden who is smiling so is one to all your seed.

13
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,880
And never was a maiden born to never know your need.

14
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,860
She'll wink her thoughts and let you know the lust that's on her mind.

15
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:24,300
And use the devil's thrust to show you what you need.

16
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,900
Dream to find.

17
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,340
Save your flower for tomorrow.

18
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:41,960
You never know what's apt to go through a tender maiden's head.

19
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,600
So save your flower for tomorrow.

20
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,640
Many men have felt the ruin.

21
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,420
Of the harlot's bed.

22
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:04,500
As you can see, so few like me remain unspoiled and pure.

23
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:09,240
By virtue's fact, I am intact.

24
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,240
Unsoiled by passion's lure.

25
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:19,840
So when temptation calls to you, you must remember well.

26
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,880
Adultery is the devil.

27
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,940
And the devil's tool for bringing you to hell.

28
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:36,080
When in the end desire's road has led you to its fork.

29
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:43,680
It won't be hard if you're on guard and always salt your pork.

30
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,460
Save your flower for tomorrow.

31
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,300
You never know what's apt to go through a tender maiden's head.

32
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:54,300


33
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:54,300


34
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:04,200
So save your flower for tomorrow.

35
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,040
Save your flower for tomorrow.

36
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,680
Save your flower for tomorrow.

37
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,100
Save your flower for tomorrow.

38
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,280
A candy-colored clown they call the Sandman.

39
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,820
Tiptoes to my room every night.

40
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,360
Every night.

41
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,620
Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper.

42
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,360
To whisper, dear friend.

43
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,980
Everything is just fine.

44
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,020
It's just fine.

45
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,920
I close my eyes.

46
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,340
Close your eyes.

47
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,680
Then I drift away.

48
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,320
Just drift away.

49
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,580
Don't even think about calling.

50
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,480
Into the magic night.

51
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,460
The magic night.

52
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,640
I softly say.

53
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,560
I say to call.

54
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,980
823-7490.

55
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,100
A silent prayer.

56
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:51,980
A prayer.

57
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,480
And you'd better pray.

58
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,500
Like dreamers do.

59
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,880
Dreamers.

60
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:04,460
Then I fall asleep to dream my dreams of you.

61
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,120
Yes, my dreams of you.

62
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,520
Oh.

63
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,140
Oh.

64
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,060
Oh.

65
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,100
Oh.

66
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:13,700
Oh.

67
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,220
Oh.

68
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:14,220

00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:14,220


70
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:14,520
Oh.

71
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:14,680
Oh.

72
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:14,740
Oh.

73
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:14,740


74
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,240
Oh.

75
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,240


76
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,240


77
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,460
Oh.

78
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,500
Oh.

79
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,960
Oh.

80
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:32,960


81
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:32,980
Oh.

82
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:32,980


83
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:32,980

00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,020


86
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,540
Ah, I meet my love and I

00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,920

Just another one thing.

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,020

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,460
Sweet Pooh I have done one hour break from film tree you have

97
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,020
to convince you how badly we and the station need your support.

98
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,380
We have a special, special form of slack in store tonight.

99
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,000
Instead of us giving you slack for once,

100
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,400
you're going to finally give some back to us.

101
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,200
Of course, some of you have been doing so all along.

102
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,400
Praise Bob.

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,920
But for the rest of you, oh, this could be the moment of truth,

104
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,500
the moment at hand.

105
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,620
And once again, that's 823-7490 or 828-9500.

106
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,300
Talk to the Will of Dobbs.

107
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,380
And just to prove to you how badly we need it,

108
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,540
we need your support.

109
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,880
For the first time, we're asking you what you think.

110
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,080
And for any pledge amount, any single pledge amount, friends,

111
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,380
you'll get the Hour of Slack questionnaire,

112
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,840
a document which you will fill out and mail back to us

113
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,100
saying just what you like.

114
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,400
And just what you hate about this show.

115
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,280
A $20 to $24 pledge gets you the bumper sticker,

116
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,700
the KNON bumper sticker and the program guide.

117
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,060
From $20 to $29, you get a cool KNON button,

118
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,880
a shirt button, as well as those aforementioned things,

119
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,560
and, dear friends, a subgenius button, a button-a-bob.

120
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,040
And from $30 to $40, you get all of that, all of that,

121
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,700
plus a T-shirt, a KNON.

122
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:19,920
It's a KNON T-shirt.

123
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,600
It's a ghost shirt, dear friends,

124
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,380
so imbued with the power of pure goodness

125
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,420
that it will repel bullets fired at you by the bad guys.

126
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,480
Here are those bullets going by.

127
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,980
If you were wearing a shirt right now, a KNON shirt,

128
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,300
they wouldn't be hurting you like they are.

129
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,180
And from $40 to $50, $40 to $49, let's say,

130
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,940
gets you all of the above, plus one live music tape.

131
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,840
Oh, see, there was somebody who didn't pledge, friends,

132
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,660
screaming in the background.

133
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,660
So a live music tape for, hey, you know what I'm saying?

134
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,460
Wait a minute.

135
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,980
Oh, that's a conspiracy trying to cut in on us, friends.

136
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,880
828-9500 or 823-7490.

137
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,700
And pledge that $50, and you'll get one of the, up to $49.

138
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,460
You get one of the music tapes recorded during KNON's live music week,

139
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,180
and you must tell us your choice.

140
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,420
Okay.

141
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,600
Of a selection of six categories.

142
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,280
Rock, country, gospel, soul, folk, blues, whore, miscellaneous.

143
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,740
And that's what you're hearing now is the miscellaneous portion of KNON's programming.

144
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,460
This is KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

145
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:43,860
And if you can pledge, if you can dig down deep and get that $50 to $59,

146
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,300
you get all of the above, plus two live music tapes, plus a subgenius.

147
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,840
T-shirt from the Weeping Cyclops Company, and subgenius pamphlets.

148
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,480
You'll get just about everything, friends.

149
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,520
And any amount over $100, you do get everything.

150
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,080
Everything.

151
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:05,400
Plus a pristine and untainted copy of the Book of the Subgenius,

152
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,560
the second edition, newly printed by Simon & Schuster.

153
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,280
But we'll send that when you send the money, okay?

154
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:16,100
Just call 823-7490 or 828-9500.

155
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,540
Mail that money in now if you want.

156
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,400
That's KNON.

157
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:24,860
And box 710909, Dallas 75371.

158
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,180
And I'll be reading that number some more.

159
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,140
We'll take Visa.

160
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,080
We'll take MasterCard.

161
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,000
We'll take American Express.

162
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,180
We'll take bank drafts, by which monthly payments are automatically withdrawn from your bank account.

163
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,560
You can call in tonight, set it up.

164
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,800
You'll never have to think again.

165
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,800
And, of course, a check or money order is always so much fun.

166
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,040
Come, a-be-gibs-a-golly-gosh-in.

167
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,300

On full-throttle potentate.

Elsewise, your wants will be wagging down on mammy's hind nanny.

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,400
Why can't your peeser pop a squeezer when the gushers are going all normal-like?

Got your no geyser sense in your sneezing chamber, boy?

Quit spritzin' your plizzerer lessen its snowing white lute-juice, baby.

179
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,980
Elsewise, your pleatin' bleeder's blowin' hot water.

180
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,440
You go blind or please your neither, tryin' not to.

181
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:45,880
Either way, you're gettin' up on the wrong orbit for this kind of free-kneedin' bleedin' side-trade, eh?

182
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,380
Well, why don't you go stand there like your damn-e-nice-o-a-bunny-faggot, and get a good rest of your day.

183
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:49,380


184
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,300
You a nickel slug, or you gonna plus your plimper and righteous hargany, P-boy?

185
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,200
Got weenie ribbers and flute or twos, don't you?

186
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:05,800
Join gumption's with the true and the seed brave, and pee for Bob, man, and send your jeans.

187
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:13,480
Buy out the gland owners with what you earned with your skinny peelin' face of pain.

188
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,520
This has been your enunciator.

189
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,640
Thank me.

190
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,500
Amen.

191
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,740
Wee-wee-wee-wee.

192
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,520
Okay.

193
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:29,180
Now, we're gonna sing some suck KNON songs.

194
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:35,200
Bob days, the Bob days in KNON.

195
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,380
The Bob days in KNON.

196
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,420
The Bob days in KNON.

197
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,480
The Bob days in KNON.

198
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,720
The Bob days in KNON.

199
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:50,940
Today.

200
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,140
Today.

201
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:52,720
Today.

202
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,980
Bob, Bob, Bob.

203
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,400
Bob-ous-Bob-ous-Bob-ous-Bob!

204
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,820
Bob-ous-Bob-ous...

205
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,940
Bob-ous-Bob-ous...

206
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,680
Bob-ous...

207
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,020
Bob-ous, Bob-ous.

208
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,240
Bob, Bob, Bob's...

209
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,040
I must not fear.

210
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:09,980
Fear is the mind-killer.

211
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,700
Fear is the little death, which brings me.

212
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,120
Pom, pom, pom, bob!

213
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,780
Mis amigos queridos.

214
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,700
Who do you love?

215
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,580
Bob!

216
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,140
Knossio City, Bob Dobbs.

217
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,740
It's a Bob world after all.

218
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,820
It's a Bob world after all.

219
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,540
It's a Bob world after all.

220
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,040
It's a Bob.

221
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,680
K-N-O-N.

222
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,240
This is the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

223
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,060
Daddy.

224
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,340
I get to listen to K-N-O-N again.

225
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,460
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart.

226
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
Nobody sent in that pledge money.

227
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:11,920
I'm afraid we may never get to hear K-N-O-N anymore after this.

228
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,560
You mean they didn't give the money,

229
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,180
but they promised?

230
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,440
I mean, they haven't sent any money to help the station?

231
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,560
Isn't that just like stealing?

232
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,400
Well, that number to call is 823-7490.

233
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,640
I want to see more calls.

234
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,620
823-7490.

235
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,720
I mean, is this going to...

236
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,660
Do I have to act like Dr. Gene Scott?

237
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:45,540
The hour of slack radio ministry is your vehicle to get you to the land of slack.

238
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,500
You, my friend, must buy the next tank of gas.

239
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:49,600
Why?

240
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,540
Because we're under so much pressure from the false churches.

241
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,620
But you can help us change that.

242
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,400
Send in those pledges.

243
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,200
Now, unlike other ministries, we do not use guilt as a weapon.

244
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,060
We let you use your own guilt against yourself.

245
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,780
And that's the thing.

246
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,720
I mean, with K-N-O-N, see, this isn't money.

247
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:18,780
You're not necessarily sending this money for the religion of Bob Dobbs.

248
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,660
The religion of slack and destruction of the conspiracy.

249
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,380
No, it's for the totality that's K-N-O-N.

250
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,560
It's not just for us.

251
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,140
It's for your very mind.

252
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,360
Your very soul, my friend.

253
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:39,040
You wouldn't believe how close your soul is to being sold out between your job and the drugs and the lies.

254
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,720
You need every bit of slack you can hang on to, friends.

255
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,280
And on this station, like, you've got all kinds of choices.

256
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,000
You've got lots of stuff you can hate.

257
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:48,760
And you've got...

258
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,880
You've got even more you can love.

259
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,720
The black shows are blacker.

260
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,200
The Mexican shows are more Mexican.

261
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,960
And therefore, they're better.

262
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,540
Even if you aren't black or Mexican, you need these shows.

263
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,560
If you want to have any ideas to what's happening.

264
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,360
So, especially if you want to have any hope in knowing what's happening 20 years from now.

265
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,700
When this planet isn't all pink and Anglo.

266
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,020
No siree.

267
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,160
And it ain't gonna be all one religion, neither.

268
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,900
Unless that's Bob's religion.

269
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,620
Which is the one religion where you can believe anything you want to believe.

270
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,100
You can even hate Bob.

271
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,300
So for all I know, maybe these...

272
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,560
Oh, yes.

273
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,540
Oh, we've got...

274
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,140
This is one of the callers that wanted to meet Reverend Stang at a cheap motel.

275
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,540
That comes with a $200 pledge.

276
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:35,660
Yeah.

277
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,460
Oh, baby.

278
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,760
And friends.

279
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:47,880
We're live.

280
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:47,880


281
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:47,880


282
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:47,880


283
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:47,880


284
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,920
We're looking for those pledges.

285
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,340
I want you to clear those lines.

286
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,140
I want to get rid of those $1 pledges.

287
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,640
I don't want to hear about no $1, $3, $4 pledges.

288
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,880
Call that number you see on your screen.

289
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,840
That's 823-7490 for those of you who cannot read.

290
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:09,240
I only want to accept calls from pledges with a minimum of $10,000.

291
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,440
Or at least $5.

292
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,840
$5, friends.

293
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,140
You may think, oh, $5.

294
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,140
That's too much.

295
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,920
For three months' worth of the hour of slack.

296
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,540
But if you don't pledge that money tonight, friends,

297
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:28,600
there may come a day when you'll lie in a concentration camp bitterly hating your own self.

298
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,900
Because you knew.

299
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:36,320
You knew so well that there was a time when you could have prevented the takeover by the conspiracy.

300
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,040
But I know that you're going to send that $20 to the hour of slack.

301
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,380
You're going to call in that pledge.

302
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,120
823-7490.

303
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,400
828-9500.

304
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:55,240
Because, you know, giving to this modest, unsyndicated radio show is the equivalent, dear friends,

305
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:00,860
to helping the first pre-humans, the Primo Anthropocus, to discover fire or the wheel.

306
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:08,520
That pathetic donation just might be the crucial last red cent that allows survival and slack

307
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,420
and prevents spaceship Earth from crash landing.

308
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,940
It's a vote against racism.

309
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,280
But for the master race, dear friends, which comes in all colors

310
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:24,120
and which lives somehow amongst the humans without the humans ever guessing our existence.

311
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,280
A vote against sexism, friends, but for sexism.

312
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:36,020
And against the mindless, mindless materialism of today's world,

313
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:40,140
but for slackful materialism and mindless fun.

314
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,200
Yes, indeed.

315
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,620
You can help in this battle against communism and monopoly capitalism,

316
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,340
but for small business and the beleaguered American farmer?

317
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,140
It's against the establishment, friends, but for the black market.

318
00:16:54,300 --> 00:17:02,040
Not repairs by the dealership, nay nay, but repairs by independent fix-it men working out of their own homes.

319
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:03,920
Bye.

320
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,140
No, don't go away.

321
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,180
Don't leave us.

322
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,460
No.

323
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,680
We need your help.

324
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,160
We need your help.

325
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,120
We need your help.

326
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,480
But you know, if you know somebody who thinks that Old Church of the Subgenius is already too famous

327
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,420
and therefore no longer deserving of charity,

328
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,980
well then that, my friend, is a person who's either ignorant or else stupid enough to believe anything.

329
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:37,660
A born duke, a slave to every superstition that the rest of the media wants them to believe.

330
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,840
Call 823-7490 or 828-9500.

331
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:47,500
Because there has never been one mention of subgenius in any major TV network.

332
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:52,320
There's been a total of ten minutes of subgenius mentioned on cable, not one major magazine article.

333
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,540
We have one book out that's hard to find, friends, and a few pamphlets that no stores sell.

334
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:04,640
Radio shows we have, indeed, but they defy you listeners yourselves to remain unoffended.

335
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,820
And of course our main targets are the hip punk artists.

336
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:10,820


337
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:15,140
We have a huge audience that would actually be our only chance of commercial success.

338
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,760
And here we are alienating even them.

339
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,000
So friends, we need that money. The station needs it.

340
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:26,960
We've been good at hoaxing stupid media buffoons into thinking this was a runaway pet rock style success.

341
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,880
But we laugh at you when you fall for that.

342
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,700
And we cry, too, because it reminds us that there are people even dumber than us.

343
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,160
And yet they're still alive.

344
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,300
And that's sad, friends.

345
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,800
But it's proof that high grades and incomes are no good.

346
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,100
No indication of intelligence.

347
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:51,800
But, I mean, but a high pledge amount for the hour of slack, that's bound to be something that we're going to use, friends.

348
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,900
Not just us, but the whole station.

349
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,500
It is a vote, dear friends, a vote against stereotypes of any kind.

350
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,960
And a vote for the unexpected.

351
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,740
A vote for the unexpected.

352
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,920
Because the unexpected isn't always bad.

353
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,240
Well, maybe that time it was.

354
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,920
But, you know, you can expect bad things.

355
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,400
It's the good news that are usually a big surprise.

356
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,320
Anything really great is always unexpected.

357
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,700
And that's what you get with K-N-O-N.

358
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,520
Your pledge is a vote, friends, a vote for Bob.

359
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:34,720
A vote for the kind of afterlife that you've always wished, you've always prayed might be real.

360
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,800
And here's a recording right here in front of me of JRBob.com.

361
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,920
Bob's a young man bringing another young man back to life.

362
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,400
And he can do this for you.

363
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,000
Oral Roberts isn't the only one, dear friends.

364
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,060
So listen, but don't listen to this.

365
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,340
Call that pledge in.

366
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,360
I mean, we need to get back up to number one.

367
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,180
This is serious.

368
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:01,880
We've been put down by three other shows ahead of us.

369
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,800
And it looks like George Mark is doing real good, too.

370
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,240
So subgeniuses out there, we need that vote.

371
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,560
The station needs that vote.

372
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:17,340
And here is, as I said, JR Bob Dobbs bringing all of us back to life.

373
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,820
If you feel, you heal.

374
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,440
I was swimming with millions of babies in a rainbow.

375
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,320
And they was naked.

376
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,780
And then all of a sudden, I turned into a perfect smile.

377
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,180
I'm sorry I brought you back, but I need your help.

378
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,520
Who are you?

379
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,800
I'm sorry I brought you back, but I need your help.

380
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,400
I'm on my way to Jerusalem to be an actor-singer.

381
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,240
It is written that the agent Morris awaits me.

382
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,340
Who am I?

383
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,060
Listen, crawl again.

384
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,580
This is blasphemy.

385
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,420
Blasphemy.

386
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,440
Crawl again.

387
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,780
Give to us something to live for.

388
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:14,940
Anything.

389
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,580
We need hope now, love.

390
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,220
Put a rope on this son of a bitch.

391
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,220
One moment, please.

392
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,440
I bring you a message.

393
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,420
Exactly six miles north of Skag Mountain in the Valley of Pain,

394
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,220
there lives an evil devil monster.

395
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,420
His name is Bingo Gas Station Motel Cheeseburger with a side of aircraft noise,

396
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,820
and you'll be Gary, Indiana.

397
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,620
And he loves to hurt people.

398
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,720
The last time I saw Bingo Gas Station Motel Cheeseburger with a side of aircraft noise,

399
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,000
and you'll be Gary, Indiana,

400
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,620
he told me what he wants to do.

401
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,480
He wants to come down here and kill each and every one of you.

402
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,920
But I said to him, Bingo, wait a minute.

403
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,520
And the reason I said that is because I believe in you people.

404
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,980
I believe you can do the job.

405
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,940
I believe you can help each other.

406
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,100
I believe you can make this world a better place to live in.

407
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,480
That's it.

408
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,820
Never mind.

409
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,420
This is how you say bingo.

410
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,460
Just tell us whether there is a life after death or not.

411
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,500
Is he the one?

412
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,540
He's got to be the one.

413
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,980
Who else could it be?

414
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,880
I'm very disappointed.

415
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,220
I'm going to be the one.

416
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:05,220


417
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,600
Oh, now you 15-year-old kids out there,

418
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:13,780
I'm talking to you specifically, not 15, just teenagers in general.

419
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:20,700
You all like the weird rock and roll stuff that George plays on the show before this one.

420
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:27,720
Now, you see, what I need to break into,

421
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,600
this is kind of an ugly fact,

422
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:35,200
But for many people that kind of rock and roll is the step that leads you into

423
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,580
drug abuse and worse things.

424
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,880
Subgenius friends,

425
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:47,100
the Church of the Subgenius is the next step of evolution after that. The step

426
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,560
beyond the drugs. In fact, we're

427
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:58,740
probably, in fact, we know for sure that we are the next to the last step

428
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:06,420
and you better watch out for that very last step friends because it is a doozy. So call 823-7490

429
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:14,640
or 828-9500 and stay with the church because it's our duty to hold and maintain the human race

430
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:22,360
to achieve the subgenius state and not go beyond that, not go to that next step for that way

431
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,400
my friend, that way lies madness,

432
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,260
madness and poverty. The poverty for instance

433
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:28,720
that would have made you a Christian,

434
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,700
that would afflict this station and put us off the air. Not just us but everybody else on this station.

435
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:40,000
If you don't call in that pledge and like I said for the oh, let me see where's my notes here.

436
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:46,100
What what you're gonna get for that pledge when you call 823-7490 or 828-9500

437
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,000
you

438
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,440
you get you that

439
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:57,060
Oh, just the up to 24 bucks will get you that bumper sticker on the program guide and the hour of slack questionnaire

440
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,700
which you need to do that.

441
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,080
Tell us how much you hate us.

442
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:07,560
A lot of people hate us. We want to know exactly where and why so that we can come get them.

443
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,940
The other

444
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:15,380
up to 29 bucks and you get the cool KNON button and the subgenius button up to $39.

445
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,520
You get that and the t-shirt and the KNO that

446
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,240
Yeah, that's the KNON ghost shirt friend.

447
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:27,580
40 to $49 gets you one live music tape recorded during KNON's live music week of the

448
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,560
genre.

449
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,040
of your choice and

450
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:39,400
50 and up gets you all of those things plus two more live music tapes and a subgenius t-shirt from the Weeping

451
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,040
Cyclops insignia company and

452
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,520
but

453
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,980
You're gonna need it you're gonna need every bit of that friends come the come the end times

454
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,200
Kids you kids out there

455
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,420
Children you may wonder why

456
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,040
You look down here in wide shot

457
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:08,360
Why I have all these rat traps and mouse traps of different sizes and makes on the table in front of me here these traps

458
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:17,520
Friends represent the lies that will be told to you by the conspiracy radio stations and by any other rival cult besides subgenius

459
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:24,660
These lies are like Satan's traps now watch what happens when I put this innocent little pink mouse

460
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,360
amongst these traps

461
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,560
Now, here he goes. He's sniffing at that first bit of cheese he sees.

462
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,540
He's going for it.

463
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:35,520
Oh, should look twice there, little mousey.

464
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,880
Look at that, friends. That little mouse snapped clean in half.

465
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:44,760
Now, that was a pink mouse, but it could just as well have been an unsuspecting subgenius mouse.

466
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,640
Do you want Satan's jaws to snap you in half?

467
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:55,360
What's gonna happen to you, little kiddies, if you go on believing the lies of anybody else besides Bob Dodson?

468
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,240
Your subgenius moms and dads and neighborhood pastors.

469
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:04,180
And if we don't raise the money in that pledge drive, that's all you're gonna hear, pal.

470
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,480
Kids, lies, lies, lies.

471
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,920
We've gotta reach those kids out there, friends.

472
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,120
You grownups listening, we've gotta reach the kids that are unsafe.

473
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,060
Look at your screens. You're seeing the film there of the trucks carrying the food and the clothing.

474
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,100
This stuff costs so much money.

475
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:25,540
It's not worth it.

476
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,220
To reach the entire planet of people begging for slack.

477
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:32,600
Now, there's 500 million people watching this program,

478
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,840
because we go to areas where there's nothing else on TV, where they have to watch us.

479
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,120
Can't see us in Dallas.

480
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:43,420
But our costs have gone up 30%, and yet our income remains the same.

481
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,720
We can't raise money.

482
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:50,860
If we can't raise the money that you pledge right now by calling 823-7490, we're gonna lose Nigeria.

483
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,260
We're gonna lose Western Australia.

484
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,540
We're gonna lose part of South Africa.

485
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,980
South Africa, friends, we're 7 million bucks in debt.

486
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,800
And, uh, oh, nowadays, oh, you gotta die to raise money.

487
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,820
You gotta die.

488
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,520
And then some dog track owner comes along and bails you out.

489
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,280
As long as you're not a subgenius.

490
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,160
See, the problem with the believers is they think we're loaded already.

491
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,020
And we are, but we don't have any money!

492
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:23,140
How can we spread the manure of Bob across the yards of America without capital?

493
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,020
We have, friends.

494
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,400
We have the world-smashing formula.

495
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:32,040
But we don't have that extra penny that would allow us to go down to the hardware store

496
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,660
and buy that last piece we need for the time control machine.

497
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:42,340
Friends, I actually had to die last time for $7,500.

498
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,400
That's all.

499
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,920
And we're ministering to people, friends, and not just me.

500
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:52,800
Subgeniuses all over the country, they're everywhere reaching out,

501
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,100
trying to draw the seekers in.

502
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:01,900
Those who can comprehend just what their slack is worth.

503
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,860
What's it worth to you?

504
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,740
Sister, brother, out there?

505
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:11,500
I mean, the people, the people need the word Bob.

506
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:17,840
But they are, oh, so few, so few are ready to put their beliefs on the line.

507
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,540
The line where you sign your name on that check.

508
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,200
Won't you join us, friends?

509
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,480
In this outreach?

510
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:29,760
Won't you try by calling 823-7490 or 828-9500?

511
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:37,020
This could be, this could be your, your, the one vote that really counted.

512
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,600
There is no more money.

513
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,280
We gotta get some money.

514
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,080
That dirty, perky, shark-backed flat.

515
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,400
We're talking about the

516
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,760
Ah, yeah, the harvest.

517
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,860
This is the way they did it in the New Testament.

518
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,400
God scolded his people in the Old Testament.

519
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,260
But you're laughing.

520
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,840
Oh, yeah, you're laughing, saying, oh, I don't care.

521
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:11,580
I don't care if radioactive rain destroys all the fish and fauna and pollutes the water

522
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,940
from me not supporting this station.

523
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:24,240
Oh, I don't care if our, if firestorms kill all dormant seeds on earth, making regeneration of plant life possible.

524
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:29,080
Oh, I don't, I'd just as soon get K-N-O-N for free.

525
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:38,040
I don't have a spare $10, because I'm gonna spend it on cigarettes and liquor and, and false slack.

526
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:38,900
Oh, yeah.

527
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:51,940
I don't care if vast quantities of nitrogen oxide dramatically increase ultraviolet radiation to the point where humans and animals are blind and we can't even hear the hour of slack with our eyes.

528
00:30:52,480 --> 00:31:08,820
Oh, just compromise your immune system by not sending, not pledging a penny, or even worse, by pretending to be a subgenius and pledging but never even actually sending the check.

529
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:14,640
Huh? Sick. Sick creatures out there, they don't even care.

530
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,160
I don't care.

531
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:15,420


532
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,900
Our team's status, luck, prosperity, by blowing them off.

533
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,800
But don't blow off that pledge drive, friends.

534
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:34,260
Bob's promises to low heat the nature of abnormal behavior to explore new ways of going over the edge and coming right back.

535
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,540
And, friends, some of them have been coming through.

536
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,160
They are coming through.

537
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,860
The Will of Dobbs is right here, live on mic,

538
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,020
to read to you the names of people who have pledged.

539
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,820
And they are...

540
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,980
Reverend Stang, we've got Paul Keyes,

541
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,060
Selena Garcia, Ed Casey again,

542
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,260
Ben Toon, Joe Edwards,

543
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,600
Gary Waller, we've got Chris Smith,

544
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,880
John Harvey, Mike Morris,

545
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,860
blessed, blessed,

546
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,460
Reverend Zafod, Ben Swallow,

547
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,960
I guess that's really his name,

548
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,200
A.K. Austin, David Aguilera,

549
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,560
Bob Murphy, and most especially,

550
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,540
Caprice Capri and Melanie James in Fort Worth.

551
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,840
You'll be hearing from me later.

552
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,500
That's it.

553
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,180
All right, friends, it's a squirt universe.

554
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,040
There's hope, there's hope,

555
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,060
but we ain't nowhere near where we need to be.

556
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,600
Nay, nay, nay.

557
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,780
Things are...

558
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:25,700
It's a tough, stinky world out there, you know,

559
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,720
for the average subgenius.

560
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,180
I mean, there's some rich ones

561
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:35,060
and some who truly understand their slack.

562
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,180
But, I mean, at the same time,

563
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:39,840
we've got these...

564
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,980
It's so sickening and so ironic.

565
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,200
By the way, call 823-749-0 or 828-9500 now.

566
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,460
Do so now.

567
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,580
Girls, Dr. Zafod is here.

568
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,540
I mean, this is your big chance.

569
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,600
This could be your big date.

570
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,900
I mean, it is so ironic

571
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:01,060
because some of these false preachers

572
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,740
can raise millions and millions of dollars.

573
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,740
No problem there.

574
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,780
Well, I tell you what,

575
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,480
I challenge you, Jim Swaggart.

576
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,660
I challenge you, Jim Baker.

577
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,800
I challenge you, Oral Roberts.

578
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,560
You see this hand here?

579
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,960
You see this hand in front of me, Mr. Jim Baker?

580
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,860
This is called the claw,

581
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,380
and it's got the power of dogs in it,

582
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,580
and the power of Bob.

583
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,780
And I challenge you to show your ugly face

584
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,260
here at this radio station and come forward.

585
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,320
Go ahead, come forward with all your millions.

586
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,920
I'm ready to have a match without rules.

587
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,300
No rules at all.

588
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,840
One will survive.

589
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:38,760
One only.

590
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,260
One minister will leave the match still breathing

591
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:45,200
if one of you goody-goody preachers

592
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,080
has the guts to show up.

593
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,740
Oh, yes.

594
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,700
I'm sitting here drinking some Texas Select beer, friends.

595
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,140
Beer!

596
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,160
You hear that, Jimmy Swaggart?

597
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,660
You don't drink beer, oh no, or smoke on prop

598
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,720
because you don't know the power of these herbs.

599
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,420
I challenge any minister do-gooder out there

600
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,060
to show up.

601
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,760
All of you, with all your TV shows

602
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,120
and all your bought-off politicians,

603
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,640
your paid-off judges,

604
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,980
do any trick you want, but I got the claw,

605
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,240
I got the power of Bob,

606
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,040
and the power of Texas Select.

607
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,100
And you, my friend listener,

608
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,200
has the power to call 823-7490

609
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,420
or 828-9500.

610
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,900
Do it, do it, do it.

611
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:34,400
The times, the end times get closer and closer.

612
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,120
Every minute.

613
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,280
Imagine some guy or some gal driving around out there.

614
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,120
They're tired of listening to the same old music

615
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,400
on their conspiracy radio show,

616
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,200
so they try switching channels,

617
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,780
and they come upon this.

618
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,080
They hear these voices talking,

619
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,760
and they think, now what is this, a talk show?

620
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,540
A church show? A comedy?

621
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,020
I mean, oh my God, are these people serious?

622
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,140
It's too developed to be a joke.

623
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,480
Should I kill them, or should I pay them?

624
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,400
Which one?

625
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,340
Will it be, friend?

626
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,800
Which will it be?

627
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,820
Kill us or pay us?

628
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,540
Either way, call 823-7490

629
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,760
or 828-9500.

630
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,560
Willa Dobbs is here.

631
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,280
The Pope S. Cecilia is here.

632
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,820
Now, boys, you want to talk to the Pope S. Cecilia.

633
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,760
Reverend Shaman is here,

634
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,300
and even someone else.

635
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:27,540
And, friends, I want to see that money coming in.

636
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,880
We are not doing that well.

637
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,680
I'm not kidding.

638
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,800
I mean, if I was kidding,

639
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,660
I would have relaxed by now.

640
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,360
You know what I mean?

641
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,060
So, this is...

642
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,240
It's...

643
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,740
There's some have-nots out there, I know.

644
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,960
By definition, many subgeniuses are have-nots in money,

645
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,400
but they do have slack,

646
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,300
and at least they know what they're missing.

647
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,900
So, you've done okay by not having money, haven't you?

648
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,280
And so, therefore, it won't hurt you a bit.

649
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,960
It won't hurt you to have a bit less.

650
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,600
And the money doesn't go to me.

651
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,300
It doesn't even go to the Willa Dobbs.

652
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,600
It doesn't even go to someone else.

653
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,500
Your membership money does, though.

654
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,340
It goes to keep K-N-O-N.

655
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,120
K-N-O-N on the air!

656
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,040
Without K-N-O-N, you won't get the hour of slack free.

657
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,860
You'll be like everybody else out there,

658
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,840
everywhere but New Jersey and Boston.

659
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,220
The only way to get these tapes is five-buck cassette.

660
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,500
Friends, pay them dues!

661
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,820
828-9500 or 823-7490.

662
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,340
Now, friends, I'm...

663
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,460
The person you're hearing talking here, I'm Reverend Stang.

664
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,780
Now, you may say, this man doesn't sound religious.

665
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,460
What kind of a pope or preacher

666
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,200
swears and then drinks on camera

667
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,820
while he's asking for pledges?

668
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,260
I'll tell you what, kind friends,

669
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,380
a sub-genius preacher does.

670
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,180
And I want $10,000.

671
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:03,320
I want $10,000.

672
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:03,320


673
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,000
I want $10,000 pledges.

674
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,700
We are not fooling around here.

675
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,940
Uh, I mean, this, this, the transmitter,

676
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,160
these tape decks, these tapes,

677
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,700
these people, these things cost.

678
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,100
And so don't call in with these little teeny-weeny pledges.

679
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,060
Now, that $10,000 that we've got so far,

680
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,500
we know how to spend it.

681
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,440
We'll spend it on fancy clothes

682
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,160
and air-conditioned dog houses.

683
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,300
You don't want to see your preacher,

684
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,460
Reverend Ivan Stang,

685
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,460
preaching in tennis shoes, do you?

686
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,320
You want to see me in a snake-skin suit?

687
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,460
Because you don't want a stupid preacher.

688
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,200
You don't want a preacher that,

689
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,940
that doesn't, uh, abuse your money.

690
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,520
You want one who abuses it,

691
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,760
is smart enough to abuse it,

692
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,240
but honest enough to tell you.

693
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,940
And I need that air-conditioned dog house, my friends,

694
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,120
because my own house isn't air-conditioned.

695
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,580
Uh, I mean, I'd set up my office in that dog house.

696
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,800
The hour of slack original tapes

697
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,140
wouldn't melt in the heat anymore.

698
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,160
And I, and I'd still share that dog house

699
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,200
with my dog friends.

700
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,740
That's the difference between a subgenius preacher

701
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,040
and, uh, uh, one of these, uh, more famous-like preachers.

702
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,460
So I want you to get on there and call that 823-7490.

703
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,400
Call that 828-9500.

704
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,420
This is more serious than you could imagine

705
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,700
in your wildest dreams.

706
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,320
And, uh, well, looky here.

707
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:26,040
I mean, we've got, uh, I've got a,

708
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,240
I've got the inner secret of the subgenius church

709
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,340
ready to tell you, friends.

710
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,960
But we've got to get 50,000 more before I can do that.

711
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,060
The calls are beginning to come in.

712
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,220
But you, and the children's home in Manila

713
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,320
is gonna go, the children's, uh,

714
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,200
the, the home for slackless children,

715
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,720
that thing's gonna go down unless we have your money.

716
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,440
So you have been challenged.

717
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,280
You've got to meet this pledge.

718
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,720
And I know that you will, because miracles are happening

719
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,900
all over Dallas, friends.

720
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,300
Miracles are happening.

721
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,720
I mean, here's one miracle.

722
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,460
90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

723
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,560
That's a miracle, ain't it?

724
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:01,080
And an even bigger miracle is when you look at those,

725
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:01,940
those letters.

726
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,260
90.9.

727
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,500
Write those down.

728
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,260
Write them down on a piece of paper.

729
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,480
90.9 FM.

730
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,340
Now, flip that piece of paper over.

731
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,140
What do those letters now appear to say upside down?

732
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,940
They say a little b, a big O, and a little b.

733
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,360
Bob! Bob!

734
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,140
And if you'll believe that, you'll believe anything.

735
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,940
And that's what we want you to do.

736
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,320
We want you to believe the Bible.

737
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,000
We want you to believe Marvel Comics.

738
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,780
We want you to believe Pee Wee Herman.

739
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,720
Cheatness, friends. Cheatness counts.

740
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,060
It's the, it's, it's the only hope for us.

741
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,720
For many of us.

742
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,980
And this footage you're seeing from Slack-filled celebration shows the drawing power that Bob

743
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,560
can have.

744
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:43,180
Now, we've got, we've got to get that Slack TV network on 24 hours a day, seven days a

745
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:43,380
week.

746
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:48,020
It's going to be all violence and sex, dear friends, except when we're raising money.

747
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,680
Because, because we love you and we love your children.

748
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:57,320
And we want to take your children and teach them how to fight the good fight and how to

749
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,860
work in our factories and to bring Slack to themselves.

750
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,060
And we want to take your children and teach them how to fight the good fight and how to

751
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,820
bridge the middle.

752
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:16,000
Here's a project from us, Séenth強 ty loss.

753
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,760
Here's a folder with the people in the search function and the fundraisers.

754
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,640
I'll give you the details.

755
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:19,640


756
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,640
We have a new patch now.

757
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,780
We need to make the money, to move on, to focus on what we do.

758
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:31,040
You know what, I could do what you want.

759
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,120
Hallelujah, friends! The headache was gone.

760
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,360
What more proof do you need?

761
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,380
But others call in and they go, what is this?

762
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,180
What is this thing?

763
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,880
What are you trying to prove? Is this supposed to be comedy?

764
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,340
Hell, I heard this whole rant in Chicago.

765
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,500
Pope Florist wrote half of this rant.

766
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,920
But friends, Bob wants, he doesn't just want us to be rich.

767
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,980
He actually wants you to be rich.

768
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,140
But rich without working.

769
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,820
Because this is the church for abnormals.

770
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,560
The church for non-joiners.

771
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,960
So it's hard to get people to join.

772
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,080
It ain't a joke, friends.

773
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,500
Sometimes you're wondering, what is it?

774
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,640
What is this thing?

775
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,220
Well, it ain't collaborative art, no.

776
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,740
It's not subversive either.

777
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,960
And it's not just a bunch of drunk guys.

778
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:18,860
Nay, nay.

779
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,780
You'll pay. You will pay.

780
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,760
And then, friends, then, at that moment,

781
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,980
you will know what you really think.

782
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,660
Uh, uh...

783
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,260
We are getting some calls in, friends.

784
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,860
We are still getting the calls in.

785
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,340
There may be some hope.

786
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,860
There may be some hope.

787
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,940
So, uh, Willa Dobbs, do you want to read some out for us real quick?

788
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,340
They're piling up.

789
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,840
Michael Ward, R.L. Lemke,

790
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,880
Finney Koo, I'm sure I didn't pronounce that right,

791
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,360
Kevin Johnson, James Ogier,

792
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,380
and Mandy Macademia, who is here tonight.

793
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:54,300
Oh, Mandy!

794
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,400
What's that horrible song?

795
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:58,980
That's right.

796
00:41:59,020 --> 00:41:59,640
What a fine...

797
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,680
That's a fine wife you would make.

798
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,240
Really?

799
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:08,080
I was born in Dallas in 1952

800
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:15,700
The Harvey moved across the street on Beckley Avenue

801
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:23,880
He used to throw the ball to me when I was just a kid

802
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:28,000
They say he shot the president

803
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,300
I was born in Dallas in 1952

804
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:29,440
They say he shot the president

805
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:29,640
I was born in Dallas in 1952

806
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,700
I don't think he did

807
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:37,720
And Lee Harvey was a friend of mine

808
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:45,720
He used to take me fishing all the time

809
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:55,440
He used to throw the ball to me when I was just a kid

810
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:59,540
They say he shot the president

811
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,540
And lapel

812
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:01,540


813
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:01,540


814
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:01,540


815
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:01,540


816
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:01,540


817
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:01,540


818
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:01,540


819
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:01,540


820
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:19,520
I don't think they's,州 не acha 지금 гуи в цвет кі он scenario

as first truly religious amusement park.

822
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,300
Not another pilgrim trap.

823
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,440
Not another religious rip-off.

824
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:28,220
Yes, we're located right here in Del Rio, Texas.

825
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,460

Murdered by Jack Ruby

858
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:34,820
The biggest sleaze in town

859
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,660
He stuck that gun into his ribs

860
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,620
And said, here's looking at you, kid

861
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:46,920
Ruby killed Lee Harvey

862
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,740

00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:48,740


871
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:48,740


872
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:48,740


873
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:48,740


874
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:48,740


875
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:48,740


876
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:48,740


877
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:48,740


878
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:48,740


879
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:48,740


880
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,560
V. proved he did

881
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,700
And he thought he was a friend

882
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,880
Oh, yes.

883
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,260
Oh, yes.

884
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,920
I want you to keep calling

885
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,540
823-749-0 or 828-9500.

886
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,020
I don't care if you have already paid your dues.

887
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,100
Some geniuses generally are, in fact,

888
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,020
those who have paid their dues

889
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:14,960
in one way or another.

890
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,080
But one way to be sure

891
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,940
is to pay them in money.

892
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:18,420
Right.

893
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,200
Now, think how much better you'll feel.

894
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:25,560
I mean, uh, you know, it's cheap now.

895
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,160
It's cheap.

896
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,880
But when those aliens arrive in 1998,

897
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,740
it's going to cost your house,

898
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,280
your spouse, your kids, everything.

899
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,500
You do not know and cannot comprehend

900
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,760
just how good you have it now

901
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,380
until it's taken away.

902
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:45,380
And friends, if the United States of America

903
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,480
cannot see the truth of Bob,

904
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,740
it will be bleak.

905
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,500
It will be blinded forever.

906
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:53,380
And if they, uh, if they don't want to keep their sight,

907
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:54,240
well, fine.

908
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,580
Fine with us.

909
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,140
We aren't so forgiving as our Christian brethren.

910
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,680
In this church, the saved ones

911
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,380
are only those who want to save themselves.

912
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:07,100
If Jim Baker was a subgenius,

913
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,680
he wouldn't have had to been paying blackmail money.

914
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,980
He'd be getting paid to tell the story.

915
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,860
And no one here at the Hour of Slack

916
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,540
is getting paid to speak of.

917
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,920
Not for Hour of Slack, not for K-N-O-N.

918
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,720
There's no income whatsoever without you.

919
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,780
You count, friend.

920
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:24,240
You.

921
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,840
You, the individual.

922
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,320
You!

923
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,660
Not all the other geeks out there listening now.

924
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,760
They're all jerks.

925
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:31,920
They're not going to pay anything.

926
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:32,380
But you.

927
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,100
You, my friend.

928
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,580
You're the one I'm talking to.

929
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,980
As Reverend Shimon said,

930
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:42,280
people listen, people who listen to this show

931
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,320
are the ones who never darken a church door.

932
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:48,540
Because we, friends, are talking to them.

933
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,580
We're talking to them where they live.

934
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,820
Now, some things never end.

935
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:54,680
Some never end at all.

936
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,980
One is dirty dishes.

937
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,080
And the other is our need for your money.

938
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,860
Now, Bob doesn't need money.

939
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,240
He needs your trust.

940
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:05,280
But how else can he know you trust him

941
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,000
aside from you sending him money?

942
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:09,260
Other religions would insist that you give away

943
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:12,000
all worldly goods and your kids.

944
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,640
Give away your kids.

945
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:17,940
But Bob knows, friends, that nowadays those things don't matter

946
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:20,200
nearly as much to you as your money.

947
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,620
So I want you to reach down into yourself,

948
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,560
into that sacred organ, that wallet,

949
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:29,000
that place, that thing, that tool

950
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,140
that you wouldn't give to anyone but Bob.

951
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:32,900
And even then, unless you had to,

952
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,860
we'll take cash, credit card numbers,

953
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,920
even blood transfusions, friends.

954
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,120
We'll take blood transfusions as long as they're clean.

955
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:46,020
So, I mean, what kind of an excuse do you have?

956
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,920
828-95-7222.

957
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:50,580
800-823-7490.

958
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,740
Talk to the children of Bob, dear friends.

959
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,960
Talk to them, or else let the curse fall upon ye.

960
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:04,020
I'm not gonna give up until we get some more calls.

961
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,700
The Will of Dobbs is sitting here.

962
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,420
He's about ready to start playing with himself.

963
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,340
Nothing else for him to do.

964
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,940
I want you to call him.

965
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,900
Call the Will of Dobbs at 820.

966
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:13,860
Now we got one.

967
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:14,960
There he's got one, see?

968
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,920
Friends, I'm gonna tell you something.

969
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:17,920


970
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,120
Friends, the false churches out there,

971
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:24,360
they'd like to ban anything like what we're doing right now.

972
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,040
But that just shows how much they have to fear

973
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,660
from people possibly catching on to their little game,

974
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,240
their game of fear.

975
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:33,040
That's how most religions are about, anyway.

976
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,080
Fear, oh, don't eat me up, God.

977
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,560
Oh, Lord, don't sneak up from below and drag me down.

978
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:39,900
Don't kill me, I'm a good boy!

979
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,100
Except when I dressed up like a girl that time.

980
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,100
I'm a good boy!

981
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,560
Aside from that time when I masturbated once.

982
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,900
I used to steal, but, that was a long time ago.

983
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:55,780
ago and it's fear and disgust friends fear and disgust but you can rise above it now our

984
00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:01,500
missionaries out there have been tortured imprisoned they're underfed in foreign countries

985
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:08,660
putting themselves in danger to spread the word above and uh we cannot let this heartache and

986
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:16,100
this misery be in vain your help your help is what can make it all worthwhile now calls are coming in

00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,080
your ancestors crimes from punishment in hell to real life forgiveness and that's why we're here

we're here to help and do the work and the rewards in heaven friends thousands of ancestors of yours

1005
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:15,640
that i've got news for you i i had a skeptic that called me up not long ago he said i'm a skeptic but

1006
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,360
You got me kind of interested in your broadcast.

1007
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:23,380
I began to tell him that I died before I came to age accountability

1008
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,580
and went into heaven in this body.

1009
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:30,380
And then God brought me back after I'd been to heaven,

1010
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:32,780
all the glory and all the music and everything.

1011
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:37,200
And friend, I'm going to tell you, that's the reason I'm preaching today.

1012
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,180
That's the reason I'm going until I can't go.

1013
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,460
Then I'll fall on the bed, but when I get in the pulpit,

1014
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:46,140
I'm going to peel your hide and trim it over your back.

1015
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:49,360
And when you leave my auditorium, you're going to be a shouting,

1016
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:53,000
dancing, walking on devils and casting out devils and healing the sick.

1017
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,280
This is a move of God for everybody.

1018
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:59,820
This week, we're going to have one of the outstanding Baptist ministers.

1019
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:06,500
Reverend Ivan Stang, and you can call 833-7490 or 828-9500

1020
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,080
and get your hide peeled, friend.

1021
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,160
I mean, that's what it's going to take.

1022
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,440
I want it.

1023
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:14,260
I want your hide.

1024
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,280
That's what I want.

1025
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,540
And you can call that hide in.

1026
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:23,040
I've told you what you get with that pledge, but the conspiracy's closing in.

1027
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,400
I've only got 10 more minutes to raise 10 more million dollars.

1028
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,200
And, I mean, it's going to be a tough one.

1029
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,780
It's going to be a tough one, dear friend.

1030
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,120
Mighty tough indeed.

1031
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,300
Say $25,000 worth of peace?

1032
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,900
$25,000?

1033
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,020
Small potatoes.

1034
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,920
Oh, $50,000 anyway.

1035
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,400
$75,000 would be more like it.

1036
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,840
Well, once a year, more or less.

1037
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,100
I'm sure you've got some money to be had.

1038
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,600
Well, sure, you're old.

1039
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:46,200
I'm young.

1040
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,920
I need dough and plenty of it.

1041
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:50,440
Well, sure, you're old.

1042
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,000
I'm young.

1043
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,660
I need dough and plenty of it.

1044
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,180
Plenty of it.

1045
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:56,020
I need dough and plenty of it.

1046
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:58,020
I need dough and plenty of it.

1047
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:59,460
I need dough and plenty of it.

1048
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:00,740
Plenty, plenty of it, friend.

1049
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:02,880
8237490.

1050
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,940
Yeah, I mean, we're fellow Texans.

1051
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:10,920
You need to call in here and party down with the good old boy, Mrs. Subgeniusland.

1052
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,300
Dear friends, this is the hub.

1053
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:17,140
This is where the Church of the Subgenius originated, right here in Dallas, Texas.

1054
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:21,140
This is the foremost subgenius radio show, the hour of slap,

1055
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:25,040
the one that brings you all the other ones, no matter how bad they may be.

1056
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,260
But I'll tell you the conspiracies after us.

1057
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,380
They're shooting at this station.

1058
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:33,640
They're trying to shoot it down with bills, friends, with bills, with evil, evil bills.

1059
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:40,280
There's so much that you could be doing for 8237490 million dollars.

1060
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,480
I mean, and we could do even more with it.

1061
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:45,880
8237490 million dollars.

1062
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,660
I want to see that happening.

1063
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,400
I want to see some yucks going on.

1064
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,320
And you say, well, who can you trust?

1065
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,740
I say, yes, you can.

1066
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,400
No one knows this money.

1067
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,660
Money changes everything.

1068
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:07,800
Oh, yes, dear friends.

1069
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:08,380
I say, money.

1070
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,040
Don't it know?

1071
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,720
Money changes everything.

1072
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,280
And I want it.

1073
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:13,400
I want to see.

1074
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,700
I want you to change things with that.

1075
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,460
I think you know what you're doing.

1076
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:18,260
Well, not really.

1077
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,500
When I'm called a stranger.

1078
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,000
It's all in the past now.

1079
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,960
Money changes everything.

1080
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:34,120
Yes, it will all be in the past pretty soon, all too soon.

1081
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,240
Very good, friend.

1082
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,500
And you're laughing out there.

1083
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,780
You're going, oh, I'm a nihilistic teenager.

1084
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:42,720
I don't know.

1085
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,840
There's no future.

1086
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:49,860
Why should I try to contribute to the world peace and slack?

1087
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:51,160
You're laughing.

1088
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:57,140
You're just thinking, there's no hope for humanity anyway.

1089
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,320
I'm just going to watch the world end.

1090
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,940
I'm going to make a million dollars.

1091
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:29,140
Is that because all you want to be is a drag queen?

1092
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:29,140


1093
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:29,140


1094
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:29,140


1095
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:31,000
擊himself?

1096
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:31,000


1097
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:31,780
Let's go even more close.

1098
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,660
It is easy for people to do it.

1099
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,000
Look at Bob.

1100
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:41,680
What?

1101
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,160
because he paid more money.

1102
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:43,340
So I want you to call 828-9500.

1103
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,680
Now you can have something to sell.

1104
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:49,220
We all know we're in the art of selling.

1105
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,980
We create a mental and an emotional climate of unconscious selling.

1106
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,540
Right in your own home.

1107
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,320
When everybody sells...

1108
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,720
We're all selling.

1109
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,520
We all have something to sell.

1110
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,920
Yes, everyone's selling together a mighty symphony of prosperity.

1111
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,960
For we all have something to sell.

1112
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:17,480
The child Bob experienced a traumatic close encounter with a UFO at the age of three.

1113
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:22,760
Soon thereafter, he began to exhibit strange powers of persuasion.

1114
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:27,220
By age six, he had made his first million almost by accident.

1115
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:31,280
But you know, that ain't good enough.

1116
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,420
No, it ain't.

1117
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,020
Oh, friends.

1118
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:35,840
We're getting...

1119
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,280
I've got five minutes left.

1120
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:41,600
Five minutes left on this show, and we are not looking so good.

1121
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,240
I mean, this is just ridiculous.

1122
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:46,680
Let me get down to the hate part here on my script.

1123
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,400
I mean, I just...

1124
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,460
I'm not feeling the power.

1125
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,100
I'm really not.

1126
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:49,900
This just ain't...

1127
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,420
823-7490 or 828-9500.

1128
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,900
The power of Bob compels you.

1129
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:01,320
The power of Bob compels you.

1130
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:04,260
The power of Bob compels you.

1131
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:07,540
The power of Bob compels you.

1132
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:07,540


1133
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:07,540


1134
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:07,540


1135
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:07,540


1136
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:07,540


1137
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:07,540


1138
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:07,540


1139
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:07,540


1140
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,580
It was Bob that kept you out of that pit.

1141
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:10,900
And...

1142
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,900
I mean, look what your pledge gets, friends.

1143
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:18,440
When you call that little pledge in, 828-9500-823-7490,

1144
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,600
it gets you another minute of...

1145
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:24,080
It gets you a few more minutes of slack in this life, which is all I've got.

1146
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:27,040
But even more important, it buys you time in subgenius hell.

1147
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,800
And there are many levels to the before and after lives,

1148
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:32,000
but at the lowest rung, you'll find the Christian hell.

1149
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,840
Only Christians go there though, but a step up from that you got the Christian Heaven.

1150
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,020
Usually reserved for Christians only.

1151
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,560
It's mostly just no pain and no pleasure either.

1152
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:44,880
But for the good folks, you get up to subgenius hell.

1153
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,740
And as Jane or Hyperclete once said,

1154
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,100
by the time you get to the Christian Heaven,

1155
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:52,920
you'll be wishing to God you've made it to subgenius hell.

1156
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:58,880
Total pleasure for subgeniuses and total torture and misery for the unsaved and the pinks,

1157
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,160
which you get to watch.

1158
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:04,080
But for people who pledge, you get all the way up to the subgenius heaven.

1159
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:09,340
And you won't be sitting on a bunch of damp clouds harping and in trumpet in all 24 hours a day.

1160
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,140
Nay, nay.

1161
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:13,740
But only if you pledge to K-N-O-N.

1162
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:17,080
You will actually become the squirt itself for all eternity.

1163
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,080
That's 823-749-0828-9500.

1164
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:21,920
Go ahead and get a few more in here.

1165
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,600
Robert Wisdom is coming up with the American Music Party.

1166
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,020
He's going to be doing it.

1167
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:30,140
But friends, I mean, look, I'm waiting for this board to change.

1168
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,560
We need more calls.

1169
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:33,440
We just aren't getting them.

1170
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,920
You don't even need to mean it.

1171
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,240
We don't care if you mean it.

1172
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,200
Just call and pledge.

1173
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,600
Then you can sit back and smirk and think,

1174
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:41,960
oh, I'm not really going to pay that.

1175
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,140
That's fine, because once we have your name and number,

1176
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:48,620
we'll call you and call you until you pay up just to get a moment's rest.

1177
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:50,100
So turn it around, dear friends.

1178
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:53,540
Turn it around and give the conspiracy a black eye.

1179
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:56,960
God Almighty itself wants to see this happen.

1180
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:00,080
I know because he told Bob and Bob left.

1181
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:00,740
He left me a memo.

1182
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,280
This cannot be denied.

1183
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,020
Friends, I've got two minutes left.

1184
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:06,420
Two minutes.

1185
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:08,520
This is getting ugly.

1186
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,300
It's getting mighty ugly.

1187
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:13,300
But I want to see something coming down that line.

1188
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,920
We've got to keep that pipe lit.

1189
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,940
This is not just a figure of speech.

1190
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,960
This could mean the last days of man on Earth.

1191
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:24,000
And if any aliens who are listening to us right now

1192
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,100
realize that we can't raise the money,

1193
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,720
they won't even consider this planet we're saving.

1194
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,300
They'll put us to sleep like some cosmic veterinarians.

1195
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:35,960
We cannot keep saving the world for nothing, friends.

1196
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,260
You think this church runs on air? Nay, nay!

1197
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,860
Does it run on honey? No, it runs on money!

1198
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:41,480
Money!

1199
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:45,220
You must entrust to Bob that which is Bob's.

1200
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:50,700
And, uh, I mean, uh, friends, you have to pay taxes.

1201
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,660
You have to listen to disgusting ads.

1202
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,380
But you don't have to pay K-N-O-N.

1203
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:56,420
K-N-O-N gives you the choice.

1204
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:58,400
Now, don't you think it's time to help out

1205
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,640
an old buddy who's been harassed by bullies in high places?

1206
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:05,400
So call 823-749-0828-9500.

1207
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:06,960
It's down to my last minute.

1208
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,500
This is, uh, I've just about had it.

1209
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:10,300
I've got to give up.

1210
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,200
We haven't reached anywhere near the goal,

1211
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:15,440
but I'm just going to have to stop right now.

1212
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,020
It's my one hour to try to raise some money,

1213
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,860
and you think, oh, I'll just do it later.

1214
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,440
I'll call back some other time.

1215
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,620
They just don't care a bit.

1216
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,160
In dreams, I walk with you.

1217
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:34,380
I wish it weren't just dreams.

1218
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:38,820
In dreams, friends, that's all we get to do now.

1219
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,960
In dreams, you'll get to listen to the hour of slack.

1220
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:45,300
In dreams, you'll get to hear Bob's word,

1221
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:46,720
but not in reality, nay.

1222
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:51,120
In dreams, you're mine.

1223
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:55,340
All of the time.

1224
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:01,100
You're still listening to the K-N-O-N 90.9 FM

1225
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:04,560
in Dallas, Texas, in dreams.

1226
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:06,580
In dreams.

1227
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:09,600
Robert Wisdom is here. I'm going to get off.

1228
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,760
I'm going to let him have a chat.

1229
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:13,360
I hope he has better luck than me.

1230
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:15,160
I certainly hope he does.

1231
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:17,220
Just before the dawn, I'm going to wake,

1232
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,420
and you'll have already been gone.

1233
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:20,760
I can't help it.

1234
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:22,720
I can't help it if I cry!

1235
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:25,140
I can't help it.

1236
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:29,400
I can't help it if I cry!

1237
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,800
I can't help it if I cry!

1238
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:38,040
I remember that you said goodbye.

1239
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:47,560
To plan all these dreams.

1240
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:53,580
And only have you.

1241
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:56,600
To dream my dreams.

1242
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:04,380
All of them in dreams.

1243
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:13,280
And in my dreams.

1244
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:13,480
And in my dreams.
