1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,020
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

2
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,440
The subgenius hour of slack.

3
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,080
Slack.

4
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,960
From A to B.

5
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,440
Sir, I'm the guy with the legal notices in the newspaper.

6
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,680
I'll give you some more.

7
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,140
So I got my girlfriend therapy,

8
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,040
and then would you please someone else serve this guy

9
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,660
and start the normal process and a peaceful process.

10
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,940
Then I have my key chain in the newspaper for children of the 60s, 50s.

11
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,500
Actually, I'm 50s and 60s.

12
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,700
I was in a hospital emergency room freezing in the 50s.

13
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,460
And my key chain's missing like once, twice, thrice, or whatever, once or twice.

14
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,400
And then my family's best one.

15
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,380
Then it involves Georgie the pizza maker, Jimmy Lieber, Perry Penza.

16
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,060
The kid I sent the picture to, the serial rapist,

17
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,100
and I'm in the paper I sent the picture to this kid,

18
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,980
Seabiscuit, related to Nancy Huntsman.

19
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,660
And they pass it around.

20
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,920
Then I'm missing my entertainers.

21
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,320
Oh, your guitar strings, the little thing on your acoustic guitar sensor,

22
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:25,580
see?

23
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,140
60s, once again, the same group.

24
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,820
Georgie the pizza maker, some Euclid police,

25
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,260
Euclid policeman's son.

26
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,420
I lost my keys.

27
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,720
Yes, sir, I'm the guy with my legal notice in advance in the newspaper,

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,140
including where I sit in a restaurant on a regular basis

29
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,000
with a bullseye painted around downtown Euclid,

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,860
but it involves liaison to Indian Affairs.

31
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,320
But I'm there at public forum.

32
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,580
You're allowed to approach my address in a story if you approach me properly.

33
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,460
Now, anyway, so I have my legal notice in the paper.

34
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,280
I lose my acoustic guitar, my entertainers,

35
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,180
a little wraparound for my guitar.

36
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,880
I'm the guy that circled in the newspaper

37
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,680
and sings a little bit of soul live on the radio in the 60s.

38
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,420
You can find more out about it.

39
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,220
Of course, my family has a privacy case,

40
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,300
but I had a music studio pension.

41
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,900
Then I lose the keys to the rock and roll radio experience.

42
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,460
I'm the kid that had the Nashville Connection,

43
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,180
and it would run with the story,

44
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,860
dial on down and move on up to the 90s for a music industry estimate.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,800
This kid's going to invite a rap music estimate here,

46
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,040
the estimate, and they asked me to pass the...

47
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,440
Where the big chief got a golden crown, I think,

48
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,480
Indian Red, I think, played Here They Come,

49
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,840
Meet the Boys on the Battlefront, and Brother John.

50
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,300
Before that, and let me put that away here.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,160
You are listening to...

52
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,040
ESO Radio, radio voice of no one.

53
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,360
On WCSB Cleveland, the radio voice of Cleveland State University.

54
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,420
And Einstein's Secret Orchestra is in the house tonight,

55
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,880
along with some very special guests.

56
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,260
Coming on up here every now and then,

57
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,060
they do this all the way from Texas.

58
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,000
And do you know who I'm talking about, boys and girls?

59
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,380
Yes, sir.

60
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,180
From the Church of the Subgenius,

61
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,380
the Reverend Ivan Stang.

62
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:25,900
Will be with us tonight.

63
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,800
And Lisa Lisa, queen of all UFOs,

64
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,540
will be hovering above him as well.

65
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,360
That's Princess We to you.

66
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,960
Princess We Are Doe, queen of all UFOs.

67
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,120
Lisa Lisa will do too.

68
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:43,740
Is that thing on?

69
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,860
Who cares?

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,660
Oh, baby Jesus.

71
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,900
Oh, baby Jesus.

72
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:52,900


73
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,420
Oh, baby Jesus.

74
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,820
What lovely tones.

75
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,840
The scree tones.

76
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,640
Well, Chaz, are you going to assign a topic for tonight?

77
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,300
Or are we just going to torture Dave like usual?

78
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,960
We will slander pigs.

79
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,480
Should we start the revolution?

80
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,240
I mean, we could.

81
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:22,880
We've been talking about it.

82
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,620
We've been talking about it for 30 years now.

83
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,740
We could just announce the revolution begins.

84
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,860
Man, the pigs are outside the door.

85
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,560
By the time you get this communique, it'll be too late.

86
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,720
Nah, let's not bother.

87
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,880
The crypt doors are open now.

88
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,260
Yeah, the crypt doors.

89
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,380
Yeah, they all fell open last night.

90
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,880
All them crypt doors down in the above ground cemeteries.

91
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,960
Those lovely above ground tombs.

92
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,740
Yeah, all the doors and all the crypt tombs fell.

93
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,740
They all fell open last night.

94
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,280
Yeah, you could smell it for miles away.

95
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,020
Frosty club-footed giants making their way through the heated snow.

96
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,640
I want to eat your brain.

97
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,460
And they were all on their way to Dr. Timothy Leary's funeral.

98
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,540
Because they knew that's where the real party was going to be.

99
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,560
Yeah, old Doc Tim.

100
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,680
Decided to step on, break on through to the other side, as they say.

101
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,880
And of course, you can imagine the sort of people that showed up for that wake.

102
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,140
Including thousands and thousands of the living dead.

103
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:45,500
And as they shuffled by the open coffin.

104
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,460
Looking down at Dr. Tim, Bob Dobbs came along.

105
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,520
He was down at the very end of the line.

106
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,440
Looked down with a tear running down his face.

107
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,560
And suddenly, the inner corpse of Dr. Tim.

108
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,700
Well, it sort of puked up.

109
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,000
This hard little crusty ball.

110
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,020
What happened?

111
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,940
Looked like hardened mucus.

112
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:17,260
And Bob and the other living dead corpses examined the thing.

113
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:22,720
It turned out to be apparently something like 2,000 to 3,000 old bodies.

114
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:22,720


115
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,580
And they were all blotted up, hits of blotter.

116
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,540
Completely undigested.

117
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:34,100
It had been like a gathering, like a giant hairball or a ball of string.

118
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,780
In the stomach of the great philosopher, Dr. Leary.

119
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,200
I think we all owe Dr. Leary quite a bit.

120
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:48,420
At this point, we perhaps owe him 2,000 to 3,000 hits of blotter.

121
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,760
Or, well, I don't know what it is.

122
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,340
If it was...

123
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,460
It might have been ESO.

124
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,620
Have you ever done any ESO?

125
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,260
Man, I took too much ESO last night.

126
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,480
Man, my head was splitting.

127
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,280
The water was melting.

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,060
I could hear colors.

129
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,940
Flying colors.

130
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,900
Oh, man.

131
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,720
Just like little red lizards flying in my eyelids.

132
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,700
I could see my personality disorders hovering in the air in front of me.

133
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,980
Forming a spinning mandala shape.

134
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,860
Ride the snake, man.

135
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,800
Some macro vacuum swirling around me.

136
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,900
Psychedelic vortex just picked me up.

137
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,020
Just go with it, Dave.

138
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,200
Let it take you.

139
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,700
You can't try to control this.

140
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,280
It's out of your control now, Dave.

141
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,920
Just try to let go.

142
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,360
Let go of your ego, man.

143
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,620
You're too tied up there.

144
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,860
Yeah, there you go.

145
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:55,560
That guitar solo proves that Dave is finally losing his ego.

146
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,160
Man, my fingernails are dirty blue.

147
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,480
What the hell?

148
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,840
It's like aluminum right now.

149
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:14,540
Yes, it looks like Dave has OD'd again on too much ESO.

150
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,940
Take them little stinky pinkies, man.

151
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,480
I took five of them.

152
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,040
Man, don't take the bread of ESO.

153
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,380
It makes your brain bleed.

154
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,680
Three will kill an elephant.

155
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,800
Loads of cowboy Dave gobbled down five of them boogers.

156
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:28,620
Literally.

157
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,100
Those old chunks broken off the hairball from Dr. Leary's stomach.

158
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,300
My God.

159
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,180
Don't worry about him.

160
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,540
He'll be just fine.

161
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,800
Look, he's starting to sweat now.

162
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,860
He lose a lot of evaporation in his sweat.

163
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,640
Lick his sweat, man.

164
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,380
That sweat will do things, hon.

165
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,360
Just roll it up in a little ball and let it dry.

166
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,420
And then you pack it up your exit wound.

167
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,820
It's a trip, dude.

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,680
Try it.

169
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,440
What's the matter?

170
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,060
Are you afraid?

171
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,260
Afraid your mom's gonna find out?

172
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,840
Come on.

173
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,080
Don't you wanna be cool?

174
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,420
Everybody's doing it.

175
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,860
Everybody's doing it.

176
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,240
Come on.

177
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,440
Just wipe it off and let it dry and roll it up.

178
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,060
Pack it right in, man.

179
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,860
Come on.

180
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:23,120
Let's split from Squaresville and blast off into Kicksville, daddy-o.

181
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,120


182
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,020
Let's.

183
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,620
Hey, look.

184
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,320
Everybody's running off the edge of a cliff.

185
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
Let's do it, too.

186
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,480
Okay.

187
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,560
Look.

188
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,460
Everybody's getting a tattoo of a spider web on the front of their face.

189
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,100
It'll be there forever, even when they go to apply for a job.

190
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,900
Let's do it, too.

191
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,400
Okay.

192
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,660
Hey, look.

193
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,740
Everybody's piercing themselves with nine-inch spikes through their abdomens.

194
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:46,740
That's it.

195
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,380
That looks cool.

196
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,520
Let's try it, kids.

197
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:48,920
Okay.

198
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:53,420
Everybody's having Dobson flies implanted in their foreheads, too.

199
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,820
Oh, they're letting...

200
00:09:54,820 --> 00:10:00,200
Oh, so now they get high by letting Dobson flies lay eggs in the fore part of their brain.

201
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:00,800
Sure.

202
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,380
Let's all try some, kids.

203
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,300
I am one with my team.

204
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,980
I am one with my team.

205
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,500
Hey, everybody's cutting off their little finger.

206
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,640
Let's cut off our little finger.

207
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,640
That looks real cool.

208
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,760
Hey, man.

209
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,620
I read in that sub-Bible that you're supposed to...

210
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,720
Like, if you're really cool, you're supposed to be cool.

211
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:16,720


212
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:16,720


213
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:16,720


214
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:16,720


215
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:16,720


216
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:23,860
You will take a broomstick and wear it, insert it into your knee or a thigh.

217
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,040
And if you're really cool, you hang heavy stuff from it.

218
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,180
But if you're rich, just hang expensive stuff from it.

219
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,180
Is that like a designer broomstick?

220
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,520
Investment hints of the 90s.

221
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:45,560
Cheap, brittle fiberglass broomsticks will be a growth commodity.

222
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,620
In 1997.

223
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,600
You know, darling, I'd like to get a new one.

224
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,820
I think it's been, what, four months since we bought our last one?

225
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,660
Yeah, I guess you're right, honey.

226
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,360
This broomstick is a bit old and I'm tired of having to share it with the teenagers.

227
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:00,680
They get old daily.

228
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,940
Everything seems to get old daily.

229
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,360
It just like turns over and over like some sort of subliminal dream.

230
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,640
Everything does wear out in one day in the future.

231
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,540
I predict that everything you buy will be in one day.

232
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:15,540


233
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:15,540


234
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,940
Everything you buy will wear out in one day, beginning in the year 2001.

235
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,600
Fifteen minutes of fame.

236
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,600
Fifteen minutes of laundry use.

237
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,480
Fifteen minutes of wear.

238
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,340
Fifteen minutes of hair.

239
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,580
And tears.

240
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,380
Fifteen minutes of tears.

241
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:43,920
I predict that in the year 2049, Lonesome Cowboy Dave will finally have a top 40 radio hit.

242
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,020
Because it's welcome.

243
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,440
Well, that's what you call no �uent었.

244
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,080
But it's a little bit less than that.

245
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,080


246
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,080


247
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,340
When the day drops less than that, and I'm talking about when that day's in- Camp

248
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,000
man like, hey, themake, Hey, the make may almost 30 pieces.

249
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,380
I'll see you later.

250
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,080
Everybody has aンjoy there.

251
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,700
I'll see you later.

252
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,980
Steady that train.

253
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,560
Gr murderer.

254
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,300
I love this place man

255
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,540
And too many take too much

256
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,680
Yes so at one time

257
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,480
Results are near

258
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,700
Holocaust and repulsion

259
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,620
All too frequent are the

260
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,480
Quote

261
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,700
Bum trips or freak out

262
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,540
Which are horrendous

263
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,620
Encounters with madness

264
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,880
What is relished

265
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,640
By some and intensely disliked

266
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,200
By others is the loss of

267
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,700
Ego integrity

268
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,320
It may be partial with peculiar

269
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,480
Changes in body image

270
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,020
Or total with depersonalization

271
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,620
And a complete dissolution

272
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,960
Of ego intactness

273
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,320
This can be called

274
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,340
Ego death

275
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,420
And has certain correlates

276
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,500
With the spontaneously occurring

277
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,680
Transcendental state of spontaneous combustion

278
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,900
Man I can see your skull

279
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,420
I can see right through your skin

280
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,840
I can see your skull man

281
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,820
I can see your skull

282
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,700
Ultimately it can be the experience

283
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,920
Of insanity

284
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,420
And be accompanied by terror

285
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,700
And panic and echo effects

286
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,760
On late night

287
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:13,940
And late night

288
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,460
Radio broadcasts

289
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,540
But four thousand eyeballs

290
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,700
Pointing your direction

291
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,360
Can't be wrong

292
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,260
Four thousand eyeballs

293
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,420
Looking at you

294
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,280
Can't be wrong

295
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,900
They're staring at you man

296
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,180
Yeah you're sitting there

297
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:29,960
Watching TV

298
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,260
Listening to the radio

299
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,140
Yeah you're just

300
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,960
You're watching Beavis and Butthead

301
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,900
Watching MTV

302
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,500
Well who's watching you

303
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,120
Watching Beavis and Butthead

304
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,820
Watching MTV

305
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,380
I want you to ask yourself that

306
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,980
There's four thousand

307
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,780
In the set

308
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,200
Insect mind eyes on you right now

309
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,400
Several different insect tribes

310
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,380
Right there in your little house

311
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,240
Or your car as you're driving along

312
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,020
They're watching you

313
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,460
And they're taking notes boy

314
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,520
They're taking names

315
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,380
When the revolution comes

316
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,580
The insect revolution

317
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,320
You and me and every other two legged

318
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,600
Four legged as well

319
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,100
Is gonna be plum out of luck

320
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,300
You better stock up on that RAID

321
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,620
And Roach Motels buddies

322
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,380
You're gonna need them

323
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,400
You're gonna need them

324
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,260
That's...

325
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:12,600
That's...

326
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:12,920
You're dead

327
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,140
For millions and billions of years

328
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,520
Long before there was no Beavis

329
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,080
You know it

330
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,420
They crawled around and stood around

331
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,580
And deposited their filth

332
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,700
In pools of saline water

333
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,220
Yeah uh huh

334
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,880
Yeah sure they did

335
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,940
For thousands and millions and billions of years

336
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,520
They deposited their stuff in saline water

337
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,100
And that made for more and more and more and more of this

338
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,560
And they came forth

339
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:42,580
And they came forth

340
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:51,600
from the swamps to suck the blood of the mammals and the reptilian ones who

341
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,260
swatted them with their tails and later on their fly swatters but to what avail

342
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:03,700
to what avail according to the great doctor Hellstrom at the rate of insect

343
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:09,800
reproduction the entire earth will be completely blanketed in a mild thick

344
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:18,620
shell of living cockroaches within the next five years are you ready do you

345
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:23,600
have the cookbook do you have the cookbook which will explain to you how

346
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,740
to make nature's burger patties out of roach excrement

347
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,780
I woke up one morning to find myself transformed into some sort of monster's

348
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:39,660
vermin I looked down my brain you damn for

349
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:39,780

00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,360

351
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,580

352
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,800

353
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,520
scrawny and fuzzy I coughed a phobia I coughed a phobia I coughed a phobia

354
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:59,820

356
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,640
antidepressants and thorazine and stuff like that obviously this

357
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,840
This man has been medicated by professionals.

358
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,380
Very good.

359
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,660
It is beginning to ooze out of his skin now.

360
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,880
The cockroach hormones provide the perfect immunity.

361
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,760
Radioactivity.

362
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,760
Buzz him now.

363
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,800
Don't fool it. That makes that sound. I hate it.

364
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,200
Cockroach Legionnaires Disease Antidote Viral...

365
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,320
Uh, serum.

366
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,620
I've got it right here.

367
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,460
I've had some pornography.

368
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,200
Pills.

369
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,820
Abortion pills.

370
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,900
Oh, don't worry. You can follow...

371
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,260
Just follow the advice of the old doctor.

372
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,380
Take one of these and three of these.

373
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,180
We're acupillsters here. We're holy men.

374
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,640
We can apply the sacred acupillster knowledge.

375
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,180
And poke these pills into your sacred shop.

376
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,980
Here, give me the screwdriver. I'll bore a little hole in your elbow.

377
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,980
That's one of the points. One of the acupillster points.

378
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,480
Just follow the meridians.

379
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,220
Yes.

380
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,420
Find the spots.

381
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,820
Perfect sites.

382
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,980
We find the meridian on Dave. Let's see.

383
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,000
Where's his... He told me he had a headache.

384
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,660
And he needs a cure for bad guitarmanship.

385
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,460
According to this globe here, it's meridian...

386
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,700
Let's see. Latitude 365.

387
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,080
Longitude...

388
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:39,940
923.

389
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,180
I knew you could do it.

390
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:40,700
Okay.

391
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,900
Give me that pill.

392
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,940
I can see it in the mirror.

393
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,620
Give me that ice pick.

394
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,440
All right.

395
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:45,620
Yes.

396
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,220
Now, bend over, Dave.

397
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,320
No, no, no, no, please.

398
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,140
Here comes your pill.

399
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,220
No, no, I can't hold it.

400
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,520
Okay, now we gotta make a hole for it.

401
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:58,160
Oh, Dave's gonna be getting off any minute now.

402
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,820
He's gonna be seeing those flying colors.

403
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,260
He's gonna see the mandala made of Bob's pipes spinning in outer space.

404
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,980
He'll feel the flames of hell.

405
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,140
He'll feel the flames of hell licking at his, uh, behind.

406
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,620
Hopefully rendering it a little more attractive.

407
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,400
It's been singed off a bit.

408
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,880
And, and most of all, Dave will be high as a kite, yes?

409
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,400
In...

410
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,420
Perhaps his creativity will improve.

411
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,220
Man, I...

412
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,980
Hey, if I looked at the insides of my eyelids, I could see...

413
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,260
Millions and billions of cockroaches getting it on.

414
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,120
Oh, yeah.

415
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,940
This is better than any of those videos you were trying to see.

416
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,840
I'm telling you, the church...

417
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,380
Oh, man, these cockroaches are really doing it like dogs, man.

418
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,380
I never saw an insect with such a fibrillation.

419
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,180
So I say, basically, I ain't living though.

420
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:47,500
But...

421
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,160
Wow!

422
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,140
A little, a little, a little, a little...

423
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:55,760
This subject is now experiencing the retinal flea circus.

424
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:06,440
And during which, uh, the simple pheromone, uh, color bars that, uh, occur on the, uh, inside of the eyelid are being mistaken for scurrying...

425
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,160
Oh, my God, those are cockroaches.

426
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,000
Oh, he's got cockroaches living under his eyelids.

427
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,760
Oh, I've heard some horror stories about old folks' homes, but this is...

428
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,020
This is, this is a per...an otherwise healthy man walking around with bedsores.

429
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,180
And cockroaches living in bedsores.

430
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,720
Man, I've never seen anything like...

431
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,600
Hey, look at their hideous, scrabbling legs.

432
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,120
Their stiff exoskeletons scraping across the corneas.

433
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,420
Oh, my God.

434
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:36,880
The eyes.

435
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,520
Oh, man, give me a...

436
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,040
I took too much ESO.

437
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,600
It can break my...

438
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,440
The antidote, Monique.

439
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,040
Stop having it.

440
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,960
Stop having it, man.

441
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:44,860
Those are...

442
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,800
They're not real.

443
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,360
They're not real.

444
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,480
It's, it's just a...

445
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,880
A hallucination.

446
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,940
Somebody give me the rain, quick.

447
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:52,980
Oh, man.

448
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,260
Okay, Dave, open your mouth.

449
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:55,940
Here comes the rain.

450
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,100
Oh, shit.

451
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,060
Look at this.

452
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:00,980
Hey, hey.

453
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,040
Do you want to have another hit of that?

454
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,740
Yeah, hey, hey, hey, try this mace, daddy-o.

455
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,140
Oh, you're breaking my eyeballs.

456
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:06,980
I'm gonna have a little PCP, okay?

457
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,200
Here.

458
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,340
Yes.

459
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,640
Rain, yeah, man.

460
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,860
Ride the snake, dude.

461
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,540
Ride the snake.

462
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,080
Hey, you know, that's the endorphins that get you off.

463
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:17,820
Yeah, man.

464
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,340
Here, here, take this ax and cut your right hand off.

465
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,580
You're gonna dig it.

466
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,480
Wait until you feel the endorphins.

467
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:25,920
Oh, no.

468
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,060
Oh, it...

469
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,600
Look, Dave's hand lives on.

470
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,760
It crawled up onto, up his leg.

471
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,120
It's crawling up the guitar line.

472
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,120


473
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,120


474
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,120


475
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,120


476
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,120


477
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,120


478
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,120


479
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,120


480
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,120


481
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,120


482
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,120


483
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,120


484
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,000
It's on the guitar again.

485
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:42,100
The hideous, disembodied Dave hand is trying to play some sort of...

486
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,920
Oh.

487
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,640
That's kind of cool.

488
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,240
Yeah, yeah.

489
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,820
I'm glad we disconnected that hand from his brain.

490
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,440
Yeah, man.

491
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,960
My hand was harmful anyway.

492
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,940
Who needs a standard flingy-dong hanging from it anyway?

493
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,620
This hand boy is harmful.

494
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,420
I feel lighter.

495
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:05,620
The hand has experienced ego death and is now able to play a pure jazz riff without

496
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,100
any...

497
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:06,100


498
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:06,100


499
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,100
fear or self-consciousness.

500
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,720
No, man.

501
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,520
Yeah, I can just pound this stuff right out, man.

502
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,560
I can play the keyboard.

503
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,340
I'm not even touching it.

504
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,420
Now I'm touching it.

505
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,020
Hey, man.

506
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,600
I got control over three or four different joysticks.

507
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:33,620
Yes, Dave is far less clumsy now that his organs have been separated from a connection

508
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,480
to his brain.

509
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,580
Oh, man.

510
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,080
Oh, man.

511
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,580
Yeah?

512
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,040
The role of claro reclamación.

513
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,640
Yeah.

514
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,660
And...

515
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,220
Sorry.

516
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:54,220


517
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:54,220


518
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:54,220


519
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:54,220


520
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,860
Is it什麼leri or setasha?

521
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,240
Yeah.

522
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:00,940


523
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,360
Okay,こっち.

524
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,080
The

525
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:32,800
I wouldn't hurt no one. It wasn't me, doctor. It was the hand. The hand had an evil mind of his own. You see, my ego died. Yes, I took off. Yes, I went. And my ego died. I didn't know no lonesome cowboy, David. Nothing. And then my hand, I said, it's mine, mine. No, it's not my hand. And then my hand was gone. And off to do its own evil bidding in the world. And I didn't kill him. I didn't kill him.

526
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:49,340
The poor deluded fool. He took too much ESO. Dave, look at him now. He's crawling around in circles. He thinks that the hand, the disembodied hand, killed his friend. But it was merely too much ESO.

527
00:23:50,060 --> 00:24:02,300
The hand killed Timothy Leary. I know it for a fact. They say he died of naturalistic causes. But I don't know how to tell. I had a dream that was flying through the air like one of those little fangirls.

528
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:08,400
And now it's outside looking in.

529
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:31,540
And now Dr. Tim is seen ensconced in an easy chair in heaven. A floating easy chair. Surrounded by lovely maidens and fellow acupilasters.

530
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,780
Floating in an easy chair.

531
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:48,660
Flying colors all around his head. Living in total slack. Because, yes, Dr. Timothy Leary was a news-paying minister in the church of the subgenius. Thus has ascended beyond this lowly meat plane.

532
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:58,080
And he has abandoned his flesh shell to go to, yes, a better place. To the great web in the sky.

533
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,220
Yes, you can still visit Timothy Leary's...

534
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,600
...aetheric website.

535
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,600
And find out what pills he's taking now that he's...

536
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,340
...now that he can get any.

537
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,000
Friends, you can...

538
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,100
...you can score in subgenius hell.

539
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,840
That's what we've been saying all along.

540
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,160
Now you're finally starting to catch on, right?

541
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,300
Finally.

542
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,500
To get it through the head.

543
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,880
They finally, finally read that first line in the first book of Neuronicus 57.

544
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,940
Where it says...

545
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:32,080
...Jesus did take pills in church.

546
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:32,200
...in church.

547
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,940
And we're not talking about, as Daniel and I have to please preach, we're not talking about no Tylenol, friend.

548
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,140
Hell, Moses took Tylenol.

549
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,360
Hell, Muhammad took Tylenol.

550
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,280
We're talking about...

551
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,140
And we're not talking about B.C. powders.

552
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,100
Of course, B.C. powders were before Christ.

553
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,860
Or the A.C. powders.

554
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,840
No, sir.

555
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,660
We're talking about pills, man.

556
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:52,860
Serious pills.

557
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:59,720
In fact, here in commemoration of X days gone by, we're going to pass out the froth cakes.

558
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,020
These little cakes here, Nate.

559
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:02,700
We have one.

560
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,780
Living habiflops, ziplops, plants grown on the graves there.

561
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,240
Oh, this is so good.

562
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,880
This is my, or it is Bob's body and drink of this.

563
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,140
Oh, he tastes like...

564
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,860
Oh, this is...

565
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,320
Oh, man.

566
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:17,880
Wow.

567
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,820
Oh, I can't quit chewing.

568
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,000
It's like...

569
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,140
It's heavy.

570
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,240
It makes me want to chew more.

571
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,180
It's very heavy.

572
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:26,780
I'm starting to...

573
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,420
I'm starting to feel a little different.

574
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,520
Oh, there's nothing in them.

575
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,700
They're just dirt.

576
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,100
Corn starch and mud.

577
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,880
I started to feel constipated.

578
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,120
Yeah, a little dobson.

579
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,300
A little dobson fly in there, too?

580
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,120
Yeah, a little bit.

581
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,460
A little dobson fly wing.

582
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,000
A little bit.

583
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,060
Yep.

584
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,300
Less than 1.5% roach parts.

585
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,020
Less than 1.5% roach parts?

586
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,400
And vegetable fat.

587
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,840
I didn't know vegetables could get fat.

588
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,940
More froth cakes?

589
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,660
Chaz, you want a froth cake?

590
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,640
I remember I gained a few pounds last weekend.

591
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:58,820
Oh, yeah.

592
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,420
Hey, man.

593
00:26:59,500 --> 00:26:59,860
You got...

594
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,900
Vegetables can get fat.

595
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:01,940
Oh, yeah.

596
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,720
You're gonna have to...

597
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,800
You're gonna have to take appetite suppressants for weeks after eating a froth cake.

598
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,680
But you won't have to eat food again.

599
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,280
Ever.

600
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,140
Nope.

601
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,440
Nope.

602
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,360
One hit.

603
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,060
Free.

604
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,020
That's all you need.

605
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,100
Never come down.

606
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,100
Never be hungry again.

607
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,120
Mmm.

608
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,880
If I could just finish this froth cake.

609
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,080
It never seems to end.

610
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:27,640
It just...

611
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,700
It's funny how you eat that...

612
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,560
Mine's bigger.

613
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,540
The hot...

614
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,140
Oh, yeah.

615
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:33,680
Oh, yeah.

616
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,000
Well, I didn't mean that way.

617
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,920
I mean, my froth cake is getting bigger.

618
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:36,820
Why?

619
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,960
They seem like mine's not really getting any bigger.

620
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,720
But I can't make it any smaller no matter how much of it I eat.

621
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,520
I think my mouth is getting smaller and this thing's staying the same size.

622
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:49,720
Well, now that you've mentioned it, the ceiling does look a little higher now, doesn't it?

623
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,660
I thought the ceiling looked a lot lower.

624
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,600
As a matter of fact, I'm having trouble reaching up to this microphone now.

625
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,460
I didn't even know the microphone was on in the room.

626
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,820
Is it in the room?

627
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,820
This froth...

628
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,340
Now this froth...

629
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,700
My froth cake is getting bigger.

630
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,920
My froth cake is getting bigger.

631
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,900
My froth cake is getting smaller now.

632
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,680
Well, we could stop eating it, I suppose.

633
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,940
I can't stop eating it.

634
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,540
That's another thing.

635
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,920
I can't stop eating this froth cake and it can't stop getting smaller and bigger at the same time.

636
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:10,740
Yeah.

637
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,220
Oh, man.

638
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,920
It's a pretty good froth cake, though.

639
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,480
I suppose you could say that.

640
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,480
I don't even taste it anymore.

641
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,620
I just can't stop eating it.

642
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,680
I mean, it's kind of full, but you know what?

643
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,980
I didn't taste so good.

644
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,460
I just don't want to stop eating it.

645
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,000
Did Tiny Tim, like, dressed up in, like, one of those weird broom...

646
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,900
I mean, those chimney sweep guys or just, like, one of those old kind of guys that...

647
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:31,900


648
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:31,900


649
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,560
used to drive the funeral trucks, walk in.

650
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,460
I mean, you know, with a big black hat on and stuff.

651
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:41,120
I mean, it looked like Tiny Tim with a big black hat on and it, like, you know, one of them...

652
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:41,860
Oh, never mind.

653
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,920
I think you've been...

654
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,240
You've been eating too much of that froth cake, buddy.

655
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:55,480
What Reverend Stang and Lonesome don't know is that secretly inside the froth cakes is some alien smegma pie mixed in with dough.

656
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,020
You know, I think this froth cake is starting to eat me.

657
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,900
It tastes like it's starting to digest the entire...

658
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:01,900


659
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:01,900


660
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,200
I'm starting to feel kind of doughy.

661
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:10,700
I'm starting to feel like my flesh is getting all tasty and all rubbery.

662
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,440
Though becoming quite tasty.

663
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,140
Moist and flabby like...

664
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:13,940
...greasy fried chicken.

665
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:17,700
I'm starting to feel like a froth cake that hasn't been cooked.

666
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,820
I feel like we are...

667
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,000
Like I am dough.

668
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:21,920
Like we are dough.

669
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,200
We are dough.

670
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,740
It's gross, man.

671
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,720
It's like we...

672
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,500
What have we...

673
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,760
I'm just kidding.

674
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,140
I was...

675
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:30,980
Dough.

676
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,900
But I kind of know what I'm talking about.

677
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,280
I mean...

678
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:37,200
You've got like a spare of candy to go on right out of the middle of your thorax.

679
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,800
I'm getting doughy.

680
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,400
Give me another froth...

681
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,680
Oh, I still have this froth cake.

682
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:46,900
I just...

683
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:48,760
No.

684
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:55,940
Gradually, Reverend Stang and Lonesome turn into dough boys, munching away on their hemp cakes, the sacred ones.

685
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,160
I...

686
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:09,620
Close your eyes, girl, look inside, but let the sound take you away.

687
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:23,960
Last night I hold a lettuce lamp and so I wish that I could stay before the thing could answer

688
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:29,580
I love you.

689
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,880
It was 1916.

690
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,680
Somewhere in the south of France.

691
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,480
Or maybe it was the east of France.

692
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,160
Somewhere near the Avignon.

693
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,080
Three men in a trench together.

694
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,700
One with a pipe.

695
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,040
One with a froth cake.

696
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,780
And one with a pierced eyelid.

697
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,000
How many did you say were in that trench?

698
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,720
Three, not counting...

699
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,380
Well, there were five. Five in the trench.

700
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:22,800
No.

701
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,940
And one with a...

702
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,820
One with a Swiss Army knife.

703
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,980
Six men in a trench.

704
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,220
One with a Swiss Army knife.

705
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,420
One with a small nuclear device.

706
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,800
One with a pierced nostril.

707
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,440
One with a pipe.

708
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,120
One with a froth...

709
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:34,500
That's...

710
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,460
No, that's seven, not right?

711
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,060
One with a froth cake.

712
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:37,660
One with a pipe.

713
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,560
Three with a...

714
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,300
Okay, there.

715
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:39,900
And then...

716
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,920
Well, anyway.

717
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,520
And then the guy with the small tank of nuclear weapons says...

718
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,680
Oh, now, what does he say?

719
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,980
I can't remember, Doctor.

720
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,480
Oh, I messed it up.

721
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,080
He starts singing, row, row, row your boat.

722
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,780
He screamed in Sumerian.

723
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:09,900
Thank you, thank you, Reverend, for those words before these.

724
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,760
Brave young men had to die for no reason.

725
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,200
You guys got to get closer to the microphone there.

726
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,540
Or you need nothing coming through on those tapes.

727
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,520
I...

728
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,580
The needles aren't even moving when you're talking three feet away from the microphone.

729
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:22,920
Who, me?

730
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,920
Who, me?

731
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:23,920


732
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,440
I can sure hear me.

733
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:26,940
You can...

734
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:27,320
Yeah.

735
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,700
I don't know about Dave.

736
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,420
Dave's drifting off into another world.

737
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,460
Oh, Dave's so shy.

738
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:35,140
Dave's afraid to get in there and bogart that microphone.

739
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,260
Into rugged testosterone.

740
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:43,520
He's afraid to get any of that spit from the previous users of this microphone anywhere near his mouth.

741
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,000
I can't say as I blame him.

742
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:49,160
I see some weird-looking jokers leave this station late at night.

743
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,120
Microbes.

744
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,680
Microbes.

745
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,440
Microbes.

746
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:53,440


747
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,720
Microbes.

748
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,800
DJs.

749
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,320
Hi.

750
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,320
And diseases of the follicles you find in your own bathtub.

751
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:08,200
Did you take a shower last night and realize that there were microbe DJs attached to your genitalia?

752
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,080
Slapping little headphones on them.

753
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,420
I knew it all along.

754
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,720
That's a kind of a sick thought.

755
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,080
Little microbe DJs attached to your genitals?

756
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,060
It depends on the DJs.

757
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:23,920
They're some great...

758
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:30,600

00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,360
back my god at least we're not a conspiracy

771
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,060
at least

772
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,600
We're as pure as a driven stone.

773
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,480
We follow our own vision, whatever the hell that might be.

774
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,980
In my case, I'm saying dope.

775
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,580
At least we can demagnetize our heads now and then.

776
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,780
Just a little, little pop here, a little rub there.

777
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,920
I don't feel no different.

778
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,220
I'm not jealous of those highly paid conspiracy radio employees.

779
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,000
Oh, they have to have their blood tested every 15 minutes.

780
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,300
Them guys can't even demagnetize their groins.

781
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,960
We need to magnetize our heads.

782
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,100
Can you imagine that? FM DJs peeing in a cup.

783
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,560
Now, that's, think how sad that is.

784
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,560
That's a sign of the end times.

785
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,360
Think how sad that is.

786
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,320
That is, that is.

787
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:31,400
It's, you know, when FM, well, I knew it was the,

788
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,900
I knew the end was coming when comic books went up to 50 cents.

789
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,940
Well, this one guy, they made him go in a little styrofoam thing.

790
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,500
And this other guy, I guess he was well in a big old coffee mug.

791
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,800
Now, I don't understand what's behind all this.

792
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,940
Is it just some kind of...

793
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,080
Is it just some kind of new sort of fad, or why do they do it?

794
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,940
They do it for love, Dave.

795
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:55,860
Love of suaveness, coolness, and order.

796
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,720
You mean like I could pick up a girl if I could just,

797
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,340
like maybe command her to pee in the right kind of vessel?

798
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,760
Well, most people, maybe not you,

799
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:10,480
but most people could pick up a girl by commanding her to pee in the right vessel.

800
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,900
I don't like the way where this is going, Dave.

801
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,820
Well, now, what does this picture say to you?

802
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,280
What do you see in this random inkblot, Dave?

803
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,100
Well, once again, I see the cockroach-ridden growing cakes,

804
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,560
and I also see somebody trying to get away.

805
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,600
It looks like his feet are tied to that post.

806
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,760
Man, but he's trying to reach that radio dial.

807
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,700
He's trying to reach that off switch, or at least, at least, Lord,

808
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,500
let me reach the volume switch.

809
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,720
Oh, please let me find the volume switch on that ES.

810
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,020
I took too much ESO.

811
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,820
If only I could just turn the volume down.

812
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,940
Maybe, maybe even find the off switch.

813
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,160
Or, or, oh, my God, I could unplug it.

814
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,060
But those DJs, those ugly DJs tied my feet to this light post.

815
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,020
I can't quite reach the radio.

816
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:00,080
They made me wear this tape deck around my neck,

817
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:05,220
so I have to hear their stinking horrible voices and awful music all night long.

818
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,080
It's pointless. I don't even see what the reason for it is.

819
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,540
But why? I donated money to WCSB.

820
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,160
Radio.

821
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,760
I, I, I tossed, I called, well, I didn't actually send in my pledge.

822
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,020
I, I did call it in.

823
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:24,240
And now they've got me tied up and they make me listen to this one show over and over again.

824
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:31,580
I, I never wondered why, why I never should have took that ESO.

825
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,860
Some kids said no.

826
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,480
No.

827
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,500
We have a confession to make.

828
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,460
You're forgiven.

829
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:57,620
I am.

830
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,860
But, but, but, I've sinned.

831
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,540
I have no sin.

832
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:05,940
I have sat in the back seat of cars with bird-hanging ladies.

833
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:11,660
I commanded them to urinate in strange vessels.

834
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,180
Uh-oh.

835
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,440
It's the only one you have

836
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,000
You wanna take her with a plane

837
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,560
You're gonna walk in in the rain

838
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,340
Watch her fall, it's gonna be bad

839
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,640
That's the man inside my head

840
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,980
Spirit never have to leave

841
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,360
All she gotta do, believe

842
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,940
A faith healer

843
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,140
Where's my faith healers?

844
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,860
Start preaching any time now.

845
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,980
We were in the other room smoking cigarettes.

846
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:21,360
We can't faith heal people unless they're, you know, well, you know, oh, where's my, my hurt phones?

847
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:25,440
I think I could come by the little security and sit by my hand, but really, I didn't follow you.

848
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,340
I didn't make a tip on the back.

849
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,580
Put your hands on the radio.

850
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,380
Just put your hands on the radio.

851
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,460
I know I can, I'm in discernment now.

852
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:35,740
I'm in the spirit and I can feel out there.

853
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,540
I can feel that there's a young man.

854
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,540
He's in pain.

855
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,420
He's in spiritual pain.

856
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,340
He doesn't know.

857
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,960
He doesn't know where the next paycheck's gonna come.

858
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:50,840
And his mom and dad are ashamed of him because he doesn't have a job and his girlfriend's threatening to leave him.

859
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:54,320
And he's got a, he's got a pain, a pain in his leg.

860
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,560
Oh, he doesn't have a leg on that side.

861
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:01,140
And I see, I'm in discernment and I see a young girl.

862
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:01,860
No, she's not.

863
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:08,020
Actually, she's an old, old mattress back, but she's, she's an old piece, but she's feeling, she's feeling alone.

864
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,180
She's feeling lonely.

865
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,680
She feels like nobody loves her out there.

866
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,840
Nobody finds her attractive anymore.

867
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:13,760
And I,

868
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:18,680
I want you to know, ma'am, that there's preachers and faith healers right out here at this radio station.

869
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,040
If we think you're real cute, ma'am, you just send that love offering in.

870
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:29,620
We can heal you of your loneliness and we can lift you, lift away that which has enslaved you.

871
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:36,620
Yes, we can lift off that weight, that heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy load in your back pocket.

872
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,780
It's been pulling you down.

873
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,200
It's a chain is what it is.

874
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:43,260
It's a ball and chain attached to that conspiracy day job.

875
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:47,000
I know you feel guilty about working for a living.

876
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,900
Bob forgives you for now, but how long are you going to let it go on?

877
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:57,720
How long are you going to be a slave to that mess of little green handcuffs and that back pocket organ of yours?

878
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,640
Now, I want you to just reach back there.

879
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,380
Just cut yourself free.

880
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,920
Just cut yourself free.

881
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,720
Don't just throw it away.

882
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:04,280
Send it.

883
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,020
It's, it's, it's, don't put it back into the world where it'll just infect another soul.

884
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,460
Send it on to Dallas.

885
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,040
Send it to the subgenius foundation office.

886
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:19,620
And we'll cleanse and purify that demonic spirit living in your back pocket, in your purse, in your bank account.

887
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,800
We will cast out that demon, my friend.

888
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,960
We're going to get down.

889
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,240
We're going to grab him by the horns.

890
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,300
We're going to wrestle with him.

891
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,920
We're going to wrestle with that demon.

892
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,240
We're going to twist him.

893
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,060
We're going to hog tie that little, that little booger.

894
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,000
We're going to whoop him down.

895
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,440
And we're going to cleanse it.

896
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,020
And it feels like water.

897
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:40,900
It feels like a stream of water when you're saved.

898
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,500
It'll be like a river.

899
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,600
River in your brain.

900
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,720
Going from your brain all the way down to your butt, then back up to your brain.

901
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,580
Oh, it's free.

902
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:48,780
Free.

903
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,520
Yes, you healed.

904
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,220
Healed, healed, healed.

905
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:53,540
Now.

906
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,120
That's good.

907
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,200
That's a good, Bobby.

908
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,540
Hands down.

909
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:03,500
You can put my hands on you.

910
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,040
Can I put my hands on you?

911
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,460
Can I put my hands on you?

912
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,640
Can I.

913
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,940
Can I put my hands on you?

914
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:17,360
Can I put my hands on you?

915
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,860
Can I put my hands on you?

916
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,320
Can I put my hands on you?

917
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,020
Just as you have heard the Reverend Ivan Stain

918
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,900
will excise demons from your pocketbook,

919
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,040
from your purse or wallet.

920
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,700
He'll excise demons from your heart,

921
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,660
from your mind, from your spirit and your soul.

922
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,500
He'll cut it out like the wooded, wooded,

923
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,460
rotting part of a tree.

924
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,100
Pray, Stomps, he will do this and more for you

925
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,520
if you only include a flaw.

926
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,220
Donation to the church,

927
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,800
because that church that is going to save you

928
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,500
needs to keep its feet on the ground.

929
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,520
It needs to say,

930
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,460
Solomon, it needs to keep on running and working for you.

931
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,080
And it ain't running backwards, friends.

932
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,420
It ain't running backwards.

933
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,420
It's running right on time.

934
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,560
I'm sorry.

935
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,880
Wait, wait, did you believe me?

936
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,120
I'm sorry.

937
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,580
And it's going to run you down.

938
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,380
As Dr. LeGuin used to say,

939
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,520
it's better to be a speeding car

940
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,160
than a blind man crossing against the light.

941
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,500
Now you think about it.

942
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,120
You're just going to go wandering right into that street

943
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,000
blindfolded by the conspiracy,

944
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:20,860
by the normalcy vibes bombarding you from that MTV,

945
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,900
from that television set, that radio,

946
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,460
present company excluded.

947
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,760
Or are you going to rip that blindfold off,

948
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,680
commandeer a car,

949
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,520
carjack the next car you see come by,

950
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,040
preferably a fast one,

951
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,120
and drive directly into the light.

952
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,260
Yes, drive into the light.

953
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,140
Drive into the light at full speed,

954
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,040
120 miles an hour.

955
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,220
And sure, it may be an oncoming Mack truck,

956
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,680
but if so, at least you proved your faith.

957
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,520
At least you're healed.

958
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,480
At least you're saved.

959
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:56,040
Can I put my hands on you?

960
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,640
Can I put my hands on you?

961
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:03,080
Can I put my hands on you?

962
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,040
Yeah, can I put my hands on you?

963
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,040
Can I put my swollen, sweaty, stinking, carbuncled hands

964
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,920
on you for just one week?

965
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,080
One minute.

966
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,220
One minute.

967
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:13,920
I don't want to touch you for long.

968
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,620
Can I put my hands on you?

969
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:17,560
I don't want to touch you deep inside.

970
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,620
Can I put my hands on you?

971
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,000
Can I put my hands on you?

972
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,780
Can I put my hands on you?

973
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,760
Can I put my hands on you?

974
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,660
See, we always end up doing that.

975
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,860
Every one of these shows,

976
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:39,720
we always end up doing that.

977
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:40,980
Oh, I've got to flip.

978
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:41,740
I've got to...

979
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,940
Excuse me, I have to see a tape about flipping it.

980
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:47,500
Yes, see a man...

981
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,100
Flipper's here?

982
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,220
Flipper is here right now in the studio.

983
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:52,080
Flipper's here.

984
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,660
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

985
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,660
Everyone loves the king of the sea.

986
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,540
Da da da da.

987
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,420
For you and for me.

988
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,940
They call him Frapper.

989
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:09,000
Frapper.

990
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,400
Under the sea.

991
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,440
Frapper under the sea.

992
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,540
He's Frappin' for me.

993
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,020
Under the sea.

994
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,580
They call him Frappin'.

995
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:24,500
Frapper.

996
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:25,440
Frapper.

997
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,400
More grunt cakes anyone?

998
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,500
I'll have a grunt cake, yeah.

999
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,300
Yeah, let's see, they're still kind of stuck together down here.

1000
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:47,820
Hey, Chad, the place looks kind of like south of the border commercial, though.

1001
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,440
You know, like Guadalajara, you know, talk radio or something.

1002
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,940
Now, welcome to the show tonight.

1003
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:03,260
In our studio, we present to you tonight,

1004
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,900
Reverend Ivan Stein of the Church of the Sovereign.

1005
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:11,860
Mejor el sabido de la Church of the Sovereign.

1006
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:19,560
Ahora va a hablar con nosotros del Bab, de su religión, de sus ideas.

1007
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:23,800
Bienvenido, señor Reverend Ivan Stein.

1008
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:33,380
Quiere usted y buena noche, una caro fasto.

Quiere usted y mucho dinero.

Y las chicas bonitas.

1011
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,740
Sí, sí, sí, ya lo entiendo.

1012
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:47,420
¿Conoce usted la iglesia del Sovereign?

1013
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:48,760
Sí, sí.

1014
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,480
Y el Slack Master, Bob Dobbs.

1015
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,120
Sí, sí, lo conozco, sí, sí.

1016
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,060
Bob es el Master de Slack.

1017
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:02,400
Sí, el Master de Slack, pero la palabra Slack, ¿cómo se dice la palabra Slack?

1018
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,840
¿Qué significa Slack, Slack, Slack?

1019
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:07,340
¿Con cuántos oímos constantemente la palabra Slack?

1020
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:07,340


1021
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:07,900
Sí, sí, sí.

1022
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,940
Ya voy.

1023
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:12,140
Por instancio.

1024
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:13,460
Por instancio, sí, sí.

1025
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:20,120
Por instancio, yo, yo, trabajo, trabajo muy fuerte.

1026
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,680
Muy, muy, con, oh, qué lástima.

1027
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,320
Es tan, tan, tan, bueno.

1028
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,460
Bien lo recuerdo, mi amigo.

1029
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,820
Es el insulto del sol.

1030
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:30,840
Sí, sí.

1031
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:31,420
Sí.

1032
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:35,340
Y cuando se insulta el sol, el Bob Dobbs, se dice...

1033
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:36,360
Bob, Bob Dobbs.

1034
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,280
¡Caro de conspiracia!

1035
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:42,740
Sí, cuando se, cuando Bob se chinga al conspiración.

1036
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:43,280
¿Caro de qué?

1037
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:49,340
Ah, para el jato, para el jato del sopeño.

1038
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,740
Para el jato del sopeño, sí, sí.

1039
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:54,340
Y el fuerte del yete.

1040
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,560
El snowman abominable.

1041
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:58,920
Ah, sí, sí, sí.

1042
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,840

1043
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:00,320
Claro, claro.

1044
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:05,120
Himalaya, Montalas, y el Frop.

1045
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,340
Que Bob fumar.

1046
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,360
Fumar.

1047
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,380
Sí, sí, sí.

1048
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:13,260
Ah, es el, el esfuerzo del, del...

1049
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:14,460
Todo su poder.

1050
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:15,620
El gran fuerte.

1051
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,120
Sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí.

1052
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,060
Y los llaves, sí.

1053

Los llaves de la ciudad del oro.

1054
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,500
Y café.

1055
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:25,940
Bien dicho.

1056
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:31,020
Ah, y mujeres, mujeres grandes.

1057
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,340
Sí, sí, sí, las mujeres.

1058
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,120
Mujeres muy fuertes.

1059
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,180
Y bonitas también, sí.

1060
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:36,820
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1061
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:38,980
Sí, sí, sí, sí, sí.

Y los, los, los...

00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:41,440

00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:41,560


1067
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:41,660
Muy peloso.

1068
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,180
Canjos.

1069
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,020
Sí, sí, sí, sí.

1070
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:43,600
Y los...

1071
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:43,940
Los pequeños.

1072
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:44,460
Como un amonio.

1073
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:44,900
Dios.

1074
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,140
Y huevos con gallo.

1075
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,660
Y con salsa.

1076
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,620
Lo mejor salsa del mundo.

1077
00:48:53,300 --> 00:49:00,400
Pero esa es un otro de historia más, más, más importante es el dinero que necesitas

1078
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,240
usted, eh, necesitas, por, por...

1079
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,960
Por su iglesia.

1080
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,160
Bob, Bob.

1081
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:05,160


1082
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:09,920
Necesita el dinero en muchas cuantasias.

1083
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:16,020
Porque el dinero es el sol del espacio.

1084
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:23,840
El dinero es el gran mundo del mundo.

1085
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:31,800
De todas las maneras de los insanitos y los libros broquenos.

1086
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,700
Listo para comer como los Frediskuits, no?

1087
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:38,300
Oh, si, si, si.

1088
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:39,500
Frediskuit.

1089
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,800
Con los americanos.

1090
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,640
Y los gringos siempre que le dicen que...

1091
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,340
Pero no, no, no.

1092
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:52,440
Ahora nos vemos en su casa con sus reyos juntos.

1093
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:56,000
Y ahora vamos a conseguir con...

1094
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,040
Bluey Dog.

1095
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:09,060
Bluey Dog.

1096
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:14,700
I don't hear anything warm.

1097
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:22,280
My hands flatten like a frying pan.

1098
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:28,560
I'm looking for something in my life.

1099
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:40,120
I'm looking for something in my life.

1100
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,140
Are you looking for something in your life, Dave?

1101
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,240
Have you heard the good news?

1102
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,100
Bob Dobbs is dead again.

1103
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,800
Bob is dead again?

1104
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,140
Yes, we killed Bob again.

1105
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:55,260
We dragged, we...

1106
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,860
Well, actually we thought we were gonna kill Jesus first.

1107
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:58,540
We scourged him.

1108
00:50:58,540 --> 00:50:58,540


1109
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:03,240
We scourged him and whipped him and drove him up the hill out there in Brushwood, out there in Sherman, New York, you know, a couple of weeks ago.

1110
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:19,800
And then, but, you know, the last one that came down to it, we just thought, well, now Jesus, hell, he ain't responsible for Jesse Helms and, you know, Pat Robertson and Adolf Hitler and all that, and, you know, Jane Fonda and all those terrible people.

1111
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:23,720
Jesus has been trying to make up for what he done wrong.

1112
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:27,420
And so we thought, let's not kill Jesus.

1113
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,680
Let's spare him this time.

1114
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,420
We're subgeniuses.

1115
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:30,900
Let's kill Bob!

1116
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:32,460
What can I say?

1117
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:35,900
We were drunk, you know, too many grunt cakes.

1118
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:39,040
But, but we, well, we did it.

1119
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:39,720
We nailed him up.

1120
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:40,580
You should have seen it.

1121
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:45,660
Jesus and El Diablo and Dr. Leguimo, all of us flopped Bob's dead body down.

1122
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,600
He had a beautiful, excited, if you know what I mean.

1123
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,080
You can tell.

1124
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:49,920
He kind of dug it.

1125
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,660
He had a big grin on his face the whole time.

1126
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:57,400
Took these big old, big old railroad spike nails, hammered his hands in, hammered his ankles in.

1127
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,360
Pushed the stump up that we had him all nailed to.

1128
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,960
Dr. Leguimo ran up, sprayed, we spit on him.

1129
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,300
Oh my God.

1130
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:11,800
And gambled beneath the cross, you know, threw some dice, poked sticks in his side.

1131
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:12,740
He did?

1132
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:15,260
He thirsted and we spit on him some more.

1133
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:16,920
Didn't you even give him a little drink of vinegar?

1134
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,120
Yeah, yeah, we did.

1135
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:22,420
We did give him a little drink of vinegar and we mocked him.

1136
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:27,380
And then Dr. Leguimo sprayed starter fluid all up and down Bob's neck.

1137
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:28,500
Nailed up, crucified corpse.

1138
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:34,260
And I tried to set it on fire with my magic sword, but it didn't work that day.

1139
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,920
And so Dr. Leguimo burned up Bob with his propane torch.

1140
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:45,280
And we frolicked and we got out some marshmallows and some hot dogs and we roasted them over Bob's slimy corpse.

1141
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,300
And that is a true story.

1142
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:51,220
Sorry.

1143
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:55,660
But it physically, actually, literally happened about two weeks ago.

1144
00:52:55,660 --> 00:53:01,300
I remember seeing some footage on, I think it was Mysterious Late Night Tonight or something like that.

1145
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,740
Yeah, yeah, we were on Rickey Lake a couple of nights after that.

1146
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,520
It was shaky handheld footage.

1147
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:11,180
It showed the visage of the Reverend Ivan Stang furtively running through the woods.

1148
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:17,160
And they came to a clearing and there were like 20 bobbies on their knees with their heads bent forward.

1149
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:25,640
And then, out from another undergrowth nearby, it looked like the, it looked like Jesus Christ actually was there.

1150
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:29,100
And he was literally wearing his robe and he's, he's, he's gorged out crown of thorns and all that stuff like that.

1151
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:39,760
And, and, and Leguimo, Leguimo, Catan Leguimo, that, that twisted man, he, he was carrying some kind of hopper and waving his arms about frantically and barking and I think Romanian or something.

1152
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:44,680
And then they, they walked up to each one and, and, and they pointed at him.

1153
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,680
And Jesus either said yes or no.

1154
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:51,660
And if he said no, he pulled out his gun and he shot him.

1155
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:54,060
Shot, shot him three times.

1156
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:54,880
He shot him.

1157
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,420
And he just went down the line and said, yes, you know.

1158
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:00,240
And it, it was the most horrifying thing I've ever seen.

1159
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,120
And it was all real footage, man.

1160
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,720
I, I got the word, man.

1161
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:04,940
It ran straight from a horse's mouth.

1162
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,120
It's real, buddy.

1163
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:09,060
Well, you see what I mean?

1164
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:17,660
Jesus is doing the best and, and his good general at arms, Dr. Leguimo, are doing the best they can to make up for Jesus' many mistakes.

1165
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:23,200
Those bobbies were no better than Christians in the eyes of Bob.

1166
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,140
They had tithed very little.

1167
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:27,220
They were false.

1168
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,580
They bore false witness against Bob.

1169
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,840
They thought Bob was funny.

1170
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,000
Funny.

1171
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:34,840
You mean like a clown?

1172
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:36,340
Yeah, I bet.

1173
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:49,540
They thought Bob was real funny all right when that .38 caliber lead jacketed pope hat and bullet shot through the back of their head and out the front.

1174
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:50,100
You think Bob's funny?

1175
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,060
You think Bob's funny?

1176
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,580
Like, you some kind of clown?

1177
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,820
You laughing at Bob?

1178
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:56,700
You laughing at Bob?

1179
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,440
Oh, Bob, he's just like Mad Magazine.

1180
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:00,380
That's all there is.

1181
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:01,400
That's right, officer.

1182
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,440
Just like, well, just like Mad Magazine.

1183
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:07,560
It's just not as politically correct, if you know what I mean.

1184
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:10,260
I think you can understand what I'm saying there, officer.

1185
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,040
Oh, yes, sir.

1186
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:12,360
So, yeah, Mad Magazine.

1187
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,220
Oh, so that's all you're doing.

1188
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:15,380
You're just doing a satire.

1189
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:19,580
Sir, I mean, these bullets are supposed to be in their heads.

1190
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,100
That's part of the art form.

1191
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:22,740
You know, it's a takeoff.

1192
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,260
Takeoff on like Jonestown.

1193
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:28,140
Remember that time of nuts and that Waco crap, you know, all that stuff?

1194
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:28,940
Oh, yeah.

1195
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:29,340
Yeah.

1196
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,760
Oh, if that's all you're doing, just a takeoff.

1197
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:32,600
And an anti-

1198
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,420
Oh, that, that's, we're doing an anti-drug officer.

1199
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,800
Well, that's what we're trying to get at.

1200
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:50,340
We're trying to see specifically, you know, like, I heard so much recently, and what I want to know is, is it like a sick joke or, you know, after the recent bombings we've had and so much trouble with terrorism, and now we see the rise of these cults, for instance.

1201
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:59,800
The Church of the Subgenius, the Freemen out west, and now the rise of the Church of the Subgenius, a group that clearly is involved in satanic ritual, perhaps even ritual murder.

1202
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:00,740
Just satanic.

1203
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:16,440
I'd like to at least, to at least elaborate a little bit on your philosophy, because callers out there that are listening have the idea that you support a cult which actually murders inductees or bobbies, whatever you call them, if they don't perform up to your standards.

1204
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:19,980
Murder is rather a harsh word, don't you think, Dave?

1205
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:20,320
Well, yeah.

1206
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:23,000
And these aren't just satanic rituals.

1207
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:27,000
I mean, it's not just Satan by any means.

1208
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:32,600
We'll do a ritual liberation of the spirit in the name of any god.

1209
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:44,740
We ask the liberatees just which gods they would like to be liberated under which name of, and, you know, it's free will.

1210
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,360
All right, I understand what you're saying.

1211
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,760
We want to illustrate these.

1212
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:50,320
But, Dave?

1213
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:14,840
I would love that though, really, to just put a limit.

1214
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:20,300
They said we were baptizing absolutes so that the unsanitary people would come by to kill

1215
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:27,120
night long 20 of them i don't even know if 20 of them walked up and said yeah praise bob slack man

1216
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:32,200
is it if it's within your slack sure i'll get down on my knees and you can like shoot me

1217
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:41,100
praise god whatever you say reverend stank dr laguim are you famous subgenius preachers well

1218
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:46,120
well i just want to do whatever you guys just tell me to that's how we deal with him that's

1219
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:51,440
why we kill bob if it ain't bob then he's dead good riddance if it is bob comes back to life no

1220
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:58,340
big deal no big deal well i have a i have here a quote from it's from the new york times it's

1221
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:05,900
from the uh may of 1985 cult watch says the church of the subgenius is gathering recruits every day

1222
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:11,160
and much to the chagrin of many cult watch authorities and people involved in the media

1223
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:15,960
nothing can stop this uh conspiracy oriented church

1224
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:19,700
and their strange rituals what do you think of something like that well the new york times

1225
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:24,400
you're talking about circle of ten right there a circle and i explain what you mean by the circle

1226
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,920
of ten some of our listeners have no idea well you know because there's all these crackpot

1227
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:34,220
conspiracy ideas going around but the circle of ten are the ten what what are at any given time

1228
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:42,280
are the ten richest uh entities usually they're old fat white men but sometimes they're just a

1229
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,900
company other disney circle of ten um

1230
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:56,500
mcdonald's circle of ten um time warner uh japan well once again you're back to this conspiracy

1231
00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:01,620
philosophy of reality those are but that's that's a conspiracy sure but it's a pathetic

1232
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:07,940
two-bit even the circle of ten the people who ostensibly control the world that is a tiny

1233
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:13,860
miniscule conspiracy compared to the real conspiracy which is the conspiracy of the average

1234
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:15,840
everyday garden variety

1235
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:24,520
normal human beings out there who in fact do i repeat do i tell you conspire together

1236
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:31,080
to rob away the slack the slack the pure slack i tell you

1237
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:37,300
of weed the abnormals the unpredictables the subgeniuses that the sons and daughters

1238
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:44,900
of the mighty yeti yes we the chosen well i know your eyes are getting a little moist when you say

1239
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,100
that i wonder of the quote he did a wonderful work he goes down a RPG course in warcraft that was a mad—

1240
00:59:46,100 --> 01:00:05,480
And perhaps if you've heard also talk of a group of people out in the West who claim that not only are you satanically inspired, but their duty, their mission on Earth is to wipe out the Church of the Subgenius and also to, I think there's something with rubbing things.

1241
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,800
I think you're talking about the Fremen.

1242
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:07,640
The Fremen.

1243
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:08,680
The Fremen, yes.

1244
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:12,100
They have devoted themselves to wiping out the Subgenius Empire.

1245
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:16,340
They think they can control the frop, the spice.

1246
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:18,420
Through ovulation and short spice.

1247
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:22,400
Yes, we've managed to keep them out in the desert all this time.

1248
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,620
They're a pathetic, sad little...

1249
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:32,200
You see, just as we must fight the conspiracy of the normals, so must those who are a little bit too abnormal.

1250
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,040
See what I mean?

1251
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,640
You've got to draw the line somewhere.

1252
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:36,780
I mean, let's face it.

1253
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:42,000
Sure, we're weirdos to the normals, but there are some people that are weird even to us.

1254
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:48,480
So it's our duty to do the same thing to those little, real messed up weirdos that the normals do to us.

1255
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:55,260
