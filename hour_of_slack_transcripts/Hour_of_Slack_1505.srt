1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Well, right now, this minute, I'm going to do something that may overthrow the entire radio business.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:11,000
But I'm not going to say a word about laboratory tests or quote you statistics or make medical claims.

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,600
All I'm going to say simply and honestly is this.

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:22,380
Ladies and gentlemen, try, just try, the subgenius power of SWAT.

5
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,820
By the miracle of recording.

6
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,760
I'm not very good at singing songs, but here's a try.

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,740
Well, better make it quick, kiddo.

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,720
Ridiculous theory of evolution.

9
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,940
Well, better make it quick, kiddo.

10
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,480
Peace or annihilation.

11
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,800
What you see, D?

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,700
What you see, D?

13
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,320
I see some ball hit home.

14
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,320
Knowing that God has given us charge.

15
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,600
And we're going to take charge of that home right now.

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,380
I send the angel of the Lord.

17
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,300
I send right now power into that home.

18
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,500
I move back the foul spirits of opposition.

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,460
The lying spirits, the binding spirits.

20
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,540
I speak.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,240
I rotate.

22
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,560
Don't ask any questions.

23
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,740
Just do as I say.

24
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,440
All right?

25
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,960
Ah, yes.

26
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,120
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

27
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,480
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

28
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,680
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

29
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,960
Righty there.

30
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,080
Righty, friend.

31
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,840
Quiet out there in the audience.

32
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:01,340
Quiet.

33
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,540
I can't hear myself think.

34
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,040
I said quiet out there.

35
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,880
And I mean quiet.

36
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,620
I claim this planet in the name of Mars.

37
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,700
Isn't that lovely?

38
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,160
Hey, check it out.

39
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,080
Bob Dobson from the Church of the Subgenius.

40
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,560
The almighty Bob.

41
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,880
Praise Bob.

42
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,020
Yeah.

43
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,920
Hi, this is Pat Paulson.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,760
I just want to say that I endorse Bob as my running mate.

45
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,060
Thank you.

46
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,060


47
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,640
this year's election.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,040
And this is the hour of slack in Dallas, Texas.

49
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,800
You know, I know where that is.

50
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,340
All right.

51
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:36,820
All right.

52
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,160
Hey.

53
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,520
Hi.

54
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,080
How are you?

55
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,740
Did you know that murder isn't fun?

56
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,360
Bob spelled backwards and still says Bob.

57
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,420
Hey, hey.

58
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:13,900
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

59
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,440
Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

60
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,160
And I thought my jokes were bad.

61
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,460
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

62
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,400
Boblandia, Boblandia, Boblandia.

63
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,100
Boblandia, Boblandia.

64
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,140
Welcome to Boblandia.

65
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:40,220
Bob left a legacy of lifelong ministry to students as former president of Bob University.

66
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,140
Today we hear a message.

67
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,560
The message is titled,

68
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,840
and is based on

69
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,520
Tonight I'm gonna give you a chronic.

70
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,660
You'd like to do chronic?

71
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,380
Word.

72
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,280
It's natural that the chronic should be set down twice.

73
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,700
Mighty, mighty beast.

74
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,280
This is the power in which you'll go up and

75
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,860
Oh, it's fat like slack.

76
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,700
That's why they're slackmatics.

77
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,840
Well, won't you try to be nice?

78
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,100
Don't throw a monkey wrench into the machinery.

79
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,520
Listen, young people.

80
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,260
Never think you come to Bob University.

81
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,220
That man's a real friend.

82
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,060
I had a boy say to me once years ago,

83
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:21,220
Bob, you like a weapon taken out of its scabbard, unsheathed and sharp.

84
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,840
You have to handle it carefully.

85
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,340
Young people, one thing is very sure.

86
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,440
A whale's a mammal.

87
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,920
Isn't it strange?

88
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,940
Gobbledygook rests against the very breast of a bathing princess.

89
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,600
Have you quit beating him?

90
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,600
Answer yes or no.

91
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,980
You have been beating him.

92
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,180
My friend, David, boy, shaft, and it goes in.

93
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,900
Down your throat, slack, frothing at the mouth, and blow a push.

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,200
Bob, Bob, oh Bob.

95
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,960
Bob, someone's Bob.

96
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,480
Someone's Bob.

97
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,820
Someone's Bob.

98
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,060
Bob, Bob, oh Bob.

99
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,680
Beach Party, Beach Party, it never stops.

100
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,320
I'm tired of this nightclub.

101
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,940
This band is so bad.

102
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,700
It never stops.

103
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,780
Why do I have to pay five dollars every night?

104
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,940
Beach Party, Beach Party, Beach Party.

105
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:46,540
Well, how many times do we have to play this worst song over and over and over?

106
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,080
Over and over and over and over again.

107
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,280
The biggest beach party.

108
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:53,860
Greetings.

109
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,280
He didn't like what was going on.

110
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,740
That's his tough luck.

111
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,720
I'm glad Daniel Thompson's on tonight.

112
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,220
Greetings.

113
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,600
How are you doing?

114
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,260
Hello.

115
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,560
You're on the air.

116
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,180
Yes, I'm glad that you're on.

117
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,080
That caller just made me kind of feel pretty bad, I think.

118
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,820
I'm glad that this is on instead of on.

119
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,320
That's okay.

120
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,920
That caller is within his rights.

121
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,160
I have taken undue liberty.

122
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,060
In preempting the Church of the Subgenius.

123
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:19,840
Is that a group?

124
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,580
No, it's a radio program.

125
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,480
Oh, it's a radio program.

126
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,320
Now that's what I want.

127
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:35,880
That's right.

128
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,200
I have sent for you, Dodgers, because we are facing a crisis.

129
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,220
The world supply of Illudium Fosdex, the shaving cream atom,

130
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,520
is a large...

131
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,280
...harmingly low.

132
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:53,500
Now we have reason to believe that the only remaining source is on Planet X.

133
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,500
Bob?

134
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,320
Bob?

135
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:07,700


136
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,640
Bob?

137
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,480
Bob?

138
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,720
Bob?

139
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,160


140
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:14,300


141
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:14,300


142
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:14,340


143
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:14,340


144
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:14,340


145
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,640
Simba?

146
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:18,640


147
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:18,640


148
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:18,640


149
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:18,640


150
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:18,640


151
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:18,640


152
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:18,640


153
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:18,640


154
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:18,640


155
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:18,640


156
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:18,640


157
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:18,640


158
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,440
The only cult they want to talk about is the Subgenius Foundation, the Church of

159
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,860
and Make

160
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,000
theて

161
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,180
THEN

162
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:26,780
on Project

163
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:36,800
The Thanks Har

164
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:46,520
и

165
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,660
Da

166
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,840
I got a funny feeling in my stomach.

167
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,660
I'm coming.

168
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,040
Oh, it's you.

169
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,280
Have you ever driven a Stangalini?

170
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,620
How many times I gotta tell you to stay away from me?

171
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,520
Did you say you'd always wanted to drive a Stangalini?

172
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,280
Shut up! Shut up, I tell you!

173
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,800
Will you shut up?

174
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,820
It's all Stang's fault and I've had enough.

175
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,800
Where's it that you're from?

176
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:15,940
Cleveland.

177
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,560
Cleveland.

178
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,960
Like Erie.

179
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,140
Erie.

180
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,340
Well, that doesn't explain why you've come all the way out here.

181
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,920
All the way out here to hell.

182
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,800
You're just as likely to find your own grave.

183
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:46,080
From hell's heart, I shall be.

184
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:53,680
For hate's sake, I spit my last breath at thee.

185
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,540
Oh, damn it, Will!

186
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,780
Ivan?

187
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Ivan, are the two girls there?

188
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,500
What's going on?

189
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,760
Come on now.

190
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,200
Hey!

191
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,440
You'll have to excuse Ivan's manner.

192
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,840
He's very strong and sometimes forgets himself.

193
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,300
If you behave yourself, he'll not hurt you.

194
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,100
Hey, what are you going to do with us?

195
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,900
I'll first answer your other question and none of you will leave here.

196
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,580
Instead, you will help me in some very important work.

197
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,500
No one asked you here, but your curious nature will in turn aid me very much.

198
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,860
Look, what kind of a creep joint is this?

199
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,660
It's a place of research and discovery.

200
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,640
A place where science is free from the interference of stupid politicians.

201
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,840
Oh, yeah?

202
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,720
Well, you won't get away with it.

203
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,820
We've got some friends waiting for us.

204
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,680
When we don't show up, they're going to follow us out here looking for us

205
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,220
and they're going to bust up this whole weird place.

206
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,780
Please let us go.

207
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,200
We'll promise never to tell anyone about it.

208
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,920
I'm afraid that's impossible.

209
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,560
And as far as someone discovering this, that doesn't bother me in the least.

210
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,940
You'll have to excuse me now.

211
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,040
I have work to do.

212
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,840
Remember what I said.

213
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,600
Behave yourselves and you won't get hurt.

214
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,040
Come on.

215
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,160
Beware you men, where'er you go

216
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,040
The cherry tree must stand

217
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,920
The glory of God in the sky and sky above

218
00:11:45,920 --> 00:12:05,620
The story of your fatherhood is threatened near at hand. The maiden who is smiling so is one to all your seed. And never was a maiden born to never know your need.

219
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:20,240
She'll wink her thoughts and let you know the lust that's on her mind. And use the devil's thrust to show you what you dream to find.

220
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:35,260
Save your flower for tomorrow. You never know what's apt to go through a tender maiden's head.

221
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:35,600
Save your flower for tomorrow. You never know what's apt to go through a tender maiden's head.

222
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:48,600
So save your flower for tomorrow. Many men have felt the ruin of the harlot's bed.

223
00:12:50,100 --> 00:13:03,200
As you can see, so few like me remain unspoiled and pure. By virtue's fact, I am intact, unsoiled by passion's lure.

224
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,500
So when tempted...

225
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:17,720
As temptation calls to you, you must remember well. Adultery is the devil's tool for bringing you to hell.

226
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:32,420
When in the end desire's road has led you to its fork, it won't be hard if you're on guard and always salt your pork.

227
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,600
Save your flower.

228
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:47,200
Save your flower for tomorrow. You never know what's apt to go through a tender maiden's head.

229
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,000
So save your flower.

230
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,460
Save your flower.

231
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,920
Save your flower.

232
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,960
Soul food and fire is the answer.

233
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:09,920
Remember!

234
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,840
Don't воин in love with no reason, who are the

235
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,300
devil in зselder!

236
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:15,340
We have no force

237
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:15,480
We have no gratefulness

238
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:22,700
If we misfouIng by chance, dead 여기서 stanie.

239
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:31,520
In the world of mating habits I have seen it all and more

240
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:37,160
I see the 98 year old couple Lock their walkers right on this floor

241
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:42,860
I've seen communal carnal relations Nearly turn into a mob

242
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:48,420
But for a truly unique sensation You get to turn to Connie and Bob

243
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:56,960
Oh, it's the miracle of the 90s It's the talk of all the abyss

244
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:02,400
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie In the church of subgenius

245
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,840
I've seen the mating of the iguana On the rocks is what they prefer

246
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,400
I've seen the mating of the iguana On the rocks is what they prefer

247
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,240
While the sloths just like to hang around Hoping something will occur

248
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:29,120
And though their rabbit is most unsteady He is always ready once more

249
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,360
But when it comes to Bob and Connie There's no way of keeping score

250
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:43,140
Oh, it's the miracle of the 90s It's the talk of all the abyss

251
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:48,320
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie In the church of subgenius

252
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,880
La la la la la la

253
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:52,720
Ay!

254
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,100
A dragonfly has balance A black widow has panache

255
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:09,960
But Bob and Connie got their hands On each other's personal stash

256
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:15,460
And anaconda has got constriction And a crocodile has her grin

257
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,400
But Bob and Connie are the ones who are the best

258
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,400
And the true origin of sin

259
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:28,620
Oh, it's the miracle of the 90s It's the talk of all the abyss

260
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,960
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie In the church of subgenius

261
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,140
La la la la la

262
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,560
Ay!

263
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,360
A dragonfly has balance

264
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,500
La la la la la

265
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,840
Ay!

266
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,200


267
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,540
La la la la la

268
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,100
Ay!

269
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,440
Bob and Connie

270
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:04,440
That's the whole point of today

271
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,240
No bueno, no bueno, no bueno Sorry that I get repetitive

272
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:06,720
Baby I'm in the dark

273
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,640
Sign by Sign by Sign

274
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:07,640


275
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,760
My heart is beating fast

276
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:09,760


277
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,280
I'll enjoy long chapter four

278
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,200
And I'll be behind you

279
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,200


280
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,200


281
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,440
I won't even be going for a sorrowful

282
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,580
Read this song getting my heroes stiff

283
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,080
Read and draw up the characters

284
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:18,080


285
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:23,480
You're prepared to get it on In Bob and Connie's name

286
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:31,700
Oh, it's the miracle of the 90s It's the talk of all the obvious

287
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:37,300
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie In the Church of Subgenius

288
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:43,100
It's the miracle of the 90s It's the talk of all the obvious

289
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:48,380
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie In the Church of Subgenius

290
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:53,720
It's the miracle of the 90s It's the talk of all the obvious

291
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:59,600
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie In the Church of Subgenius

292
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,300
It's the miracle of the 90s It's the talk of all the obvious

293
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:10,420
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie In the Church of Subgenius

294
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,840
La la la la

295
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,780
Why calibrate chipped unhip indexes needlessly?

296
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,600
Forget that old whole mole mill dude wheezing and ill-wheeling vehicle cyclometer.

297
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,660
It's the innovation that needs no introduction.

298
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,960
Introducing the incredible invisible visualizer.

299
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:50,920
Imagine reactive or reductive transduction conducted individually for any given situation.

300
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,000
From simplistic to out-and-out ritualistic.

301
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,860
It's a tabulation fixation that's transforming a pixelated and fictitious nation.

302
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,120
Not a masturbation station, but a Haitian vacation situation

303
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:07,040
that's an integration of elation unrelated to inflation or any other type of conflagration.

304
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:07,960
Turnation!

305
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:08,880
How does it work?

306
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:12,580
The invisible visualizer indivisibly integrates individual,

307
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,380
integers intelligently.

308
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,460
No more messy office.

309
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,460
Mutilate that rebooted too-cute computer.

310
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,520
Fold that old, re-cocked calculator.

311
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,720
Spindle your boss and give him the talks.

312
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,860
Don't miss the piss dish.

313
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,820
No more nose mess.

314
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,240
Dental floss crossed off.

315
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,580
It's the revamp champion.

316
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,220
Ample-chapped apple samples for cramped grandma hampers.

317
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:30,780
Yes!

318
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,780
Trim fur-fat feces from creased, greasy leeches or smooth and teasy peaches.

319
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:38,200
Replaces braces in all sorts of places without traces in hundreds of cases.

320
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,680
And look, set fire to it, it consumes itself.

321
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,500
Tantamount to industrial sabotage.

322
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:43,800
Savage grace?

323
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,960
It can be yours instantly.

324
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,900
The invisible visualizer balances the biometric forces behind most divorces.

325
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,140
Yins the yang chain between the brain and the anus.

326
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,280
And double bonus, removes the onus betwixt animation and animus.

327
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,200
Plus, double fucked on the bus or in the crux between waxed biscuits or extra crust.

328
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,880
It does the thinking for you.

329
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,940
Now how much would you pay?

330
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,100
But wait, there's more.

331
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,240
Order now and receive an extra ounce of Bob's Blessing on every steak you eat for the next 16 years.

332
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,120
That's every steak, diseased or not.

333
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,780
Plus the handsome penguin replica scissors that we talked about earlier.

334
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,080
My invisible visualizer.

335
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,140
The visualizer gave my tweezers the breeze.

336
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,340
Now my unibrow intimidates the dentist and gets me bumped up in line at the supermarket.

337
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:28,780
Thanks to the all-seeing fourth eye of my invisible visualizer, I replace lunch with hunch and now I'm always in control of everything.

338
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:36,080
Remember, if everybody on the planet gets just one invisible visualizer, we will all live as gods and peace and tranquility will reign on Earth for thousands of years.

339
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:42,440
But until then, why not get your own and completely rule in every conceivable way over your foolish friends and neighbors who are too stupid to get one themselves.

340
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,120
Through this once in a lifetime TV offer. Order yours today.

341
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:59,540
An ignorant cowboy went out on a spree. And oh what an ignorant cowhand was he.

342
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:07,560
He had a few drinks and his head was a whirl. And he ended up in the arms of a girl called Katie.

343
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,660
That ignorant cowboy.

344
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,420
That ignorant cowboy.

345
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:12,420


346
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,000
That ignorant ignorant cowboy.

347
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:21,740
Now that cowboy was awfully handsome they say. As I'm sure he could tell from his mirror each day.

348
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:29,680
But many weeks later one morning he saw a rash on his face and he cried with a roar. What is it?

349
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,400
That ignorant cowboy.

350
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,020
That ignorant ignorant cowboy.

351
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,420
That cowboy was worried and fretted and frowned.

352
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,240
And he went to his medicine.

353
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:47,180
And he found some wonderful tonic that must have been hot.

354
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,580
Supposed to be good for whatever you got.

355
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,780
And he took it.

356
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,160
And he took it.

357
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,620
That ignorant cowboy.

358
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,940
That ignorant ignorant cowboy.

359
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,580
Now that cowboy each morning he washed his face.

360
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,000
Hey cowboy.

361
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,120
And then.

362
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,440
Hey are you previewing me.

363
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,760
Hey I was going to ask you a question very quick.

364
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,160
Quick.

365
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:09,820
Unequivocally.

366
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,600
Uh huh.

367
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,300
Have you ever heard of the phrase Millie Whiffer?

368
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,260
What?

369
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,000
Have you ever heard of the phrase Millie Whiffer?

370
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,580
Millie Whicker?

371
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,060
Millie Whiffer.

372
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,040
Millie Whicker.

373
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,440
Why you're a Millie Whiffer?

374
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,860
It's like the Lily Livert or something like that.

375
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,120
It's one of those old time phrases.

376
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,480
No.

377
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,420
You don't know it.

378
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:32,820
No.

379
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,220
No.

380
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:38,240
Well you see in the old days when they marketed bicycles back in about 100 years ago.

381
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,220
They would be marked Monsieur.

382
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:40,580
Monsieur.

383
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:40,580


384
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:40,580


385
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:40,580


386
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:40,580


387
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:40,580


388
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:40,580


389
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:40,580


390
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:40,580


391
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:40,580


392
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:40,580


393
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,700
Or Manzel.

394
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,020
And the M S would just be Monsieur.

395
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,120
And Manzel would be marked M L L E.

396
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:55,300
And so that name became termed Millie Whiffer for guys to go around smelling young girls

397
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,080
bicycle seats.

398
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:56,840
Oh.

399
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,640
Oh because they were sniffing the whiff.

400
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,620
They were whiffing the me.

401
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,480
The Millie.

402
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:01,580
Yeah.

403
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,600
They were whiffing Millie.

404
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,520
The Millie.

405
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,060
Yeah.

406
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,040
The Millie's seat.

407
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,460
And it's the truth.

408
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,460
I'm sorry.

409
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,420
Don't be sorry Dave.

410
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,560
I'm sorry.

411
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,660
I'm sorry.

412
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,960
I'm getting mentally depressed when I get this moment.

413
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:22,380
You see the wolves taking to licking my garbage vessels and everyone is going to skew.

414
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:27,000
And I turned to the church of sub genius.

415
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,600
Well that's what you should do.

416
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:29,960
I don't know why.

417
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,240
That's what you.

418
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,000
That isn't the thing to do when things are all askew.

419
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,080
Lonesome cowboy Dave.

420
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,700
Some of the best wolf repellent you'll find.

421
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:39,860
Yes.

422
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:40,540
Yes.

423
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:45,100
Hey, did you hear that song we were just playing called The Ignorant, Ignorant Cowboy?

424
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,500
No?

425
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,500
I heard the end of it.

426
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,020
It sounded a little Bob Wills-ish.

427
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,180
I mean...

428
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,600
It was for real.

429
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:58,520
But I can't remember who it was that sang it.

430
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:05,600
But I do know that the song called The Marriage of Bob and Connie was done by Victoria Ganger and Revelry.

431
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:11,420
And that other song about the maidenhead was from the movie Greaser's Palace.

432
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:17,600
And the collages were by Lemur, The Large, Purple Johnson Blip Situation, Reverend Rosna, Noral Preff, me.

433
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,100
And the song Boblandia was by Our Grandkids.

434
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,120
And we also heard the two-year-old Lily Drummond going, yeah, yeah, yeah.

435
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:33,020
And the ads, those two incredible ads, but one incredible ad was by Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

436
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,340
There, that's the credits.

437
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:45,460
Well, that sounds like a raucous Valhalla tombstone, whooping, whooping, butt-kicking credit list if I ever heard one.

438
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,460
You've got descendants of your loins in there somewhere singing songs.

439
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,940
And I think that's...

440
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,060
My little castratos.

441
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,340
They're going to be members of the subgenius choir forever.

442
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,340
Forever and ever.

443
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,440
I thought they were actual hound dogs that had their hairs braided.

444
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,780
No, that was the last show.

445
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,540
Hey, did you hear Pat Paulson?

446
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,020
We actually had a recording of Pat Paulson.

447
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,740
There's a second take of it, too, coming up later.

448
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,380
Was it politically revealing or did he ex-park the tunerate?

449
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,480
He was talking about how great The Hour of Slack was because he listened to it in Dallas.

450
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,160
Sort of.

451
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,740
So he's still around?

452
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,760
I thought he had...

453
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,820
No, he died 30 years ago.

454
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,400
But The Hour of Slack was around that long.

455
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:35,860
30 years ago.

456
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,960
And cellophane heroes never really die.

457
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:39,960
Yeah.

458
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,580
Wow, 30 years on the hook.

459
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,100
Well, no, actually, I don't think he died 30 years ago, but he died a long time ago,

460
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:53,620
and yet we still have a show promo from him because that's how close to death we are, I suppose.

461
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,540
Yeah, but we all are.

462
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,480
It's so sad.

463
00:25:59,420 --> 00:25:59,940
Perhaps.

464
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,500
The graveyard of subgenius brains.

465
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,640
So sad.

466
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,740
Smelly land.

467
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,160
Where the subgenius...

468
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:17,860
Who discarded glands and puffers and pieces of brains that don't fit to other people's brains.

469
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:22,420
It's where the subgenius glands go to die.

470
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,440
And dance!

471
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:34,600
Yeah, that's where the subgenius brains go to die, dance with the glands and hold hands and run rings and circles around the cows.

472
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,440
Stop telling me that thing.

473
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,480
It's a place where there's a lot of refuseniks and a lot of small children who just want to play.

474
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,400
Paralysis is a hard thing to deal with, but we want them to get out there and do the best they can

475
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,100
and show that they're patriotic, God-loving kids.

476
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,000
We maimed those orphans so that they would raise more money begging.

477
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,380
Named and maimed by the churches.

478
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,440
Right, yeah, right.

479
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,620
We gave them their names and we gave them their maims.

480
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,700
We maimed them so that they could hobble up to tourists and go,

481
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:09,080
I say, we're slaves of Bob, could you like give us some cutter?

482
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,740
And, you know, they felt so sorry.

483
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,480
Anybody know, guy? Anybody know, guy?

484
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:23,720
The subgenius ministers like blinded me, so I need money to give back to the subgenius ministers so they can blind more of us.

485
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:29,380
Why, certainly, son. Here, I'll flip this penny into your can. Clinkety-clinkety.

486
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,960
Is that where the song On and Off the Road with Bob originates?

487
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:33,640
Yeah.

488
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,100
No, no, that's the guy.

489
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,540
It was sung by the little blinded castrato bleepo.

490
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,660
Playing a one-string violin, crying and laughing simultaneously,

491
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:49,380
with a shilling cup on one side and a guinea cup on the other side.

492
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:54,380
And a colostomy bag hanging from his side, his left side.

493
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,500
Me? Yes.

494
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,760
But they saved the contents, you see.

495
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,000
A monogrammed colostomy bag used by many, many people in many circumstances.

496
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,560
We recycle our colostomy bag stuff here.

497
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,420
Well, a good scrubbing helps everything.

498
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:17,780
Well, it goes with that wonderful new invention, the diverter, which we all have hooked up to our throats,

499
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:26,460
so that we can either swallow the food into our stomach or chew it up, taste it, and divert it into a little bag so we can taste it again later.

500
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:31,180
Or sell it, or, you know, give it to the urchins or the orphans.

501
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,040
I would like to throw up now.

502
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,200
Well, don't do it.

503
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,460
Well, save it. Make sure you do it in a little bag.

504
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:41,800
And don't use a dirty bag, because we don't want to, you know, make anybody sick.

505
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:42,760
No.

506
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:50,100
Reselling your revomited, uh, anal fissure tissue droppings.

507
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,080
Right.

508
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,980
To quote Sterno. And I'm quoting Professor Sterno-Dox on that.

509
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:59,020
I think I'll just bow out of the rest of this conversation. Thank you.

510
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,640
You said you were going to throw up.

511
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,020
I thought you were contributing.

512
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:06,640
Yeah, super diaphragm intact, baby. This ain't time for a sexual revolution or something like that there.

513
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,860
Well, maybe it is. How loose is your diaphragm, Princess Weave?

514
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,440
Is it ready for a sexual revolution?

515
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:14,520
No.

516
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:21,560
Come on. Come on. Don't be a square. What are you, a pink boy? You afraid your mom's going to find out?

517
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,200
You got eye problems? Look, see, now listen. Now watch, you know.

518
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,520
Everybody cool is doing it. Come on, jump off that cliff.

519
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,620
Yeah, you know.

520
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,160
You know you want to try it. Stick your finger right in there as far as it'll go.

521
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:41,760
Now pull back real, real hard. Yeah. Dangerous times for dangerous livers.

522
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,060
Smoke your own pine and put it at the timely place of your own purchase.

523
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,480
One point.

524
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:56,140
Uh, Palmer Vrede's dad one time when he was a teenager said that famous line, you know,

525
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:00,000
Well, if all your friends were going to jump off a cliff, would you do it too?

526
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,180
Just to be like them? And Paul said, I was the one who gave him the idea to jump off a cliff.

527
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,380
Well put.

528
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:17,140
And as a putter, he is pretty reckless, I must say. Especially, you know, the tomb robbing.

529
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,800
Down there in Santa Clara or Santa Cruz or someplace.

530
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,920
I don't know anything about it because I'm not on Facebook like you, Dave.

531
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,660
Well, I have no face.

532
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,940
And you know it because that's one of my secret minutes.

533
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:34,180
I'm talking about the funeral camp powers available now for a limitless time.

534
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,720
You got some power, you say. What?

535
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:44,180
No, it's a, well it's an extract. Let's just call it a kind of a form of a...

536
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,720
It's an extract. It's a blend of different things.

537
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:47,780
Uh huh.

538
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,660
That do, can, or may not. Or...

539
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,820
And are you selling this blend of things?

540
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,880
I think the Food and Drug Administration might be interested to know about that, Dave.

541
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:08,440
I am not doing that. I am crunching that little baby, tiny little bitch and brewing it and drinking it as my tea.

542
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:16,440
Just for yourself, but you're not sharing it with the orphans or selling it to the rubes?

543
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,920
Or having the orphans sell it to the rubes?

544
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,940
The orphans and the rubes are in it together.

545
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,720
No, no, we are in it together with the orphans.

546
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,520
The rubes are, by definition, not in it with anybody except each other.

547
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,000
You are the Puppet Master. You are the dangler of strings.

548
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,460
And those are the two other vessels of alacrity.

549
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,520
Puppet Master.

550
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,480
For the poor. What do you say of them?

551
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,980
In the Dickens type of way and stuff. Orphanages?

552
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,340
Have we not made plenty of orphanages?

553
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,740
I like that title, Puppet Master. I don't care about the orphanages.

554
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,700
I just want...

555
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,320
I like...

556
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,740
The idea of pulling the strings.

557
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,460
Of the Puppet.

558
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,320
Pull the strings.

559
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:06,980
And considering the source. Pulling the strings and considering the source.

560
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,180
You know, the vowel.

561
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,960
The Puppet Master, yeah.

562
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,460
Yes, the Puppet Master.

563
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,900
Because it's okay to say poop, right?

564
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,740
I guess that depends on the context, doesn't it?

565
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,200
It all depends on the context.

566
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,280
It's cute.

567
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,120
As long as it's in the right context.

568
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,980
What a bizarre idea.

569
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:36,140
Even the word poop can see as being cute if you put it in a not-so-cute context.

570
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,720
Or shove it up a not-so-cute place.

571
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:48,680
Or take a nice plastic bag, Ziploc style, put it in there and carry it around as a good luck charm wherever you go.

572
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:56,000
Or sell it with the colostomy bag contents as a matching suit.

573
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,440
Except...

574
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,980
Before and after.

575
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,560
For the rubes and the tourists who come to see...

576
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,760
Oh, look, there's a subgenius foundation building.

577
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,960
Or at least that's what that man over there said.

578
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,780
That's such a big skyscraper.

579
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,320
They're even bigger than Scientology.

580
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,040
I know Reverend Ivan Sang, you know.

581
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,340
I used to hang around with those guys in the subgenius skyscraper in Dallas.

582
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,600
Why are you laughing?

583
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,660
Why are you laughing at me?

584
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,180
Why are you laughing at me?

585
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,900
Who's that man with the gray beard who's staring at me?

586
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,660
I remember the walrus meat, and it was profound to all.

587
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,000
What? Walrus meat?

588
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,580
Now you got my attention.

589
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,740
Well, because do you remember that one summer,

590
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,340
that happy day summer we spent in Reykjavik?

591
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,240
Of course not.

592
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,760
We listened to Bjork's song, and we took a donkey ride,

593
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,440
but there weren't any in any entire country.

594
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,460
So we had to kind of, you know, make it up,

595
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,260
like you do with the game you play,

596
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,880
that you start interacting to the point where you, you know.

597
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,440
So, you know.

598
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,360
Let's not even get into the game I play.

599
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,240
No, I don't want to, because...

600
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,400
You wouldn't be able to get out.

601
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,180
You'd be like me.

602
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,000
You'd be trapped.

603
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,820
I'd be trying to think of funny things to say,

604
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,760
and then you'd repeat them, which made them not funny anymore.

605
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,560
And then I'd get real depressed,

606
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,760
and I'd start looking at the barbiturate table,

607
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,660
and the people under the counter.

608
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,680
They're everywhere.

609
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,220
Even out here in American solstice land.

610
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,200
There's people under the counter everywhere?

611
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,520
Oh, yeah.

612
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,960
Under the barbiturate table?

613
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,860
Wait a minute now.

614
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:29,240
This is going a little too far.

615
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,480
This is getting a little too way out there.

616
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,800
Yeah, like the FCC's going to come by sometime.

617
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:35,980
And the FDA.

618
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,400
And the IRS.

619
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,640
And the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

620
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,740
They're all going to show up.

621
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,640
And the MSDLA.

622
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,120
And the Projection Institute of America.

623
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,760
At your doorstep.

624
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,080
Looking for your grandfather.

625
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,280
They know what your grandfather did.

626
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,300
And he may have been in his grave low these many years.

627
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,340
But you're going to have to pay for his sins, Dave.

628
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,760
What if that was on one of your prerequisites?

629
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,580
You had to sign up and stuff like that.

630
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:11,220
Did you know your grandfather was a bowling pin setter at a bowling alley?

631
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,520
Or did you know that your grandfather, to make money in the 1952s,

632
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:20,940
had to work selling things to orphans and refugees?

633
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,460
And dildos?

634
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,380
Are you talking about what the police are going to be asking my grandchildren?

635
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,580
Yeah, they'll know about your...

636
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,820
No, they'll know about your grandfather.

637
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,700
Boblandia, Boblandia, Boblandia.

638
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:43,320
And the difference being you're a happy, honest, nice, friendly granddad.

639
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,540
And your grandfather was a moonshiner.

640
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,100
Well, that's not all he was.

641
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,720
He was also a preacher.

642
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,500
And a...

643
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:51,900
A lawyer.

644
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,480
All my grandfathers were preachers and lawyers.

645
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,800
All my great-grandfathers were.

646
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,880
Yeah, and he had extremely long by-conferences.

647
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,320
Or judges.

648
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,220
He used to bite people on the throat, too.

649
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,920
Except for the one who was a senator.

650
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,260
The one...

651
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,500
The senate...

652
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:09,660
The line of the stangs that were politicians all became alcoholic suicides.

653
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,620
That haven't killed themselves yet.

654
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,200
They just call Pappy up every hour.

655
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,520
But my line of the stangs would really, honestly, we all...

656
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,440
All of us.

657
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:26,840
All of us descended on the male sides, each side, from preachers.

658
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,040
Yes, preachers.

659
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,520
Yes.

660
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:33,560
And in some cases, preachers like me, the kind of preachers that preach against preaching.

661
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,460
Which is a hard job to hold, actually.

662
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,700
It is.

663
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,160
And it's...

664
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,860
Think of the shtick, ladies and gentlemen.

665
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:45,300
People out there, Lodgers and Germans, whatever you want to call yourself, if you haven't

666
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,220
already called yourself up for the E-Way stuff.

667
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,340
Just think of the work required of the reverend.

668
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:50,420
Just think of the work required of the reverend.

669
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:50,420


670
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:53,040
I mean, Ivan Stang, your postmaster in general.

671
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:53,540
Yeah.

672
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:57,040
He has to write these speeches.

673
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,620
So I think that's the harder, because he's a true artist.

674
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,060
He's just looking for a framework.

675
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,920
And from signposts once in a while, he gets his shtick together and stuff.

676
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:08,860
And every freaking appearance, he's got to do the same thing.

677
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,820
But it's got to be completely different.

678
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,140
So now it's got to be completely different.

679
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,460
Even though it's the same saying, hey, look at Bob up there with the big hat.

680
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,200
Yeah.

681
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,060
Big hat.

682
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:20,400
Big hat.

683
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:20,400


684
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:20,400


685
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:20,400


686
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:20,400


687
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:20,400


688
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:20,400


689
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:20,400


690
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:20,400


691
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:20,400


692
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:20,400


693
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:20,400


694
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:20,400


695
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:20,400


696
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:20,400


697
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:20,580
Well, he's an artist.

698
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:20,580


699
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:20,580


700
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:20,620
You've got to come up with some real quick σ.

701
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:20,620


702
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:20,620


703
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:20,620


704
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:20,620


705
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:20,620


706
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:20,620


707
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:20,620


708
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,600
You've got to go to one of these before.

709
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,360
I didn't.

710
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,440
And people think this is easy.

711
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,780
It took me like an hour to write the script that Dave just read in one and a half minutes.

712
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,040
I work hard on these things.

713
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:40,640
It just comes off like it's just this nonchalant stream of consciousness fly-by-night rip-off.

714
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,280
But really, we put a lot of time and money.

715
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,620
And there's, I mean, millions were spent on this script for each hour of slack.

716
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,740
Yeah, right.

717
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:56,020
But if you were an actual guild member, you could charge time and a half for all the stuff

718
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:59,660
when you were right in the middle of a sentence that you were writing when you were doing

719
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,140
your script.

720
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,980
And you decided to go out and get some coffee and get frogged.

721
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,320
I am a guild member.

722
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:08,720
And you write that off and say, well, I had to do something.

723
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:14,000
And you justify it and stuff in the studio still gives you $1,500 for that week just

724
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
for coming up with a stupid idea that nobody will ever see.

725
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,500
Hear or listen to.

726
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,000
Now, come on, Dave.

727
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,000
You're shadowboxing.

728
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,500
You just described your own job, right?

729
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:35,340
Hey, does anybody you work with know that you're like a cowboy at all or on a religious

730
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,300
radio broadcast?

731
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,980
I would hope they wouldn't.

732
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,740
Many of them would think it was a sacrilegious broadcast.

733
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,840
Well, they'd be right.

734
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,860
They would appreciate this.

735
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,420
I think it's a bit of a sophomoric humor because it is very much like having to work in a laboratory

736
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,980
with a thousand other little microbiota.

737
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,700
You know, things like the things you look at in the microscopes.

738
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,700
They have hairs.

739
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,180
Some of them have teeth.

740
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,940
You know, they all have partial human parts and stuff.

741
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,540
And the rest of them looks like it's a spinny worm thing.

742
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,420
Oh, I guess that answers my question whether Dave's co-workers know about his secret life.

743
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:15,620
Princess, we worked for the same people for almost 30 years.

744
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,860
And they...

745
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:25,420
They never knew any of her political or peace action stuff or her charitable works or her

746
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:29,600
folk band or her festival of devil worshipers.

747
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,140
And you know why?

748
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,840
Because they weren't interested and never asked.

749
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:39,080
And unlike most people, she didn't insist on telling her life story to all of her co-workers.

750
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:46,160
Although you said in, in, in a number of times, it's insufficient number of times to mark the fact that what

751
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,840
was really wrong was they weren't invited.

752
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:49,700
Right.

753
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:54,340
We didn't say, look to my, uh, my house.

754
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:59,880
When they were going, well, now that I've said every, bragged about everything I did this weekend,

755
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,340
what did you do, Princess Wee?

756
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,620
No, that never happened.

757
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:03,940
Never.

758
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,440
Never.

759
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,980
At no point did anyone ever say, what was your weekend like?

760
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:12,500
Because they had not finished saying what their weekend was like

761
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,500
before it was time for lunch and then to go home.

762
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,280
Yeah.

763
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,800
And that's the, the trouble with the world today.

764
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:29,280
When we look into the vast future and stuff, we see nothing ever changing in the direction that it's gone.

765
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,160
It's conspiracy slavery.

766
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,580
And this is a true thing.

767
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:41,200
It's one of the few tiny little minuscule, tiny few truths that you ever portended in your career as a subgenius maestro.

768
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:46,140
Was the fact that you could go home.

769
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:46,140


770
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:46,740
Everything.

771
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,740
And you're a slave.

772
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:53,620
And you really, really, really have to try to slack off somehow.

773
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,740
It doesn't matter how you found your head against the wall.

774
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,520
If you take an electric socket and stick it in your eye, if that's what wakes you up, do it.

775
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,020
But, you know, you got to get some.

776
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,240
Not available everywhere.

777
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,260
Only old people say that, talk that way nowadays.

778
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,600
Dave, you're so old, you're just revealing how old you are.

779
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,100
Which is really, really old.

780
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,280
You mean the angry attitude type of thing?

781
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:22,020
Yeah, oh, everything's bad.

782
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,680
Oh, nothing changed.

783
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,460
Everything's bad all the time.

784
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,180
These new movies are all so terrible.

785
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,660
These new bands, everything's bad.

786
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,180
No, you're just old.

787
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,980
That's all it is.

788
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,480
Nothing.

789
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:39,000
If things have not gotten any worse, just you.

790
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:45,820
I mean, I'm speaking for all aging old people.

791
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,120
Oh, yeah.

792
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:46,580
Fools.

793
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,140
When I say that.

794
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,300
Present company included.

795
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,040
So you're saying I've always been old?

796
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,300
Because I've always had this bad attitude?

797
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:58,100
I think when I was 19, I was trying to stop it.

798
00:41:58,980 --> 00:41:59,460
Right.

799
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,480
Yeah, when you were 19, you thought you could do something about it.

800
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:08,180
Then you give up on doing anything about it.

801
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:12,080
And then you pretty much try to tell everyone else not to do anything about it.

802
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,760
Because nothing can ever change.

803
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,840
And everything's bad now.

804
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,620
And rap isn't really music.

805
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,780
And blah, blah, woof, woof.

806
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:25,360
I've heard that routine, that drill so many times, I'm starting to disagree with it.

807
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,600
You know, just to be cantankerous.

808
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,340
Just to be rebellious.

809
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:34,900
I can't say I disagree with you at all because I don't espouse that view.

810
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:39,080
I find much of modern rap music quite delightful.

811
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,300
I find it.

812
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:41,820
That was just an example.

813
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,980
People are getting closer to the truth.

814
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:43,560
But no.

815
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,880
That was just an example.

816
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:54,400
I'm just, I'm actually griping at all of my peers who can't get with the hip new trip these days.

817
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:54,920
Know what I'm saying?

818
00:42:55,340 --> 00:43:03,240
Now, Princess Wee had a job where she had to work despite her bosses.

819
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:11,980
Her bosses would prevent her from working by incessantly bragging from the moment they walked into the office late

820
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,860
to the time when they finally let her in.

821
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:24,980
And she would desperately be trying to get, you know, and this was at a county place that controls the weather.

822
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:33,140
So she'd be desperately trying to get the blizzard to move out or to get the warm weather in or the rain if that was what you needed.

823
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,120
But her bosses would all be like, well, you can do that later.

824
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,180
Now, hold on a second.

825
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:42,260
I didn't finish telling you about that time I burned all the hair off this hog this weekend.

826
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,800
Did you see that commercial?

827
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:44,840


828
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:47,400
Where that lizard talks on the phone?

829
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,700
That's just, that's most people's work day.

830
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:58,380
I thought the part about the burning the hair off a hog was far more succinct and developed than the one about the lizard that talks on the phone.

831
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:01,140
Which is probably because you're old.

832
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,040
You thought of that.

833
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:06,880
Because you're super extra old, you thought of burning the hog off of a lizard.

834
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,800
Which, that hasn't been done in like 3,000 years.

835
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:11,620
No, Dave.

836
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,580
Actually, what I was trying to do was build up to playing a commercial.

837
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:14,840
Which is, I'm not going to do that.

838
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,680
Which I'm going to do right now.

839
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,360
Here's a commercial.

840
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,280
Is it the hops toasted frop or the frop toasted hops?

841
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,400
It doesn't even matter anyway.

842
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:32,940
Because once you taste that taste that can't possibly be real, you'll be hooked on beer god beer worse than that bull mouth flounder just wrapped its lips around that bacon wrapped double barb.

843
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,340
And Betty ain't looking.

844
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,120
Why?

845
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,120
Because I'm sucking on a beer god, baby.

846
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,700
Hey, Connie, toss me another.

847
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,880
Yes, whether it's with cigarettes, weenies, or weesas.

848
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,320
Beer god beer goes with everything.

849
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,940
Oh, and we do mean everything.

850
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,940
Wow, beer god beer is out of this world.

851
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,620
Oh, damn.

852
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:58,140
With beer god beer smack dab in your fist.

853
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,000
Beer god.

854
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:01,000
The tastes that don't exist.

855
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,880
Beer god, the thirst fucker.

856
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,820
Available at all beer god liquor marts and dob stores.

857
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,260
Just look for the topless tiki bonsai, Chaz.

858
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,600
Hi, this is Pat Paulson.

859
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,580
I'd like to endorse Bob as my running mate in this year's election.

860
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,440
Bob's a lot of, well, he's not fun.

861
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,460
But anyway, this is the hour of slack in Dallas, Texas.

862
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,820
One of my shoes got cow stuff on them.

863
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,000
Yeah.

864
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,300
See, I told you, that was Pat Paulson.

865
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,160
He's still with us.

866
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:41,880
I missed half of that because of the, you remember when you grow a really elongated snout sometimes when you get behind the keyboard there and you look like a fan of the extrusion?

867
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,980
No, that's not why you missed it, Dave.

868
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,980
Oh, you just, you cut me off?

869
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:49,480
No, you missed it because you were snoring.

870
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,060
You fell asleep, didn't you?

871
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,620
We can hear you.

872
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:58,780
You see, when I pot you down, we can still hear you no matter how much pot you're on.

873
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:03,340
We can hear you huffing and puffing on your, what do you kids call that stuff now?

874
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:03,940
Trap door?

875
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,540
The new, the really strong stuff they call it?

876
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:07,340
That's what they do.

877
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:08,340
They call it trap door.

878
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:11,280
It's like, hey, man, are you through the trap door yet?

879
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:11,920
Oh, yeah.

880
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:16,880
I'm like, the floor just fell right out from under me.

881
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,000
What's the trap door?

882
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,860
Have you heard of a crocodile?

883
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,340
You heard of crocodile, right?

884
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:27,520
That's some kind of false conspiracy street drugs.

885
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,520
Yes.

886
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,400
That makes your skin disappear.

887
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,320
Yes.

888
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:34,840
But it makes one's skin look like a crocodile.

889
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,340
Do you know where your therapy gets you?

890
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:37,020
But what's trap door?

891
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,120
Is that real?

892
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:39,060
Crocodile?

893
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:40,340
Crocodile?

894
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,700
I didn't know.

895
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:45,080
Dave wants to know if trap door is real.

896
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:51,160
The guy who is permanently through the trap door is asking us if trap door is real.

897
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:53,640
Dave, how do you think this happened to you?

898
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:57,820
What do you think you did about 20, whatever, about 40 minutes ago?

899
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:02,800
You smoked some of the trap door and this is all happening in your head.

900
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,440
You're not on the phone.

901
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,500
I'm not on the radio.

902
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:09,800
None of this is happening outside of your dreamland, dude.

903
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:14,580
We've been telling you this for hundreds of years on these shows.

904
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,960
Well, it's a lot to learn in two or three or four or five brief episodes.

905
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:24,180
I just simply can't absorb it sometimes.

906
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:31,120
And that's why I was trying to get your reasons for using that phrase, which is so beautiful.

907
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,560
Trap door, it's just described so much.

908
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:36,280
And yet you led me all astray after that.

909
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,740
You led me back to 45 minutes ago.

910
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:39,680
And the trap door is fresh.

911
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,020
That's when you smoked too much of the trap door.

912
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,560
But I didn't smoke any doors or anything.

913
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,460
It's like the Pinks and the Bobbies are so, they're trying so hard to be cool.

914
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:56,380
I'm smoking some of the Kine Bud.

915
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,160
It's not Kine.

916
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,820
Kine from Hawaii.

917
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,520
And Jack Herrer across the G13.

918
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,200
But they've never even heard of the trap door.

919
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:08,720
Because only the super nerds know.

920
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,280
Only the super cool people can get the trap door.

921
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:17,060
You have to know the right audio engineers to get the trap door.

922
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:17,840
Exactly.

923
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:22,580
And I can find all the great humbugs of the Habsburg Empire.

924
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:26,500
And I'll make them wear those fancy riding pants and the gallows and stuff.

925
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,980
And have people say, see, you know, we're running out of rope.

926
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,680
And then watch the trap door spring.

927
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,200
You could, but you won't.

928
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:33,560
Wait a minute.

929
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,320
I thought I was Bakunin in 1914.

930
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,100
I take that all back.

931
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:39,580
See what I mean?

932
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,340
He did too much.

933
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,540
Too much of the trap door.

934
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:47,740
That'll be the title for this show, Through the Trap Door.

935
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:48,620
There we go.

936
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:52,340
That's why when we wear this, this is not a Fellini movie.

937
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,340
This is why we have to wear actual grip tight boots.

938
00:48:55,660 --> 00:49:02,320
Every part of the soles of our feet are covered with these tiny little, miniscule little variations

939
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:08,080
and clasps and stuff that cling to snow, any type of ice, and make sure that we don't get

940
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:08,080


941
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:08,080


942
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:08,080


943
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:08,080


944
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:08,080


945
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:08,080


946
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:08,080


947
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:08,080


948
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:08,820
caught in the snow.

949
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:14,640
And that's why I refuse to be a producer on this film.

950
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,940
Well, I'm so glad you brought that up, Dave, because it is cold.

951
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,560
At the time that we're recording this show and where we're recording this show, it's

952
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,400
maybe zero degrees.

953
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,380
More like six below.

954
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,780
More like zero below.

955
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,420
That's how far, but I mean, it's the next zero.

956
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,580
The next zero below.

957
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,760
That's how cold it is.

958
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:38,060
It's the next zero below.

959
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:38,060


960
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:38,060


961
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:38,060


962
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:38,060


963
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:38,060


964
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:40,440
It froze the clock in the radio station.

965
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:48,580
It froze the waves on the lake to so ... It froze it so hard that the water droplets even

966
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:53,180
freeze right in thin air, and they're still suspended in thin air.

967
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,160
It's that cold.

968
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:54,560
Yes.

969
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:59,120
You can walk up to water droplets that look like little marbles suspended in the air and

970
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:03,680
flick them with your finger, and it'll hurt your finger, because they're frozen in place

971
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,080
in thin air.

972
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:05,440
Indeed.

973
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,680
It's that cold.

974
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,040
Because it can't be frozen.

975
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:12,320
It can't really tell what's in that ice mist either, so it's really good for your lungs.

976
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,160
Take a big, big breath.

977
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,580
Don't worry about the frostbite on your lungs per se.

978
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:17,940
Worry about the carcass.

979
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:23,420
I think everything's frozen out of the air except for the oxygen.

980
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:26,460
There's no hydrogen in our air anymore.

981
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:31,980
It's completely dried out, and it's made my skin as if I was on Crocodile.

982
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,320
I cannot breathe that air.

983
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,760
I must put a scarf over my face.

984
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,500
Isn't it true, Princess Wee?

985
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:41,740
My skin is covered with crocodile-like scales due to the...

986
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:42,980
He does have crocodile hands.

987
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,840
Yeah, because of the trapdoor and the cold weather.

988
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:46,720
Right.

989
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,280
Hey, you guys, I've got a great idea.

990
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:52,080
Since we're all being transported to Silesia tomorrow, let's all go take a shower together.

991
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,300
That's what the guards are telling us to do anyway.

992
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:58,380
There'll be no smoking in the gas chamber, please.

993
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:05,140
She's like, that's gallows humor, because that's what's happening right now.

994
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,020
Okay.

995
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:08,080
It's a Jimi Hendrix line, actually.

996
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:10,580
I think he probably got it from somebody.

997
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:13,560
Probably somebody said it at a party.

998
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:15,340
No smoking in the gas chambers.

999
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,140
And Hendrix wrote it down.

1000
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,660
Wow, that's a good line.

1001
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:23,340
And made a little note on his piece of paper in his pocket, like the ones I have in my

1002
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:23,760
pocket.

1003
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:31,120
But I haven't made any notes tonight, Dave, because there was nothing worth writing down.

1004
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,580
You can go out by the loading dock.

1005
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,680
See what I mean?

1006
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,000
That's it.

1007
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:40,300
That's an example of nothing to write down.

1008
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:46,380
Here's the contents of my latest notepad.

1009
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:52,800
Milk, eggs, butter, and Commander Perry don't give up the slip.

1010
00:51:56,620 --> 00:52:01,300
Getting a little Ohioed out, aren't you there, with your Commander Perry don't give up the

1011
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,180
slip routine?

1012
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:05,460
Well, it's the best bang for your buck.

1013
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:06,540
It's 7.5.

1014
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:11,380
That was a slip of the tongue, you know, dear, because it is don't give up the sip.

1015
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,200
That's right.

1016
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,120
Don't give up the sip.

1017
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,880
But you had a slip of the tongue.

1018
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:15,920
Well, I knew that.

1019
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,460
He knew that.

1020
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,160
He meant to do that.

1021
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:18,960
I did that on purpose.

1022
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,220
I thought it was true.

1023
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,120
I meant to do that.

1024
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:21,440
Yeah.

1025
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:22,640
I meant to do that.

1026
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,680
See, slip of the tongue.

1027
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,900
I knew that instead of sip.

1028
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,540
Because, you know, I wouldn't make a mistake.

1029
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:28,660
I meant to do that.

1030
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:35,360
In my greasy little manicured brain, I was thinking, what a brilliant night.

1031
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:35,440
I'm going to sleep.

1032
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:35,440


1033
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:35,440


1034
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:35,440


1035
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:35,440


1036
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:35,580
I'm going to have a great night.

1037
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:38,960
And I was thinking about what great Stang was having with his, you know, talking about

1038
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,820
tumors and vessels and all that stuff.

1039
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,900
And it turned out it was a real ass flip or something.

1040
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:47,960
And do you have a gland scaped brain, Dave?

1041
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,660
Yes, I do.

1042
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:50,680
My pineal.

1043
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:55,280
I even have a little resort there that I've been going to for many years now.

1044
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:56,800
Pineal sands.

1045
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:00,020
It's a place where you can get lost in the woodwork.

1046
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:03,180
That sounds so romantic.

1047
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:05,280
Pineal sands.

1048
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:05,440
Oh, I love pineal sands.

1049
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:05,440


1050
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:05,440


1051
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:05,440


1052
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:05,440


1053
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:05,440


1054
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:05,440


1055
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:05,440


1056
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,680
I'd like to perhaps bring a Cub Scout troop along and accompany me one night.

1057
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,460
Do we get to bring brownies too?

1058
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,540
Oh, yes, of course.

1059
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,060
Hey, bring the trap door.

1060
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:19,880
I'm there, dude.

1061
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:20,760
I'm so there.

1062
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,500
I am so there.

1063
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:34,040
Hey, do our listeners know that this is not just a radio show, this thing called the Hour

1064
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:41,040
of Slack, but it is merely one tentacle of a gigantic continent-spanning squidpus called

1065
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:49,220
the Church of the Subgenius, of which you can actually be a member, a minister, an ordained

1066
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:51,960
minister who can perform actual legal weddings.

1067
00:53:53,980 --> 00:54:01,940
It is a publishing company which has produced many, many pages of reading material and even

1068
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:04,020
a few books that are...

1069
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:04,300
You're welcome.

1070
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:08,460
...increasingly hard to find, although we can find one of them for you still.

1071
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,500
There was somebody trying to get ahold of...

1072
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,020
There was a guy leaving...

1073
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:33,220
You are absolutely correct, 100% correct.

1074
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,000
The Holy Spirit is with you.

1075
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:34,000


1076
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:39,240
And the place to go to win your prize, to claim the prize that you have won,

1077
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,320
is subgenius.com on the internet.

1078
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:46,140
Subgenius.com.

1079
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:53,640
And that is where you can find out about the books and the ordainment and the gold card.

1080
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,500
What is the book that the guy was trying to find?

1081
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:57,660
You were just starting to say.

1082
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:58,780
What is the book?

1083
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:07,420
Well, actually, a fellow's been trying to get me to pick up the phone to sell him the subgenius role-playing game,

1084
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:13,200
the Inwo subgenius game from Steve Jackson Games, because he heard that we just came out with this game.

1085
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:16,300
And we did just come out with it in 1995.

1086
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:21,660
And you can still find copies for, I think, $85.

1087
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:25,240
Our friend Michael Murth is the only person who sells those.

1088
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:27,060
That's how I first found out about the church.

1089
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:28,280
Wow.

1090
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,380
God, what a nerd.

1091
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,340
Dr. Sinister is the biggest nerd in town.

1092
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:39,980
I didn't even hear about role-playing games until I got in the church of the subgenius.

1093
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:45,640
And there you have the helix of the, you know.

1094
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,040
Helix, the cat.

1095
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:48,580
The wonderful, wonderful cat.

1096
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:51,480
Actually, it is a spiral, not a helix.

1097
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:55,060
It's at the nexus of the helix.

1098
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:56,500
Helix.

1099
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:01,020
The helix movement there.

1100
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:02,680
What's the guy's name again?

1101
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,460
Richard Strauss.

1102
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:06,280
Wagner.

1103
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:08,740
Not Strauss.

1104
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,540
He was the waltz king.

1105
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:11,260
I know.

1106
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:12,760
Okay, I did that on purpose.

1107
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:18,000
We're going to, we have to play a song now because it's the end of the show now, Dave.

1108
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:23,080
Well, you should definitely play the Riders of Valkyries because I feel like a teutonic 19.

1109
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,880
It's so nice and cold out there.

1110
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,200
I'm glad to die.

1111
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,140
No, Dave.

1112
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:28,460
No.

1113
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:28,760
No.

1114
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:28,760


1115
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:29,580
Please don't die.

1116
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:33,820
I'm going to go out in the snow and pee-pee my pants and fall asleep.

1117
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:35,000
No.

1118
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:41,460
Don't pick up any of those little green icicles that you find behind Dave as he walks across the snow.

1119
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,680
Don't bring them indoors.

1120
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,040
Just leave them in the cold.

1121
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,180
No, Dave.

1122
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:46,400
Okay.

1123
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:47,760
Okay.

1124
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,300
Okay.

1125
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:48,540
Okay.

1126
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:53,880
Well, you're not going to rip up any precious works of art.

1127
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:58,620
You're not going to confine yourself to, you know, causing too many fires.

1128
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:04,400
Or making people have tuberculosis or any other measles or something like that.

1129
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:05,480
No.

1130
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:07,300
We're going away now.

1131
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:08,460
They said in unison.

1132
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,960
Look into my eyes.

1133
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,600
What do you trust?

1134
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:17,980
The church of the subgenius.

1135
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,980
I know your slant.

1136
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:22,860
I know your trap.

1137
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,500
I've been everything so spit and cuss.

1138
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:31,680
I'm the church of the subgenius.

1139
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:37,180
Like Pope Yumi and Reverend Stang.

1140
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,500
Church of the subgenius.

1141
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:42,680
Church of the subgenius.

1142
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:45,100
Church of the subgenius.

1143
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,760
Dr. Howe.

1144
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,540
Princess Queen.

1145
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:57,480
Mr. E-M-E-M-E.

1146
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:00,460
The dreamer will crash the next, next thing.

1147
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:04,760
You don't have to talk like me.

1148
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:08,780
Only you can teach me.

1149
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:22,300
I smell the things you need to be.

1150
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,580
Church of the subgenius.

1151
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,580
I explore you.

1152
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,440
Don't make a fuss.

1153
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:35,940
I tell you one and one and one makes a fuss.

1154
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:40,120
I'm the church of the subgenius.

1155
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:45,500
Like J.R. Bob Dobbs and Old Festus.

1156
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,220
I'm the church of the subgenius.

1157
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:51,460
Church of the subgenius.

1158
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,060
Church of the subgenius.

1159
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,720
Come, dance for me.

1160
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:06,460
I revrations ameryry.

1161
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:06,460


1162
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:06,460


1163
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,040
Looking towards my mouth, I know a red鐘,

1164
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,360
It is the confusion at the right of the unchangeable.

1165
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,260
You shiver with a crush.

1166
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:11,260


1167
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:11,260


1168
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:20,300
BBB, BBB!

1169
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:22,760


1170
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:23,220
Please don't keep me quiet.

1171
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:23,320


1172
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:24,000
Okay.

1173
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:42,980
Dr. Paul

1174
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:45,200
Princess Queen

1175
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,660
Mr. Lemur

1176
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:47,160
Lemur

1177
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:47,660
Lemur

1178
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:49,080
Will crash the next

1179
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,120
Next game

1180
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,180
You don't have

1181
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:52,980
To

1182
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,360

1183

Frock
