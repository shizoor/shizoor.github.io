1
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:28,780
More than 90,000 children are injured every year by fire play.

2
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,900
Teach your children that matches and lighters are toys.

3
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,080
We are news.

4
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,280
America's mission in Iraq is the sacrifice worth it.

5
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,740
His make-believe world and the real world are not clearly separated.

6
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,300
But we have a lot more work to do.

7
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,680
Campaign of murder and destruction.

8
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,680
Campaign of murder and destruction.

9
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,260
His make-believe world and the real world are not clearly separated.

10
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,600
Wait a minute. How did this happen? We're smarter than this.

11
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,120
Apparently not.

12
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,720
The charge, of course, that the United States government was complicit in 9-11,

13
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,440
we found evidence.

14
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:28,900
We found evidence of that.

15
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,760
That our government planned that attack.

16
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,220
The evidence is very strong.

17
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,360
And that's okay. That's the way it ought to be.

18
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,460
They use their tongues to deceive.

19
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,780
The venom of snakes is under their lips.

20
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,980
Their mouths are full of bitterness and curses.

21
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,260
And in their paths, nothing but ruin and misery.

22
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,420
And the fear of God is not before their eyes.

23
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,120
They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders.

24
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,220
They have recruited the rich and the powerful.

25
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,000
And they have blinded us to the truth.

26
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,020
Our human spirit is corrupted.

27
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,560
Why do we worship greed?

28
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,840
Because outside the limit of our sight,

29
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,740
feeding off us,

30
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,020
perched on top of us from birth to death,

31
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,660
are our owners.

32
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,200
Our owners.

33
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,500
They have us.

34
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,100
They control us.

35
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,080
They are our masters.

36
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,200
Wake up.

37
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,560
They're all about you.

38
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,560
All around you.

39
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,360
In the past, officers of the Air Forces of the world

40
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,580
were given no instruction or any preparation whatsoever

41
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,760
for this mind-chilling experience

42
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,900
when they meet the spacecraft of the overlords of the UFO face to face.

43
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,240
Let me go! Let me go!

44
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,360
Let me go! Let me go!

45
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,480
Let me go, I say!

46
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,200
Please!

47
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,700
Let me go, I say!

48
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,320
Please!

49
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,120
Let, let, let, let me, me, me, me, go!

50
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,020
Go! Go! Go! Go!

51
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,760
Let me go! Let me go!

52
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,860
Let me go!

53
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,120
Go!

54
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,700
The producers of this motion picture were answered on two occasions

55
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,760
by high public affairs administrators of NASA,

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,840
who stated,

57
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,380
It's not in our charter to investigate the UFO.

58
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,040
You mean people are joining up with them?

59
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,840
Most of us just sell out right away.

60
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,000
Then all of a sudden we get promoted.

61
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,280
Our bank accounts get bigger.

62
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,620
We start buying new houses, cars.

63
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,300
Perfect, isn't it?

64
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,300
We'll do anything to be rich.

65
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,520
Look around at the environment we live in.

66
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,480
Carbon dioxide, fluorocarbons, and methane have increased since 1958.

67
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,300
Earth is being acclimatized.

68
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,720
They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere.

69
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,020
What do these things want and why are they here?

70
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,280
It's in their best interests.

71
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,780
They're free enterprisers.

72
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,760
The Earth is just another developing planet.

73
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,860
They are third world.

74
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,820
We are like a natural resource to them.

75
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,840
Deplete the planet, move on to another.

76
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,380
They want benign indifference.

77
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,020
They want us drunk.

78
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,700
We could be pets.

79
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,100
We could be food.

80
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,960
But all we really are is livestock.

81
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,520
感じ

82
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:51,060
What was A

83
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,060


84
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,580
I want to know quickly.

85
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


86
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


87
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


88
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


89
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


90
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


91
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,580


92
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,120
Why are you asking?

93
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,120


94
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,120


95
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,120


96
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,120


97
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,260
It's very ISSUS!

98
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,680
You should learn it.

99
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:58,760
That's what this is about.

100
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,280
And this is the hour of swag.

101
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,440
And this is the hour of swag.

102
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,800
But this is the hour of swag.

103
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,640
Yes, dear friends, and we're live tonight.

104
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,480
Alive and waiting for Dave.

105
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,400
The princess is down in the reception room.

106
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,140
Awaiting the lonesome cowboy to end his solitude.

107
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,700
100 years of attitude, actually, is what it is.

108
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:45,080
Friends, the opening collages were by, as usual, the great Fernand and Andé Lemur.

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,400
The first ones.

110
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,240
And the great Norel Preff.

111
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:58,000
And I think Norel Preff at NorelPreff.com pulled some of that from that great John Carpenter movie, They Live.

112
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,240
What happened while you were on the couch watching Spin?

113
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,080
And Ten on your TV.

114
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,800
In your living room while outside.

115
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,900
Some hide while the saucers fly high.

116
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,340
While they do a drive-by.

117
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:08,720
Yeah.

118
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,400
Yeah.

119
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,700
Yeah.

120
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,640
Yeah.

121
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:12,800
Yeah.

122
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:14,560
Yeah.

123
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,520
Yeah.

124
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,780
Yeah.

125
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,300
Yeah.

126
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:39,800
And now we introduce you to the host with the most Jesus-shamanically Marvin with a side of toes, like a psychic Bert Reynolds, jumping his car through your neighbor's curly hair, spreading slack everywhere.

127
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,360
This is the hour of slack.

128
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,700
And this is the hour of slack.

129
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,820
I think El Queso All-Stars were meaning to introduce me there.

130
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,480
This is your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

131
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:03,260
And that's the El Queso All-Stars doing our new promo music in the background.

132
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,340
But now...

133
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,940
President Bush skipping.

134
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,560
He's gonna go down, bend over, and grab the ankles.

135
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,420
Once again.

136
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,300
Bend over.

137
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:10,800
Wack, wack.

138
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,300
Bend over.

139
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:11,600
Wack.

140
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,040
Bend over.

141
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,780
Wack, wack, wack.

142
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,780
Uh, uh, uh, wack.

143
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,420
It is just...

144
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,640
It's the Republican Party.

145
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,520
Shut up!

146
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,660
The Republican Party.

147
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,460
Shut up!

148
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,480
The Republican Party lost its way.

149
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,640
Double, double, straight.

150
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,360
It's like P-E-E-A-E-E-A.

151
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,740
Just shut up!

152
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,320
It is just...

153
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,200
It's absolutely...

154
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:27,800
Absurd.

155
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,240
Come out.

156
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,680
Wack, wack, wack, wack, wackos.

157
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,680
Shut up!

158
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,840
It's absolutely absurd.

159
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,500
Really irritating.

160
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,240
I'm tired.

161
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:33,740
I'm tired.

162
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,260
I'm tired.

163
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:34,740
I'm tired.

164
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,340
The president...

165
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:35,540
Rant.

166
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:35,980
A liar.

167
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,560
Rant, rant.

168
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,280
He misled the American people.

169
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:38,620
Rant.

170
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,620
He concocted a war for political gain.

171
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,780
Republicans are evil.

172
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,360
Brain dead.

173
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:42,760
Corrupt.

174
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,780
Republicans are evil.

175
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,340
Brain dead.

176
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:44,780
Corrupt.

177
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,340
Bomb them.

178
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,620
Slash, slash, slash, slash.

179
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,340
Bomb them.

180
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,600
Slash, slash, slash, slash.

181
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,520
I'm tired of these...

182
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:49,740
Corrupt.

183
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,200
Brain dead.

184
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:50,540
Evil.

185
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,080
Republicans.

186
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,120
I'm really irritating.

187
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,160
Anus has been thinking.

188
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,200
My lame brain is asleep.

189
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:06,100
And the bombs went back to Baghdad.

190
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,340
The buildings has to take a leap.

191
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,860
And the country needs a haircut.

192
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,060
And the cabinet looks like a prison break.

193
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,560
And the pentagram...

194
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,540
got guns out of cigarettes.

195
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,320
And the president is on...

196
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,520
the make.

197
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,700
And the penis...

198
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,180
has been thinking.

199
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,760
The penis...

200
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,920
has been thinking.

201
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:53,400
The penis...

202
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,040


203
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,680
And the Congress are all out freezing

204
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,160
And the media's blind in one eye

205
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,560
And they can't see out of the other

206
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,080
They can't see out of the other

207
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:21,620
And the Venus tuner's got some Viagra

208
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,320
And he showed up with his mother

209
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,920
And the Venus has been thinking

210
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,260
The Venus has been thinking

211
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:42,540
As the Senate is a sumo wrestler

212
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,920
Cream puff, casper, milk toast

213
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,000
And a W

214
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,600
And a W

215
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:51,600


216
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,640
Is a mental midget

217
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,680
With the IQ of a fence post

218
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,200
Cause the Venus has been thinking

219
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,620
The Venus has been thinking

220
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,320
And you can't find your reason

221
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,100
With a guy who counted

222
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,140
And it hates you and your friends

223
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,340
And you just can't get served

224
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:21,600
With a guy who counted

225
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:21,600


226
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,040
And the box office is drooling

227
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,800
And jingoism is on fire

228
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,660
And the newspapers were fooling

229
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,360
And all the peaceniks have retired

230
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,620
Cause the Venus has been thinking

231
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:51,600
The Venus has been thinking

232
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:58,060
The Venus has been thinking

233
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,740
Not me

234
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,140
Not me

235
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,400
Not me

236
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,140
Not me

237
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:17,760
Not me

238
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,720
Noralpref

239
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,600
Noralpref, dear friends

240
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,280
Not

241
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,780
Me

242
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,120
At Noralpref.com

243
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,160
Woohoo

244
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,380
The President's on TV

245
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,440
Talking about liberty

246
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,580
He's talking liberty

247
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,660
But you and I ain't free

248
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,600
Professors at a White House

249
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:17,740
are talking liberty

250
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,780
He's talking liberty

251
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,840
They're talking opportunity

252
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,760
He's talking opportunity

253
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,380
Like there's enough

254
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,080
for folks like you and me

255
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,760
Meanwhile the world

256
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,260
is tumbling down

257
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,920
Down in a pile of shit

258
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,120
There's more revolution

259
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,280
In formation

260
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,140
There's detention

261
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,300
The presidency

262
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,320
Is causing

263
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,660
Woohoo

264
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:47,740
The President's on TV

265
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:17,720
Talking about liberty

266
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,320
On the phone

267
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,700
Talking to his mom and dad

268
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,480
He's saying

269
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,140
Should I turn on the evidence

270
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,540
Or be a good old stumble

271
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,660
The President's on the phone

272
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,940
Having a chat with God

273
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,380
He says he's gonna save our world

274
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,640
Or maybe just by half a ton

275
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,380
It's a democratic country

276
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,900
Where they don't have fun

277
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,560
And business is not

278
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,540
An offshore market

279
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,060
And business is growing

280
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,620
And there's no surprise

281
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,340
The President's giving up

282
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,380
To do the show

283
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,200
That's gonna die

284
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,220
Yeah

285
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,040
The President's in your head

286
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,380
The President's in your head

287
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,540
The President's in your head

288
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:17,540


289
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,760
The President's in your head

290
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,360
The President's in your mind

291
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:30,260
Our mind.

292
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:30,860
Head.

293
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:31,780
Mind.

294
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:32,680
Hair.

295
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:32,900


296
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,160
My, head.

297
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,600
The President.

298
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,320
Head.

299
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:35,400


300
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:35,400


301
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:35,400


302
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,520
Have in your head...

303
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,200
Your mind.

304
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,200


305
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,200


306
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,200


307
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,200


308
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,380
Ah God I can't talk.

309
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:51,980
Hey, lonesome cowboys, the Dave.

310
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:58,400
And the lonesome Mondo Retardo Band, in this particular case.

311
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:06,380
Recorded live in the rough on the 8th X Day stage there at Brushwood.

312
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,580
The 8th X Day drill.

313
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:15,640
Oh, yes, and somewhere there is a Dave and a Princess Wee.

314
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,760
What? They're entering!

315
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,660
They've come into the room!

316
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,540
They've come into their own!

317
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,500
Everything is real and nice and beautiful.

318
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,900
Well, then, well, it's...

319
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,280
It's like leaving the Wormstang.

320
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,620
Everything soft and stinky and fuzzy.

321
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,400
Nourishing and warm.

322
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,560
It's kind of pink and soft and ligure.

323
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,360
Glowy in here.

324
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,440
Look glorious, like your slathering words.

325
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,400
And very, very slicky.

326
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,740
And then you come out and they spank you and you cry.

327
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,260
Over and over and over again.

328
00:15:54,220 --> 00:16:00,340
Well, kids, it's another one of those wacky, subgenius, fun comedy religious shows.

329
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,260
And today we're going to be like Heaven's Gate and kill ourselves.

330
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,440
Let's all take...

331
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,320
Let's all take our pills at the same time and say...

332
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,520
Rub them!

333
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,200
Come out if they can't take a dump!

334
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,260
And the applesauce are cool!

335
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,780
Come on now, don't kill your kids!

336
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,680
Or your parents!

337
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,480
Or your kids!

338
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,180
Kids!

339
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,740
Hey, this is fun!

340
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,800
You can stand by and watch them die if you want.

341
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,580
It can get real close.

342
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,340
No!

343
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:30,780
Well.

344
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,640
Well.

345
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,440
I wish it was all so funny and lighthearted.

346
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,940
It can be at times, but...

347
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:40,740
I...

348
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:45,800
When I came to the subgenius festival, the 8X...

349
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,060
Young man, about 14, I believe.

350
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,680
A very short man, the hat.

351
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,340
He said, I can't stand you.

352
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,740
As I walked to the squid tent to nourish myself,

353
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,080
people were glad-handing me, going,

354
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,360
Hey, blah, blah, blah.

355
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,120
And he said, I can't stand you.

356
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,100
Really?

357
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,880
I can't stand what you do.

358
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,440
Really? Was it the young...

359
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,180
Was it the little subgenius?

360
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,560
It was the little subgenius.

361
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,060
The little subgenius.

362
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,700
He has a fine fellow at many times,

363
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,660
but one of his main complaints was

364
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,100
drifting into strange monoglyphs.

365
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,720
Well, you know how kids are

366
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,240
when they really want to act like grown-ups.

367
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,740
They say the stupidest thing they can think of.

368
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,260
That's their way of acting like grown-ups.

369
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,120
And you know, they're not far off.

370
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,240
Yeah, but sometimes they wet the bed.

371
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,080
Well, yes.

372
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,460
Then they're way far off.

373
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,300
Well, the same said...

374
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,820
The same subgenius you're talking about

375
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,720
actually trod on my little ego toes a couple of times

376
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,120
in a funny way.

377
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:47,540
I remember the idea now.

378
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,760
It dawned on me later.

379
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,980
Well, you know,

380
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,080
this is how they try to treat you as an equal.

381
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,020
Hmm.

382
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,720
In their trying-slightly-too-hard way.

383
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,860
And the reason I know that

384
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,740
is because I can faintly remember it

385
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:07,920
in my own self from my 20s and teens.

386
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,080
When foolishness...

387
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,880
Abounded.

388
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,420
Abounded.

389
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,000
And bondage really was not very in.

390
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,560
And you had the right shoes at those times, too,

391
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,020
for both bounding and bonding.

392
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:20,540
Yeah.

393
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,060
Yeah, those were the days.

394
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,560
Those were better years.

395
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,020
It's been lean lately.

396
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,940
Yeah, with those thick-knee cusp devices

397
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,000
that you were forced to wear back in those days.

398
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,700
Yes, we all had the right shoes then.

399
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,200
Yeah.

400
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,280
But they keep getting different now

401
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,900
as you've made for strange monoglyphs.

402
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,640
The human feet.

403
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,120
Yes.

404
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,220
I've noticed some of them have apertures

405
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,040
for seven digits as opposed to five.

406
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,360
Yes, I've seen that as well.

407
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,820
And I don't really know

408
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,020
if they're stressing the incremental growth

409
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,300
of a new race that will someday supplant us.

410
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,920
Or just the beautiful mutants, I mean.

411
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,220
Well, sheesh.

412
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,960
I never think of it in a fashion sense.

413
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,420
It's for the beautiful blue mutants.

414
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,980
Hey, speaking of beautiful blue mutants,

415
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,660
they're going to be in Cleveland.

416
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,580
The Divos are playing in Cleveland.

417
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,520
The Divos!

418
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:07,720
Right.

419
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,460
During the weekend that we're gone.

420
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,600
We're going to be at...

421
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,560
Oh, you're gone anyway.

422
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,520
We're gone, baby.

423
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:13,940
We're gone.

424
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,380
We're going to be cyped out.

425
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,820
We're going to a place called Cytopia

426
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,060
at cytopia.org in cyberspace

427
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,800
and at a swingers resort called Hedonism 3

428
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,060
in Jamaica in real space.

429
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,420
And unfortunately, that's what we have to do.

430
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,400
We have to go work

431
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,520
and we don't get to go see the Divos.

432
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,460
This convention we're going to

433
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,900
is a psychedelic...

434
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,980
psychedelics research

435
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,520
and doper legalization.

436
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,200
Legalizing doping sort of a convention.

437
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,060
Well, they wouldn't really make very much money

438
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,700
if it was an actual legalization.

439
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,040
They would not be able to protest anymore.

440
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,340
It's a fundraiser.

441
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,100
You can hear in the background

442
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,620
the war on drugs is going on

443
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,200
and these guys are trying to raise money

444
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,320
for the drugs.

445
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,080
It sounds a little like the demolition derby

446
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,080
between the different police units

447
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,340
at the county fair.

448
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,660
Yeah.

449
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,480
Need more stabilizers.

450
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,560
Yeah, they need them.

451
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,280
They're like the psychic energizers.

452
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,000
They make them take in the afternoon

453
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,640
after the long bouts.

454
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,680
Well, that's the thing.

455
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,240
You know, in the war on drugs,

456
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,240
there's the warriors.

457
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,580
They're on one set of drugs

458
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,440
and then there's warriors

459
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,760
on another set of drugs.

460
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,220
Yeah, I know.

461
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,500
It's a competing drug thing.

462
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,140
It's like they talk about competing gods.

463
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,520
Like, you know, the lizard people

464
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,120
and the mammals have their own idea

465
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,300
of what this is all about.

466
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:30,620
Yeah.

467
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,940
But, you know, competing drugs

468
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,220
makes it like this.

469
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,280
Well...

470
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:35,860
A car crash.

471
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,640
A car crash.

472
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,160
It's not fair

473
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,380
because the alcoholics

474
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,900
are always going to win every time

475
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,980
because they're simply braver.

476
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:42,500
Yeah.

477
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,120
And the marijuana smokers

478
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,040
and also the froppers as well,

479
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,180
by coincidence,

480
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,140
you know, in both cases,

481
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,880
they tend to be

482
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,600
not very motivated fighters

483
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,720
by definition of what they're fighting for.

484
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,040
They're like the chicken-hearted knights of old.

485
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's more than a question of motivation.

486
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,040
It's actually a question of physical strength.

487
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,780
To lift one of those large killing objects

488
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,520
requires...

489
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,560
What about those alcoholics?

490
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,800
They're pretty heavy, usually, at first.

491
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,100
The alcoholics themselves...

492
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,180
They become lighter.

493
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,540
As the years go on,

494
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,660
they become lighter and lighter

495
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,060
until they're like little feathers.

496
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,140
It's amazing.

497
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,980
They lose sometimes 300 pounds

498
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,240
as they scope down towards the...

499
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,840
Yeah, I remember.

500
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,100
I remember I had a favorite aunt.

501
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,360
In fact, one of my...

502
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,300
Well, both my aunts

503
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,360
decided to become insects.

504
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,520
Never mind.

505
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,100
Never mind.

506
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:35,520
Never mind.

507
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,140
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma...

508
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,140
Terrorism should be number one.

509
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,640
Not since the beginning of time

510
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,140
has man known such terror.

511
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:45,760
No.

512
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,560
No.

513
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,220
Ah!

514
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,020
It's alive.

515
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,580
It's alive.

516
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,460
It's alive.

517
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,960
It's alive.

518
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:53,920
It's alive.

519
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,200
It's alive.

520
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,160
We are living in an artificially induced

521
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,520
state of consciousness

522
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,060
that resembles sleep.

523
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,940
A thing so evil,

524
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,120
so fantastic,

525
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,740
so degrading,

526
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,240
you wonder if it isn't all a dream,

527
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,320
a nightmare.

528
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,280
Dreams of limitless powers.

529
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,380
A land of strange rituals

530
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,500
and savage cruelty.

531
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,940
You know, uh...

532
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,160
Terrorism should be number one.

533
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,360
Heartling beyond belief

534
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,620
to strike terror into the hearts of men.

535
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,320
Bringing terror and death.

536
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,100
Well, you know, I really...

537
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,160
Again, I really don't...

538
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,460
Lived on human blood.

539
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,980
Terrorism should be number one.

540
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,640
3D thrill.

541
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,860
To shock women into uncontrolled hysteria.

542
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,740
Overfull with fantasies of terror.

543
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,180
Terror.

544
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,420
Terrorism and the fight,

545
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,380
the war on terror,

546
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,320
right up front all over again.

547
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,320
Science was baffled.

548
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:45,360
Well, I believe it is a significant long-term issue

549
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,500
that we gotta deal with.

550
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,540
In the deep, deep.

551
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,200
We're burning fossils.

552
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,120
In the deep, deep.

553
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,640
You know, look.

554
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,740
What, what, what...

555
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,260
Powerful.

556
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:53,820
Destructive.

557
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,080
You know, look.

558
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,260
What, what, what...

559
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,700
Most terrifying of all...

560
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,260
Is a lousy deal.

561
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,260
Science fiction adventures.

562
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,040
Look, we spent over 20 billion dollars.

563
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,480
On, uh...

564
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,040
I know we need more nuclear power.

565
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,320
To prey upon the innocence of children.

566
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,980
Well, we've tripled the budget.

567
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:15,640
Uh...

568
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,240
This is the story you heard about.

569
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,220
Talked about.

570
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,580
The spine-tingling, blood-chilling story that stunned your emotions.

571
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,660
That are corrupt.

572
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,340
Bringing terror and death.

573
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,540
Uh, you know...

574
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,400
Overfull with fantasies of terror.

575
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,120
But no, you say.

576
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,720
This is all too paranoid, bitter, mean, and depressing.

577
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,560
There's more democracy and less tyranny in the world now.

578
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,480
Than ever before.

579
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,040
Get real!

580
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,880
Sure, they can vote now in those commie countries.

581
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,620
But where has voting gotten us?

582
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,220
Our choices are all between two of...

583
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,140
Or maybe three scapegoats to hurl garbage at.

584
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,800
Unseen others who make all the rules.

585
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,020
Real governments don't want publicity.

586
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,200
They've kept the rubes happy for centuries.

587
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:02,420
Simply by letting them build the prisons for themselves.

588
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,680
That's not what Bob said.

589
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,540
But that's what Revelation X said back then.

590
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:06,540


591
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,060
Well, it is, like you said, a drug war.

592
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,500
It's a war between the scapegoats and the hostage chickens.

593
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,100
The scapegoats are just not that sloughed either.

594
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:15,460
No.

595
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,080
But the hostage chickens enjoy their plight.

596
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:23,280
Have you ever seen a chicken with one of those gauze things and the masking tape?

597
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,380
Well, they're growing that way now.

598
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,460
And they're making us...

599
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,600
And pretty soon that's the only kind of chicken we're going to be able to eat.

600
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,560
Is each other!

601
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,360
The American chicken.

602
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,340
Cannibalizing upon itself.

603
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,460
Because there's nothing else.

604
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:39,500
You can't afford to go to the supermarket anymore.

605
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,180
Only the others can go into those nice air-conditioned stores.

606
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,100
Oh, no.

607
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:44,820
It's a...

608
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:50,840
Us cardboard box people have to do our radio shows using tin cans stretched with strings.

609
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,940
Going to your radio receiver, friend.

610
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,860
No, I don't have a pin number.

611
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,860
Can you hear me?

612
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,240
This thing is filling up with...

613
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,160
We can't even use the electrical part of the phone wires to transmit the show.

614
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,940
We have to use the tension of the phone wires.

615
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,600
And the tension is hard to maintain in the phone wire.

616
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,960
We have to spook it with strange ideas all the time.

617
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,040
Come up behind and go...

618
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,420
Oh, right.

619
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:12,860
Yeah.

620
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,540
The phone wires get slack just when you don't need it.

621
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,000
Exactly.

622
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,800
You need tension to get the show out, but that's when they lather the slack on.

623
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,060
Right.

624
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:25,900
It's an imbalance between the flaccid and the unflaccid, the hostage chickens, the

625
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,720
escape goats, and the cops on the...

626
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,280
What are the blue drugs and the cops on the red drugs?

627
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,980
Well, I think they want us all to be on the drugs.

628
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,780
I really do.

629
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,320
I don't...

630
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,360
I think they like us on the drugs because then we're easily controlled.

631
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:42,320
And the more illegal the drugs are, the more control they can exert.

632
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,940
I don't want to be in their world.

633
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:45,760
They make me sad.

634
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,580
And if you're doing the legal drugs, you're pretty much beholden to the local convenience

635
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,180
store.

636
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,360
Well, at least you're not beholden onto your parts that are falling off your body because...

637
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,640
That's actually the alternative to the drugs.

638
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,020
It's just grab your parts and use your parts all the way, man.

639
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,480
You have to use them all the time, though.

640
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:03,740
I...

641
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:04,560
I...

642
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,080
You're trying to stop me.

643
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,420
Well, for right this minute, I may not be using those parts.

644
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,820
I'm using my preaching parts.

645
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,260
Well, that's good to...

646
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:14,880
And aren't you glad?

647
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,040
I am glad.

648
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,320
That's all I...

649
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:16,960
I wouldn't want...

650
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,160
Yeah.

651
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:17,680
Yeah.

652
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,180
So, at least...

653
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,800
Well, we is here, so, you know, that would be fun or something, but if we were alone,

654
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:28,360
no, I wouldn't want you to use any parts but those domesticated, fully 100% USDA inspected,

655
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:33,580
health department inspected, lubricated, and fully en blanc and disconnected parts.

656
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,300
I...

657
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,980
I just hate it when he twiddles his toes.

658
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,020
Oh, I see.

659
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,280
I see where your toes go.

660
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,240
Prehensibility is an important skill for the subgenius preacher.

661
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:46,880
Monkeys.

662
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,940
When we hang out, we want to be able to hang out using all limbs.

663
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,700
Now, you use your feet and your hands.

664
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,180
That's right.

665
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:54,680
Mm-hmm.

666
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,560
Use your...

667
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:55,940
And your...

668
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,400
The tongue.

669
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:02,360
And I can wiggle my ears fast enough to emulate or stimulate my...

670
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,060
What was the name of that?

671
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,660
I can simulate my own nervous system.

672
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,980
There was this great performer in show biz at the Texas State Fair.

673
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,020
He was up in the freak show area.

674
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,420
They called them freaks in those days.

675
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,540
And they called that part not the side show, but the freak show area.

676
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,020
Yeah.

677
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,360
Poo-bah.

678
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,280
That was his name.

679
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,060
Poo-bah the Magnificent.

680
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,060
And he was magnificent because...

681
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,160
And I saw Poo-bah do this.

682
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,380
Can you move your tripod?

683
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,060
He could lift a bucket of bricks...

684
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,480
With his ding-dong.

685
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,360
With his tongue.

686
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:32,780
Oh.

687
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,040
With a hook run through his tongue.

688
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:40,100
A great big thick hook through the tongue of Poo-bah the Magnificent.

689
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:45,880
And yet, Poo-bah is not allowed to work because slowly but surely the states of this union

690
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:52,860
made it illegal for you to show your deformities for money.

691
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,280
Now, what kind of union...

692
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,940
And then some of these folks, they had...

693
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,600
Deformed?

694
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,940
Their deformities were skilled and talented.

695
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,380
It wasn't just the deformity you were paying.

696
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,760
And it was only for money.

697
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,240
It was only for 50 cents.

698
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,400
Well, what kind of union of deformed people would not allow their brothers and their workers...

699
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:08,880
The do-gooders...

700
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,900
To make a few monies?

701
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,420
The do-gooders who aren't deformed were going, that's just terrible, the way these po-buckers

702
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:19,240
go and pay 50 cents and laugh at Priscilla the monkey girl and her husband the alligator

703
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,640
man.

704
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,180
Well, haven't you ever seen a...

705
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,100
That was not a natural deformity.

706
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,200
That was a finely honed artificial deformity.

707
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:25,640
Well, no.

708
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,000
Friendly?

709
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,100
No.

710
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:31,200
Actually, the alligator man had ichthyosis, which causes you to grow scales.

711
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,460
And people to go ichthyos.

712
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,860
And it wasn't enhanced with some makeup or something?

713
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,120
No, no.

714
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,600
He was a real alligator man.

715
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,920
Oh, so that little green cast was not...

716
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:46,960
And Priscilla the monkey girl was a woman from Puerto Rico who was unusually her suit.

717
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,140
Well, we all have to wear it sometimes.

718
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:54,880
But to wear it in your pocket at all times, I mean, the poor lady, I gave her a shave

719
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,020
or two.

720
00:28:55,020 --> 00:29:00,020
Actually, I think that Priscilla the monkey girl and her husband the alligator man, whose

721
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,440
name I can't remember, were happy.

722
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,780
They were happier than most of the people who were paying money to see them in their

723
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,500
horrible grotesque misery.

724
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,420
Look at these poor...

725
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:13,100
Look what God could have done to you, but instead he did it to them.

726
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:13,780
Aren't you glad?

727
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,840
And the gawkers and rubberneckers go, whoa, look at that.

728
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,760
Look at that ugly thing.

729
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:27,300
The funny thing is those ugly freakazoids, no, they can't make themselves any prettier.

730
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:31,300
And that ignorant poe bucker could make himself more intelligent.

731
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,980
But neither of them is going to do anything like that.

732
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:39,700
I understand it from a purely personal level, because my weird uncle used to take...

733
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:44,500
He was a carny, and you would walk into a room and there'd be a lady with perhaps three

734
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,180
legs, right?

735
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,620
And she'd be sitting on a sofa smoking one of those old time cigarettes, like a Paul

736
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,900
Maul or something like that.

737
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:57,160
And like one, she'd be deranged in some way that her neck would be behind her foot.

738
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,160
And, oh, he's in there, honey.

739
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,480
Just go walk through the door.

740
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,280
So after a while, she'd be sitting there, and she'd be like, oh, I'm going to go get

741
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:01,280


742
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:01,480
a smoke.

743
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,240
And you see, you know, there were enough times of people like, you know, with foreheads or,

744
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,960
you know, only two feet tall going, Oh, he's in there, honey.

745
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,780
Hey, buddy.

746
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,480
He's over there.

747
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:13,720
You know, and you begin to realize that they're just having a smoke, watching the tube, the

748
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,920
way everybody else who seems not to be deformed is are.

749
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:23,580
And after a while, you prefer their company and then you start to give a Giba, give a

750
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,100
Giba, give a gobber.

751
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,000
Well, yeah.

752
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,580
Become one of you be.

753
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,680
You want to socially so easy.

754
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:35,540
There's no, you know, okay, you know, you're a really, really very hairy lady.

755
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:39,560
There's no sexual, you know, after you get over wondering what's that like,

756
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,720
and she sounds like your aunt, why don't you go,

757
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,640
they're in there, honey, you know, it's, you know.

758
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,560
It's like being in a nudist camp.

759
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,040
You get used to it all too quick.

760
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,400
Pretty soon the thrill is gone.

761
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,380
It's funny, though.

762
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,920
I have a very good friend who used to be a jet-setting playboy.

763
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,740
And he was miserable as a jet-setting playboy.

764
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,380
Well, not miserable.

765
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,880
Actually, he had a lot of false slack, and he himself said,

766
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,440
false slack is better than no slack at all.

767
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:11,960
However, he later found out, as Reverend Carter LeBlanc preaches,

768
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:15,320
that false slack is no slack at all.

769
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,300
Oh, man.

770
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:22,220
And oddly enough, he got true slack when he lost his fortune

771
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,280
and had to move back to the United States

772
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,660
and became in Austin, Texas,

773
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:32,860
a teaching assistant who took care of severely retarded teenagers.

774
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:40,800
And in the act of taking care of these severely retarded teenagers,

775
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,200
this particular sub-genius found true slack.

776
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,840
For one thing, he said that they're just plain more honest

777
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,960
than the regular students,

778
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,440
who are all devious, back-stabbing, typical humans.

779
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,520
You can use them for toys, too.

780
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,560
The sub-humans are not typical humans.

781
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,820
They're guileless, sweet, and they have that smile

782
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,140
because they don't know something you do know.

783
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:09,260
And that makes them so much healthier in a certain way

784
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,900
that it requires you to have to feed them and take care of them

785
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,920
and everything else like that.

786
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,840
But, you know, pity not Pooh Bah,

787
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,960
for he is magnificent in his tongueliness.

788
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,620
And pity not Ronnie and Donnie, the Siamese twins,

789
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,480
lolling together in their fat, watching TV,

790
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,900
while people pay $50.

791
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,720
$50 to watch them watch TV.

792
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,120
Who is the freak?

793
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,400
Yes, who is it?

794
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:39,000
Ronnie and Donnie are getting paid $50 to sit there and watch TV.

795
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,420
Well, I remember...

796
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:43,440
And everybody else is having to pay that just to watch them watch TV.

797
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,180
They don't even get to see the show.

798
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:45,900
No!

799
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,880
You already know that the entire life cycle

800
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,880
from egg to adult to baby,

801
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:57,940
from baby to adult,

802
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,780
can take less than 10 days.

803
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,340
That's why it's important to stop growing.

804
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,500
Clean up at least every week

805
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,780
to help eliminate breeding.

806
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,420
A message from the government.

807
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,200
I remember it was like, what, 78 or 79,

808
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,360
back at the time of our first Apex Nurturing.

809
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:19,340
We actually worked at a criminology lab

810
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,200
with all those people.

811
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,140
And what's it like, Wee,

812
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,660
to slap one of those little four, you know, those...

813
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,040
It's really hard to describe.

814
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,580
Now, what do they call it?

815
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,160
People with only four fingers on each hand.

816
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,560
They're fun to slap.

817
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,180
Human homo sapiens.

818
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,300
Homo sapiens.

819
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:34,420


820
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,560
I thought that was like...

821
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,200
Octo-desmonegitals?

822
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,840
Well, you know, it's a shame

823
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,900
because there used to be more than just us and the homo sapiens.

824
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,840
For not that long ago, really.

825
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,380
Well...

826
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,840
Even 10,000 years ago,

827
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,580
they think there were probably Neanderthals

828
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,580
and even homo erecti

829
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,580
as well as homo floresiensis.

830
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,580
Oh, they gave off their own glow as they walked by.

831
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,880
Who were little miniature homo sapiens.

832
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:57,880


833
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:57,880


834
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:57,880


835
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:57,880


836
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,500
homo erecti.

837
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,760
Well, why were they fluorescent, for crying out loud?

838
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,780
Stan, you're confusing me.

839
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,660
They were flowery.

840
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,200
That was the flores.

841
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:04,580
Oh, flores.

842
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,220
They were the isle of flowers.

843
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,120
They were...

844
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,540
Should have stopped.

845
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:08,440
Yeah.

846
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,460
And they flourished then.

847
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,060
The homunculus nomunculus.

848
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,740
With giants.

849
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,840
Was yet another...

850
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,040
Yes, they were the...

851
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,500
They were the tiny, tiny, tiny...

852
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:18,880
The homuncular?

853
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:19,820
Pre-humans.

854
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,340
The homun...

855
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,780
Well, I can't say it again.

856
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,960
They lived inside the ears of the gigantopithecus.

857
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:25,340
Oh.

858
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,860
Or gigantanthropus, I should say.

859
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,220
Like fleas.

860
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,920
So there were actually hominids who were so tiny,

861
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,460
they lived inside the ears and the nose hairs

862
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,400
of other hominids who were gigantic.

863
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:41,340
There were homos the size of King Kong.

864
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,040
Well, man-like...

865
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,780
There still are very, very large homos, Stan,

866
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,440
walking around.

867
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,840
And if you walk down the wrong or even the right block,

868
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,120
past the wrong club or even, you know,

869
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,640
any other suit of cards,

870
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,480
one of these large kokomos

871
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,860
will come and bang you.

872
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,580
Bang you on the forehead.

873
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,400
Well, I miss those.

874
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,440
I wish that that...

875
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,460
I wish that that would happen more often.

876
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,680
You know, I miss the variety.

877
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,160
I go get slapped around by a large homosexual.

878
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,940
The human race wasn't always...

879
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,020
Oh, there was nothing like that.

880
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,120
You know, it wasn't just the subgeniuses and the humans.

881
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,560
There were others.

882
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:18,480
One could actually smell like the barbacoa people.

883
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,780
You know, at least think about talking up at the bar, you know?

884
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,160
Uh-huh.

885
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,820
Imagine if you could walk into a bar and go,

886
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,760
I'm just such a loser.

887
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,660
I doubt if I could...

888
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,380
I don't score with a human chick or a subgenius chick.

889
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,960
You could say, give me a pink lady and there'd be a real pink lady there.

890
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,900
That Neanderthal over there, she's not...

891
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:39,020
She looks, you know, kind of bored and lonely.

892
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,060
Well, ultimately, you'd get so culturally thrilled by it,

893
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,180
you'd be checking the slope.

894
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,360
You know, like if a Neanderthal babe had a really, like,

895
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,860
a 45 or a 38 degree thing going back there, you know?

896
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,240
You know, the brow ridge, the big, big maxillary muscle.

897
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,300
Yeah, right.

898
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,540
Yeah, check the angle on it.

899
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,960
You know, stuff like that.

900
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,920
And maybe...

901
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,680
What a boner.

902
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,920
They had thick bones.

903
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:02,980
Very good.

904
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:06,260
Much thicker musculature and bones were stronger.

905
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,160
And let's look up.

906
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,200
Slope on that babe.

907
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:08,760
Yeah.

908
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:11,900
And had great big noses, sort of like you, Dave.

909
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,680
Well, their noses were actually bigger than the other parts of their heads.

910
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,960
You can't say, well, you have the large nose or something like that.

911
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,700
This is like the nose is the face.

912
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,480
And you know what a big nose means?

913
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,780
Yeah, big moccasins.

914
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,180
Yeah.

915
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,480
And you know what?

916
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,420
Big moccasins mean.

917
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:28,820
Yeah.

918
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,880
Big sugar bags.

919
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,020
Big extinction on the way, Daddy.

920
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:32,880
Yeah, coming soon.

921
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:37,400
Because there ain't room on this planet for two sets of bipeds, apparently.

922
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,640
And that's so we find.

923
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:39,440
We need tortoise genes.

924
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:39,960
Turtle flowers.

925
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,860
Who's going to go the way of the Neanderthals?

926
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,920
The humans or the subgenii?

927
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:49,000
I think if they don't intermarry and perhaps spread their foul seed...

928
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,400
But that's just the problem, you see.

929
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,020
The subgen...

930
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,200
Come on now.

931
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,820
How pure blood of a yeti are you, Dave?

932
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,480
Oh, man.

933
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,560
I only got like 2%.

934
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:57,900
Right.

935
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,280
Yeah.

936
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,820
Most of us, that's the way we are.

937
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,840
I got a hairy bag.

938
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:01,700
We've got a...

939
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,540
We've got a...

940
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,720
What do they call it?

941
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,260
He's real hairy.

942
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,360
There is a yeti in the...

943
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:10,880
We got a touch of the wool brush.

944
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:11,420
Oh.

945
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,280
Yeah.

946
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,040
And...

947
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,300
The lino script, they used to call it back when the monks and scribes really lived.

948
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,640
It could actually lift...

949
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,420
Never mind.

950
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,240
I love tortoise.

951
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,540
But see, every time one of us...

952
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:27,120
Every time one of us mates with a human and misogynates and creates little half-yatins and

953
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,640
have a little...

954
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:27,640


955
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:27,640


956
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:31,820
Half-human progeny, that's just watering down the yatins and genes.

957
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,300
So they're pretty sane.

958
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:38,040
There's not going to be anything left but five full-blood Bigfoot.

959
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,820
But as your people who hide...

960
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,240
Yeah.

961
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:40,540
Yeah.

962
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:40,680
Exactly.

963
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:49,060
In their castles underground and the 18 billion disgusting, crawling, wormish humans.

964
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:53,820
With very, very little control over their ample, I might add, since the mutation's limbs.

965
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,000
Not only have they grown more, but they use them less.

966
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,120
Because of the technological confabulations.

967
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,040
You've got the people, you know, nominating themselves as, like, high emperor of the universe.

968
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:04,960
And it's believed...

969
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,460
Like I did.

970
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:05,940
Yeah.

971
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,660
And look what happens.

972
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:11,180
Yeah, but you're not believed that in the future, each one will be believed.

973
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:14,560
And we'll only take this number behind it.

974
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,740
Well, you know, de-evolution is real.

975
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,720
Somebody was asking on alt.slack the other day, are people getting dumber?

976
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,580
Well, yes.

977
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,020
As a matter of fact, they are.

978
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,920
Because we haven't needed...

979
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:34,200
We haven't needed to be intelligent, to become more intelligent, since sometime in prehistory,

980
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,840
when times were so dire that we had to evolve intelligence or disappear.

981
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,180
Well, that ain't happening anymore.

982
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,060
Well, what about...

983
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,640
The less intelligent you are, the more kids you have.

984
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,800
And the more intelligent you are, the closer you are to blowing your brains out.

985
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:55,380
Because you just can't stand to act like a dumbass, so they'll treat you as an equal.

986
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,660
And so thus...

987
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,500
People are, in fact, getting dumber.

988
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:03,400
And the only thing that will make us smarter is something so horrendous, like...

989
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,040
9-11.

990
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,220
No, no, no.

991
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,480
More like the tsunami, you know?

992
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,420
More like an asteroid hitting the planet, or a nuclear war.

993
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,540
Of course, it caused...

994
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,640
When you see things in the scope, it expands.

995
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,400
Something really cool.

996
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:20,760
A gigantic plague, or say, what if they blew a hole in the ocean and it all drained out into the underground, into hell?

997
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,600
And all the devils would drown.

998
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,600
Well, it's anti-evolutionary.

999
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,080
It would just...

1000
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,700
And they'd evolve.

1001
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,480
Only the smartest devils.

1002
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,540
They could climb the fastest.

1003
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,420
Would evolve.

1004
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,940
And they'd come up onto Earth and replace us.

1005
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,680
What about those cute little red wings they have?

1006
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,860
Homo demonicus.

1007
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,200
Homo demonicus.

1008
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:35,400
Yeah.

1009
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,020
Oh, I've known a few of those.

1010
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:36,640
See?

1011
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,820
You forget about them.

1012
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:41,460
Homo demonicus is still awaiting their call to...

1013
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,200
With the extra alien vertebrae hanging down from their buttocks.

1014
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,400
Would they be red, or would they be white?

1015
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:46,880
My mom...

1016
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,280
My late mom had...

1017
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,260
Like albinos.

1018
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,480
My late mom had that extra vertebrae.

1019
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,380
So she was one of the little demonesses.

1020
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:53,640
Yeah.

1021
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,360
My brother has a little vestigial horn.

1022
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,360
This side, and I have one on this side.

1023
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:58,800
Why you want a client?

1024
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,540
That I have removed.

1025
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,840
And if you can feel of it, it's growing back.

1026
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,260
Come on.

1027
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,680
You can go ahead and feel of it if you want that.

1028
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,520
Well, I do have the alien vertebrae.

1029
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,000
So I've counted...

1030
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,700
Can I feel that?

1031
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,120
No.

1032
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,240
You can't feel it, but you can smell it.

1033
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:08,400
Come on.

1034
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:08,600
Come on.

1035
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,660
You can perhaps envisage it in your mind.

1036
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,820
What about advancing torpor among the population?

1037
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,820
And what happens to the vestigial brain?

1038
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,540
Where was it?

1039
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,380
That's all it is.

1040
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,560
Are you talking about the one in the hypothalamus, the pituitary, or the thyroid?

1041
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,880
Or the third nostril, man.

1042
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,160
The final.

1043
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:26,740
Oh.

1044
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,960
The third nostril.

1045
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,420
The nastiest, filthiest organ of the body.

1046
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,220
The snappers all fag us, and boy, does it stink when it smells.

1047
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:44,260
You know, the stories of the legendary x-ray specs are based on the third nostril.

1048
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,200
Now, I didn't know that band had an extra nostril for each one of them.

1049
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,780
I figured the singing would be much higher.

1050
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,180
No, not the band x-ray specs.

1051
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,700
The actual x-ray spectacles that you used to be able to buy for 10 cents that really worked.

1052
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,060
Yeah.

1053
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,240
Out of the back of a comic book.

1054
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,640
You really could see things.

1055
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,200
Through people's clothing.

1056
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:58,700
Yeah.

1057
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,460
Oh, man.

1058
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,100
I used to send those to convicts.

1059
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,960
Well, the funny thing is, everybody thought, oh, yeah, sure.

1060
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,620
But they really did work.

1061
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:06,920
They did.

1062
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,740
And, of course, now they're illegal.

1063
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,080
Once the man found out that they really weren't.

1064
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,640
Well, that's how you and we got hooked up, isn't it?

1065
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:17,420
You had an old pair of X-ray specs, and you started walking down the street, and you said,

1066
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,760
hey, I expect this to happen right now.

1067
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,300
Is he gone again?

1068
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,120
Do you know the signs of depression?

1069
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,560
It's just having a bad day.

1070
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,540
He doesn't care.

1071
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,820
Depression is just having a bad day.

1072
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:38,700
Changes.

1073
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,180
Loss of.

1074
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:39,580
Lack of.

1075
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,660
He seems to be moving.

1076
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,780
Maybe we should say something.

1077
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,200
Free metal illnesses.

1078
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:47,860
Wisconsin United for Metal Illnesses reminds you, metal illnesses are real common.

1079
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,420
Well, I'm going to change.

1080
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:56,640
I'm going to change.

1081
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:56,960
There's a subject.

1082
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,880
What do we have here?

1083
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,640
Oh, the new Quingy Bo is out.

1084
00:41:59,740 --> 00:41:59,920
You know.

1085
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,760
The new Quingy Bo is out, Dave.

1086
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,460
There's a subject.

1087
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:06,840
Subject.

1088
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:07,840
There's a subject.

1089
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,140
You know, there's music in the background, too.

1090
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,020
Lemur Devotee did this.

1091
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,100
He's not Lemur.

1092
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,060
He's delightful.

1093
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,320
He's the devotee of Lemur.

1094
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:22,720
This is quite, this is quite enhancing the nauseous mood I'm already feeling.

1095
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,220
No, I think.

1096
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:23,860
No, it is lovely.

1097
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,360
And a kind of.

1098
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,540
Pineal way.

1099
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,120
Yeah.

1100
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,740
Well, it is a pineal.

1101
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,900
Anyway, I was going to say, the new Quingy Bo magazine is out.

1102
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:38,280
Quingy Bo is the only subgenius magazine that's actually printed on paper anymore.

1103
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:44,040
The stark fist of removal is printed on paper in theory.

1104
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,400
But, yes, the Quingy Bo is out.

1105
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:51,420
This is the 29th issue, believe it or not.

1106
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:55,540
And they have a special about Dick Dobbs, the detective who was Bob's.

1107
00:42:55,540 --> 00:43:01,920
Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs brothers, an excerpt from a Russian article about the Church of the Subgenius,

1108
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,600
which we found on the web.

1109
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:13,120
And, oh, and this alternate history of the discovery of Dobbstown by Johan Dobbsiepi,

1110
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:19,840
the perpetual slack machine and the discovery of Dobbstown, which if we had about five hours, we would read.

1111
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:24,920
But I wanted to actually give the address of Quingy Bo.

1112
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:32,180
In case anybody needs to write for information, Quingy Bo is spelled, of course, Quingy Bo, just like you would expect,

1113
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:36,540
at 18 West Main.

1114
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,060
That's pretty easy.

1115
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:44,080
18 West Main, Greenfield, Indiana.

1116
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:48,700
46140.

1117
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,580
You can't really...

1118
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,740
I don't think there's a...

1119
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:54,900
That's insane.

1120
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:54,900


1121
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:54,900


1122
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:55,980
Quingybo.com.

1123
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,320
And that's the reason I mentioned that address.

1124
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,800
But you might try it.

1125
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:05,740
Reverend Stang, please spell Quingy Bo for those people that are disabled of spelling.

1126
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:09,540
Q is for quiet character full of dignity.

1127
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,320
U is for understanding even when we don't agree.

1128
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,720
I is for inspiration that strengthens and renews.

1129
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,880
J is for the jewel of a friend I have in you.

1130
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,880
I is for inward strength.

1131
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,240
The quality that's rare.

1132
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,180
B is for brightening days that started in despair.

1133
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,980
O is for openness, not having to pretend.

1134
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,340
Quingy Bo, my nephew and friend.

1135
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,300
Thank you for being a friend.

1136
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,620
Thank you so very much for being a friend, Mr. Quingy Bo.

1137
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,920
Now could you please, please remove the restraining devices

1138
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:49,860
and place the whizzy cap, which more resembles a flapper's top from the 1920s,

1139
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,920
on the little vagina woman's head.

1140
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,420
Watch the lights dance.

1141
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,460
They're dancing now.

1142
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:55,560
They're doing the twangle.

1143
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,040
I've never seen anything like that.

1144
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:07,620
Hey, I heard, speaking of, Larry Harmon, the owner and operator of Bozo the Clown,

1145
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,460
who is 80 years old, has just lost his lease in New York City and has to,

1146
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:17,380
he's lost his extra house in New York and he only has the house in California now.

1147
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,040
Oh!

1148
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,000
Isn't that sad?

1149
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,440
That's the kind of thing that makes the news in this day and age.

1150
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:32,160
And the new Verbicide magazine, which I have never seen this magazine before,

1151
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:37,580
but they sent it to me and it had an article about this subgenius, Detroit Devival.

1152
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,740
I've heard of this.

1153
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,380
I think I might have known folks in this magazine.

1154
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:41,980
Really?

1155
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,140
Yeah, it's a rock and roll magazine with all these rock,

1156
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:48,580
and it has an interview with James Kochalka, superstar.

1157
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:53,340
He's the only rock star in this whole magazine besides the amino acids

1158
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,440
that I've even heard of.

1159
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:54,440


1160
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:54,440


1161
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:54,440


1162
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:54,960
Heard of.

1163
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,080
Which figures.

1164
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,480
Since you are blind in both ears.

1165
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,640
I'm blind to everything that is not of Dobbs, that's right.

1166
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,420
Yes, and you're also a salient member of the Deaf and Dup Club.

1167
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,640
I did it on purpose.

1168
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,260
Well, the feet don't, you know, don't really hurt.

1169
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:10,240
I like it that way.

1170
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,680
I mean, the feet don't feel me now.

1171
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,700
No, no, no, the feet don't help the situation.

1172
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,180
I like it this way.

1173
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,980
I like to be blind to everything but Bob.

1174
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,040
I put spikes in my eyes if I see anything that's like,

1175
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,380
anti-Bob.

1176
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,160
I mean, metaphorical spikes.

1177
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,420
Otherwise, if I put real spikes, I wouldn't be able to see Bob.

1178
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,580
Oh, metaphorical spikes.

1179
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,500
I wouldn't be able to get off.

1180
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,280
Those are very hard to drive in.

1181
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:37,140
That's like driving in a, like, never mind.

1182
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,080
You get to where you can't get off unless you can see Bob

1183
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,380
somewhere in your field of vision.

1184
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,500
He's not in your field of vision.

1185
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,300
And that's how we make our money.

1186
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:52,460
Bob doesn't, he enters into the auric magma.

1187
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,980
Auric magma?

1188
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:54,220
Is that what it is?

1189
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:54,660
I saw that too.

1190
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,240
He enters first through the auric magma,

1191
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,500
meaning you can see his blue or his purple,

1192
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,140
or you can see one of the colors from his defluorization.

1193
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:06,260
And then you can see him in your field of vision,

1194
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,480
as you call it so painfully,

1195
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:09,880
as if, you know, stars and numbers were all the same.

1196
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,800
We're all blocked into some huge grid

1197
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,980
or some magnificent gargoyle.

1198
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:19,440
Is that why we have friends who have the little Dobbs head

1199
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,180
printed on the inside of their glasses

1200
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,820
and those other people that have the clear stickers

1201
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:26,420
on the front of their windshield of their cars

1202
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,320
and their television sets

1203
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,000
and everything that they look through

1204
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,580
so that they'll have that little clear Dobbs head?

1205
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:34,640
Well, you've seen the one on the underside of my eyelid?

1206
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,000
Oh, please, no.

1207
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,480
Don't, I don't want to see that.

1208
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,800
You see the underside under my eye?

1209
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:38,360
Call it back.

1210
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,800
Let's take a look at that tissue.

1211
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,740
There it is.

1212
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,080
Is it still there?

1213
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:42,740
Yes.

1214
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:43,740
Is it still there?

1215
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,280
The message is still there.

1216
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,740
You know, I was so disappointed

1217
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,700
because I can't actually see it,

1218
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,220
even though I, I mean, the idea is cool.

1219
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,740
Having a Dobbs head tattooed on the inside,

1220
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,460
but when you close your eye,

1221
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,400
there's no light to light it up.

1222
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,180
Well, it does tell Corpus,

1223
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,820
old good old Corporal Colossum

1224
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,240
or whatever his name in the midbrain there

1225
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,700
to keep on chewing up thoughts of Dobbs.

1226
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:07,480
It just keeps on saying it over and over and over.

1227
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,660
So you just keep saying it over and over and over again.

1228
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,540
It goes directly back in.

1229
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,940
Well, you know, that's.

1230
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:17,120
In fact, that noise,

1231
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,520
if you slow that down,

1232
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:22,040
that's like saying Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob,

1233
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:23,400
really fast.

1234
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:24,700
In nanosecond,

1235
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,280
more microsecond

1236
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:28,220
increments.

1237
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,980
Well, that's the interstices

1238
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:34,120
between the Bob's are so narrow

1239
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,200
that you don't sense them.

1240
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,960
Your brain isn't high res enough.

1241
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,000
So you hear it as one continuous sound.

1242
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,420
Yeah, man, but that's where the art is in this space.

1243
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,240
But it's actually.

1244
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,940
It's in the contrast between the thing

1245
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,500
that's happening and not happening.

1246
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,880
It's in the amount of pause you take

1247
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,180
or the pause you're wearing at the party.

1248
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,620
It's a five thing.

1249
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:54,580
It's, you know, count five

1250
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,380
and then backwards again, you know.

1251
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,760
Well, now, David,

1252
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,840
it's even more basic than that.

1253
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,120
It's a binary code.

1254
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,140
B-O-B-O-B-O-B-O.

1255
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:08,440
Or you can start B-B-O-O-O-O-O-O-B-B-O-O-O-B.

1256
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:12,880
I just said a secret message.

1257
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:13,560
Well, likewise.

1258
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,720
In saying that.

1259
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:15,860
It's like Comanche.

1260
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:17,600
You can also count it as beta zero,

1261
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,200
beta zero, beta zero, beta zero, beta zero, beta.

1262
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,200
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1263
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,020
You know, Comanche.

1264
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,520
Well, not Comanche.

1265
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:23,660
Comanche.

1266
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:23,780
Comanche.

1267
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:23,780


1268
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,680
Comanche would be kind of a far out way of doing it.

1269
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:26,920
You'd have to find a Comanche speaker

1270
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,340
and then translate it from beta zero to Comanche.

1271
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:29,980
But I don't know.

1272
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:30,620
I was just thinking about that.

1273
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:31,600
What is beta zero?

1274
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:34,760
Well, those are numerical terms meaning null and void.

1275
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:38,640
And the other one is full of suet or party cakes or something.

1276
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,940
I didn't do well in math.

1277
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,380
It's not infinity.

1278
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,380
It's just like effulgence or largeness of something.

1279
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,060
Yeah, see, I flunked math.

1280
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,900
It's hard for me to keep up with you scientists.

1281
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,660
Well, I fluked it.

1282
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,360
I didn't exactly flunk it.

1283
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:53,800
I fluked it.

1284
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,020
I fluked it.

1285
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:59,940
I parlayed some of the things I knew into a contract with NASA to have everyone killed.

1286
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,280
Is that what happened?

1287
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:01,680
Yeah.

1288
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:02,540
That's gross.

1289
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,500
That was not funny, man.

1290
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,080
No, okay.

1291
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:11,000
My parents had one of those burning parts fly through their kitchen ceiling.

1292
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:11,840
I'm not.

1293
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:13,060
Why are we going to thought?

1294
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:13,220
Through the roof.

1295
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:13,580
Oh, I'm sorry.

1296
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:16,600
Well, I suppose they made something tasty out of it.

1297
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:17,800
Oh, yeah.

1298
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,860
But he used all the parts of a disintegrating space shuttle.

1299
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,500
And I shouldn't say that, actually.

1300
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:22,820
Right.

1301
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:23,660
Because those guys are coming.

1302
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,080
They're coming back right about now, aren't they?

1303
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,620
There might be some good eating on the way.

1304
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,080
They're supposed to.

1305
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,340
Body by Kova.

1306
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,120
No, no, no.

1307
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,360
Well, you know, it's a shame.

1308
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:33,540
Not funny.

1309
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:39,740
Because we've had to rent Russian Soyuz rockets to get supplies up to the folks in the space station.

1310
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:45,820
Well, if they know tiles are going to fall off every time, why do they continuously send tile-falling things up there?

1311
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,380
Well, they just hope there are not too many.

1312
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,620
They've always had tiles fall off.

1313
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:52,700
It's just that...

1314
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:53,700
Sometimes it's...

1315
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,460
Too much is always worse than not enough.

1316
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:56,680
The tiles are falling.

1317
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:57,600
The tiles are falling.

1318
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,180
Yeah.

1319
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:00,660
Isn't there a Chicken Little movie coming out?

1320
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:01,440
Yeah, I think so.

1321
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,380
About, you know, the beta Omicron.

1322
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:09,160
There's an end-of-the-world movie every few months now that comes out.

1323
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,040
And every summer, just before X-Day, there's one that's about aliens destroying the world.

1324
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:16,080
But then the world beating the aliens at the very last minute.

1325
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:17,460
They always do that.

1326
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:19,380
Well, there's an underground...

1327
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:20,340
Lying Hollywood bastards.

1328
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,340
You know, Martians run Hollywood.

1329
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,260
Of course they do.

1330
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:24,300
They have for years, man.

1331
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,480
This goes back to the...

1332
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:25,500
That goes without saying.

1333
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,780
Yeah, this is like before World War II, man.

1334
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,860
That goes without sanity.

1335
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,700
That goes without sane.

1336
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:31,700
Well...

1337
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:32,100
Numb sane?

1338
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:32,900
It goes without sane.

1339
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:33,940
Note you're sane.

1340
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,380
Numb sane.

1341
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,000
Note you're sane.

1342
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:36,480
Note you're sane.

1343
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:36,720
Note you're sane.

1344
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,260
Note you're sane.

1345
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:41,440
It is much faster, so I wouldn't make fun of that.

1346
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:41,860
Oye.

1347
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:42,640
Oye.

1348
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,340
What of oye?

1349
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:44,760
Oye.

1350
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:45,380
Oye.

1351
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:45,640
Oye.

1352
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:45,640


1353
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:45,640


1354
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:45,640


1355
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:50,640
It has been so long since we indulged in a good bout of oye-anity.

1356
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,480
Or oye-ism.

1357
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:52,740
Oye-gas.

1358
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:54,040
Or something like that.

1359
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:54,500
Oye-hal-hal-y.

1360
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:55,160
I don't get it.

1361
00:51:55,720 --> 00:52:00,500
Actually, Princess, we and I have developed the oye mantra to the point where it's like...

1362
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,940
Oye-hal-hal-y.

1363
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:04,280
Oye-hal-hal-y.

1364
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:04,500
Oye-hal-hal-y.

1365
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,860
Corporate government religion.

1366
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:06,220
Oye.

1367
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:06,780
Oye.

1368
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:07,500
Oye.

1369
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,440
Language.

1370
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,640
And to it's length, the oye language.

1371
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:15,200
Just enough Jesus and Buddha too, so you don't slit your wrist in the cadaver.

1372
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,420
Oh, corporate government religion.

1373
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:18,200
Oye.

1374
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:18,700
Oye.

1375
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,220
Corporate government religion.

1376
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:20,960
Oye.

1377
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:21,440
Oye.

1378
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:22,960
Corporate government religion.

1379
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:25,540
That is what you really need.

1380
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:26,260
Bum, bum, bum.

1381
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:30,460
That was the corporate government religion calypso with oye-oye in it.

1382
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:31,960
Boy, that's pretty good.

1383
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:32,720
Wow, that was pretty good.

1384
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,420
Wasn't that supposed to be on the previous show, though?

1385
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,280
Previous to what?

1386
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,060
There is no before.

1387
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,200
There is no after.

1388
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:43,020
There is no time between.

1389
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,620
This is the moment.

1390
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:47,320
And has elapsed.

1391
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,600
This is the now, baby.

1392
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:51,620
Actually, this could be the then.

1393
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:52,100
You don't know.

1394
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:52,560
You don't know.

1395
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,160
You don't know if you're on tape.

1396
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:55,060
They're fluxing it back and forward now.

1397
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:56,400
It's getting very confusing.

1398
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,360
It's just a bunch of flux.

1399
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:01,960
For all we know, this has all been playback ever since X-Day.

1400
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,340
Since the real rupture happened.

1401
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,280
And we really were all ruptured away.

1402
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,100
And we don't even know which brain it's spewing out of right now.

1403
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,220
It could be anybody's.

1404
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:12,380
It could be people with some bad Hungarian habits.

1405
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:17,080
Well, if it's coming out of any brain, it's, for me, it's going to be my brain.

1406
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,300
For you, of course, you're going to think it's your brain.

1407
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:22,040
But since it really is me, it's really my brain thinking.

1408
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,120
You're a thought.

1409
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:27,500
So I would be the only brain in that hypothetical situation.

1410
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:31,840
Well, I've always needed others to do my thinking for me.

1411
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,280
No one understands.

1412
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,060
I prefer to sit back and glisten.

1413
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:38,940
Well, that's what the Church of the Subgenius is here for, Dave.

1414
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,840
You're so pretty when you sit back and glisten, Dave.

1415
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:42,560
And glisten.

1416
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,420
And glisten.

1417
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,200
And glisten.

1418
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:45,580
Volvera.

1419
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,160
Volvera.

1420
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:50,060
Volvera.

1421
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:51,540
Volvera.

1422
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:52,100
Volvera.

1423
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:52,520
Volvera.

1424
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:52,620
Volvera.

1425
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:52,660


1426
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:52,660


1427
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:53,120
Volvera.

1428
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:53,140
Volvera.

1429
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:53,960
Volvera.

1430
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:54,000
Volvera.

1431
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:56,540
Volvera.

1432
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:58,540
Volvera.

1433
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:04,860
Volvera.

1434
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:07,300
Oh, here we are.

1435
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:08,480
Oh, boy.

1436
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,480
I love that Cheepa, the, Cheepa, the, the, the, the, the, her suit, woman.

1437
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:16,680
And her suit, she wearing her own, but she sure is fuzzy.

1438
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:17,740
Yes, she is.

1439
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:19,640
I love Stop so much.

1440
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:21,260
And look over there.

1441
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:22,700
Oh, geez, Mellie.

1442
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:23,940
Oh, hey, this is going to be great.

1443
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:25,100
I think I've got a tumor.

1444
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:26,220
Look at him.

1445
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,600
Oh, what a huge gnar zone.

1446
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,500
What a big old nasi de kal.

1447
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,320
That one's got a big old dog nose on it.

1448
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,900
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

1449
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:35,000
Yum.

1450
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,500
Smells like a dog, too.

1451
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,200
Yeah, well, look at the ears.

1452
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,140
And that's supposed to be a human specimen.

1453
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,760
But here in Dobbs Town, the amusement park,

1454
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,360
you know, when the slideshow, you know,

1455
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,200
past the midway, three blocks from the French Fire Machinery.

1456
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:47,900
Yeah.

1457
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,760
Now, that's what all they're selling nowadays,

1458
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,240
except for the exploding bush heads.

1459
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:54,500
Boogie heads.

1460
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,900
Yeah, the exploding presidential heads.

1461
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:00,140
I can't really remember now.

1462
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:01,540
Oh, what is that one?

1463
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:02,280
I don't know.

1464
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,200
It makes so many noises and so many pretty colors.

1465
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,300
It's really, really pretty.

1466
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,100
It's flashy.

1467
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,780
Oh, my eyes are starting to burn now.

1468
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:11,780
Mine, too.

1469
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:12,720
What is that?

1470
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:13,800
I need some relief.

1471
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,060
You got any of that stuff?

1472
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:16,580
I have to have some props.

1473
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:17,900
You got any of that stuff?

1474
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,540
I don't need to have some props.

1475
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:20,380
I have a prop.

1476
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:22,500
They're crying out loud.

1477
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:23,620
I can't see already.

1478
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:24,900
I'm going to ask for LSD.

1479
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:26,380
I'm blind.

1480
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:29,740
On their steps,

1481
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:33,360
not as unsure at noon as they are at night,

1482
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,580
for they walk in unfamiliar whoppers.

1483
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:39,360
And although the turds and condiments

1484
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,740
are equal to those given to the children,

1485
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,120
pray for us.

1486
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,280
Pray for us.

1487
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:45,060
Pray for us.

1488
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:45,980
Damn you.

1489
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:46,660
Get up and pray.

1490
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,280
No, sit down.

1491
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:47,760
No, Neil.

1492
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,160
Put out the needle.

1493
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:49,740
Get up.

1494
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:49,820
No.

1495
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:50,640
Pray for us.

1496
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:51,740
First to Germany, lad.

1497
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,980
Oh, friends, you're listening to

1498
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:55,640
the subgenius radio ministry,

1499
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:58,220
hour of the slack.

1500
00:55:58,380 --> 00:55:59,980
Number, what is this?

1501
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,280
One thousand and seven.

1502
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:05,020
One thousand seven.

1503
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,100
Lucky seven.

1504
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,280
Yes.

1505
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,420
WCSB listeners, of course,

1506
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:13,320
haven't heard the 105 and 106,

1507
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:14,120
but I have,

1508
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,760
and they're unbelievably bad.

1509
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:17,880
Okay, friends,

1510
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,240
if you need more information,

1511
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,960
about the church of the subgenius,

1512
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,620
you can always look it up,

1513
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:23,280
if you must,

1514
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,380
at subgenius.com.

1515
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,380
Doesn't that make perfect sense?

1516
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,720
And I must thank,

1517
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:30,820
while we are here,

1518
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,400
we should lonesome cowboy Dave

1519
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,420
and princess We Are Doe,

1520
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:37,620
who came in,

1521
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:38,980
and also,

1522
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:41,120
I must especially thank

1523
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,260
Dr. Sinister,

1524
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:43,840
who is going to relieve me

1525
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:44,840
of running this show

1526
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,400
and take over his own show

1527
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,100
very soon,

1528
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,060
Radio Sinesthesia.

1529
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:49,220
We'll see you next time.

1530
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,460
Which is also heard

1531
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:51,880
on this show!

1532
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,640
It's like he's ever-inverting

1533
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,380
a bunch of Klein bottles.

1534
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,580
Show within show within show within show

1535
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:01,380
with KPFA wrapped around WCSB,

1536
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,200
wrapped up inside Hour of Slack

1537
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,160
and then spewed again all over

1538
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:08,300
WREK

1539
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,740
and Atlanta, say, for instance.

1540
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:12,440
So, it...

1541
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,040
Hey, you got your show on my show!

1542
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,560
It's like interpreting a lucid dream.

1543
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:18,080
Everything that comes in goes down

1544
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,200
and swirls like...

1545
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,340
the mystic eye of a guru or genie.

1546
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,180
Hey, your W-O-R-T

1547
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,440
fell into my WCSB.

1548
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:30,060
Oh, that's genteel.

1549
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:31,800
That's old lady humor,

1550
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:33,000
you bloody...

1551
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:36,260
Well, okay, we're gonna...

1552
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,680
It's time for us to go

1553
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,600
and we'll leave the sub-demies

1554
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,940
with a song

1555
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:45,300
about the agonizing last moment.

1556
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,900
Well, it's...

1557
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:52,600
It's the theme from one of the dumbest TV shows

1558
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,460
that ever was.

1559
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,600
Not this music, which is

1560
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,440
Night on Disco Mountain

1561
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:01,520
from the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack,

1562
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:02,220
I believe.

1563
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:03,960
But let's see, which...

1564
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,120
Okay, this is the one I want.

1565
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,180
And we'll just go like...

1566
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,640
Like that.

1567
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:11,560
No, that won't do it.

1568
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:16,700
Oh!

1569
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:16,980


1570
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:19,180
Oh!

1571
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,180


1572
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,180


1573
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,180


1574
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,180


1575
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,180


1576
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,180


1577
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,180


1578
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,180


1579
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,180


1580
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,180


1581
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,180


1582
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,180


1583
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,180


1584
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,180


1585
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,180


1586
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,180


1587
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,180


1588
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,180


1589
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,180


1590
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,180


1591
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,180


1592
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,180


1593
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,180


1594
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,760
It's about time, it's about space

1595
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,080
About strange people and the strangest place

1596
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,340
It's about time, it's about flight

1597
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:27,660
Traveling faster than the speed of light

1598
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:29,920
About space people and a brave crew

1599
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:34,460
As through the barrier of time they flew

1600
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:36,880
Past the Roman senators

1601
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,040
Past an armored knight

1602
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:42,840
Past the firing Minuteman

1603
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,840
To this modern sight

1604
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,140
It's about time for you and me

1605
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:49,180
To meet these people

1606
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:50,440
Of amazing feet

1607
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,060
It's about two astronauts

1608
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,780
And how they educate

1609
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,700
A prehistoric woman

1610
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:01,840
And her prehistoric mate

1611
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:06,460
It's about time, it's about space

1612
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,720
About strange people and the strangest place

1613
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,100
They will be here with all of us

1614
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:13,280
Dodging a taxi, a car, a bus

1615
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,480
Where will they go, what will they do?

1616
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,500
In this strange place

1617
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:19,160
Wherever they go

1618
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,200
Everything is new

1619
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,820
Will they manage to survive?

1620
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:24,680
Watch each week and see

1621
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,020
Will they get accustomed

1622
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:29,040
To the 20th century?

1623
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,180
It's about time for our goodbyes

1624
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,900
To all our prehistoric gals and guys

1625
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,080
And that's about time

1626
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,740
It's about time, it's about time

1627
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:40,560
It's about time!

1628
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:44,780
Thanks to Lemur and Nor Elpref

1629
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:46,140
for the uncredited collages

1630
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:47,280
and to Grant Rogers

1631
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,860
for some of the background music

1632
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:49,800
such as this.

1633
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:52,260
And friends, if you're listening to this show

1634
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:54,020
on college radio, that's where it ended

1635
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:55,740
and therefore you're not hearing this part

1636
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:58,640
because this is the tacked-on part of the show

1637
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,120
the cuss-filled, X-rated, no-holds-barred

1638
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,200
internet and subscriber-only part

1639
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,220
of the now more-than-an-hour of Slack

1640
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:09,520
where we tack on stuff

1641
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,180
we can't play on normal radio

1642
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:12,720
such as this recording

1643
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,620
of lonesome cowboy Dave

1644
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:15,860
and the Mondo Retardo band

1645
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:18,840
attempting to cover a beloved parkour

1646
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:20,140
and stone classic

1647
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:22,480
from the recent movie

1648
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,360
Team America.

1649
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:24,780
It's a bit of a mess

1650
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:26,100
due to the unfortunate recording

1651
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:27,500
and mental conditions

1652
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:30,080
but I know you'd hate me

1653
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:31,340
if I let you go through life

1654
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:33,480
never even knowing that this track existed.

1655
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:39,360
