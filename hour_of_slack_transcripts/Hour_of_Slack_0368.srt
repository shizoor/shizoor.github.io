1
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,580
Oh, yes, dear friends.

2
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:36,220
And tonight, it's the Atlanta Phenomicon Subgenius D Vival special, just for you.

3
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:19,180
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius.

4
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:34,560
We return now with the Reverend Ivan Stang's final message of resire, panic, and acceptance.

5
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,540
Oh, yes, dear friends, enemies, and everyone in between.

6
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:44,720
You know, a lot of people have asked me, how can I go about accruing slack?

7
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,680
How can I be a nuclear subgenius?

8
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,200
How can devivulation fit in with my rumba lessons?

9
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,000
People want answers, but listen to this now, and maybe you'll learn something.

10
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,560
Why give answers?

11
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,680
When you give answers, that just leads to more questions.

12
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,080
Well, the answers stop here.

13
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,360
I won't fall into their trap.

14
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,880
Who are they?

15
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,280
You know, the you-know-whos.

16
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,320
They'm the people beyond the puppeteer.

17
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,640
All I know is, if you want to get something, you have to give something.

18
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,340
And while there are no true guarantees in life,

19
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,320
I know of a giving you could give

20
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,500
that would help you all on your quest for what Bob is all about.

21
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,260
And that is your vote.

22
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,600
Get out and vote.

23
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,280
Vote Republican.

24
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,260
That's right.

25
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:44,680
Voting the straight Republican ticket enhances your chances to go into trances.

26
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,820
Now I must be going, dear friends.

27
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,220
The limo from limbo is awaiting.

28
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,140
Did you hear that, engine valves?

29
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,000
Am I losing my mind?

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,320
I wonder what?

31
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,020
Did I just hear the Reverend Ivan Stang say to vote Republican?

32
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,020
We must admit frankly and honestly that something is very wrong.

33
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:06,620
Listen.

34
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,000
Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen.

35
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:09,940
Now wait a minute.

36
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,400
I can't change attitude.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,740
Ha ha ha.

38
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:13,700
Yeah.

39
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,380
I didn't apologize for nothing.

40
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,600
That was a little excerpt from the hour of slack.

41
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,780
That was, of course, the Reverend Ivan Stang you heard.

42
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,980
Yeah, that was the Reverend Ivan Stang running at about 80 percent.

43
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:26,980


44
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:26,980


45
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:26,980


46
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:26,980


47
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:26,980


48
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:26,980


49
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:26,980


50
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:26,980


51
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,560
I think it was about 80 percent speed.

52
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,720
I like it better that way.

53
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,700
Yeah, but an hour lasts an hour and ten minutes if you're playing that way.

54
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,100
Oh, that explains it now.

55
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:36,200
Yeah.

56
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,160
Okay.

57
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,540
Tell us tonight at 10 o'clock there's a revival.

58
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,620
I take it there's going to be some preaching going on?

59
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,020
Oh, there's going to be some hellacious preaching.

60
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,400
Ranting and raving and testifying.

61
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500
Spouting and spewing.

62
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,740
It'll make what you just heard sound like some burnout on drugs.

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,340
Flashing and glowing.

64
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,140
Talking on a microphone.

65
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,960
I'll be performing.

66
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:56,960


67
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:56,960


68
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:56,960


69
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:56,960


70
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:56,960


71
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:56,960


72
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:56,960


73
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:56,960


74
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:56,960


75
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,180
I'll be performing my money miracle.

76
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,560
I'll be putting money out of hats.

77
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:02,900
Wow.

78
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,100
I'm going to be burning it.

79
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,060
And there will be an assassination, although we're going to leave the target somewhat of

80
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,420
a mystery until it actually happens.

81
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,780
It could be you, friend.

82
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,420
You could be the 13th apostle.

83
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:23,040
You could be the one that shows up and be that number millionth member that gets slain

84
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,720
and sacrificed.

85
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:24,800
That's right.

86
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,660
We're tired.

87
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,320
Raptured.

88
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,780
We're tired of killing our messiah.

89
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,700
We're going to, I mean, if somebody's going to die, let it be one of the audience members

90
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,100
who just innocently wandered in.

91
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,200
Hey, shut up!

92
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,520
We're supposed to run some videos or something, aren't we?

93
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,120
Yeah.

94
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,680
Huh?

95
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,020
God, this is horrible.

96
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,780
This is the way.

97
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,520
We're just taking up space, you know?

98
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,020
Didn't you read the script for the show, Dr. Drummond?

99
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:12,800
Yeah, but.

100
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,020
It says the videos come first and then the band starts playing.

101
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:16,620
Oh, okay.

102
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,020
All right.

103
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,580
And then the bats are released.

104
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,020
You got that cage ready?

105
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,620
Got your amido putting in the door, I hope.

106
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,060
Somebody's doing some sunglasses.

107
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,300
I'm going to go.

108
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:26,300


109
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:26,300


110
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:26,300


111
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:26,300


112
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:26,300


113
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:26,300


114
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:26,300


115
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:26,300


116
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:26,300


117
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,760
We're going to get some glasses around here that have fingers sticking off the side of

118
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,600
them and .

119
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,100
Hey, you guys, shut up!

120
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,720
Shut up!

121
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,320
Hey!

122
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,660
Are you guys ready with the machinery?

123
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,220
Okay, ready?

124
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,240
Oh, turn the lights off and run.

125
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,480
What if we have the tilting?

126
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,260
Well, I don't want to tell you.

127
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,280
Yeah, let's do it.

128
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,280


129
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,280


130
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,280


131
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,280


132
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,280


133
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,280


134
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,280


135
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,520
No choice but to listen closely to the first time.

136
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,680
Don't tell them.

137
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,200
Ah!

138
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,540
Killed it!

139
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,120
I believe in big knuckles.

140
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,660
Oh, yes, it was ankle-deep.

141
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,800
That's getting meaty.

142
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,260
Hallelujah.

143
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,120
Pretty soon, we're going to be all swimming in it.

144
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,520
Yes, and we have faith.

145
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,180
You just need to use it.

146
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:26,260


147
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:26,260

00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:26,260


152
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,100
You just need to say it to the Lord.

153
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,580
Hallelujah.

154
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,020

JAWS!

194
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,520
Anyway.

I can't see him.

197

Turn up expenses for the party.

Thank you.

200
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,040
Thank you.

they can after we're finished that's right Papa Joe mama interviewed dr.

203
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,300
Kevorkian before he was ever famous he knew that there was gonna be a big

204
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:00,640
market in death machines for pink we're just trying to you know come July 4th

205
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,760
those things are gonna be selling like hotcakes because they're gonna see the

206
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,540
excess arriving and they're gonna know that the lucky ones blessed are the dead

207
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,020
but you won't know anything about I mean this is by by the day before 1998 a

208
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:21,140
subgenius membership card is not gonna still be $20 hundreds of thousands maybe

209
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:25,100
and it could fork you in death machine what's that maybe 150 hundred dollars

210
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,280
you know we're gonna have to make sure that we're gonna have to make sure that

211
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,420
we're gonna have to make sure that they're getting paid for those things

212
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,880
they're gonna have to pay on a blue light special so friends of course joy

213
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:35,100
now while right close by than anyone that's right money won't be before and I

214
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:40,820
know you last years of this century people will be using subgenius pamphlets

215
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,740
instead of ten thousand dollar bills that's another thing how do you feel

216
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:49,760
about you said you said today at the at the panel that you know you said if you

217
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,240
had a penny for every time you saw a stamp of jr. Bob Dobbs you'd be rich now

218
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,620
Now is that causing a problem or?

219
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,040
Well maybe I'm just confusing you.

220
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,660
People are making millions of capitalism on our messiah.

221
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,480
No, we don't allow anybody else to make any money off of it.

222
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,200
It's just that we'd like to make more.

223
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,660
Too much is always better than not enough.

224
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,420
There you go.

225
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,960
Just say Mo is our philosophy.

226
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,160
Mo.

227
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,900
Yeah, what's up with that dance?

228
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,880

ś We're on top of it.

232
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,080
I don't want to go home

233
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,340
I've got to go home

234
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,260
I don't want to go home

235
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:37,320
I don't want to go home

236
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:46,780
I've got to go home

237
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,620

500 colors

243
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,120
flash in with my brain

244
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,520
my gem is the word

245
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,600
gets rid of the pain

246
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,060
My best friend

247
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,020
and recipe

248
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,760
and idioms

249
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,560
are the source

250
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,820

253
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,320
We used toHi-Champ

254
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,560
while we kept

255
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,380
40 marbles

256
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,800
We st mouthed

257
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,580

00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,200
I wanna holler, but the town's too small.

282
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,800
Praise Sister Mary Squared and all the preachers that are here tonight.

283
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,160
And hail Connie.

284
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,720
Hail Connie.

285
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,340
Hail!

286
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,240
Hail!

287
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,340
And praise that damn man, Bob!

288
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,360
I wanna hear you say praise Bob!

289
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,440
Praise Bob!

290
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,880
Praise Bob!

291
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,720
Praise Bob!

292
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,440
Praise Bob!

293
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,460
Oh, come on, and sound off like you got a pair.

294
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,320
Praise Bob!

295
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,500
We had some ovaries out there that time.

296
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,380
Yes, sir.

297
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,900
All right, friends, before we get going,

298
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:32,600
don't you think we ought to lead them in that solemn practice we've tried?

299
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,740
We've opened all the devivals up with since the first one in Little Rock, Arkansas.

300
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,300
If you all could just, some of you have already done this with us many times,

301
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:48,040
but if you could just bow your heads and join us in a...

302
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,440
Thank you, Father.

303
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,800
...solid moment of sacred...

304
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,640
...life!

305
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,840
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

306
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,480
Bob's theme song as played by Sphinx Drummond.

307
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:18,180
All right, friends, we have no idea what's gonna happen in this devival tonight.

308
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,260
We have not a clue, but...

309
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,180
Do you really think we need to know?

310
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:22,940
No!

311
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:23,640
No?

312
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:23,880
No!

313
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,620
The path of least resistance is the best way to go.

314
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,340
Amen.

315
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,700
And it's the easiest way to go, by definition.

316
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:43,060
But yet, you still have to sit there frightened and fluttered away with all this care from the normalcy and your job and...

317
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,220
...hate your life.

318
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,000
...the person's probably sitting next to you that you hate.

319
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,640
So much.

320
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,320
So much.

321
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:55,300
And we'll be preaching plenty of hate, but at first, first I think, let's try something new.

322
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:02,940
I'd like every subgenius here to look at the person next to them, whether they think they look, quote, look like a subgenius or not.

323
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,840
Stick out your hand and say, howdy, partner.

324
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,220
Why the hell not?

325
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,500
Hey, there you go.

326
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,560
They're touching, see?

327
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,980
So wait, there's moments, there's gonna be...

328
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,600
Some of you will get laid tonight!

329
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,540
Woo!

330
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,520
Praise God!

331
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,620
Praise God!

332
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,560
We can't promise that to everybody.

333
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,100
No.

334
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:35,120
But yet, some of the most seemingly disgusting people will in fact somehow get laid tonight.

335
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,680
Thank you.

336
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,280
Thank you.

337
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,240
Because of the words and images that will be implanted in your mind.

338
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,960
The facts and feelings that will be intoned into your brain.

339
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,000
And some of you will get married squared tonight.

340
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,980
Married squared tonight.

341
00:22:53,260 --> 00:23:01,360
At the very end of the night, you better have that, that everyone in this room is going to have a 24-hour short duration marriage.

342
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,380
Whether you want to or not.

343
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:03,740
You want to or not.

344
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,780
So you better think about who your spouse for the next 24 hours is gonna be.

345
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,540
Or it'll be a short duration shotgun wedding.

346
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,940
Because if you don't consummate it, it makes a mockery.

347
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,620
It makes a mockery of the whole institution of marriage.

348
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,000
It does.

349
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,340
It looks it in the eye and laughs boldly into the face.

350
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:27,600
So, but, don't worry, you don't have to marry a person of the opposite sex.

351
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:27,980
No.

352
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,360
Or the desired sex.

353
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,980
Or even a person for that matter.

354
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,620
You can marry anything or anyone you want.

355
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,600
And as many as you need.

356
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,160
Or you can marry your partners.

357
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,200
Some of you may have nothing better to marry than those partners in your pocket.

358
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,600
It doesn't have to be a mammal.

359
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,040
You can marry your back, I guess.

360
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:57,200
You can, many, many have married their car keys, their wallets.

361
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:03,500
Knowing that after the revival event, when the parties start up, it's going to be very

362
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,000
difficult to hang on to those things.

363
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:14,180
But in the meantime, dear friends, we'll try to impart something of what slack means to

364
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:14,520
you.

365
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:14,520


366
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:14,520


367
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,880
And I mean one thing to me and another thing to me.

368
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,100
But dualities are doable.

369
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:28,020
And in the church of the subgenius, we do believe that two and two do equal four, but

370
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,700
a five will get you ten if you know how to work it.

371
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,060
Preach it.

372
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,180
Shut the fuck up.

373
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,180
Now look at the soil.

374
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,660
I am a...

375
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,060
Let's see.

376
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,980
Oh, we finally found the script.

377
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,160
I'm going to show you how to do it.

378
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,160


379
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,160


380
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,160


381
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,160


382
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,160


383
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,720
Let's see what you can do.

384
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:54,540
I said make a corresponds excuse.

385
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,980
Let me pull this off.

386
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,100
Now and take it slow.

387
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,700
Genius craftsmanship.

388
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,800
Risk Sally?

389
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,880
You are right, and I can't deny that.

390
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,160
This is great, but you know what, have you been on New York working for diminArthur fails?

391
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,580
Sister Susie the floozy

392
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,580
Father Joe Mama

393
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,120
All the sweet little forks

394
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,480
Who play their top 40 hits

395
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,560
From the 50s

396
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,600
You're gonna hear about Bob

397
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,780
And you're gonna hear about Bob

398
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,620
From a man

399
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,260
Well, some call him a man

400
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,160
Others just call him

401
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,060
A man who, from Little Rock, Arkansas

402
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,080
A man who loves Bob

403
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,760
More than anyone has ever loved Bob

404
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,640
A man who will do anything

405
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,520
For J.R. Bob Dogs

406
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,180
That man, your friends

407
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,200
For the first time in this city

408
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,340
Sike!

409
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,040
Show your door, hug, and play!

410
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,580
Before I begin my official sermon

411
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,420
I need to point out that in order to understand one of my sermons

412
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,900
You can't just read on the lines

413
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,900
You can't just read between the lines

414
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,380
In order to understand one of my sermons

415
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,040
You've got to read above the lines

416
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,920
And below the lines

417
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,040
And you've got to read between the lines

418
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,520
And to the side of the lines

419
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,720
And across the lines

420
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,300
Anyway, now to begin my official sermon

421
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,820
I'm here to preach tonight about a religion

422
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,020
Ladies and gentlemen

423
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:00,100
And this religion is not just any old religion

424
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,100
Because this religion just happens to be

425
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,620
The world's one and only true religion

426
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,900
Of course, I'm referring to the church

427
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,280
Is there anyone else here

428
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:14,480
Hey Hey

429
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:14,480


430
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:14,480


431
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:14,480


432
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,020
The church of

433
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,920
John

434
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,760
What!!

435
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,960
boxing

436
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,460
boxing

437
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,240
I was born God

438
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,620
The church

439
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,620
Is like a little temple

440
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:41,600
In Peter's Church

441
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,480
Don.

442
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,000
Don.

443
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,000
Don.

444
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:53,620
Don.

445
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:54,620
Don.

446
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,720
Don.

447
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:55,980


448
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:56,460
Don.

449
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:56,600
Don.

450
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:56,780
Don.

451
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:56,940
Don.

452
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:56,940


453
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,180
Don.

454
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:57,280
Don.

455
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,200
Don.

456
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:58,460
Don.

457
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:58,580
Don.

458
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,420
Don.

459
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:05,920
For those who have nothing left, Don smokes Bob and his pipe.

460
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,780
No!

461
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,500
It's a lie!

462
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,660
Hear me out.

463
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,100
At least hear me out.

464
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:18,920
Are alien space monsters dull beyond all possible belief?

465
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,320
Are you abnormal?

466
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,180
Big deal.

467
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,960
Then you're probably just a talentless, whimpering art fag.

468
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,860
It's a lie!

469
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,160
It's a lie!

470
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,580
It's a lie!

471
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,140
Listen to the truth.

472
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
It's a lie!

473
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,380
The normals are right.

474
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,500
You probably are subhuman.

475
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:39,480
It's a lie!

476
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,380
You are subhuman!

477
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:44,780
You are subhuman!

478
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:47,740
The Neo-Genius must have looseness.

479
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:54,400
The Church of Don and his followers exist to make mockery and parody of J.R. Bob Dobbs

480
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,780
and his silly followers the Church of the Sub-Genius.

481
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,580
What?

482
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,580
Traitor!

483
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,420
Heretic!

484
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,840
Listen to the truth for once.

485
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,700
Listen to the truth for once.

486
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,920
You will die! You will burn a thousand deaths!

487
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,120
We exude a mockery and a hatred for all manner of subgenii,

488
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,400
including ranchers, clip artists, sacred scribes, head launchers,

489
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,180
anti-musicians, filmmakers, writers, comedians, cartoonists, and artists.

490
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,560
What about snipers?

491
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,520
Pull the eyes over your own wool, boys.

492
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,900
What the fuck?

493
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,100
He's a witch!

494
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,500
Face reality for a change.

495
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,220
This Christian came up to me at the airport and tried to talk to me about Jesus,

496
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,540
but I just said, I'm into Bob.

497
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,760
Snicker, snicker, snicker.

498
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,460
What's so funny?

499
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,100
Clinkish pseudo-intellectual white boys

500
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:59,280
making incomprehensible in-jokes to alienate all others around them.

501
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,400
Praise Bob.

502
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,240
Yuck, yuck, yuck.

503
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,560
Yeah!

504
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,740
I think that's quite fair.

505
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,380
Where's my 20-page?

506
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:14,300
Oh, here's my 20-page stapled together zine based on science fiction films of the 50s.

507
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,140
I also sent a copy of the tape to Stang,

508
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,460
but although my zine isn't even typeset and is hardly legible,

509
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,280
it's still the only meaning to my life

510
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,720
and the only outlet I have for all my pent-up rage and aggression.

511
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,140
Yeah!

512
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:30,840
Yeah!

513
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,780
For the first time in all honesty,

514
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,740
kill me.

515
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,320
Where's my bag?

516
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:49,820
Henceforth, if any of the pathetic, whimpering subgenii are heard bleating,

517
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,580
kill me.

518
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,880
This is one group that would be more than willing to take them up on it.

519
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,740
You can't just talk about some little infinite hate.

520
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,540
You've got to take it.

521
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,380
You've got to take a life in order to be accepted by Don.

522
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,440
Let's party in.

523
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,480
Kill Don.

524
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,800
Kill Don.

525
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:19,220
The jesting of a Don is dissimilar to the actions of a junkie with collapsed veins

526
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:23,320
who must jack blood up into his syringe several times in order to get...

527
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,900
...a bleeding head stupid, healed head pointless.

528
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,160
That's ridiculous.

529
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,160
Don't listen to him.

530
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,680
It's too loud.

531
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:32,840
Hear me out.

532
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,580
Hear me out.

533
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,400
Hear the truth.

534
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,360
The judge is going to take this tape.

535
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:36,880
And a technique.

536
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:37,920
.

537
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,120
.

538
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,120


539
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,120


540
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,120


541
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,120


542
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,040
The Church of Don is the hip faith of the 90's.

543
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:49,580
We're into real estate, banking, foreclosures, oppressing others, and other reality-oriented

544
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,280
financial ventures that the Church of the Subgenius seeks to ignore.

545
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:01,240
We're into frat boy kid parties, bowling, pay-per-view wrestling, and closed-circuit

546
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,320
heavyweight boxing.

547
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,940
We're into flopping in front of the TV with a beer without bothering to check or change

548
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,820
the channels.

549
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,020
Art and invention are pointless.

550
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,380
We like things the way they are.

551
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,880
We like plaid.

552
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,800
Don't cut up our magazines.

553
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,960
We might want to read them later or clip out the coupons.

554
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,300
We like plaid.

555
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:32,300


556
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:32,300


557
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,460
We're into Norman Rockwell over Salvador Dali.

558
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:40,860
We wish life could be more like a Tide or a Maxwell House commercial.

559
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,980
Don't bother looking for a P.O. box from the Church of Don.

560
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:52,200
We'll contact you if we decide to let you live.

561
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,040
.

562
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:55,780
.

563
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:55,780


564
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:55,780


565
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:55,780


566
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:55,800
.

567
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:55,840
.

568
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,400
.

569
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:56,880
.

570
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,420
.

571
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:00,420


572
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:04,580
Yes, Bob is a picture and still threatens no one.

573
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,700
.

574
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:11,240
.

575
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:11,240


576
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:21,100
Do people think you're strange?

577
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,820
You are.

578
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:23,720
.

579
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,720
.

580
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:24,720


581
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:24,860
.

582
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,420
.

583
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:33,660
We're sick and tired of shaving-headed acid-goblin dead dogs beating art school dropouts who

584
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:40,360
spell everything wrong, boldly surrealistic artistic worms proving absolutely nothing.

585
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,800
Oh, but I'm expressing my abnormality.

586
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,540
This has very deep meaning.

587
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:04,060
Science can remove money-grubbing, get-ahead, babbling surrealist writers.

588
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,060
It uses a technique called a gun.

589
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,580
But I'm ranting.

590
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,540
I'm speaking in gums.

591
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,160
You spit on my pants is what you did.

592
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:19,580
We can...

593
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,080
We can...

594
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,540
We can...

595
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:27,700
We can conceptualize an infinite hierarchy of monosyllabically-named male 50's pipe-smoking

596
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,200
satirical deities...

597
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,000
...endlessly parodying one another.

598
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:41,020
If Bob is a parody of Earth and the entire physical plane, then Don is a parody of Bob,

599
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,620
Joe is a parody of Don, Frank a parody of Joe, etc., etc.

600
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,060
A sample of the Lew pamphlet.

601
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:06,200
The jesting of a Lewist is so far out, so demented, it's not even English anymore.

602
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,740
We don't even understand what it means.

603
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:16,700
Subscribe to Lew's magazine, the stark-fisted, gitchy, gitchy, gitchy, and a goo-goo-goo.

604
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:27,840
You thought you were someone just because you were into Dobbs, but in reality you're

605
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,800
in the lowest chakra.

606
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:36,860
We conceptualize a transcendental yoga of hate.

607
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,340
You create so much hate, you destroy the entire universe.

608
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,560
That's neat.

609
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:58,560
But now you find yourself in a new universe of being so powerful and hateful, you can't

610
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,520
even get a date in this new universe.

611
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,460
You're utterly dwarfed.

612
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,840
A new universe.

613
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:12,140
A new universe where you say, I've read Mein Kampf, and someone answers, yeah, I've read

614
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:16,020
Mein Kampf, be here now, and all the rest of that love burger.

615
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,060
Let's all get together and just destroy this Bob thing.

616
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:36,160
You might, you might call us a conspiracy in the Church of Don, and yes, we are a conspiracy.

617
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:36,820
But we're not.

618
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:36,820


619
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:36,820


620
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:41,660
And yes, it's going to be a financial and social lockout until you guys get it together

621
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,680
and straighten up.

622
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:49,320
We're sick and tired of the first church of pathetic, whimpering crybabies, err, I mean

623
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:58,340
the Church of the Subgenius, wielding a ray gun finger of unrelenting financial humiliation

624
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:03,800
and a righteous, indignant moral outrage of red-blooded moral Americans.

625
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,800
But still, we're going to be a church of the subgenius.

626
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:06,800


627
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:06,800


628
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:06,800


629
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:06,800


630
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,620
Still, it's not enough for the freaked-out, value-raping, diarrhea-mouthed bastards.

631
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,920
Get a haircut.

632
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,760
Get a hair growth.

633
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,860
I can't even.

634
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:36,780
I'm going to break your neck.

635
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:36,780


636
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,760
grown playboys who watch cheap science fiction movies during the day and at night make silly

637
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,620
humor tapes while stoned out of their mind on drugs most people have never heard of,

638
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:54,960
using the cheap excuse that they're trying to make it as writers and conning their wives

639
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,540
and supporting them, as if there could ever be a market for magazines of schizophrenic

640
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:04,080
babble and copycat adolescent religious satire.

641
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,260
Since the real world obviously isn't interested in their cute little masturbatory in-joke

642
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:17,500
zines, they simply mail them back and forth to each other.

643
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:25,180
Thus every pencil-necked geek and four-eyed fat girl is now an editor, an artist, a writer.

644
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,580
We're more interested in TV Guide and Sports Illustrated.

645
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,360
But

646
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:33,360


647
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:33,760
I'm not.

648
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,340
I'm doing social commentary by standing on a stage talking about pee-pee and doo-doo

649
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:45,220
and Connie Dobbs' panties.

650
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:50,880
I'm actually making a deep satire on the restrictions our society has placed on...

651
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,100
Oh, shut up!

652
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,720
Too much is more than enough!

653
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:06,780
So maybe we did rough you up a bit in high school, but we're sick and tired of

654
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,380
hearing you bellyache about it!

655
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,720
The

656
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:09,840
The

657
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,360
The

658
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,480
The

659
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,140
The

660
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:17,620
The

661
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:17,620


662
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:17,620


663
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,080
The

664
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,380
The

665
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:18,420
The

666
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:18,480
The

667
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,320
The

668
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,260
The

669
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,040
The

670
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,080
The

671
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,360
The

672
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:22,800
The

673
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,000
The

674
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,000


675
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,000


676
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,000


677
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,000


678
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,000


679
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,800
We worship on Sh distances.

680
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:00,920
is.

681
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,580
Jayner's

682
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,800
right. It's a fraud.

683
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,740
It's a sham.

684
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,660
Obviously, I mean, look, we use

685
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,380
four letter words for no

686
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,860
discernible reason except we can't

687
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,040
think of anything else.

688
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,960
It's just...

689
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,880
Maybe Bob

690
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,860
is just a piece

691
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,360
of crap.

692
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,500
I mean, why not

693
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,520
launch a tribune over here?

694
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,120
We launch a tribune over here.

695
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,640
Go ahead. Might as well launch a tribune.

696
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,860
Why not?

697
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,140
We want everyone to chant

698
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,700
Healed head good.

699
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,180
Bleeding head bad.

700
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,940
Healed head good.

701
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,680
Bleeding head bad.

702
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,320
Healed head good.

703
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,180
Bleeding head bad.

704
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,940
Healed head bad.

705
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,600
Bleeding head bad.

706
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:54,940
Jayner's

707
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,280
lining up for the pot.

708
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,120
I guess it's a new church.

709
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,660
Church of Don now.

710
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,540
There goes Trevino.

711
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,440
In the name of

712
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,360
McDonald's.

713
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,900
In the name of Sears.

714
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,360
In the name of

715
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,820
Sergeant Jayner.

716
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,700
In the name of Walmart.

717
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,480
In the name of Bunch.

718
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,160
Great.

719
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,480
You let him do it.

720
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,600
He must be right.

721
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,240
Billy, what are we doing?

722
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,540
You people just let him

723
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,100
launch a Trevino head.

724
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,140
You mean you're letting me get away?

725
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,780
The church of Don.

726
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,020
He's been ranting about Don

727
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,760
for probably 20 minutes

728
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,260
and you let him get this far without killing him.

729
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,000
Where are the assassins?

730
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,040
I'm talking to you.

731
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,140
Where are the assassins?

732
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,020
Hey, stay!

733
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,220
I'm talking about the word of Don

734
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:01,080
and no one's just come up here and killed me yet.

735
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,800
My God.

736
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,520
Healed head good.

737
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,660
Take a look behind you, Jayner.

738
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,040
Don!

739
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,680
Look at yourselves.

740
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:11,920
My God.

741
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,600
Okay, yeah, they come up and kill him with fake guns.

742
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,320
They're probably all fake guns in here.

743
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,120
You don't pay us enough for real ammo.

744
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,500
Well, great.

745
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,020
You see anything?

746
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,940
This is real.

747
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,980
You got to pay for it, boy.

748
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:31,860
Now this place is starting to look like a subgenius convention.

749
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:32,740
Yeah!

750
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,760
You start finding blood, semen, and weapons all over the stage.

751
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,380
Sweat covering the pulpit.

752
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:42,320
That's when it's starting to look like a damn subgenius revival.

753
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,460
There's not blood on the floor.

754
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,560
It's just not happening.

755
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:48,220
Shoot him!

756
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,360
No, the only true

757
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,920
real pipe-smoking deity is

758
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,140
is him.

759
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,000
J.R. Bob Dobbs himself.

760
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,420
Right, Bob!

761
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,200
Preach it!

762
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:05,400
He is patience.

763
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,680
He is wisdom.

764
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:10,240
He is loving kindness.

765
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,500
He is strange humor.

766
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,100
He is life itself.

767
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,760
But this church of the subgenius

768
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,200
is not some namby-pamby

769
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:29,940
hypocritical teachings of

770
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,700
peace and brotherhood like you find in the New Age or

771
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,820
in Christianity.

772
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,680
This is a certified religion of hate.

773
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,720
You won't steal my tape recorder.

774
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,180
I'll call the Lord and put you in the pen.

775
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,020
You won't steal that thing again.

776
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:47,040
What are we talking about when we talk about hate, children?

777
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:51,440
Are we talking about some little namby-pamby little old...

778
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:51,700
Hey!

779
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:52,620
Hey!

780
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:56,300
Oh, I just hate the president.

781
00:43:58,620 --> 00:43:59,640
You call that hate?

782
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,680
You talking about some little old hate?

783
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,160
Oh, I just hate myself.

784
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:14,900
We're talking about, in the church of the subgenius,

785
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,820
we're talking about an infinite hate.

786
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,060
We're talking about an all-consuming,

787
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,280
all-pervading,

788
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,380
all-pervasive,

789
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,620
eternal hate.

790
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,620
You've got to become the hate.

791
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,160
You've got to hate

792
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,120
the wind in the trees.

793
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,420
You've got to hate

794
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,240
a bluebird chirping at dawn.

795
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,080
You've got to hate

796
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,220
a cure for cancer.

797
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,800
You've got to sit down, close your eyes,

798
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,480
pinch your fists,

799
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,160
furrow your brow,

800
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,120
and with all your might,

801
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,120
you've got to hate

802
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,440
a small child being cured of muscular dystrophy

803
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,760
and learning to walk again.

804
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,120
Oh!

805
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,060
Oh!

806
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,120
Oh!

807
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:12,660
Oh!

808
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:12,820
Oh!

809
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:12,880


810
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,440
Senseless hate!

811
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,220
The state of the church.

812
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,700
Someday there'll be no separation between the two.

813
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,320
Freedom...

814
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,520
See, we're talking about freedom of religion.

815
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,620
OUR religion.

816
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,080
It's been the dead guy on the stick long enough,

817
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:40,180
and they just haven't given anybody else enough slack.

818
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,640
I'm sorry, but they're right.

819
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:43,660
There has to be a balance.

820
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,940
Just as...

821
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:47,520
I mean, if Rush Limbaugh is going to be

822
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,880
the most popular talk show host in the country,

823
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:52,000
then we need Howard Stern.

824
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,580
If Jimmy Swag...

825
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,480
Well, not Swaggart, but whatever,

826
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,540
whoever the latest preacher that the media's about to tackle

827
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,800
is going to be on television

828
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:04,200
all over the country, several hours a day,

829
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,780
then the hour of slack certainly ought to be able to

830
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:10,200
blaspheme for one hour a week in 16 towns.

831
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:11,520
Uh...

832
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,340
Is there any argument with that, huh?

833
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,080
No!

834
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:15,140
I didn't think so.

835
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,440
What is going on?

836
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,440
In case you guys don't know,

837
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,640
we're interviewing the sort of CNN for Bob,

838
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:20,820
the Church of the Subgenius,

839
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,560
and I would really like to know,

840
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,160
do you guys see yourselves as a sort of CNN for Bob,

841
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,580
a sort of anti-conspiracy news network?

842
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:29,260
Anti-conspiracy...

843
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:35,760
Well, we're more like the Big Brother network for subgeniuses.

844
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,380
Someday there will be nothing but the hour of slack

845
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,520
on all stations.

846
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,240
All the time.

847
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,360
We're kind of the Malcolm X of mutants.

848
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:51,040
Destroy normality by any means necessary.

849
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,600
By any means necessary,

850
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,640
including a radio show that hurts.

851
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:57,520
The eardrums.

852
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,180
Makes your ears bleed.

853
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,260
The Church of the Subgenius.

854
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,200
Knowledge is power.

855
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,800
The only taped show that does for you

856
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,620
what a fifth of alcohol cannot do in the last quarter.

857
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:09,680
It sounds so good.

858
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,260
It hurts.

859
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,100
You can't be arrested for listening to Subgenius,

860
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,900
even though you're drunk on it.

861
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,920
Well, tell us about the new book, Revelation X.

862
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:19,860
When's it coming out?

863
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:20,880
What's it going to be?

864
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:22,920
We want to know.

865
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:23,800
Well, um...

866
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:24,920
It's already come out.

867
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,520
It's just been subverted,

868
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,000
and it's being censored and held back.

869
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,040
Suppression.

870
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:35,480
We're working on trying to get it released officially yet again.

871
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,500
This is the most important organization in the history of the world.

872
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,160
The history of the Earth, my friends.

873
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:47,340
A joke, they call it.

874
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,820
A joke.

875
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,520
Oh yeah, it might be a joke.

876
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:55,020
It might be the greatest joke ever told.

877
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:00,860
But if, and only if, Earth can make it to the punchline.

878
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:07,680
And it ain't gonna make it unless those men from Planet X get down here

879
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,540
and see somebody hatin' properly.

880
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,780
Hatin' them, but they hate, hate it some.

881
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,380
Haven't they achieved hate squared?

882
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,400
Where they hate even Jader talkin' about hate.

883
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,480
People are walkin' around sayin' this is a sign of the end times,

884
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,500
that's a sign of the end times.

885
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:30,020
But everyone should be shrieking simultaneously that

886
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:33,300
it's all a sign of the end times.

887
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,660
My face is a sign of the end times.

888
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:49,120
But we're reaching a, we're facing a financial crisis tonight

889
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,680
in the Church of the Subgenius.

890
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:56,020
My friends, we're in danger of losing the entire ministry.

891
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,720
We can't run this ministry on love alone.

892
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,620
We can't even run it on hate alone.

893
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:11,520
We can't run it on indifference alone.

894
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:19,800
If we're gonna completely and utterly eradicate the entire concept of money,

895
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:21,960
it's gonna take money.

896
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,200
A lot of money.

897
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,100
Tons of it.

898
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,040
Let me put it this way, if I were you, I'd give me all your money.

899
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:33,160
Why get ripped off somewhere else when you can come here?

900
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:37,280
We don't know if it'll even be the church the next morning.

901
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,360
That's the wonderful thing about it, you know?

902
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:44,180
I mean, theoretically, a couple of Bobs got killed last night.

903
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,700
Did you see the one, the one, the Bob look,

904
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,860
the guy who looked like Bob without a mask,

905
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:54,640
had a bat stuck across his face at one point,

906
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,500
at the, right in front of the stage.

907
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:00,320
It was kind of hard to see, but he spasmed around with this plastic bat

908
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,560
stuck over his mouth for about ten minutes.

909
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,260
We are prophets, and we want to be.

910
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:07,460
We want to be prophets.

911
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,840
Oh, you could go to some other church, sure.

912
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,400
You go to some other church where they only preach to the same,

913
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:18,460
where they do chicken preach to sinners like you.

914
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:23,940
Drugs and drug addicts, drug addicts, sexual perverts and sinners like you.

915
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,120
They're afraid to preach slack to people like that.

916
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:27,980
That's all.

917
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:29,860
But you go to those other churches,

918
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:35,040
are you gonna find preachers like Reverend Susie the floozy?

919
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:35,840
No!

920
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,020
Susie the floozy!

921
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,060
Susie, what a nice woman up here.

922
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,020
Woo!

923
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,460
Bob Tilton can sure fart,

924
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:55,740
but has he got a preaching assistant like this?

925
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:02,420
Does Bob Tilton have Sister Mary Squared, Susie the floozy,

926
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,000
and Princess We Are Doha?

927
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:07,060
No, he doesn't.

928
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:07,240
No, he doesn't.

929
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,860
We challenge you, Jimmy Swagger.

930
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,440
We challenge you, well, Jim Baker.

931
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:12,340
Hell, that's too easy.

932
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,020
Tammy, where are you, buddy?

933
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,380
We need you in this church.

934
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,500
We got to go now!

935
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:25,000
I guess y'all are tired enough of watching a bunch of ugly old guys preach.

936
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:31,080
Next time we'll have a little bit from the stage between game and over, man.

937
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:32,380
Woman!

938
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:33,740
Woman!

939
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:43,840
Oh, I am sweating like a whore in church.

940
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,200
Excuse me while I whip this out.

941
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:54,840
Over a decade ago, I classed this church, and Bob, to my face,

942
00:51:54,900 --> 00:52:00,160
I slapped a gimme slack clapper sticker off my car,

943
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:03,120
and I thought I had slapped,

944
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,180
I hated the paint,

945
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:12,900
I sent all sorts of money to the church and only got 500 tracks.

946
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:20,700
But despite my best efforts, I couldn't get slack.

947
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,880
And you can think that you have slack.

948
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,320
Shut that up.

949
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:39,060
So I want to tell everybody about the splendor and the wonder

950
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:47,980
and that fresh, zesty, brain-douche feeling I've got ever since Connie's come in and on my life.

951
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,000
Yeah.

952
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:04,740
Well, not too long ago, on a chart of spiritual evolution,

953
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:08,080
I wouldn't have even rated a You Are Here squid.

954
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,800
But now things are different.

955
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:18,060
I found Connie, the eternal sex ceramic goddess,

956
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,580
the wet spill on aisle five.

957
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:30,300
And Connie searched for the love of her life.

958
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,920
Oh, her gaze fell upon the face of the earth.

959
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,980
And she sat on it.

960
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:43,040
It took Connie to tell me I had slack, all right, but I wasn't using it.

961
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:46,780
Compared to the average pink, I was doing pretty damn good.

962
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:51,540
But for the sister of the Yeti, I was a pathetic mess.

963
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:55,600
Oh, you and Connie.

964
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:58,760
Enter the picture.

965
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:01,200
She said,

966
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:08,940
Flooz, do you know the only sin in this church is the sin of slacklessness?

967
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,340
And I looked at Connie in the eye and I said,

968
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,800
Are you sure it's sin?

969
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,120
And it was.

970
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,860
Because without slack,

971
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:34,000
life is like a bolt from a handle on the inside.

972
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,900
And if I didn't watch my ass,

973
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:56,560
my chances of getting slack

974
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:01,460
would have been wearing as thin as Karen Carpenter in a vomitorium.

975
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:08,020
But she turned me around.

976
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:11,720
She told me.

977
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,660
She told me things about himself, does it not?

978
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:22,760
She taught me how to get UHF on the dial of the hash.

979
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:31,060
She taught me how to snort Slim Pass through my third nostril.

980
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:40,520
She taught me autoeroticism doesn't necessarily mean doing it in a car.

981
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,680
Because of Connie,

982
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,360
I pulled myself up on my own bra straps.

983
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,900
As Connie said,

984
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:07,320
Honesty is the best policy.

985
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,500
But insanity is a better defense.

986
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:16,400
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

987
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:23,360
The benefits from looking at things Connie's way and me.

988
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,220
And it felt so good.

989
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:36,300
And then I realized, I thought I'd been doing the right thing.

990
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:41,300
But I've been pulling the conspiracy war over my eyes.

991
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:46,560
And I say, let's charge them another grand theft of slack.

992
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,760
We want our slack. We want it back.

993
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,200
Oh, Connie, thank you. I'm on a rampage now.

994
00:56:56,580 --> 00:57:03,400
And those candy-ass, pussy-less, pecker-headed, pink-clothes-that-send-her-watch-outs.

995
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,220
Praise Connie!

996
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,860
My God, have you ever seen anything like this?

997
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:19,900
Praise Connie!

998
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,460
Praise Connie!

999
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:30,200
I know I just want to know what you think, but don't call me that just because I'm spitting feathers.

1000
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:33,460
Woo-wee!

1001
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,380
Man, I love this job.

1002
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,060
This is the church.

1003
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:41,280
This is the church.

1004
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:41,280


1005
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:41,280


1006
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:42,300
This is what I'm here to be, dear friends.

1007
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:47,960
When one's preaching partners include Sister Susie the Floozy,

1008
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,820
a.k.a. Lois Carmen,

1009
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,180
the nominator,

1010
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:55,640
and shall we have a big hand for the swinging love corpses?

1011
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:58,700
I think that was a incredible, impactful chance.

1012
00:57:59,040 --> 00:57:59,780
Woo-wee!

1013
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,500
What a great...

1014
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:07,320
Oh, I see a false bob walking back there.

1015
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:09,440
No, no.

1016
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:14,280
So we've had some fun with some false bobs over the years.

1017
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,980
Oh, what's next?

1018
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:25,600
When you and Connie first split up, I understand.

1019
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:27,240
I didn't see you in the same.

1020
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:27,700
Yeah.

1021
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:28,660
She was running.

1022
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,680
Never going on.

1023
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,140
But you did.

1024
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,780
Connie, what does your husband think about your relationship?

1025
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:34,680
We're friends.

1026
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:35,400
That's it.

1027
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,740
Oh, yes, dear.

1028
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,140
We're friends.

1029
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:49,620
Some recordings there from the Genius Convention in Atlanta this last weekend at Phenomicon.

1030
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:56,900
An interesting DeVival lineup in that the schedule kept having to be shortened by half every hour.

1031
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:58,960
It was an interesting thing.

1032
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:04,580
The original schedule called for 19 preachers and two bands.

1033
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,580
But we were all told that we could go on all night long.

1034
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:09,420
Or at least twice.

1035
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,080
Until very, very, very late.

1036
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:15,500
About halfway through the show, we found out that very late was actually 1 o'clock.

1037
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:17,080
No one had ever told us that.

1038
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,160
And the thing didn't start until 10.

1039
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,420
So, gosh, a bunch of people didn't get to preach.

1040
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:29,720
But we'll be playing tapes of those other preachers anyway over the next few shows.

1041
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:34,600
And the kind of shows they are are like this show, the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1042
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:38,280
If you want information on the Church of the Subgenius and other...

1043
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:43,560
things, please write to Bob.

1044
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,300
That's all you gotta write.

1045
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:50,340
Bob at Post Office Box 140306.

1046
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:54,460
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1047
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:58,560
Once again, that's Post Office Box 140306.

1048
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:01,000
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1049
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,980
Praise Bob and let there be slack.

1050
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:03,220
Huh!

1051
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:16,820
U.S. Money Reserve

1052
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:17,020
U.S. Money Reserve

1053
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:17,020


1054
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:17,040
U.S. Money Reserve

1055
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:17,540
The U.S. Money Reserve

1056
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:17,840
U.S. Money Reserve

1057
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:17,840


1058
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:17,860
The U.S. Money Reserve

1059
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:19,140
Our camera owns a million million bucks.

1060
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:19,360
Bob's Walk Today

1061
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:19,360


1062
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:19,520
We would totally use your business

1063
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:19,880
The U.S. Money Reserve

1064
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:19,880


1065
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:19,880


1066
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:19,880
