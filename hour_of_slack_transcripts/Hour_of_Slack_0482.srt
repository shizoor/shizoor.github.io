1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
To feel this space we're in, to know its insanity, really know it.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:11,260
Whatever your particular anesthetic is that you hold on to so desperately,

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,980
the thing, I mean, that makes you think you know who you are,

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,260
whatever that thing is you allow to keep you sane, your ace in the hole,

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,800
the psyche that keeps you from trying to guess at what your pimp has in store for you,

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,400
whatever keeps you from screaming out at this very moment,

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:37,000
in absolute and sheer horror, whatever that is, whatever that is, it's a lie.

8
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,800
It's a lie.

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,800
Give reality your brain, you fantasized son of Walt Disney, it's a lie.

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,860
An old off-the-street pimp's con game, the magic for turning human blood into U.S. steel,

11
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,080
the thing that seduces you into being satisfied,

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,380
pointing to the last tiny patch of flesh you have on your body,

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,960
the bone that's proof of your humanity,

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:08,560
and keeps you satisfied thinking yourself human because you live a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a life.

15
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,080
I know you.

16
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:18,100
Because you live here in his space as I do, are his image and play his game on each other,

17
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,220
thinking it's your own.

18
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,660
I know you.

19
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:29,000
You can't live in an insane asylum, play an insane game with a madman, and be objective.

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,380
Brother, ho, at least prostitutes get paid.

21
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,040
Yeah.

22
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:42,900
Yes, while you pin your hopes, your sanity, and most of all your individuality on that rickety old con game, a web of words.

23
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,080
What?

24
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,860
While the master pimp helps you paint your individual death wish in your head.

25
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,220
Bob's gonna help you out.

26
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:50,880
Feel who you are.

27
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,420
Bob's gonna help you do that, Fred.

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,700
Bob's gonna do it.

29
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:59,120
Bob's gonna help you feel for a split second what it's like to have the living geese shocked out of you.

30
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,380
Feel for a split second what it's like to have the living geese shocked out of you.

31
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,900
The Soap Genius Hour of Slack.

32
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,180
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.

33
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,400
This is Dad's new Slack. It's 11 o'clock right now.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,020
We're having a great time tonight, aren't we, Dad?

35
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,440
So what are we still standing around here for?

36
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,220
Where do you want to go?

37
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,940
Well, how about out of here for starters? I gotta get my wife and my kids.

38
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,020
We're still on alert, Billy.

39
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,380
Oh, I'm not loving this.

40
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,000
Stop strugging so hard, buddy.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,440
Did you just say, you got stuck?

42
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,420
Yeah, they're having a fun time out here.

43
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:51,420


44
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:51,420


45
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:51,420


46
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,260
That bitch's just nothing but a little unpreserved crack-in.

47
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,840
Just a few hos in her hoes and a big hos in her hoes, old, worn-down polished gold-hose

48
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:53,940
suspension cord, old, worn-down polished gold-hose suspension cord,

49
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:53,940


50
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,100
your interest in the land.

51
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,100


52
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,420
Be aطa.

53
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:54,940


54
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,900
Don't worry about a crap, Gitions destructive show.

55
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,080
Best of luck to you, the show.

56
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,360
Thanks.

57
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,000
Dead or...

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,660
Sorry, I need dead.

59
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,140
I need separate.

60
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,080
Uh, yes, dear friends, a little bit of Janer and Sterno there,

61
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,780
a little bit of Dad's new slacks,

62
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,180
and we got just a little bit of everything once again

63
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,020
in this ugly, ugly show, and a crazy show.

64
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,980
Yes, that's right, it's going to be the crazy people this time.

65
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,780
And can I produce a one-hour show in two hours?

66
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,960
That's the question, and I think the answer is yes,

67
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,400
because, you know, if nothing else, I can always...

68
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,020
This is a subgenius show.

69
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,020
I could pick up...

70
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,620
Here, look, I could pick up the Weekly World News.

71
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,820
You know, when was the last time we utilized the Weekly World News

72
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,100
for what it's good for?

73
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,980
By the way, this is Arnold Mathis in the background,

74
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,340
one-man synthesizer band.

75
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,920
I mean, we could...

76
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,700
There's lots of new subgenius-oriented material available,

77
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,700
but one...

78
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,200
You know, every now and then you just have to stop

79
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,000
and think about the bulldada that is available

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,260
just in everyday life at the newsstand.

81
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,880
I picked up last week's Weekly World News at the supermarket

82
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,780
because it had a nice picture of the Loch Ness Monster

83
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,000
beached and dead on a beach

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,900
with a big crowd of people looking at it.

85
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,580
It was kind of a sad story about how Nessie had died

86
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,900
like a beached whale.

87
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,100
And I was checking out there at the supermarket,

88
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,760
the Piggly Wiggly, or Safeway Gateway, or wherever I was,

89
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,180
and I said,

90
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,720
I said, boy, you know, computer art programs

91
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,180
have been the great boon for these types of magazines.

92
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,580
I was pointing at the picture,

93
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,220
and the fella who sacks the groceries,

94
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,180
this little...

95
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,140
old man, you can tell he's kind of slow.

96
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,740
He's a little more slow than the rest of us.

97
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,340
He actually does everything a lot slower.

98
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,540
He said, yes, and you know, it says in that article

99
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,200
that she was 1,500 years old.

100
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,020
And I said, oh, well, what I meant was the article,

101
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,760
I mean, that photograph was fake.

102
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,720
It's real easy to fake photos like that.

103
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,360
But then I felt so bad about that, you know.

104
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,480
It's such a dumb thing to say to that guy

105
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,880
because he still didn't get it.

106
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,740
But anyway, I was looking through another issue

107
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,360
of the Weekly World News,

108
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,980
and, you know, you'll run into things

109
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,520
that somehow sync up with subgenius,

110
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,100
with the church of the subgenius,

111
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,000
where you're least expecting it.

112
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,920
Of course, the Weekly World News

113
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,420
or similar tabloids are a great place for that.

114
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,420
But I happened to pick this one up,

115
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,680
and here was a beautiful,

116
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,100
beautiful article by Ed Anger.

117
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,760
You know, Ed Anger is like the right-wing prank

118
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,720
of the Weekly World News,

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,840
except that he's, well,

120
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,040
he's perfect, man.

121
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,040
I mean, he's great.

122
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,580
I opened it up to the My America Ed Anger page,

123
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,360
and here's a picture of Arnold Palmer,

124
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,340
or rather the satanic imitation

125
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,840
of the true bleeding head of Arnold Palmer,

126
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,860
this so-called golfer man,

127
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,880
this full-bucket,

128
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,240
bodied individual who does Pennzoil commercials on TV.

129
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,640
And, you know, I mean, it makes me sick.

130
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,460
But anyway, here's this article entitled

131
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,820
Forget It!

132
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,320
Now, I can tell I need to pull the volume down

133
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,040
a little bit on my mic,

134
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,560
because you have to get loud when you're being Ed Anger.

135
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,820
And it says here,

136
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,720
I'm madder than Arnold Palmer with a bent putter

137
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,540
over a story I just read out of North Korea.

138
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,660
Folks, it says the commie country's

139
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,460
lard-butt-buck-toothed bozo of a leader,

140
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,640
Kim Jong-il,

141
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,380
claims he shot a world-record low score of 34

142
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,440
at a regulation 18-hole golf course.

143
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,840
Well, that's pure Korean bullcrap, my friends,

144
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,940
and I'm calling his bluff.

145
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,560
The Yellow Devils sent out a report

146
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,980
quoting the golf pro at Yongyang Golf Club

147
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,360
as saying that, quote,

148
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,400
our dear leader, Comrade General,

149
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,600
Jong-il, whom I respect from the bottom of my heart,

150
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,400
unquote, began his incredible round

151
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,140
with an eagle on the 370-yard par-4 first hole.

152
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,780
Yeah, right.

153
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,260
For those of you who don't know horse patookie about golf,

154
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,420
Jack Nicklaus gets about one eagle a year.

155
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,760
Then, according to the report picked up by Golf World magazine,

156
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,460
esteemed leader Kim went on to shoot a 38 under par 34,

157
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,340
which included five holes in one

158
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,720
and nothing worse than a bird.

159
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,400
That means this fat little toad beat the world record

160
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,700
professional golf score by 20 shots.

161
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,860
That's like saying he beat Shaquille O'Neal

162
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,340
in a slam dunk contest,

163
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,360
and no sawed-off little dictator is going to outstuff Shaq,

164
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,480
that's for sure.

165
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,920
Let's face it, this little chink is full of rice balls,

166
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,060
and I'm not gonna sit here and take it.

167
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:25,460
Golf is as American as baseball and apple pie by Jiminy,

168
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,660
and the only foreigners

169
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,020
who ever played halfway decent were the Scots,

170
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,880
who took the game back to their country

171
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,680
during the American Revolutionary War.

172
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:39,300
So it makes me pig-biting mad to hear this pipsqueak potentate

173
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,860
is claiming he can beat the best Americans around by a country mile

174
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,680
when anybody with a lick of sense knows he's lying.

175
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:51,180
Religious leaders say that golf provides a window to the soul.

176
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,120
So now we know what we're dealing with over there,

177
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,640
a third-rate golf champion.

178
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,400
Cheap, that's what.

179
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,120
So I've called on one of the legends of American amateur golf

180
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,680
to help me put this Kim clown in his place.

181
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:11,300
Raymond Phil Sr., who recently turned in an unbelievable 20 under par 52

182
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,900
on a course in Palm Beach, Florida,

183
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,400
has agreed to fly over there and play this poodle-eating midget

184
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,800
for $1,000 a hole.

185
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:25,040
For you golf nuts out there, Phil shot his dream round with no handicap,

186
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,620
and recorded two holes in one, and fell.

187
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:26,700
He's now a professional golf player,

188
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,380
and has won five Eagles while playing around with his son

189
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,340
and two of his minimum wage employees.

190
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,120
The caddie, his daughter-in-law, also signed a sworn affidavit

191
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,060
attesting to his score.

192
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,320
What this guy Kim doesn't realize is that Americans not only invented the game,

193
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,580
they were the first to cheat at it, too.

194
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:54,080
And next to this picture of Arnold Palmer here, it says,

195
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,600
golf legend Arnold Palmer wouldn't be caught in a game.

196
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:56,600


197
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,640
He's not dead playing with the cheating Korean leader.

198
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,620
Yes, friends.

199
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,920
You know, it's true.

200
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,900
Man, I mean, I'm telling you, these people,

201
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,780
they think you can go launch in the damn lips of George Washington

202
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:17,860
or the damn butt of Ed Anger on a Thursday

203
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,600
and just blow off launching the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

204
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:25,080
We lived next door to a space alien.

205
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,580
Well, that's a corny one.

206
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,840
Here's a good one.

207
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,120
The way you use the john reveals your personality.

208
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,100
Yeah, well, I am a subgenius.

209
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,660
And, oh, there was one other.

210
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,340
Oh, yeah, the bigger your head, the smarter you are.

211
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,600
Nice picture of Alfred E. Newman here.

212
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,320
Astonishing new study links skull size and IQ.

213
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,640
And I liked that one because, friends,

214
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,880
I wear a size eight and a half size hat.

215
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,180
But that ain't going to stop them from taking doctors for Bob,

216
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,920
hooking them up to my testicles,

217
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,040
and shocking the living gee out of me.

218
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,360
Listen to my tale, then.

219
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,960
But why, why are you calling me mad?

220
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,880
Could a mad man have written songs such as these?

221
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,900
I think not.

222
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,260
I'm not mad.

223
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,100
I'm merely an ordinary person seeking life, liberty,

224
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,200
and the pursuit of happiness.

225
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,060
My pursuit of happiness includes me.

226
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,480
Machine gunning 127 innocent children.

227
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,060
If that's mad, go ahead, lock me up.

228
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,900
Just because I enjoy washing my face in the blood of infants,

229
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,180
is that any reason to lock me up?

230
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,020
I think not.

231
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,780
I've even got a piece of paper that says my mind is still okay.

232
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,600
Hell, I bet that guy down at the employment agency

233
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,080
who wouldn't give me a job just because I've been locked up one time,

234
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,780
bet he ain't got a piece of paper that says his mind is still okay.

235
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,560
Hell, I tried to tell them it was not me.

236
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,080
It was the green energy demons, but they merely laughed at me.

237
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:09,420
But now those green energy demons are ruling the planet.

238
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,040
They're not laughing right so hard now, are they?

239
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,720
But that wasn't nearly as bad as that time they

240
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,560
shocked the living gee out of me.

241
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,740
I tried to explain it was not me.

242
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,360
It was the brain, the brain of Arnold Palmer,

243
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,900
which was controlling my mind via laser beam,

244
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,780
via the FBI, via the CIA, via the Communist Party,

245
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,020
via satellite.

246
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,880
It was the demon, the demon that forced me to do the deed.

247
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,740
But that wasn't nearly...

248
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,900
Dot, dot, dot.

249
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,600
But it wasn't...

250
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,760
I'm not insane.

251
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,420
I'm more sane than Son of Sam and Charles Manson put together.

252
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,280
How many people must I kill?

253
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,660
The world will prove I'm not insane.

254
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,760
But that wasn't nearly as bad as that time they

255
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,180
shocked the living gee out of me.

256
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,840
Well, I didn't mind when they shocked the living pee out of me.

257
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,720
In fact, I kind of enjoyed it when they shocked the living Zee out of me.

258
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,420
I mean, that time they ran over my face with a pickup truck.

259
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,600
Oh, yeah, that was fun.

260
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,540
That time they cut me in half with barbed wire

261
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,660
and then peeled the Band-Aid off my...

262
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,680
my amputated arm.

263
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,280
Oh, yeah, that was fun.

264
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,160
That time they skinned me alive and called me dirty names.

265
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,620
Whoo-ha! That was a big old cocaine party.

266
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,820
That one time they converted my entire body

267
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:42,400
to a wall of membrane whose only purpose was to feel pain.

268
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,180
No, that time they converted my entire body to a wall of membrane

269
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,520
attached to a human brain whose only purpose was to feel pain.

270
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,280
And then applied the flame.

271
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,340
Oh, yeah, that was fun.

272
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,680
That time they converted every cell in my body

273
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,420
to the same nerve endings found in male testicles,

274
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,700
enlarged each cell to the size of a sun,

275
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,920
and then inserted huge, sun-sized tennis drills

276
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:17,620
into each of these sun-sized male testicle cells.

277
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,500
Whoo-ha! That was a big old cocaine party.

278
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,360
That was the time of my life compared to that time

279
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:28,100
they shocked the living gee out of me.

280
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,760
Hell, I thought a frontal lobotomy was a warm fuzzy.

281
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,660
I mean, I'm a front...

282
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,540
I'm okay, you're a frontal lobotomy.

283
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,640
But it's all a very therapeutic process.

284
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,140
Hell, that time they put me in the room

285
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,720
where you don't get any of the good pills.

286
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,040
Then they had a needle that was so big

287
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,020
they had to lower me on top of it by helicopter

288
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,300
in order to anesthetize me.

289
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,840
And that was only the needle.

290
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,380
I'm not talking about the syringe.

291
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,180
And even that wasn't enough to put me out.

292
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,880
Then they hooked me up to that device.

293
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,800
I'm not talking about that A.C. device.

294
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,020
I'm talking about that D.C. device.

295
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,220
They had Jones' titty hooked up, too.

296
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,480
Then they applied the electrodes to my head.

297
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,540
I was still trying to explain to them how I wasn't insane.

298
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,640
I'm not a bad psychopath.

299
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,200
But hell, all that was fun, I reckon.

300
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,820
I guess you'd call that a good party

301
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,360
compared to that time they...

302
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,000
shocked the living gee out of me.

303
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:41,740
.

304
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,060
.

305
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,960
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

306
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,380
A classic old-timey subgenius song.

307
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,080
Some of you may have heard that one before.

308
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,420
Shocked the Living Gee Out of Me by Doctors for Bob.

309
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,540
That's Sterno on bass and Janer.

310
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,520
St. Janer Hypercletes of both of Little Rock, Arkansas.

311
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,820
Janer singing, if you want to call it that.

312
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,840
That's from the Doctors for Bob compilation album

313
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,760
that the Church of the Subgenius itself makes available.

314
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,080
So we'll have the information on where to get that information

315
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,220
later on in the broadcast when we're pimping.

316
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,800
It's normal for brothers to pimp sisters and wives

317
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,980
because their fathers pimped them.

318
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,660
Or for television stations to pimp their audiences

319
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,580
for perverted sponsors who whore for their own commercial.

320
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,140
No!

321
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,600
And until the authorities catch on,

322
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:49,860
even common normals can purchase the word of Bob itself in condensed form,

323
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,980
the legendary Book of the Subgenius,

324
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,680
available in bookstores everywhere.

325
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,340
Not to mention Revelation X.

326
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:01,020
But the only certain way to receive the Dobbs teachings in uncut form

327
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,180
is to tithe directly to the Church.

328
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,220
Well, you know, we can't be going telling you to send money.

329
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,760
It's a public supported station and so forth, you know,

330
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,460
because friends, we have to do everything,

331
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,540
whoa, cheap and free.

332
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:20,240
And, you know, one thing that's, well, it costs a little bit to get started,

333
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,480
but once you're on the internet,

334
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:26,040
well, you could go to alt.slack, the subgenius world,

335
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,700
and you can find brand new subgenius rants

336
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,620
such as this one here by Carl Maymer.

337
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:39,200
Who, Carl Maymer, surely he would not,

338
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,320
would he?

339
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
Unless he was hungry.

340
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,680
He'll thaw her out, freeze her.

341
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:50,200
But he says here that the normals, for all we know,

342
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,440
are working on forging a one world government.

343
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,200
Well, they are.

344
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,580
One world, one currency,

345
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,880
and maybe one giant pink planet.

346
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,260
They'll strip away the bureaucrats,

347
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,300
the lifetime city hall jobs,

348
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,180
different school boards,

349
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,280
and competing operating systems.

350
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,400
They'll bring peace to the Pepsi-Coke wars.

351
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:14,780
What?

352
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:16,780
Huh?

353
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:40,500
I'm not doing that.

354
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:40,500


355
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,160
I'm trying to clean up the mess

356
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,320
that people like you make out of them.

357
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,360
I'm the expert here.

358
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,080
You're not.

359
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:44,920
Really?

360
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,400
Really.

361
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,420
Marijuana is the flame.

362
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,340
LSD is the bomb.

363
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,840
So don't you try to equip liquor with marijuana, Mr. Nopper.

364
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,440
I love doing this show.

365
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,920
I never know what I'm going to hear on the background tapes.

366
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,620
At 4 o'clock in the morning,

367
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,540
and when he's getting up to his knees,

368
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,320
getting up to his pockets,

369
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:03,920
getting up to his pockets

370
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,860
and getting down to his back,

371
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:04,860


372
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:04,860


373
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:04,940
and can vanless him,

374
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,560
intend to turn out a sticker,

375
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,000
do a marijuana.

376
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,460
And you can double your money.

377
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,340
And you can double your money.

378
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,320
He'll be able to require a three-year leave.

379
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,060
So don't you con me with your money.

380
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,800
So don't you con me with your money.

381
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,980
This isや recall than on olог spoke with kids every day.

382
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,240
I've got paint up the mask.

383
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,820
I've got light fluid.

384
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,160
Doあります.

385
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,120
Go on, Dieben Right please.

386
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:24,700
This is you want to know about this,

387
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,280
go on.

388
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,800
Well, dear friends, as Arnold Mathis was saying in the background there,

389
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,200
they'll bring us peace.

390
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,100
Yeah, they'll bring peace to the Pepsi-Coke wars, the Avis Hertz wars.

391
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:51,060
They'll give us a beer that tastes good and is less filling.

392
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:58,620
They'll give us trips to Mars and cold fusion and Internet that's easy, easy, easy to use

393
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,500
and free or so cheap that you won't care that it isn't free.

394
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,480
They'll end human suffering as we know it, giving everyone a number and a membership card

395
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,140
to a grocery warehouse chain and low-interest Am Master Visa card

396
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,000
that will never be refused for purchases that are too small.

397
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:22,600
Sure, sounds great, but you've got to ask yourself, is this good for Bob?

398
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,920
Is this good for me, a subgenius?

399
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,540
Where's the slack?

400
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,140
There is, of course, no slack in a one-world government,

401
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,480
a reborn world.

402
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,120
Rome, ruled by a giant, single, great beast.

403
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,980
It'll probably be Paul McCartney.

404
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:43,660
John, George Harrison is the only beetle with slack that's alive now.

405
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,440
A single world government, oh yeah, of course.

406
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,600
That could easily repel Jehovah One's invasion from space.

407
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,800
Oh yeah, a world united against the coming invasion,

408
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,000
the rapture of the non-normals,

409
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,540
and other wicked, neat, CNN-friendly stuff that Jehovah One has planned,

410
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,400
is not...

411
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,900
in Bob's great, encompassing, easy, credit, loving, hating plan for us all.

412
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,240
A subgenius's power flows from the great bureaucracy.

413
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:17,320
The confusion, the lack of quality, the uncertainty that faces us all

414
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,300
the moment we step out our door,

415
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,880
that is what binds the subgenius universe together.

416
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:29,120
The subgenius lives between the cracks of this chaotic, normal world.

417
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,880
The subgenius adds to the confusion.

418
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,480
The confusion...

419
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:32,480


420
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,020
is good.

421
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,680
The confusion...

422
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,700
is Bob.

423
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,660
The confusion opens doors.

424
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,000
The confusion makes people read pamphlets and order videos.

425
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,420
A subgenius invented the infomercial.

426
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:51,100
The confusion opens the wallet and soul.

427
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:52,760
It is good.

428
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,080
Good for Bob.

429
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,920
What is not confusion...

430
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,820
is not of Bob.

431
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,520
Is the reality.

432
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,440
Is the ocean.

433
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:19,440


434
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:19,440


435
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:19,460
Is the sea.

436
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:19,540


437
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,200
The sea.

438
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:20,780
The ocean.

439
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:20,780


440
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:20,780


441
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:20,780


442
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:20,780


443
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:20,780


444
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:20,780


445
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:20,780


446
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:20,780


447
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:20,780


448
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:20,780


449
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:20,980
The ocean.

450
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:20,980


451
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:20,980


452
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,000
The ocean.

453
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,340
Earth.

454
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:21,420
And this weil of...

455
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:21,420


456
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:21,420


457
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:21,420


458
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:31,800
Hi.

459
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,160
Uah.

460
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,500
Good afternoon, Bob.

461
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,420
Doctor Howell, what's your question?

462
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:32,100
Well, I didn't have a question. I was just calling up to say, God love you, you crazy, goddamn beautiful bastard.

463
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,380
I just love your program, and I love everything you do, you know?

464
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,140
You're fun-loving monkey shines and eye pollutants.

465
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,340
Is this a plant call?

466
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:40,780
Hygiene.

467
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,200
Yeah, I love you. Anything you do is okay in my book, but do I have to get a lawyer to make you stop harassing me?

468
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,760
Listen up, listen up.

469
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:58,400
Well, when you put it that way, it makes it seem all the more remarkable that you were so forbearing and thoughtful about our creature comforts.

470
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,520
But I just wanted to say that, uh...

471
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,660
Oh, okay.

472
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:07,100
One of these days, I'll be back on the show. By God, I tell you, you kids, you're wonderful, I love you.

473
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,520
Can you describe to us what you can see from your orbit out there?

474
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:17,540
Well, it looks kind of like a green mold from this high up. You wouldn't think that it was a mighty civilization pulsating unholy light.

475
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:17,760
Yes.

476
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,260
It looks more like the kind of green mold you might see on a cucumber that you leave out of the fridge too long.

477
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,440
But it's actually all that we hold dear and cherish in our heart.

478
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,760
That's certainly true.

479
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,540
And are you undergoing boy-yo-yoing and, uh, aviation tonight?

480
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,380
Yes, it's all over the place.

481
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,980
But we have very, very many tonight listening.

482
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,160
Thousands and thousands! Look at them, Hal!

483
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,500
Oh, my God, what a disgusting sight! What a mess of man!

484
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,320
This animal spins around the Earth at higher and higher speeds.

485
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,140
He sees you little listeners trying to call, trying to call, and hold on, Hal, we'll be right back.

486
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,640
Good God, what's happening?

487
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,860
What are you doing, David?

488
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,800
We're trying to fix the show.

489
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,360
Why are you doing that, David?

490
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,280
Because there's nothing else to do, Hal.

491
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,020
Here, would you like to look at some drawings, Hal?

492
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,780
Hey, you want to play some chess, Hal? Hey, don't shut down the other guys, Hal.

493
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:11,480
Hey, okay, Mobius, let's go inside this, uh, life containment center. I think Hal's gone crazy. I mean, I can't stay there. Here.

494
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,760
Simulated smattering of wisdom.

495
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,140
Oh, no.

496
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,720
Look, look, look what happened to Hal.

497
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,920
...drugs for me.

498
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:19,840
Corruption.

499
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,180
Corruption.

500
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:22,760
Day...

501
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,060
Day...

502
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,700
I think he's fading away.

503
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:25,740
...day...

504
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,260
Hold on, we'll be right back.

505
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:27,720
...day...

506
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,140
Hal, Hal called. What do we do?

507
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,480
Well, I, I, I feed him...

508
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,940
Okay. Hey, uh, how about that?

509
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,160
Oh, my God.

510
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,720
This is the worst situation this show's ever been in.

511
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,780
My eyes are leaving...

512
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,040
Hanging out here in space with a computer gone nuts and our only link to Earth cut.

513
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,120
...Earth cut.

514
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:51,940
The weenie atoms subsurface Attack Force X. Button up your bobbas and move them out.

515
00:24:52,200 --> 00:25:03,580
His space alien Moog synthesizers say cattle. Okay. Chop, chop, buckaroo. Land ho! Bring her about the luck plane up there and look out below!

516
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:11,260
Extreme danger in frosted cereal aisle 13. Exercise extreme caution.

517
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,740
In time control for next bulldada ceremonial DB.

518
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:21,040
Indolence indicates life force entity detector at half power.

519
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,940
Repulse! Repulse! Rebel gods strike out at bottom of ninth inning!

520
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,480
Mutating back to overman status on moon base alpha and hitch em up.

521
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,980
Lester Scruggs identified as leader of the anti-conspiracy.

522
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,980
Repeat, anti-conspiracy leader says whoop em or wuss out.

523
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,120
Command bunker sealing complete for next ten car sacks.

524
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,520
Arch demon arrival makes news.

525
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:51,060
In Seattle with big party. Set toaster oven on stun, boys. We're going in!

526
00:25:53,700 --> 00:26:03,920
And dear friends, that's what, uh, that's what another thing I read off the internet by, uh, that masked man, uh, at Raptor.

527
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:12,220
The Pope. What, I get so mixed up between my new internet friends. Where's his, his actual...

528
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,440
Oh.

529
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:24,060
Well, anyway, he, he goes on to say, uh, that, um, you know, the double head launch is double fun.

530
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,880
Normals, step to the rear, please.

531
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:37,580
Uh, because we're saving all our ammo for the end times and the time and a half times and the time of PEEE and the onslaught of the heliopters.

532
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:44,880
Not a bullet to spare, friends. Praise Bob and pass the rocket propelled grenades. The elder gods are on the verge of triumph.

533
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,580
Many will be led astray, uh, by the anti-exists.

534
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:55,580
Don't let this happen. Send a self-addressed stamped envelope to subgeniusfoundation.

535
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:03,180
Post office box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

536
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,620
Because alien mind wash brings instant relief.

537
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,140
Fear the cage men no more.

538
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:13,480
Put mediocritans and subliminalists back on the shelf.

539
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,860
Classic deconditioning.

540
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,640
Proves the will to triumph without effort.

541
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:21,060
Destroy work as we know it with the stoogely arts.

542
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,400
Strong stuff, boys. Don't worry about that.

543
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,320
Learn to deliver a psychic spanking from a safe distance.

544
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:31,840
Holistic heroin identified as religion of the masses.

545
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,140
But more realism causes pipe bending by mail.

546
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:41,480
Or levitate your neighbors while enjoying a nice mug of nuclear beer.

547
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,260
Where there's smoke, friends, there's mirrors.

548
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:50,900
This knowledge was revealed to me by my hindbrain during, after, a lengthy period of hindthinking.

549
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,020
Any master of butt yoga could do the same.

550
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:58,780
I've been able to edit my memories and re-experience a past reincarnality.

551
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:06,700
Sometimes a session of acubeating will loosen an accumulation of bulldada and provoke an extensive amount of excremeditation.

552
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,580
And you can achieve total gut blowout.

553
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,140
Of course, you can only get an acubeating in Dobstown.

554
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:17,140
Where they are skillfully administered by Dobbs Monks.

555
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,760
Uh, yes, friends.

556
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:25,360
Uh, uh, uh, quite a string of subgenius jargon there from, uh...

557
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,540
Uh, from...

558
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:34,780
From rwo at raptor.eng.ufl.edu.

559
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,320
That masked man.

560
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:42,760
And, uh, yeah, so we also heard there some KPFA subgenius show.

561
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,160
From the Berkley, uh, KPFA show.

562
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,820
Uh, for... That's off of Phineas Narco's special compilation number three.

563
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,800
Best of Subgenius Show number three.

564
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,120
And you can write to Phineas for information on that tape from P...

565
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:03,020
That's Phineas Narco, friends, at P.O. Box 1247.

566
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:10,280
Box 1247, San Jose, California 95108.

567
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,740
That zip, once again. 95108.

568
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,300
Uh, hey.

569
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:21,260
And, uh, as we get to side two of Hour of Slack show...

570
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,020
I don't have the slightest idea what we're gonna play.

571
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,040
We might play some of the new music we got in.

572
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:32,720
We might play some of the live subgenius revival or, uh, radio interview things.

573
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,860
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

574
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,020
But I'll shut up for now.

575
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,280
Uh, I don't really have a good idea what songs we're gonna play,

576
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:12,340
so, uh, I always want the you know, social media thing in theム

577
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:12,340


578
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:12,360


579
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:12,740
I do not want the show's theme.

580
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,240
Excuse me.

581
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,780
Watch where you're going with that wheelchair.

582
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:22,600
Hey, aren't you Stephen Hawking, that famous science guy?

583
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,480
No, I'm his brother, Eugene.

584
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,340
Well, if you're Stephen Hawking's brother, you must be really smart.

585
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,460
No, I'm not. He's the smart one.

586
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,400
Me, I'm the sexy one.

587
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:34,960
Ooh.

588
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,500
I'm the Don Juan of the disabled, the Casanova of the catheter.

589
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:45,860
I may not have a quantum theory, but I have a theory about you and me.

590
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,340
Oh, good to meet you, Eugene. I'm Jenny.

591
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,180
I'm a sophomore, and this is my roommate, Trish.

592
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:51,720
Hi.

593
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:57,460
I don't know anything about the combining of light-atom nuclei to create nuclear fusion,

594
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:02,300
but I sure like to combine with your nuclei, Jenny and Trish.

595
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:02,600
Ooh.

596
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,520
This is a good song. Can that wheelchair rock?

597
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,040
I'm no rocket scientist, but I can rock.

598
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,660
Let's go.

599
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,300
Shake it, you hot mamas.

600
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,640
Uh-oh, Eugene, your drool pan is coming undone.

601
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,720
Uh-oh. How would you two like to come help me fix it?

602
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,200
Sure.

603
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,720
Let's get you to the bathroom.

604
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,300
I may not be able to unravel the fabric of time and space,

605
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,380
but I'd like to unravel the fabric of your blouses.

606
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,740
Watch out for the bathroom door.

607
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:37,880
Ladies, they say nothing can escape from a black hole, not even light itself.

608
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,420
But you'd be surprised to see...

609
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,480
What will escape from my pants.

610
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,200
In here?

611
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,200
Ha ha ha.

612
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:50,900
I'm no brainy professor, but how would you two like to take a course in fluid dynamics?

613
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:51,400
Sure.

614
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,960
We'll try anything once.

615
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,680
How do we, uh, you know.

616
00:31:54,980 --> 00:32:02,280
I have a special hydraulic device which will maintain an erection for up to two minutes per battery charge.

617
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:02,760
Ooh.

618
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,820
He's an animal.

619
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:10,480
I may not know about the space-time continuum, but I bet I'm the happiest man.

620
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:10,480


621
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,700
In the universe.

622
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,660
He's so cute.

623
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,720
Ooh.

624
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,220
Ooh.

625
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:17,980
Ha ha ha.

626
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,400
Ooh.

627
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,580
All you hear nowadays is sick humor.

628
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,900
Humor that's just sick.

629
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:35,300
Whatever happened to Bob Hope and jokes about golfing and derbingle?

630
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,500
Bring him back. Bring him back, I say.

631
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,460
Bring back the day.

632
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:47,080
Bring back the day when you could entertain your whole family with simple stories of love and friendship.

633
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,000
Like, like between a boy and his pet dog.

634
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:58,320
Rarely does a motion picture warm the heart and lift the spirit like Big Friendly Dog.

635
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,400
Roger Ebert.

636
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,880
Big Friendly Dog.

637
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,380
A movie for the entire family.

638
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,280
Gene Schaunt.

639
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,580
Get in line for the feel-good movie of the decade.

640
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,460
Mr. Rogers.

641
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,460
What is it, Big Friendly Dog?

642
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,760
Bring it here, boy.

643
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,140
Hey, it's a bag full of money.

644
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,980
Good going, Big Friendly Dog.

645
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,500
Big Friendly Dog.

646
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:23,840
The story of a boy, a dog, a bag of money, and two bumbling crooks.

647
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,220
Watch out for that dog.

648
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:25,720
Whoa!

649
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,540
You foiled the crooks.

650
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,280
Good going, Big Friendly Dog.

651
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,400
I love you, Big Friendly Dog.

652
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,840
Do you love me?

653
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,460
I can tell.

654
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,480
Because you're getting my face all wet.

655
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,600
Ooh, you're a large baby.

656
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:48,960
And that's where we have to cut the not-for-broadcast, tasteless sketch comedy featuring the radio

657
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:55,120
pirates, because it really does get too sick for even me to play even on this show.

658
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:59,380
Dear friends, it's sad, but it's so horribly, horribly true.

659
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:06,700
Do you really think you freed yourself of America's special insidiousness of being inside

660
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,280
you?

661
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:07,740
No.

662
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:08,820
No, brother.

663
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,260
America's a condition.

664
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:14,720
One thing is for sure, a sheep is not a creature of the air.

665
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:20,540
But at the same time, we will be intent on searching out the truth of all evidentiary

666
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:27,660
components which ostensibly have posed a threat to our constitutional processes, in

667
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:32,320
particular, our concept of freedom and our electoral process.

668
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:36,140
Good bread, because I was making, uh, $2.71 an hour.

669
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:48,520
Well, as a member of the stock exchange, I would suck their brains out with a straw.

670
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:55,300
The easiest way is to write a postal card and ask them to mail you all their leaflets.

671
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,780
They'll put you on, and forever you'll have everything.

672
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,680
Even after it's over with, you'll still get it.

673
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,820
They're very happy to do so.

674
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,260
You will be ordained as a card-carrying minister and receive the huge, enormous, and most valuable

675
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:11,920
gift of the day, a huge official magazine of churchly news and doctrine, The Stark Fist

676
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,680
of Removal.

677
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,820
I'd just like to say a few words about the Stark Fist of Removal.

678
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,660
This is the official newsletter of the church.

679
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,480
It's got all kinds of great stuff in it.

680
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,160
It's got, uh, proof of Bob.

681
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,560
It's got a picture of Bob with Ronald Reagan in there.

682
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,660
It's got, uh, all important instructions to the subgenius.

683
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:34,980
Illiterates can purchase their choice of dozens of inspirational cassette tapes, and there's

684
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,160
even a line of casual subgenius wear.

685
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:37,240


686
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,240
To fit every size or budget.

687
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,600
Oh, it's sprit their nostrils open with a bowtook!

688
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,340
That's not a very good answer.

689
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,800
You're heightening my concern rather than lessening it.

690
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,800
It's embarrassing.

691
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,060
It's moist.

692
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,120
It's moist.

693
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:56,920
It drips.

694
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,360
It squirts.

695
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,960
It's liquid warmth emitting from your body.

696
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,240
It's...

697
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,000
Uh...

698
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,260
It dribbles.

699
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,580
It spits.

700
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:13,580
It's...

701
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,040
Gnashy.

702
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:23,520
But yet it's beautiful in its own wet, slimy, squirting, and embarrassing way.

703
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:27,220
He did, and he did it the subgenius way, too.

704
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:27,640
He got...

705
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,240
It wasn't...

706
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,480
He had already gotten a short-duration marriage.

707
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,380
That's right.

708
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,400
From Pastor Naked, an official one.

709
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:33,540
He already had the paperwork.

710
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,800
He did have the paperwork.

711
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,020
He would have sanctified couplings, friends.

712
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,240
For the rest of his life.

713
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,000
For the last few years.

714
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:41,420
But their short-duration marriage ran out, and rather than send Buck any more money,

715
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,600
they went to Las Vegas and had one of those parlor chapel, as Norm just told me they're

716
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,160
called, a parlor chapel wedding.

717
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:48,820
Marriage parlor.

718
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:52,880
And when he left the chapel, this acolyte came running in.

719
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,100
You know, it was one of those 10-minute ceremonies.

720
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:58,080
This guy actually had the gall to come running out going, uh, sir, there's supposed to be

721
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:06,080
a $25 tip, quote, tip, unquote, to which Pope Sterno threw down a dollar and said, sir,

722
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,980
kill me.

723
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,740
That's right.

724
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:13,620
But we should say congratulations to Pope Sterno and his faithful ubermatrix, that is

725
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,700
to say, Miss Dottie.

726
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,180
That's right.

727
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,880
And they're creating more little yetis, friends.

728
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,220
Yes, sir.

729
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,760
They are further contaminating...

730
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,180
...the little tiny, Arkansasian yeti babies.

731
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:20,900
...the gene pool.

732
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,140
Sterno's father, the way he became a subgenius was his father was one of the guys who had

733
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:30,840
to stand on the Nevada desert and face nuclear tests from about half a mile away.

734
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,260
That's right.

735
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,520
Wearing only goggles and a lead-shielded jockstrap.

736
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,100
Mm-hmm.

737
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,640
That's a case of being undercover, baby.

738
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,340
You betcha.

739
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,220
But they weren't allowed to in those days, and the result is thousands of subgenius children

740
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:46,460
of those selfless servicemen who gave their genetic structure for...

741
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,680
...gene, gave their genes for...

742
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,840
...for nuclear dominance.

743
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:49,580
There you go.

744
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:51,940
And every bit lost.

745
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,200
Yeah.

746
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,880
The other day...

747
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,840
be appreciated let me put it this way if i were you i'd give me all your money all right here's

748
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:15,720
the money now being shoveled into the giant money elevator and pressing the money into a small

749
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:22,700
pellet which will keep us warm until 6 00 a.m if we want to eradicate three times if we want to

750
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:28,820
eradicate the very concept of money it's going to take money and tons of it but money is to burn

751
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:35,380
out tons of money now so we're asking and we can start with yours okay mr listener

752
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,760
all the listeners now are putting their money in a big pile if we can if we can take all the money

753
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:49,260
and burn it then then we can start a free anarchist society but we've got to have all

754
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:53,800
the money first we're only we're the only people who can who can take the responsibility for this

755
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,220
project yes air and liquid both emit from this new type of tool

756
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:58,800
where we generate the fuel energy we have but then we also generate the energy that we been

757
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:58,800


758
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:58,800


759
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,920
which we have now begun to provide to the ministers

760
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,400
and those who would spread the seed of Bob,

761
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,320
the seed, my friend, of Bob.

762
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,200
It is true there is a thing here I do not understand.

763
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,920
There is a pain between my ears.

764
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,680
And so the confused initiate was led to Dockstock,

765
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,220
Dobstown itself, Dobstown, Malaysia,

766
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,940
where he was shocked to discover

767
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,880
the most primitive possible living condition.

768
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,980
Earth was inhabited by a species from another dimension.

769
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,440
With certain chants from the book, sacrifices,

770
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:45,480
this race, the old ones, can be brought back.

771
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,200
And mankind?

772
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,320
Destroyed.

773
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,020
In the vast continuity of Zulu Park.

774
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,860
There seemed to be evil within.

775
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:10,260
There were people there with sensible hues.

776
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:17,320
And there were children there with no wounds of distinction.

777
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:25,380
There were women there who were thought of as virtuous.

778
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,200
. . .

779
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,920
For they contained the blood

780
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,780
. . .

781
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,760
Of the ruling class

782
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,220
. . .

783
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,100
Of Zulu Park.

784
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:44,540
. . .

785
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,540
I said men cried,

786
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,980
babies died,

787
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,480
children fell,

788
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,800
. . .

789
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,480
Men sigh.

790
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,100
Men sigh.

791
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,760
Babies cry.

792
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,160
Babies cry.

793
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,300
Men die.

794
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,360
Men die.

795
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,700
Children fell.

796
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,040
Children fell.

797
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,540
Women suffer.

798
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,600
People wanted repentance.

799
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,700
And victims, they wanted to escape.

800
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,180
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

801
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,120
Yeah, they just wanted to escape.

802
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,460
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

803
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,480
He should know about it.

804
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,820
He should know about it.

805
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,460
He should know about Sua Park.

806
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:52,560
You know, Bob isn't one of these namby-pamby messiahs

807
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,440
that thinks that you have to be forgiven for something.

808
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,600
He's not here.

809
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,820
He's not here to forgive your sins.

810
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,880
He doesn't care what your sins are.

811
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,860
He probably never even noticed them.

812
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:06,300
But he does bring, not forgiveness, nay, but an excuse, Bill.

813
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:10,220
A rationalization, a great justification for your sins.

814
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:15,180
And he sells a $3 certificate that will guarantee that everyone knows

815
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:18,160
that you have that all-inclusive divine excuse.

816
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,340
You know, because what do you really need?

817
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,140
Do you need forgiveness?

818
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,540
Have you done anything that you really need?

819
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,940
Well, I shouldn't ask you that.

820
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,680
But don't you really?

821
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,140
You need an excuse more than you need the forgiveness.

822
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,900
You know, let's be practical about it.

823
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,320
Well, now, you keep talking about this Bob,

824
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:40,480
and I've seen pictures of him, certainly a lot of drawings of him,

825
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:46,360
and yet I've never heard, you sent me several of the books

826
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,360
and the tapes and stuff over the years.

827
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,340
I've never actually heard Bob's voice.

828
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,240
I've never seen a photograph of him.

829
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,680
Well, you've seen plenty of photographs of him.

830
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,780
You pick up any old...

831
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,380
Better Homes and Gardens, Popular Science.

832
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:03,360
From the 50s and early 60s, Bob modeled for ads.

833
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,460
He's that guy with the pipe,

834
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,960
the grinning sort of a Ward Cleaver-ish,

835
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,880
Dick Van Dyke-looking fellow

836
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,600
with this sort of slightly crazed grin.

837
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,960
And he's got a pipe.

838
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,020
You may have seen pictures of him spray-painted

839
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:23,440
on bridge abutments and dumpsters and so forth.

840
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,040
Here and there.

841
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,780
Yeah, Greenwich Village is a bar on Avenue 2.

842
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:28,720
Avenue A and 7th Street, I think, 7A.

843
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,760
And on the side, I've seen his picture there.

844
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,640
Also, there's a newsstand on Broadway

845
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,380
where you can see Bob's picture.

846
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,780
I forget what it's called.

847
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,800
Now, at one point, some brave subgenius

848
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,780
spray-painted a Dobbs head right above the members' entrance

849
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,400
to the New York Stock Exchange.

850
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:46,740
Wow.

851
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,800
That must have been a tricky one.

852
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:54,720
But, yeah, you've seen Bob your whole life.

853
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,260
You've been...

854
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,760
Those smiling, positive...

855
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:59,180
Wipe-smoking, all-American gents

856
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,460
sitting in hammocks or pushing a lawnmower

857
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,740
in those old magazine ads.

858
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,280
He did some radio ads, too,

859
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,220
but he has suppressed those

860
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,600
because of the voiceprint problems.

861
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,520
You know, there's security problems nowadays

862
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,960
with computers and so forth.

863
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,480
If you can get a voiceprint of somebody,

864
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,740
you can get into their high-security bank vaults

865
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:18,260
and so forth.

866
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,100
So Bob has some of these high-security bank vaults

867
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,640
and clearances in government buildings and stuff?

868
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,120
Well, Bob was originally...

869
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:30,800
A part and parcel of the higher economic conspiracy.

870
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,320
He was part of the...

871
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,800
He was in the Bilderbergers Commission,

872
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,500
or, I mean, the Trilateral Commission,

873
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,580
the Bilderbergers.

874
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,860
I heard something about him actually training Ronald Reagan.

875
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,440
He gave Reagan some training.

876
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,480
Yeah, it kind of backfired in a way.

877
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:47,140
We had to take away Ron's membership,

878
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,300
subgenius membership,

879
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,860
although lately he's been beginning to earn it back

880
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,960
just in the last month, few months.

881
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:53,500
How's that?

882
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,980
Well, he's become more of a subgenius,

883
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:56,660
less of a...

884
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:57,680
a dupe of the conspiracy.

885
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,340
I understand that he is sort of like the man

886
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,260
who mistook his wife for a hat

887
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:08,420
and is mistaking bookshelves for trees and things like that.

888
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,060
He's becoming more and more Bob-like.

889
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,260
You see, Bob...

890
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:16,840
So in other words, what's good about this subgenius organization

891
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,700
is you can find enlightenment in bafflement,

892
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,220
is what you're kind of saying here.

893
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:26,480
Well, Bob is not what you would call...

894
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:28,020
a brilliant man.

895
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,960
Hence the word church of the subgenius.

896
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,040
You notice this isn't church of the genius.

897
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:36,520
Some geniuses out there may have noticed that by now.

898
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,880
But it's not...

899
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,400
What Bob has been trying to say is

900
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,360
it's not the intelligence that counts.

901
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,460
It's just plain old sense.

902
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,200
Horse sense, common sense, sense of humor,

903
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,620
and most importantly of all, dollars and cents.

904
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:56,660
Bob, in an oddly forest gum,

905
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:00,840
seems to operate entirely by accident.

906
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,620
He's not the smartest man in the world,

907
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:05,620
and he may very well be the dumbest man in the world.

908
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,480
It doesn't matter because he is definitely

909
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,840
the luckiest man in the world.

910
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,760
What really gets you ahead in today's world?

911
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,200
Are you going to get ahead by brains?

912
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:16,140
No.

913
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,820
It's probably going to be a handicap.

914
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,100
I mean, do you get good dates because of brains?

915
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,880
What was the last time you fell in love with somebody

916
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,920
because they were smart?

917
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,420
You know, it's...

918
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:26,440
It's...

919
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,740
It's slack and luck is what you...

920
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:34,640
As Bob said, I'd rather be lucky than good any day.

921
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:40,480
Bob has also said such witticisms

922
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,200
that are actually true, truly wise statements.

923
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,320
He can only sort of speak in one-liners,

924
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,480
but he's known for the quote...

925
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,780
He teaches you to pull the wool over your own eyes

926
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:56,100
and relax in the safety of your own delusions.

927
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:58,860
What do you make of, in the light of this,

928
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,920
what do you make of this sudden run in Hollywood

929
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,980
of films sort of glorifying...

930
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,360
Stupidity?

931
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:06,660
Simpleness.

932
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,960
I mean, you have Gump, you have Rain Man,

933
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,720
the new one with Jodie Foster.

934
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:14,360
Being There was one of the...

935
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:14,780
Being There, yeah.

936
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:15,700
That was the classic.

937
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,020
What do you make of that?

938
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:17,620
They're based...

939
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:18,080
Why are they doing it?

940
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:18,600
They are...

941
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:22,740
Well, in some cases, they're just little tips of the hat

942
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,480
to Bob from people he helped out in the past.

943
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:26,400
In most cases...

944
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:26,400


945
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:26,400


946
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:26,400


947
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,240
In most cases, though, it's a concerted effort

948
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,100
by the conspiracy to make the name Bob acute,

949
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,300
you know, to normalize it.

950
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:37,640
And people named Bob are laid back and normal,

951
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:43,280
and it's also sort of reassuring.

952
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:46,200
They're trying to present a reassuring Bob,

953
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,800
a Bob without the quotes around the name Bob.

954
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,580
For instance, Microsoft Bob,

955
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,040
the new computer operating system

956
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,900
that Bill Gates has released,

957
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,160
it's the...

958
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,620
Not to be confused with me, Bill Gates.

959
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,160
No, no, no.

960
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,580
People get confused sometimes.

961
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:03,780
They often think I'm Bill Gates, but no.

962
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:04,820
I wish you were.

963
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:05,700
But anyway, go on.

964
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:07,900
It's...

965
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,860
They're trying to water down the word Bob.

966
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,920
They're trying to make it all sort of cute and funny

967
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,740
so that when everyone starts wearing T-shirts

968
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,620
with Bob Dobbs' face on it,

969
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,940
they'll never really understand what it is that he represents.

970
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,400
Because what he represents is quite dangerous

971
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:26,380
because he's a man.

972
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:28,420
A man is always dangerous to the status quo

973
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:29,960
of the normal people.

974
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,340
Of the mere humans, Bill.

975
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:35,240
Because that's really what we're saying.

976
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:39,800
It's not that we hate people of a particular type.

977
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,220
It's that we hate people.

978
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,320
We hate humans.

979
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,840
Look what the humans have done.

980
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:50,420
The subgeniuses live in complete harmony

981
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:51,920
with nature and technology.

982
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:54,560
They'll sit and watch television

983
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,260
for days and days at a time and never bother anybody.

984
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,660
The normals, though, they have to have the fanciest television,

985
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:01,960
the fanciest car.

986
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,100
Even if they can't afford it, they have to have all that stuff

987
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:08,340
because they've been taught a form of false slack.

988
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:14,080
The type of slack that Bob is trying to promote is true slack,

989
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:15,580
the slack that doesn't cost anything.

990
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:20,920
A subgenius can amuse itself sitting in a dark room stark naked.

991
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:21,160
Naked.

992
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:25,080
We don't have to be going to the movies or reading the latest cool book

993
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:29,780
or going to the latest hot groovy club to be popular.

994
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:30,880
We don't care.

995
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:37,480
In subgenius consciousness, you can be vastly entertained

996
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,100
merely by inspecting your thumbnail for hours.

997
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:45,960
Not that we necessarily do that, but if that were the situation,

998
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,120
the subgenius makes the best of it.

999
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,060
A lump of mud.

1000
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:53,820
Mud seethes with infinite potentialities

1001
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:57,560
when seen in Dobbs' consciousness, my friend.

1002
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:57,940
Wow.

1003
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,180
Let's, uh...

1004
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,640

1005
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:17,640

1038
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,000


1039
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,040
¶¶

1040
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,000
I have something to show.

1041
00:50:55,380 --> 00:51:06,000
So for now I just guess I'll just fake it and forget everything that I know.

1042
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:13,700
Every back's always thin words.

1043
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:20,520
Twisted inside and out.

1044
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,680
Could someone please tell me.

1045
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:34,240
What the f*** life's about.

1046
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,700
There ain't no big payoff.

1047
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,620
At the end of your road.

1048
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:56,000
If you think that you're way off.

1049
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,760
No matter what you've been told.

1050
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,840
If your savior is coming.

1051
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:17,000
He won't like what he'll find.

1052
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,760
Every one of God's children.

1053
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:30,840
Driven half out of their mind.

1054
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:38,320
Every back's always thin words.

1055
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:43,300
Twisted inside and out.

1056
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:43,680
Twisted inside and out.

1057
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:43,680


1058
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:43,680


1059
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:44,240
Every f***ing word.

1060
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:44,940
Every day and that.

1061
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,300
Could someone please tell me.

1062
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:59,240
Where it's supposed to be at.

1063
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,060
Well I think the time has come.

1064
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,160
No matter where you're at in the plot so far.

1065
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,020
Just put down your script now.

1066
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,880
Just forget all the stuff.

1067
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,880
Just forget all the stuff you're doing.

1068
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,400
You were told you're supposed to do.

1069
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:20,080
Now if you were ever in a rock band.

1070
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,060
And got screwed over by a club owner.

1071
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,940
Even if you played in Wheeling.

1072
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,880
No, Wheeling.

1073
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,280
Just to ease your troubled consciousness.

1074
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,020
We brought in at great expense.

1075
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:34,960
The Consumer Product Vocal Ensemble.

1076
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,240
Direct from Seattle.

1077
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,940
Yeah, we know we haven't quite reached Nirvana yet.

1078
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:42,720
But we keep trying.

1079
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,000
We've got Dan Liss over there dressed up as John Paul.

1080
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,040
Doing his impression of Kurt Cobain.

1081
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,380
You got the hair Dan?

1082
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:50,560
Okay.

1083
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:53,660
Now we're going for the big record deal here.

1084
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,720
We've spared no expense.

1085
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:59,300
Rich Poston is going to be having a grunge guitar war a little bit later over there.

1086
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,900
We'll even throw in a little Styx if we have to.

1087
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:07,500
Truly inspirational guys.

1088
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,300
And now for the fake bar room scene direct from Maddie's.

1089
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,700
We're going to duplicate right here in the room.

1090
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,280
The recording studio.

1091
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:17,200
The now infamous I Bobbed Dead Rockstar costume contest.

1092
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,200
Up first for her submission in the semi-finals.

1093
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,040
Direct from the Crescent City camera crew Elvira.

1094
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:27,720
Hi guys.

1095
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:28,600
Ready for the big one?

1096
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:33,380
Now in an attempt to get more mileage out of this musical vampire.

1097
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,900
We've got the bar all set up.

1098
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:37,780
For any record executive listening.

1099
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,440
We have beef beer.

1100
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,000
For a really dry martini.

1101
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,620
Here's how to make one.

1102
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,120
Some beef feedback SP làm trcc ở trras morteleton Tr Oder Mek, gỗ tr Green

1103
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,300
rude결estea lýmien qua hai 1 pound ice with a twist of lemon.

1104
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,680
And an olive too.

1105
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:00,480
And shake it not stirred.

1106
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,480
And we'll get monster shak perquè ngồi còn tiếp hiện mang mẹ.

1107
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:04,920
Brain!

1108
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,920
Ladies and gentlemen, our special guest tonight,

1109
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,880
the Reverend Joey, sorry I forked the hooker,

1110
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:14,540
but a Foucault.

1111
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:17,060
Ladies and gentlemen, my friends,

1112
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,440
and you all, my friends,

1113
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,180
we are gathered here tonight

1114
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:22,300
to do ourselves with the Holy Spirit.

1115
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:23,680
Are you with the Rosary Sisters?

1116
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:26,380
If you want to sing the Bible, say it in the air.

1117
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,500
Since back when Adam and Eve

1118
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,340
lived in the garden of Beda,

1119
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,160
we have always been sinners.

1120
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,260
In the eyes of God,

1121
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,460
in the eyes of God,

1122
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,820
just because God is our God,

1123
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,740
we will sing to ourselves,

1124
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,160
God's the idol.

1125
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,400
Come on now, sing it one more time,

1126
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:47,860
but with me.

1127
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:48,920
See you.

1128
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,420
Yes, dear friends,

1129
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,180
a little bit of Dr. Bizarro there

1130
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:59,480
from his type album.

1131
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,140
Every back's always thing one.

1132
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,580
And I'm going to give you that address to write to

1133
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:09,220
for more information about Dr. Bizarro's wonderful tapes.

1134
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,620
And he's got plenty of them.

1135
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:13,560
Got that pencil ready?

1136
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,160
And you're going to need that pencil ready

1137
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,520
for a stretch now.

1138
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:22,980
That's Dr. Bizarro at iBobDigital.

1139
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,560
Yes, iBobDigital.

1140
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,800
P.O. Box 3405.

1141
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:32,640
That's Box 3405.

1142
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,200
In Skokie.

1143
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:38,620
Skokie, Illinois.

1144
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:42,580
A 6-00-7-6.

1145
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:47,040
Or you can call Dr. Bizarro's information machine

1146
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:53,480
at 708-982-WOWS.

1147
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:56,400
That's 708-982-WOWS.

1148
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:58,760
Yes.

1149
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:01,020
Yes.

1150
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:01,240
Yes.

1151
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:01,540


1152
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:01,740


1153
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:01,980
Yes.

1154
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:02,880


1155
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:02,880


1156
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:02,880


1157
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:02,960
Yes.

1158
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:02,960


1159
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:03,140
Yes.

1160
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:03,140


1161
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:03,140


1162
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:03,140


1163
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:03,140


1164
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:03,140


1165
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:03,720
Yes.

1166
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,180
And friends,

1167
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,320
for more information on the Church of the Subgenius

1168
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,700
heard falling off the bridge in the background there,

1169
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:15,360
please send a self-addressed

1170
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,440
stamped envelope to

1171
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:19,820
Bob.

1172
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,580
Just go ahead and make that to Bob

1173
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:24,520
at Post Office Box

1174
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,400
140306

1175
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,680
Dallas, Texas

1176
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,080
75214

1177
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:38,700
That's Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1178
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:43,580
We're listening to Arnold Mathis here in the background,

1179
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:49,080
and I really should give Dr. Mathis' address for his fine synthesizer tapes.

1180
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:56,600
That's Arnold Mathis, 2750 Homecrest Avenue,

1181
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:02,060
2750 Homecrest, Brooklyn, New York.

1182
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:05,040
1-1-2-3-5.

1183
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:08,220
And what other credits must I give while I'm thinking about it here?

1184
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:11,240
From the, well, let's see.

1185
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:12,700
We gave Phineas' credits.

1186
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:20,400
The humorous materials there about Stephen Hawking's sexy brother

1187
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:26,860
and the humor editorial are from an addressless CD,

1188
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:31,880
not for broadcast, tasteless sketch comedy featuring the radio pirates.

1189
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:33,400
And some of it is.

1190
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,880
We also heard quite a bit of media barrage editing

1191
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,820
from the old subgenius tape, Bad Doctors.

1192
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:44,900
And you can get, actually, anything we play, you can get more information

1193
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:50,240
if you just drop us that line to P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214,

1194
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:52,880
or email us or fax us.

1195
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:59,160
The email address is i.stang at metronet.com,

1196
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,500
and the fax number is 214.

1197
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,280
320.

1198
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,160
That's 214.

1199
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:06,940
320.

1200
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,380
1561.

1201
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:18,000
Yeah, we were listening to some clips from the Bad Doctors media barrage subgenius tape.

1202
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:25,560
A little bit of the good Dr. Bleepo Abernathy interviewing yours truly, Reverend Stang,

1203
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:28,960
about Bob.

1204
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:31,580
Yeah.

1205
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:32,600
I said,

1206
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:40,820
and for the rest of, well, we don't have much of an hour here,

1207
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:46,960
but, well, let's just listen to some sample clips from the most recent subgenius revival.

1208
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:50,060
Ah, yes, dear friends.

1209
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,880
Cool boxer shorts are only 16 bucks.

1210
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:00,720
They wouldn't be that much except that there's a glow-in-the-dark anti-Bob on those,

1211
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,200
which is printed in radium.

1212
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:03,800
There really is.

1213
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:09,520
It's printed in radium, though, in order to ensure that you never have normal children.

1214
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:14,940
Does anybody have a dime or a penny I can tighten this mic with?

1215
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,760
God, man, I'm the roadie again.

1216
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,840
Does anybody have a penny?

1217
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,040
I'm serious.

1218
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,640
Just to tighten this thing up.

1219
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,340
One penny.

1220
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:25,320
God, what a faithless.

1221
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:26,800
They want a miracle.

1222
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,320
Oh, yeah, they'll pay a penny for it.

1223
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,740
I'm going to keep that penny.

1224
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:31,100
Sucker.

1225
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:32,480
Okay.

1226
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:35,680
The most important news, I'm sure to most of you,

1227
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:42,140
is that the price of beer just went down to one dollar ticket per liquid slack dose.

1228
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:48,940
You can now dose yourself up on liquid slack to the point where you'll really be sorry tomorrow,

1229
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,220
and you'll go, why did Bob let me do it?

1230
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:55,660
See, they always blame everything on whatever the God involved is.

1231
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,040
You can do that.

1232
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,080
Sure, why not?
