1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
Hey, hey, hey, oh!

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,680
Oh, yes, dear friends, you gotta go.

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,980
Ruben, you must go. Everyone must go.

4
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,300
Even Joe King must go.

5
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,680
And lo, out of the darkness came a voice.

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,180
And it was the voice of the people raising up.

7
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:43,340
And it was called K-N-O-N 89.3 FM in Dallas, Texas.

8
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:51,920
And lo, the voice spokeeth across the waters of the airwaves.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,440
And it said, and it said,

10
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,240
Ahem!

11
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,140
And, uh-huh, the voice said,

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,720
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

13
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:13,280
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to

14
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,420
The Self Genius Hour of Life!

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,500
And the listeners heard.

16
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,280
And they said,

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,820
Yea, though it causeth my ears anguish and my brain to hurt,

18
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,160
Between my ears,

19
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,200
Nevertheless it is good.

20
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,060
And so they pledged to their station and made it rich.

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,660
And likewise the listeners became rich in their poverty, for they were rich in slap.

22
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,500
I heard things.

23
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,620
What things you heard?

24
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,620
I heard some things.

25
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,640
Hey, you heard things.

26
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,800
I heard some things.

27
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:57,800


28
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:57,800


29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:57,800


30
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,480
But you heard nothing.

31
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:04,680
I do not shout.

32
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,940
I hear nothing.

33
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,640
I do not say.

34
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,400
Master, you must pray?

35
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:08,400


36
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:08,400


37
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:08,560


38
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,360
There must be something in you,

39
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,060
Is there a strict claim to your service to me?

40
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,120

60
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,380
let me tell you

61
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,600
the story

62
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,980
of jr bob dobbs

63
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,100
bread of men in yeti

64
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,620
he walked with the gods

65
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,060
he wore a silly grin

66
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,880
and he smoked a

67
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,380
suicide pipe

68
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,380
he fought the conspiracy

69
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,520
every day of

70
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,340
his life

71
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,680
born to

72
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,540
humble parents somewhere in the

73
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,460
midwest the child bob

74
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:19,700
who spoth Mamet

75
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:25,940
experienced a traumatic close encounter with a UFO at the age of three. Soon

76
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:32,340
thereafter he began to exhibit strange powers of persuasion. By age six he had

77
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:38,160
made his first million, almost by accident. In college he met and married

78
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,180
his first and still his primary wife, Connie, who is now revered by female

79
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:50,880
subgenie as the blessed anti-virgin. With Connie's encouragement the young

80
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,580
Dobbs became a salesman of legendary, almost frightening, abilities known to

81
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:01,260
his peers as the man who could sell anything. He worked his way up to the

82
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:07,320
very top of the conspiracy ladder and might have stayed there. But late one

83
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,540
night in 1953 while working on an amateur television of his own design an

84
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,160
event occurred which was to become a

85
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:21,540
milestone on man's mind path to slack. He was suddenly seized up in the spirit

86
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:27,720
by the hand of Jehovah One itself, the cosmic puppeteer of the Old Testament,

87
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:34,260
the wrathful alien space god from some corporate sin galaxy. In this timeless

88
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:40,360
moment which we call the divine immaculation of the Bob, Dobbs received

89
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,700
the first of countless brain-curdling pronouncements

90
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:50,040
which formed the sacred pre-scriptures of the church. He was shown a vision, a

91
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:55,620
world where all humanity was equally wealthy, rich beyond imagining, but

92
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:01,840
without working. This experience combined with his UFO given sales magic led him

93
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,480
inevitably into the religion field. He quickly discovered the golden rule

94
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:13,680
embodied in his classic saying, they'll pay to know what they really think. This is Bob, Bob's God.

95
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:19,040
Speaking. You say that you make yourself sure sound dumb. Loosen some of your halos sister.

96
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,840
Praise the Lord. That Beelzebub, that Lucifer, that angel of darkness, he's come.

97
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:31,020
Don't you know the devil must have been excited? So the devil got all these demons

98
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,200
together. Said let's have a meeting. We've got to have a satanic summer

99
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,800
conference. So he got together with all of his little demons and I imagine

100
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,580
little oriental demon stood up and said, pardon me Mr. Devil.

101
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:50,580
Just wait until tomorrow. Just wait until next week. Just wait till things get

102
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,660
better and they never get right and they die and they go to hell.

103
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:01,540
What does Bob do? Does Bob yield? Well if Bob gets wrong and I get wrong that must be

104
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:06,500
all right. Well if Bob gets wrong and I get wrong that must be all right. That

105
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,240
must be all right. You're not gonna stand up and hear my tape played. You go hear

106
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,600
your tape played and it won't be in a secretary around till

107
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,840
you raise a part of it. You might need just take off and run. Bob's running with

108
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,780
the devil. So you're gonna run way to the other. One way or the other. What else

109
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,500
do you do? I'm seeing a few people talking up in these bleachers while I'm

110
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,100
talking. I don't want no more of that. I'll embarrass you to death in a few

111
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:38,040
moments. You need to run. That means you need to premeditate your pressure points.

112
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,420
Brother Bob the devil's after me all the time. I said wait really? Because the

113
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,540
The devil doesn't ever bother me much.

114
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,020
He usually puts a demon or two on me.

115
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,800
They can take care of me.

116
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,500
If the phone rings and there's somebody you don't want to talk to,

117
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,060
run from the phone.

118
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,280
I'm glad you came.

119
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,700
You're hearing a preacher preach.

120
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,620
I hope you're listening.

121
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,380
I hope you're listening.

122
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:02,840
Ooh.

123
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,000
Ooh.

124
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,040
Ooh.

125
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,200
Man, those first few months, I wore out three pair of breeches.

126
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,340
I learned to talk to God.

127
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,100
I learned to talk to God.

128
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,720
See, because for a person to get saved and just quit smoking, drinking,

129
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,500
cussing, chewing, and acting ugly, drying up, and dying,

130
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,320
they become bored to death.

131
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,380
They become bored to death.

132
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,460
Some of the most dead-looking, bored, dissipated-looking,

133
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,520
pew-packing papas I ever see are church members.

134
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,940
When they sit on a pew, they so dead the termites move.

135
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,380
That's right, dear friends.

136
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,680
Even the termites get to chewing away on you.

137
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,860
That was cut together by Craig Shropshire,

138
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,460
who used to do the music for a new age show,

139
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,300
Chota, to you KON listeners.

140
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,740
Edited that and several other things coming up.

141
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,580
But in the meantime, as I said earlier,

142
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,200
we're...

143
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,360
We're...

144
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:09,360


145
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:09,360


146
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,060
Going to be quoting the Bible.

147
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,360
And these are some lines from the Bible that may come in handy

148
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,440
to any of you who are like the kid in Catholic school

149
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,000
that's always asking things like,

150
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,900
Hey, Father, can, like, uh...

151
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,240
Can, like, God create a rock so big he can't move it?

152
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,500
Or...

153
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,020
Who did Cain marry?

154
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,580
Or...

155
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,400
The old favorite.

156
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,520
But if God is, like, all-loving,

157
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,240
why does he let people go to eternal hellfire and damnation?

158
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:44,040
And whether every atom is in excruciating pain forever and ever and ever

159
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,880
just because they were born in pango-pango and never got baptized,

160
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,020
even if they otherwise lived by the rules of Jesus

161
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,940
without ever hearing from him?

162
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,500
Huh?

163
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,460
And, uh, tricky questions like that.

164
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:06,720
So, we have a some Bible quotes there, friends.

165
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,260
Uh, here's a good one.

166
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,320
From Luke 14, 26.

167
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,480
Jesus said,

168
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:20,480
If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife

169
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,840
and children and brothers and sisters,

170
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,360
yes, and even his own life,

171
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,620
he cannot be my disciple.

172
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,480
Corinthians 11, 5.

173
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:39,300
But every woman who has her head uncovered while praying or prophesying

174
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,880
disgraces her head,

175
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:46,320
for she is one and the same with her whose head is shaved.

176
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,380
Behold, I, Paul, say to you,

177
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,080
Galatians 5, 2,

178
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,680
I say to you that if you receive circumcision,

179
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,460
Christ will be of no benefit to you.

180
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,500
Timothy 2, 12.

181
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:08,460
But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man,

182
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,280
but to,

183
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,460
to remain quiet.

184
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,240
Potentially embarrassing, I suppose, to, uh, some people.

185
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,680
And back, going back to the Old Testament,

186
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,200
uh, Exodus 21, 17.

187
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:29,240
And he who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.

188
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,040
Leviticus 19, 19.

189
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,360
You are to keep my statutes.

190
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,740
You shall not breed together two kinds of cattle.

191
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,360
You shall not sow your field with two kinds of cattle.

192
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,040
You shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed.

193
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,340
Nor wear a garment upon you of two kinds of material mixed together.

194
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,460
Now, friend, is that shirt you're wearing anything less than 100% cotton?

195
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,460
You sinner.

196
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,180
Uh, Leviticus 19, 27.

197
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,900
You shall not round off the side growth of your heads,

198
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,780
nor harm the edges of your beard.

199
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,560
Now, what is the edge?

200
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,920
Where is the edge, you know?

201
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,260
Leviticus 20, 18.

202
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,340
If there is a man who lies with a menswear,

203
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,280
and a monstrous woman,

204
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,880
and uncovers her nakedness,

205
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,260
he has laid bare her flow,

206
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,380
and she has exposed the flow of her blood.

207
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,640
Thus both of them shall be cut off from among their people.

208
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,060
Deuteronomy 23, 1.

209
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:33,420
No one who is emasculated, or has his male organ cut off,

210
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,280
shall enter the assembly of the Lord.

211
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,820
Now, I know this isn't against FCC rules,

212
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,340
because this is a law.

213
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,620
This is straight out of the King James Version, my friends.

214
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,840
Uh, in, uh, Kings 2, 23, 24.

215
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,380
This is one of my dad's favorites.

216
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,340
He's a Methodist lay preacher.

217
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,920
He likes to point out that, uh,

218
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,080
because they made fun of the prophet Elijah's bald head,

219
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:05,160
God caused 42 little children to be torn apart by bears.

220
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,140
And the she-bears came from the woods,

221
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,280
and tore them.

222
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,480
Um, Hosea 13, 16.

223
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,780
Samaria will be held guilty,

224
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,120
for she has rebelled against her God.

225
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,900
They will fall by the sword,

226
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,380
and their little ones will be dashed in pieces,

227
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,580
and their pregnant women will be ripped open.

228
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,440
But on the other hand,

229
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,000
look at it this way.

230
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,120
John 10, 34.

231
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,200
Jesus answered them,

232
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,740
Has it not been written in your law,

233
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,980
I said,

234
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,940
You are gods?

235
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,080
Uh, yes.

236
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,060
There's quite a few things that were cut from the Bible, actually.

237
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,120
From a historical perspective,

238
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,900
it's interesting to see that, uh,

239
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,100
certain books that were written, uh,

240
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,040
then were not accepted as canonical.

241
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,380
Some of these include the books of the Apocrypha

242
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,080
and the Gnostic Gospels,

243
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,060
which, uh, were recently discovered in 1945

244
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,960
by Muhammad Ali Ali,

245
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,900
al-Saman Muhammad Khalifaq,

246
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,380
uh, translated as the Nag Hammadi Library.

247
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,480
And they present a very different picture of Jesus

248
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,820
in the early church than the common Christian view.

249
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,560
Now, many of these writings have an authority equal to

250
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,800
or greater than the canonical Gospels,

251
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,140
because they were written for Egyptians rather than Romans.

252
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:32,660
So they're free of the pro-Roman bias, censorship, and revision

253
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,800
that the, uh, early mainstream Christian cults used.

254
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,940
These writings lend support to the theories that,

255
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,740
for instance, Jesus was married and had children,

256
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,920
that Jesus did not die upon the cross.

257
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,820
Uh, the Gospel of Philip says,

258
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,840
and the companion of the Savior is Mary Magdalene,

259
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,520
but Christ loved her more than all the disciples

260
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,740
and used to kiss her often on the mouth.

261
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,620
Some historians have stated that the word translated, uh,

262
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,780
companion is more practical.

263
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,280
It's properly translated as spouse.

264
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,200
This same Gospel says,

265
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,580
there is the Son of Man,

266
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,900
and there is the Son of the Son of Man.

267
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,240
The Lord is the Son of Man,

268
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,360
and the Son of the Son of Man is He who is created

269
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,500
through the Son of Man.

270
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,580
Now, you figure that out, my friend.

271
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,220
There is a lot cut from the Bible,

272
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,080
and here's some more lines they cut.

273
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,080
Uh, these are from, uh, uh,

274
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,560
Jesus could hit a baseball so hard

275
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,020
it would go all the way around the world,

276
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,800
and hit him in the back of the head

277
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,100
if he was still standing there 47 hours later.

278
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,440
Ecclesians 6.14,

279
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,160
And lo, on the seventh day,

280
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,480
while God rested and was not looking,

281
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,220
the first bob created him extra beasts of the field,

282
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,980
and among these were the jackalopes,

283
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,900
and the passenger pigeons,

284
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,380
and dodos,

285
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,560
and giant ground sloths,

286
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,780
and flu viruses,

287
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,560
and giant lake serpents,

288
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,700
and bigfoots,

289
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,040
and diasgudises,

290
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,220
and snipe birds.

291
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,760
And he looked upon his handiwork and said,

292
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,780
Lo, it is good.

293
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,180
And on the eighth day,

294
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,640
when God awoke and saw what Bob had done,

295
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,260
he said unto Bob,

296
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:33,560
Lo, these beasts of the field are unclean in mine eyes,

297
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,840
and of foul odour to my nostrils.

298
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,020
And so I shall let my children,

299
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,060
Adam and Eve,

300
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,880
have brains that they might disobey,

301
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,560
and after a certain time

302
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,740
they shall slay all thine animals

303
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,540
which are ludicrous before mine eyes.

304
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,040
And on the ninth day,

305
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,900
the first bob, in his sadness,

306
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,360
created him certain plants of the field,

307
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,040
such as habifrops,

308
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,940
and zippulops,

309
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,380
and hops,

310
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,000
and grains,

311
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,040
and strange yeasts,

312
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,660
and mould,

313
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,880
and fungi,

314
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,980
that God's children might eat of them,

315
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,060
and fall down and have visions.

316
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,400
And then God saw what Bob had done,

317
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,340
and he putteth his arm over Bob's shoulder,

318
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,920
and they both laughed with a great heartiness

319
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,260
that shook the earth.

320
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,440
For the Lord was glad at Bob's jokes,

321
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,060
and said,

322
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,960
Bob, thou hast shown unto me slack,

323
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,980
so thou art surely my son,

324
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,100
or at least my adopted son,

325
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:46,120
dearer to me than my shiftless real son,

326
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,260
Satan, that old serpent.

327
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,260
And from that day on,

328
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,640
both the Lord and Bob made merry,

329
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,080
and enjoyed great mirth,

330
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,940
as they made more jokes upon creation

331
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,320
and man forevermore.

332
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,700
The music there was by Art Zoid,

333
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,560
also courtesy of Craig.

334
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,140
And...

335
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,860
Just plain dead!

336
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,540
I'm down here in a restaurant eating a steak

337
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,480
and run up on a gristle,

338
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:28,920
I'm not gonna give you a hand,

339
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,360
I'm not gonna sit there and fight that gristle!

340
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,980
I'm gonna move around in a hop-over

341
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,100
and get back to the meat!

342
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,020
I don't understand that spot.

343
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,080
Well, dum-dum, jump that spot!

344
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,960
I mean, I'm still glad you came, right here.

345
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,260
And if my heart is made to love,

346
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,100
I want it to love my sponsor!

347
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,500
I've gotta keep my excitement exciting.

348
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,760
Let me give you the truth about exorcism.

349
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,840
And the whole truth about exorcism is this.

350
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,240
Somebody's gonna have everybody.

351
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,300
And the question is, who's got you?

352
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,900
I know a lot of people in the educational field,

353
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,380
they're dedicated to education.

354
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,940
That means they're going to hell smart.

355
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,240
Hogwash!

356
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,120
You better put your faith in somewhere it counts!

357
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,660
Keep your excitement in where it ought to be.

358
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,920
You just go into hell with a bucket on your head

359
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,360
and a fuzz hang off the side.

360
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,240
Ha ha ha ha!

361
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,460
.

362
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,560
.

363
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,240
I just see some of you right now saying,

364
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,760
well, I don't like this kind of preaching.

365
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,920
Well, big deal!

366
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,580
I know a lot of good masons.

367
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,480
I know some mason men and mason fruit jars.

368
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:38,720
.

369
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,400
What he'd tempt Bob to do, he wouldn't tempt you to do.

370
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,820
But whatever area you need tempting, he can make it available.

371
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,420
What in the world is wrong with you, woman?

372
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,220
Call me.

373
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,440
Call me.

374
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,100
.

375
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,100
At 8237-490.

376
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,920
Best way in the world for you and me to be victorious

377
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,140
is to call the manager.

378
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,620
This is Bob speaking.

379
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,540
.

380
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:04,540


381
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,140
.

382
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,360
Yes, yesterday's brains are here.

383
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:21,740
.

384
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:26,920
A slow but steady intelligence leading me by the nose.

385
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,320
.

386
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,080
To the table.

387
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,420
.

388
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,880
This war has spread.

389
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:30,400
.

390
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,580
You can't eat eagles.

391
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:31,960
.

392
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,800
You must watch my feet.

393
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,060
.

394
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:34,360
First.

395
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:34,660
.

396
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,500
And then the crocs shall strike free.

397
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:36,880
.

398
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,300
Inflicting heavy casualties.

399
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:38,560
.

400
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,320
And you're out to lunch.

401
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:39,740
.

402
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,900
I'll take care of this.

403
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,280
I brought my plastic.

404
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:42,560
.

405
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,620
Simon Peter assided to me as I flopped out my wallet.

406
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,120
.

407
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,960
His bulging.

408
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,260
.

409
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:47,620
Belching.

410
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:47,960
.

411
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,640
Bronze tan.

412
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,060
.

413
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,280
Voice.

414
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:49,700
.

415
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,020
Carried through the cafe. .

416
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:51,700
Intentionally.

417
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:51,980
.

418
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,700
Trying to impress the boss, eh, Pete?

419
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,000
.

420
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,060
Paul retorted.

421
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,300
.

422
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,040
His bracketed.

423
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:56,080
.

424
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,680
Enclosed.

425
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,080
.

426
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:57,520
Bumshel.

427
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,040
.

428
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,260
Voice.

429
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,060
.

430
00:20:59,060 --> 00:20:59,680
Blast.

431
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,280
.

432
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:00,600
.

433
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,020
Booming.

434
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,300
.

435
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:01,420
Across.

436
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:01,980
.

437
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,620
The Neverwax.

438
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:02,800
.

439
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,520
Floor tiles.

440
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,320
.

441
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,100
Boys.

442
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,160


443
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,740
Boys.

444
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:06,500
.

445
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:06,580
Jesus.

446
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,280
.

447
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:07,780
Cleared his.

448
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,280
.

449
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:08,780
Trout.

450
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,180
.

451
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:09,960
Accordionly.

452
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,320
.

453
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,580
Aye, but I like a draw.

454
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:11,920
.

455
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,020
Maggie moaned to a greasy pair of glasses.

456
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,360
.

457
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,540
Jesus dawned.

458
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:15,660
.

459
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,080
The spectacle and declaimed the onside click.

460
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:18,900
.

461
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,600
When in Rome. .

462
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:21,900
.

463
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,340
Jesus was jousted. .

464
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:27,780
Indeed the Roman enumerator's bogus man. .

465
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:27,880
.

466
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,780
John announced from under the table. .

467
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:29,960
.

468
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,380
John found his fork. .

469
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:31,700
.

470
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,940
And thrust. .

471
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:32,980
.

472
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,340
His precepts. .

473
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:34,360
.

474
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:34,420
.

475
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,380
In a must unquainly manner. .

476
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:37,580
.

477
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:37,660
.

478
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:37,660


479
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,760
Upon his stable-mates. .

480
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:39,820
.

481
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,920
They called on us for an explanation. .

482
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:41,920


483
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,700
John jumped. .

484
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,080
But Judas couldn't explain his order. .

485
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,400
And the waitress confused did utter.

486
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,560
Look, mister, you must tell me what you want.

487
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,480
Robin Force abused my influence.

488
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,360
I can't read your mind.

489
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,120
The two of us spent a second fooling in and had a strange vision.

490
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,620
He was holding the bearded lord in his wrists.

491
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,260
Rado style.

492
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,080
Racking to a crazy beat.

493
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,520
Faster and faster than slower.

494
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,840
He heard Cab Calloway singing.

495
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,360
Minnie the Moocher.

496
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,720
He smelled the hearty wrath.

497
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,060
Of twice burned toast.

498
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,700
In trembling egghead earnesty.

499
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,960
He touched and tasted a thousand things.

500
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,860
And was unsure and mortally bounced.

501
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,900
Into the street to find wherefore.

502
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,440
And what not.

503
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,260
On the bench.

504
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,540
That's pronounced guilty.

505
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,880
The others tittered and toasted.

506
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,300
But Jesus savored not the heart.

507
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,500
Savored not.

508
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,620
In the pit.

509
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,300
Of his ugly mug.

510
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,620
The sky rained a million volts.

511
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,740
Of lightning bolts.

512
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,740
And forty buckets.

513
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,440
Of blood.

514
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:44,760
And beer.

515
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,180
And finally Maggie skittered over.

516
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,180
To our booth.

517
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,720
Heaving and a-hoing.

518
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,280
And the streaming, steaming heap of feast.

519
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,420
She glared straight into the belly soul.

520
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,340
Of our savior.

521
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,620
Cresting.

522
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,100
You order this weather?

523
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,480
Red beans and rhymes in yesterday's brains.

524
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,860
Read the two inch video monitor implanted firmly.

525
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,840
In the forehead.

526
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,500
Of our one eyed waitress.

527
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,760
Maggie Magdalena Witts.

528
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,620
Heh heh heh.

529
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,660
Simon Peter.

530
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:13,820
Simon Peter.

531
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,060
Cuffed his face.

532
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,300
To the side of my mouth.

533
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:17,900
Hey whip.

534
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,580
I told you we should have taken him to the awful house.

535
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,140
Their food is fresher and cheaper too.

536
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,280
But let him look at his men.

537
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:26,940
You.

538
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,400
You.

539
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,420
You.

540
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:28,780
You.

541
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,720
Customer implicated by circumstance.

542
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,920
You fresh faced.

543
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:32,940
Side of bacon.

544
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,040
Too many rowers scraped the bow.

545
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,840
I could see, feel and touch.

546
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,040
His healing glaze.

547
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,120
As it shot clean through the tabular sails.

548
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,560
In Maggie's hot sauce.

549
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:43,800
The man who was the man.

550
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:43,800


551
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:43,800


552
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:43,800


553
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:43,800


554
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:43,800


555
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:43,800


556
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:43,800


557
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:43,800


558
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,360
Sliding side slots.

559
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,200
Thomas touched it too.

560
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,280
And eagerly agreed.

561
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,180
Yes.

562
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:49,860
Yes.

563
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,900
They damn well.

564
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,400
Should have eaten elsewhere.

565
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,640
But.

566
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,380
Hell.

567
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,540
Here was water.

568
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,220
Silver.

569
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,520
Leave now?

570
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,080
Why.

571
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,560
They'd look like asses.

572
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,800
They'd break my glasses too.

573
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,680
Maggie recited to no one.

574
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,460
So with their heads.

575
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,720
On their knees.

576
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,900
They broke brains.

577
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,960
In the house of the rising one.

578
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,760
It was over.

579
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:13,800


580
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:13,800


581
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:13,800


582
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:13,800


583
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:13,800


584
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:13,800


585
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:13,800


586
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,060
Easy.

587
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:14,640
All around.

588
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,540
Black coffin.

589
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,280
Olive eyeballs.

590
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,020
A rim.

591
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,480
An English translation.

592
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,440
Please.

593
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,460
Mouths watered.

594
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:21,960
At once.

595
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:22,680
And as one.

596
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,880
But before feasting.

597
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,440
As always.

598
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,360
Jesus rose.

599
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,560
He ass ended.

600
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,900
And performed a.

601
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,500
A matriarch.

602
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,220
Look faked.

603
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,260
A knowing smile.

604
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,380
Of adoration.

605
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,780
As he had been hoping for his favorite.

606
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,400
The Messiah's interpretation.

607
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,020
Of Chinook's.

608
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,520
Fresh water.

609
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,340
The boys ate.

610
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,440
Feverishly.

611
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,360
Judas.

612
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:42,920
The joker.

613
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,780
Choked on.

614
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:43,780


615
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,840
Thirty slivers.

616
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,480
As usual.

617
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,260
He got a big pat on the back side.

618
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:47,540
Back side.

619
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,840
For his.

620
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,460
Deep.

621
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,220
Trouble.

622
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,200
The lettuce braid.

623
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,460
And everybody.

624
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,260
Said it was Grace's fault.

625
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,920
For extolling the stone.

626
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,220
In front of the shameless.

627
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:57,880
Steel.

628
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,660
Vault.

629
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,160
The dirty dozen.

630
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:00,980
Ordered donuts.

631
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:01,680
In haste.

632
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,240
They ordered bagels.

633
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:03,660
Dry.

634
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,360
Then they ordered many hundreds.

635
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,320
Of hot dogs.

636
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,940
Then they ordered the tube steaks.

637
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,440
To jump.

638
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,340
Through.

639
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,760
The pastry hoops.

640
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,260
Sit up.

641
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:11,740
Big.

642
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,100
Roll.

643
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:12,780
Over.

644
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,380
And pop.

645
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,460
On to their.

646
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,100
Twelve.

647
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,260
Twirling.

648
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:16,960
Tongues.

649
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,240
Imagine their surprise.

650
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,900
When the dogs disobeyed.

651
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,860
And spelled out.

652
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,920
On Peter's placemat.

653
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,100
The word.

654
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,500
Denial.

655
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,800
Yes.

656
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,860
The instantaneous.

657
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:29,880
Gnashing.

658
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:30,640
Of teeth.

659
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,740
Sounded like a lion cub's demolition derby of the soul.

660
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,580
A smoky rabbit's nest arose from the brown.

661
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,180
James.

662
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,160
And haloed them all.

663
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,560
With the foul paw.

664
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,880
That eventually settled.

665
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:43,400
In.

666
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:43,780
Surround.

667
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:43,780


668
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:43,780


669
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:43,780


670
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:43,780


671
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:43,780


672
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:43,780


673
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:43,780


674
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,960
Judy's bulletin purse.

675
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,300
You foot the bell.

676
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,220
They all bawled at the jude.

677
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,140
Who had began to get under their skin.

678
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,580
To make it better.

679
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,560
They all.

680
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,500
Fall down drunk.

681
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,580
And asleep.

682
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,720
In Jesus.

683
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,660
White.

684
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,060
As a sheep.

685
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,040
Knuckled under.

686
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:02,760
And blake.

687
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,680
I'll never eat out.

688
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,200
Again.

689
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,820
And then he ate his words.

690
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,780
In remembrance.

691
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,160
Of red.

692
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,080
Bees.

693
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:11,940
And.

694
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,540
Wine.

695
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,760
And.

696
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:13,760


697
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:13,760


698
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:13,760


699
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:13,760


700
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:13,760


701
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:13,760


702
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,480
James.

703
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:27,600
That was G Don Truby from his album Post Hypnosis.

704
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,380
Actually G Don and Friends.

705
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,180
No telling who they may be.

706
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,600
Old manager.

707
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,020
This is Bob speaking.

708
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,440
I'm Juggler.

709
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:39,780
Wait up.

710
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,180
Do I sound like me?

711
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,260
Oh.

712
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,200
I'm Juggler.

713
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:43,700
We got something.

714
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:43,740


715
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:43,740


716
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:43,740


717
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,460
You gotta have some legs to dive.

718
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,640
Come.

719
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,020
I've told it to you.

720
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,320
All gonna do.

721
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,200
Call 823.

722
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,440
74 90.

723
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:03,200
I was a psyched out on the booger man.

724
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,380
I looked everywhere for him.

725
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,640
I was always taught as a youngster down in Sweetwater, Alabama, that the booger man was

726
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,200
going to get me.

727
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,180
You ever been that.

728
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,820
Now, any of ever been look for.

729
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,140
Alabama.

730
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,880
for him. University of Alabama.

731
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,400
University of Alabama. Don't get me.

732
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,440
Boogerman to get you. You ever been talking to the Boogerman?

733
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,500
I looked everywhere for him.

734
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,560
Bob and the Devil.

735
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,060
Bob and the Devil.

736
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,480
We're in space.

737
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,980
Now believe it.

738
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:31,960
It's real.

739
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,320
Why?

740
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,940
Why is it real?

741
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,300
Do you know where you are?

742
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:46,840
No.

743
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,060
Now where?

744
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,240
How did we get here?

745
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,660
Does anyone understand what this woman wants?

746
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,320
Have fun.

747
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,640
I love popsicles.

748
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,920
I don't know what it is.

749
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,480
I don't know what it is.

750
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,640
But whatever it is,

751
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,080
it's a property of Soviet Union.

752
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,640
Are you real?

753
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,660
Who are you?

754
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,020
Is it possible?

755
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,880
Yes, it is me.

756
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,340
Mr. Kane, is it you?

757
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,600
We thought you're dead.

758
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,580
Oh, really?

759
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,580
Well, yes and no.

760
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,500
Oh, my God.

761
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,780
Are you upstairs?

762
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,140
Sort of.

763
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,620
Sort of.

764
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,040
Friends,

765
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,320
please feel quite free

766
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,140
to call for information.

Speak to Will of Dobbs here at 823-7490.

He's ready to answer, well, not all your questions.

770
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,480
Not the ones you really, really, really want to know,

771
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,980
but the ones at least that you have to know.

772
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,420
You can also write for information.

00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,960
Wait a minute.

775
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,600
No. That's when you...

776
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,440
Excuse me, friends.

777
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,580
Bob, the big Bob in my pants got all...

778
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,460
He tried to get out.

779
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,560
Write for information, free information,

780
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,700

781
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,140

side one of your Hour of Slack show.

792
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,840
You may now fast forward to the end and flip it over.

793
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:06,500
Go down the leader just a little bit and start side two.

794
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,100
Praise Bob and thank you.

from his album, Where I Belong.

801
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,120
There's a problem with abortion.

802
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:47,960
You may have noticed that.

803
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,300
It's in the news a lot lately.

804
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,960
Look at it this way.

805
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,500
If God sends aborted babies to hell,

806
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,420
he is incredibly unjust.

807
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,440
Those babies never had a chance for salvation.

808
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,260
Such a God could not possibly be omnipotent,

809
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,400
omnibenevolent, and omniscient

810
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:18,080
if he does not condemn aborted babies to hell.

811
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,200
The Christian is taking an exceedingly evil position

812
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,420
by being against abortion.

813
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:27,800
Since most people who are born do not become Christians,

814
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,680
the prohibition of abortion causes more souls to be created,

815
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,600
which will be tortured for all eternity in hell.

816
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,880
If aborted babies go to neither heaven nor hell,

817
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,360
then the soul must not be created until some later time,

818
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,020
and Christians still have no reason to be against abortion

819
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,600
except among themselves,

820
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,820
as their own children have a much greater chance of achieving salvation.

821
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:56,660
Friends, that and the other Bible quotes

822
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,960

So in the meantime, yeah friends, you know I think the whole idea originally behind this

God guy, he wanted to have fun and they didn't come up with any of the really anti-fun stuff

841

until human beings evolved.

842
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,100
What a shame, what a shame.

Moses went up to the mountain high to find out the God, why did you make us, why?

You gotta let my people go.

That's the Rainmakers.

Old album of theirs.

00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:56,960
Whoa!

887
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,980
Call me gullible.

888
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,600
Call me an idiot.

889
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,640
Call me an idiot, man.

The new messiah.

891
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,640
An underdeveloped lighting object.

892
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,420
The things that I've never seen.

893
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,460
But I got to keep the faith.

894
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,660
Got to keep a vision.

895
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,740
And keep watching TV.

896
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,840
But I don't want to hear.

897
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,340
I want to know.

898
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,880
And it's not so clear just to let go.

899
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,500
Let go.

900
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,320
Let go.

901
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,480
Let go.

902
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:36,480


903
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,160
Let go.

904
00:37:44,300 --> 00:38:02,920
Oh, yes.

905
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:02,920


906
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:02,920


907
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,240
Check that dam door

908
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,980
Jesus Calling.

909
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,380
Wake up.

910
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,060
Wake up.

911
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:16,920
Wake up.

912
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,300
Oh no, it really was him!

913
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,920
A man with a mind.

914
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,280
I must keep saying it.

915
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,840
To myself.

916
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,420
What does that mean to you?

917
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,940
A very long time ago, there was this very powerful man.

918
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,060
In fact, he was more than a powerful man.

919
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,260
He was more like a force, of course, of course.

920
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,400
He was the one who threw the switch.

921
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,560
The switch was wired to the sun's rays.

922
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,580
Then it went right out and it made the earth.

923
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,680
It did it all in seven days.

924
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,980
I did not make this story up.

925
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,120
It has been going around for years.

926
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,200
It first came out of this old book with a capital B, C, C.

927
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,480
They say there's wisdom in that book.

928
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,820
More than you'll find in a bottle of scotch.

929
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:15,260
And if you buy what's in that book, perhaps you'd like to buy this watch.

930
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,540
Oh God, oh God, you give me such a pain.

931
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:24,820
When I think of all the things we do and don't do in your name.

932
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:29,160
Are you love? Are you lighter? Are you just a man?

933
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:33,260
I just hope I'm on your side when the sh** all hits the fan.

934
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,500
When I was born.

935
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,340
But a little lad.

936
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,760
I stood before the throne of our Lord.

937
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,760
A wide-eyed open bundle of youth.

938
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,820
But not quite on the search for truth.

939
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,000
I saw the water turn to wine.

940
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,200
I saw the church's coppers grow.

941
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:52,300
I saw more miracles in there than at the circus magic show.

942
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,540
There was this kindly man of the clock.

943
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,660
This man, he took me by the hand.

944
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:00,760
This man said I should stand erect and wait for God and his command.

945
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,840
This man, he taught me wrong from right.

946
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,720
To love the sinner and hate the sin.

947
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,240
Only words from God.

948
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,160
All I heard was not to be along with this man.

949
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:15,260
Oh God, oh God, you give me such a pain.

950
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:19,540
When I think of all the things we do and don't do in your name.

951
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,840
Are you love? Are you lighter? Are you just a man?

952
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:28,040
I just hope I'm on your side when the sh** all hits the fan.

953
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,480
I've got my crystals.

954
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,420
I've got my chance.

955
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,800
Girls think I'm cool.

956
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,800
And my tight, cheap pants.

957
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,060
All I really want to know is what I have to buy.

958
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,760
So when I kick, I can shake his hand.

959
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,500
And look him in the eye.

960
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,740
There are so many gods right now.

961
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,620
It just could drive a man insane.

962
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:58,880
And all these people running around who'd slit your throat in his good name.

963
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,040
They all got holy beads and books that make their God the one to know.

964
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,720
But I ain't never met no one who's been up there.

965
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,860
To see his show.

966
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,060
So don't be coming around to me with all your holy cosmic slump.

967
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,200
And don't be showing off your God like he's the latest spandex top.

968
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,400
While Christian soldiers go to war, crusading for the Prince of Peace.

969
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:24,480
The only preacher you can trust will give the most an ass of peace.

970
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,160
Oh God, oh God, you give me such a pain.

971
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:32,420
When I think of all the things we do and don't do in your name.

972
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,300
Are you love? Are you lighter?

973
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,800
Are you just a man?

974
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:40,920
I just hope I'm on your side when the sh** all hits the fan.

975
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,880
Nonsense. Nonsense, nonsense, nonsense.

976
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,220
I don't feel very nice.

977
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,340
I feel as if I'm having a bad dream.

978
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,240
He looks perfectly pitiful.

979
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,160
I think it's just awful.

980
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,720
Awful, awful, awful.

981
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,960
You feel fear.

982
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,840
Come close.

983
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,040
Let me dissect it.

984
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,700
Let me absorb it.

985
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,780
Bring it here.

986
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,360
Bring your brain here.

987
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,120
No!

988
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:09,820
It hurts.

989
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,780
Who hurts?

990
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,100
My head.

991
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,360
Inside.

992
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,660
It hurts inside.

993
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,140
Shut up, Randall.

994
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,960
Or I'll be nice to you.

995
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,060
Dr. Checker and Mr. Hyde.

996
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,760
Real nice guys.

997
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

998
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,180
That's the side.

999
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,560
In trouble.

1000
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,440
He tried to hide from himself.

1001
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,260
Oh, God.

1002
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:46,160
Sad men couldn't face up to the yin and the yang.

1003
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:51,000
Everybody, all of us got a shadow.

1004
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:59,360
Who knows what lies in the hearts of men?

1005
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,560
Shame.

1006
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,140
We become what we do.

1007
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,900
Not what we pretend.

1008
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:16,140
Between the intention and the expression.

1009
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,760
Between the emotion and the response.

1010
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,800
Who's the shadow?

1011
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,780
Who's the shadow?

1012
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:32,380
Who's the shadow?

1013
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,160
Who?

1014
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:34,600
Who?

1015
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,280
Me?

1016
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:48,480
Me?

1017
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:55,940
Well, that's a kid, isn't it?

1018
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:55,980
Well, that's a girl.

1019
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:55,980


1020
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:55,980


1021
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:56,140
This little enhanced' mushroom has all kinds of siters.

1022
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:56,160


1023
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:56,160


1024
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:56,160


1025
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:56,160


1026
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,360
Sometimes I fail,

1027
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,860
to follow the rules.

1028
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:03,920
On things that I want to do

1029
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,360
And other times

1030
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,420
I find myself

1031
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:12,340
Doing the very things I hate

1032
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,720
Reverend Jimmy

1033
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,620
And Tammy Bell

1034
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,700
Big time pumpers

1035
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,280
With a story to sell

1036
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,540
Wait a minute

1037
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,940
Put your fingers

1038
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,160
On that you

1039
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:29,900
Pay attention

1040
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,080
Listen up

1041
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,300
Don't try to deny it

1042
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,900
Or cover it up

1043
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,460
Everybody

1044
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,840
All of us

1045
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,820
Got a shadow

1046
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,520
Oh

1047
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,020
Oh

1048
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,680
You could have been a god

1049
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,660
Ha ha ha ha ha

1050
00:44:58,660 --> 00:44:59,740
Ha ha ha ha ha

1051
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,360
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

1052
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:05,340
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

1053
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:08,460
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

1054
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:08,880
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

1055
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,580
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

1056
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:10,100
Ha ha

1057
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,300
And we have some wonderful wieners

1058
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,700
stuffed with 11 ingredients

1059
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,260
11 ingredients

1060
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,120
Can you believe it

1061
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,420
Tell everybody who did that

1062
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,400
Jesus did that

1063
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:17,620
Who

1064
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:18,260
Jesus

1065
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,080
Well tell them one more time

1066
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,700
Tell everybody who did that

1067
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,660
Jesus did that

1068
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:22,880
Who

1069
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:23,600
Jesus

1070
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,340
Well tell them one more time

1071
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,480
Jesus did that

1072
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,760
Tell everybody who did that

1073
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,720
Jesus did that

1074
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:28,920
Who

1075
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,620
Jesus

1076
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,400
Well, tell them one more time.

1077
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,140
Somebody give Jesus a big hand.

1078
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,420
Give the Lord a big hand.

1079
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:44,460
You tell me that I'm different from the other guys

1080
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,760
But that's because I see the devil in your eyes

1081
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,740
Don't talk about commitment, it just freaks me out

1082
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,900
My afterlife is in serious doubt

1083
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:57,100
I'd love to love you, baby, but can't you see

1084
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,260
I'm nothing but a Catholic casualty

1085
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:03,500
The way you touch me, it just sends me up

1086
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,700
I gotta take a shower cause I get too hot

1087
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,820
All my life I'm talking, making love's a sin

1088
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,980
We have one night of fashion and you wanna move in

1089
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:15,540
I see my soul burning for eternity

1090
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:19,280
I'm nothing but a Catholic casualty

1091
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,280
C-C-C-C-Catholic casualty

1092
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,680
I have to kiss and confess

1093
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,080
C-C-C-C-Catholic casualty

1094
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,600
C-C-C-Catholic casualty

1095
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,100
My conscientism is

1096
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,500
Oh, sweet temptation

1097
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,060
Don't you know

1098
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:38,280
You can't take an altar boy from my soul

1099
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,200
I'd love to get beyond the bull**** rule

1100
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,360
They crammed down my throat in parochial school

1101
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,660
But now I'm here in limbo and I'm under a spell

1102
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:09,840
Trapped between pleasure and the fear of hell

1103
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,880
I pray to God have mercy on me

1104
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,040
I'm nothing but a Catholic casualty

1105
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:19,280
C-C-C-C-Catholic casualty

1106
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,520
I have to kiss and confess

1107
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,560
C-C-C-C-Catholic casualty

1108
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,080
My conscientism is

1109
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:27,080


1110
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:27,080


1111
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:27,080


1112
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:27,080


1113
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:30,280
Oh, sweet temptation

1114
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,900
I guess you should know

1115
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:35,000
You can't take the altar boy from my soul

1116
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:47,520
Oh, sweet temptation

1117
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:50,820
Don't you know

1118
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:55,280
You can't take the altar boy请 your omega

1119
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:57,980
Saul!

1120
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:10,480
The true subgenius can learn to think for himself, but only Bob can show him how.

1121
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:20,840
And so, Bob Dobbs founded his church upon a sandy beach of common sense, sense of humor, and dollars and cents.

1122
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,440
... and God is pouring out His Spirit, record crowds, the fastest growing church in town.

1123
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:31,260
People are flying in, driving in from all over the nation, and the people here in the Metroplex are receiving miracles.

1124
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,640
I minister here. The address is on the screen.

1125
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:34,600
...

1126
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,660
Uh, yes, dear friends.

1127
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:49,820
Okay, uh, Catholic Casualty there, and the song, Oh God, You Give Me a Pain, are both by Joe Paulino.

1128
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:55,060
Reverend Joe Paulino, an actor and multi-talented singer.

1129
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:55,400
... and, uh, multi-talented singer.

1130
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,220
Subgenius in, uh, I believe San Francisco, maybe L.A.

1131
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:08,880
Uh, you also heard a little bit of Devo in there, and what I'm about to read is from John Shirley's novel, uh, The Black Hole of Carcosa.

1132
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:19,040
There were maybe fourteen of them, earthmen or Jalurians with serious earth damage, crowded around the car with guns in their hands.

1133
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:23,920
Okay, said one of the men, gesturing with the big black gun in his hand, out of the car.

1134
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:25,420
... He was wearing a t-shirt.

1135
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,920
... A t-shirt printed with, Do It With Dippy Dog, Drink Dippy Dog Beer.

1136
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:35,400
There was a picture of a rather anthropomorphic dog, winking, as it swilled a can of beer.

1137
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,860
... What happens is, the Dippy Dog guy says,

1138
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:47,840
We take this here real nice car for me to drive, and then we take you to the big computer that puts you through your paces, makes you into one of us.

1139
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:51,300
You'll be out fit through and through, and you'll like it or we'll kill you.

1140
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:52,660
You wouldn't like that.

1141
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,300
Sorry, boys.

1142
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:58,780
Bob said cheerfully, his grin never wavering, the pipe wagging in his teeth.

1143
00:49:58,880 --> 00:49:59,640
Can't oblige you.

1144
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,940
The dippy dog guy pointed his pistol at Bob's head and cocked it.

1145
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:06,020
Then kiss your booty goodbye.

1146
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,560
Mind if we pray first, Bob asked, still smiling.

1147
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:14,240
Well, I guess not.

1148
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,060
Make it quick.

1149
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:20,340
You do a quick prayer unless you're going to try to do some kind of dark land type wizard

1150
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:23,340
hocus pocus and pray to some god awful demon.

1151
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:25,380
Nope, Stang said.

1152
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:26,980
We're going to pray to Jesus.

1153
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,360
Jesus, the dippy dog guy said.

1154
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,220
He shrugged.

1155
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,160
He's harmless.

1156
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:32,720
Go ahead.

1157
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:35,320
I stared at them in disbelief.

1158
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,600
They were going to pray to Jesus?

1159
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,800
Stang looked up at the sky.

1160
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:44,060
Jesus, I'd sure appreciate it if you'd kind of drop in and escort those who are deserving

1161
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:47,860
through your pearly gates or whatever gates you deem appropriate.

1162
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,140
Okay, enough praying, the dippy dog guy said.

1163
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,940
He aimed the gun at Bob's forehead.

1164
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:56,800
Then he blinked and looked up, distracted by a light in the sky.

1165
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:02,960
A ball of soft luminescence was descending the sky, coming down directly overhead, straight

1166
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,280
and true as an elevator.

1167
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,140
In fact, it was an elevator.

1168
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,620
A shining elevator without a building.

1169
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:12,640
When it opened five meters over the road, a man leapt out of it.

1170
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:13,960
More than a man.

1171
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,120
It was Jesus.

1172
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:20,440
Jesus with a submachine gun in his hand and a burning cigar clamped in his mouth.

1173
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,900
When I say Jesus, I mean Jesus.

1174
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:26,840
I don't mean Jesus Garcia of Western Avenue, East LA.

1175
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,740
I mean Jesus of Nazareth.

1176
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,200
He had the crown of thorns.

1177
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,180
He had the stigmata.

1178
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,220
He had the beard, the robe and sandals.

1179
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:34,900
He had the halo.

1180
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:37,040
He also looked sore as hell.

1181
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:40,940
And he had that submachine gun in his hand aimed downward.

1182
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:45,260
He leaped out of the elevator, carried him to the air in front of it.

1183
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,020
But he didn't fall.

1184
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,920
He hovered up there, opening up with the machine gun.

1185
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:49,820
That's right.

1186
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,100
The machine gun rattled in Jesus' hands.

1187
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,620
He was barking murderous firepower.

1188
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:57,400
Blasting the dippy dog guy into kibblets.

1189
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,140
Blowing away a half dozen more of the outfit thugs.

1190
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,540
The submachine gun shaking him with its recoil.

1191
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:06,180
The cigar almost bitten in half in his angry clenched teeth.

1192
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,660
Jesus was yelling through those clenched teeth.

1193
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,640
Yee-haw!

1194
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:11,960
I knew him then.

1195
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:14,080
He wasn't really merely Jesus.

1196
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:18,320
I'd read about this Jesus in the sacred scroll of hyper cryptic icons.

1197
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,560
He wasn't your ordinary Jesus.

1198
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,020
He was The Fightin' Jesus!

1199
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:28,500
And the sight of The Fightin' Jesus blazing away was inspiring as all hell.

1200
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:33,180
I ducked down behind and between the front and back seat staying out of it but I was

1201
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,580
inspired by the sight.

1202
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:40,320
Meanwhile, Bob had let loose the lightning of his terrible swift pipe, electrocuting

1203
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:47,140
two more of the thugs while Stang used their Confusion to stomp the elevator with deaf

1204
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:50,540
jerks of the steering wheel smashing a couple outfits down.

1205
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:50,540


1206
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:50,540


1207
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:56,960
mine clones out of the way using the car as his club. I have to get these darn fenders replaced

1208
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:02,920
from a damn junkyard. Can't get parts for 66 no more, he complained as we roared down the road.

1209
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:08,680
Behind us, the fighting Jesus was turning back to the elevator. He'd killed all the thugs who

1210
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:14,460
hadn't run. Now he punched the buttons on the elevator, waited till the door opened. He turned

1211
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:20,560
and made a gesture of benediction toward us, then a breezy salute of camaraderie. He stepped into

1212
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:26,880
the shining lift and rode it back to the stars. I got up and leaned back in the seat, realizing I

1213
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:32,380
was tired. Tired but impressed. Man, you guys have got connections.

1214
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,420
From John Shirley

1215
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:43,620
Popsicle

1216
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,260
Praise the fighting Jesus, dear friend.

1217
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:50,080
Joe Paulino here.

1218
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,900
The host of Hosanna in the High.

1219
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,060
In your super bed.

1220
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,240
Good guy.

1221
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:24,800
Having a night.

1222
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:27,360
This is popcorn.

1223
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:29,960
Lord of Macy's.

1224
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,120
Lord of Macy's.

1225
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,140
Lord of Macy's.

1226
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:36,280
Lord of Macy's.

1227
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,360
Christ of Macy's.

1228
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:40,580
Christ of Macy's.

1229
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,720
Christ of Macy's.

1230
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:44,420
Christ of Macy's.

1231
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:44,840
Have mercy on me.

1232
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:45,820
Have mercy.

1233
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:46,420
Christ of God.

1234
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,560
Christ of Macy's Ann gesagt.

1235
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:48,560


1236
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:49,480
Christ has risen.

1237
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:49,840
Christ.

1238
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:50,120
Christ.

1239
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,920
He feels cortisol because he lost his true nature.

1240
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:56,300
I invite you to get on

1241
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:56,840
I invite you to get under my roof.

1242
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,440
So give it up.

1243
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:58,840
Leave him бел수 공.

1244
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:58,840


1245
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,160
I'll turn him to death.

1246
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:00,760
Turn him to death.

1247
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,480
Lamb of God, protect away!

1248
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,340
Have mercy.

1249
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:06,600
多少.

1250
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,640
Lamb of God.

1251
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:07,740
Protect away love.

1252
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:07,740


1253
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,180
Take away the sins of the wild.

1254
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:09,360
Have mercy.

1255
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:10,920
Most Uhh!

1256
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,000
Bless the old.

1257
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:25,260
We believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, the only God, Son of God.

1258
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:33,900
He sits down at the right hand of the man and pops the pulse and got a brand new band.

1259
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:41,060
He's super bad.

1260
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,480
He's super bad.

1261
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:51,680
Super, super, super bad.

1262
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:55,740
Oh my God, I'm hot inside so have a little baby beef.

1263
00:55:56,020 --> 00:56:01,180
And I'm the king of all my sins, so baby, leave your hip.

1264
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:02,580
Huh.

1265
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,060
Huh.

1266
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,060
You're too funky down there.

1267
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:06,100
Huh.

1268
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:08,860
Ha!

1269
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:10,820
Lord be with you.

1270
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,680
With you too.

1271
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,200
Lord be with you.

1272
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:16,920
With you too.

1273
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,320
May God bless you.

1274
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,080
Bless you too.

1275
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:23,460
May God bless you.

1276
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,320
Bless you too.

1277
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:27,060
Please.

1278
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:28,400
I wanna be.

1279
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,060
God's a holy god.

1280
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:35,240
Huh.

1281
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:36,520
Good God.

1282
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,420
Good God.

1283
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:39,980
Mass has ended.

1284
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,680
Go in peace, hit me.

1285
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:47,440
Uh, yes, dear friends, that was, uh, Joe Polino .

1286
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:52,000
No under this thing, it always gets extremely, extremely, extremely, extremely .

1287
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,300
It's extremely hard.

1288
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,220
Mm hmm , and, uh, this is .

1289
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:57,040
You've been listening to The Subgenius by Michael Weir.

1290
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:57,040


1291
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:57,040


1292
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:57,040


1293
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:57,040


1294
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:57,040


1295
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:57,040


1296
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:57,040


1297
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,920
radio ministry hour of slack.

1298
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,360
You are welcome to recognize or resist us

1299
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,240
by writing for free information.

1300
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,460
I'm about to give that box number.

1301
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:14,300
Just write to Bob or Jesus or, you know, Rama, whoever,

1302
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:23,840
at Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1303
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,140
It's the same way that it would be odd to talk about it.

1304
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:29,460
It's odd to talk about it, but it's Box 140306,

1305
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:33,860
Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1306
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:34,960
Praise Bobby.

1307
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:35,760
Oh, yeah.

1308
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,480
...on the New Age.

1309
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,000
So what's wrong with the human potential movement?

1310
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,360
I mean, doesn't God want me to live life to the fullest?

1311
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:46,000
No.

1312
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:51,340
The idea of developing human potential has invaded our culture.

1313
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,820
The Army asks you to be all that you can.

1314
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:56,680
MasterCard wants you to master your possibilities.

1315
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:01,380
Both unwittingly encourage the New Age idea of self-deification.

1316
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,760
New Agers believe man's nature can be remolded by human effort.

1317
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:08,860
They would rather you sell your soul for success today

1318
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,200
than seek God's will for tomorrow.

1319
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,480
Just don't sell cheap.

1320
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:15,520
The human potential movement is not an enlightened choice,

1321
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,380
but a doomed decision.

1322
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:18,880
Join us.

1323
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:21,160
Confront the New Age before it's too late.

1324
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:21,780
...

1325
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:25,780
I'm asking you to have the guts to stand up for what's right.

1326
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:28,660
999-9999.

1327
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:29,680
That's Bobby.

1328
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,800
Oh, yes, we love you, friend.

1329
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:43,720
We love you, and stay tuned for, uh...

1330
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,120
What?

1331
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:46,500
What?

1332
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:50,560
That's right.

1333
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:51,540
Just...

1334
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:52,420
Work it out.

1335
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,460
Work it out, baby.

1336
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:55,700
Oh, ah.

1337
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:59,440
And stay tuned for Robert Wisdom's American Music Party.

1338
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:03,440
Hurry, hurry, hurry, rama, hurry, rama, rama, rama, hurry, hurry.

1339
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,240
Woo-hoo!
