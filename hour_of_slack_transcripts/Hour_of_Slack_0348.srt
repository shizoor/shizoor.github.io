1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,860
For men on the go, it's not what's in the pipe, it's the pipe itself.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:09,920
The Bob Dobbs Classic Meerschaum, hand-carved by the finest craftsmen in Malaysia.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:16,780
This and other fine Bob Dobbs smoking accessories cast a spell of their own for the discriminating smoker.

4
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,380
Bob Dobbs pipes never go out. Of style.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,480
Available at Kmart, Walmart, Target and Hypermart.

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh, too much church.

7
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,160
Trace motion!

8
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,800
And welcome to the subjeious radio.

9
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,280
Trace down!

10
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,160
Yeah, nothing works really well.

11
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,300
Here's a song that we was all brainwashed with. Remember this oldies but goodies?

12
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,880
Trace the car.

13
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:23,460
And that's how the canton 오 Tasker

33
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:30,040
to the fact that it's also a pink, you know, the day before X Day, July 4th, being a pink

34
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,680
holiday, the holiday of those who think this is still a free country.

35
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,980
Boy, they're so good at making that sound like a crazy phrase.

36
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,840
But, oh, last night we, well, the family, the Stang family, because the world isn't

37
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:56,120
all subgenius yet, we had to go to a 4th of July party with our in-laws, my in-laws,

38
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:02,900
at North Dallas, a North Dallas country club, which shall remain nameless.

39
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,580
See, my in-laws are self-made, well, not millionaires, but thousandaires anyway.

40
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,060
And, you know, for business reasons, they have to stay in the club.

41
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,300
And, oh, that country club atmosphere, friends, I'm not around that very much anymore.

42
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,820
And it gives you...

43
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,880
It gives you the creeps.

44
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:29,780
You walk in there and it's like, this place, unclean, subgenius should not be here.

45
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,260
Evil, place of the enemy, the house of the enemy.

46
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:41,320
It's partly my boy, my boy Idnax and I were probably the only males with long hair.

47
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,800
I've got ordinary kind of long hair.

48
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,260
But he's got chains and earrings and all that kind of stuff on him, you know, cool.

49
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,720
But, boy, we felt...

50
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:50,820
But, boy, we felt...

51
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,280
All four of the stangs felt kind of out of place at that country club.

52
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,840
Because, well, we were the only non-whites in the crowd, aside from the help.

53
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:08,680
See, around 1980, you know, the yuppies in the club realized that it just didn't look right

54
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,420
for all the help to be old black guys like Morgan Freeman.

55
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,600
And I guess at some point they all saw Driving Miss Daisy,

56
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,600
and so they fired all the blacks and hired a bunch of Asians.

57
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,640
And anyway...

58
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:20,900
Right.

59
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,740
At this point, you're going, now, Reverend Stang, how do you figure you and your family as non-whites?

60
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,520
I mean, you're damn near as white as Bob, Reverend Stang.

61
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,960
And, well, yeah, of course, that's true.

62
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,460
And I'm proud of my northern Neanderthal heritage.

63
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,480
But what I mean is, well, see, since I left home in 1973 or whatever,

64
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,940
I've rarely been in a really all-white environment.

65
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,920
And unless you've been to a country club, you don't know what I'm talking about.

66
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,760
It's strange in there.

67
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,420
I mean...

68
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,660
And there's been a lot of times.

69
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,180
When my wife and I were the only old chalk people around.

70
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,680
And for us, it feels very weird to realize that we're in one of those all-white crowds.

71
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,560
Because for the true, true white, white person,

72
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,060
the really white bread type of white person,

73
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:15,780
and, you know, they only feel comfortable when everybody else looks like them.

74
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,340
And we're just the opposite.

75
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,800
And that's why I say we feel like non-whites.

76
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:28,320
Just because it's so obvious that we don't live up to the white North Dallas ideal.

77
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,880
But who cares, dear friends?

78
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,900
Who cares?

79
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,640
Because the end times are coming up.

80
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,460
You know, it's the first day of the end of the world.

81
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:50,280
And we've been given, Bob has given us to see,

82
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:56,160
signs and portents of what will bring this end.

83
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,000
What will trigger the day of judgment.

84
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,400
And what it's going to be.

85
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,180
And of course we know when the exes will, of course, arrive.

86
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,040
July 5th, 1998 at 7 o'clock in the morning.

87
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,120
All over the world.

88
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:17,420
But what triggers the end times for the other alien beings,

89
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,420
the Yakatizma and so forth,

90
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,800
is the...

91
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,180
This one moment when the world, when America becomes so decadent

92
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,800
that it no longer deserves to live.

93
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,040
And that sign of the end times, dear friends,

94
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,920
is the royal jelly enema.

95
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:44,860
At a time, 1998, 97, doesn't matter when, might be now, may have already happened.

96
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,220
A time when beggars are crowding the streets

97
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,600
and...

98
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:50,540
Uh...

99
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:50,800
Uh...

100
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,600
Children, poor children are out starving.

101
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,700
Celebrities and lawyers in Hollywood

102
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,220
will be indulging in the latest hedonistic health,

103
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,240
the crackpot health fad.

104
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,580
Getting enemas with pure royal jelly.

105
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,420
The honey fed to queen bees.

106
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,980
Which costs a thousand dollars for enough royal jelly

107
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,480
to get the average jaded swinger, um, you know, off or whatever.

108
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,780
And so at this point,

109
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,240
it's time when the homeless are selling their babies

110
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:30,400
to procure used, leftover ambergris and royal jelly enema byproducts.

111
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,960
When a Hollywood star,

112
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,500
the moment when a Hollywood star spends $60,000 in one night on that,

113
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,140
and his used jelly is sold on the streets for $200 for half a pint,

114
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,700
this so disgusts the aliens that they decide to trash the earth

115
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,200
before the...

116
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,900
Exist...

117
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,360
Arrival.

118
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,360
Friends.

119
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,980
It's gonna be a rough time, and I'm gonna, I'm gonna, this is,

120
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,900
this is gonna be an all-Ex Day night, a night of celebrating, yes,

121
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,480
that time when Bob will come and hose down the streets

122
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,040
and clean up this crooked and perverse nation.

123
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,120
So we're gonna hear from, uh, Father Joe Mama

124
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,520
as he delves on into this as well.

125
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:19,880
Praise Bob.

126
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,100
Hello, friends, and welcome.

127
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,320
You know, most of you out there must be feeling pretty smug with yourselves.

128
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,300
After all, you're alive.

129
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,700
You're healthy.

130
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,340
Your life's insured.

131
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,760
There's little money set aside in case of accidents.

132
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,480
What more could you ask for?

133
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,560
These are good times.

134
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:50,180
Easy money, easy sex, VCRs, and Nintendo to keep your minds off of.

135
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,120
The golden age is never the present age.

136
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,080
You know, they say that the golden age is never the present age.

137
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,180
They really do say that.

138
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,840
But we look all around us everywhere, and what do we see?

139
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:01,860
Golden opportunity.

140
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,220
Well, friends, that's just calm before the storm,

141
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,940
because tonight's sermon is entitled,

142
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,620
Ex Day 1998, Day of Reckoning.

143
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,760
We all know vaguely what Ex Day is.

144
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,160
Bob told us himself that it shall occur July 5th, 1998.

145
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,180
The exes shall land and whisk the good subgenies off

146
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,420
to never an unpleasant cruise of the cosmos.

147
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,160
But what of the pinks that remain on Earth?

148
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,760
What will happen to the a-holes that are left behind?

149
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,840
Well, friends, as much as I hate to gloat over those less fortunate,

150
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,900
the fact is they'll get exactly what they deserve.

151
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,000
Now to any real subgenie, giving the normal what he deserves

152
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,060
is about the cruelest fate a normal could ever receive.

153
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:55,740
After all, these are the same normals that have supported the conspiracy for centuries.

154
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:00,580
These are the same normals that have tortured us with their ignorance and defiled the name

155
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,000
of Bob.

156
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,240
These are the same normals that have taken the most free country in the world and turned

157
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,140
it into an ever-growing bureaucratic governmental monster that feeds on taxes, committees, laws,

158
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,760
statutes, buck-passing, and fill-in-the-blank.

159
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,980
Then once the creature's rot-filled gut sprues out the digested combination of all the vashes,

160
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:24,640
before mentioned by the lawyers and liars that created this filth, what's the result?

161
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,360
Why, the conspiracy, of course!

162
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:34,360
And this pile of stinking defecation we're supposed to kneel before and worship and serve?

163
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,580
Never!

164
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:41,860
Bob will avenge us for the years of conspiracy rule on that most dreaded of subgenius holidays,

165
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,920
X-Day 1998!

166
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,320
Dreaded by them, but not by us!

167
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:57,860
Let us look at Bob's prophecy and see what the normals have in store for them, shall we?

168
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,620
Bob's word comes in many mysterious ways, not all of which are immediately recognized

169
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,080
as divine in origin.

170
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,700
Indeed, since Bob transcends time, so does his word.

171
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,340
This revelation popped up in a 1938 radio drama.

172
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:20,160
In this story, the Martians, then a synonym for aliens, later to be known as X-ists, are

173
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,160


174
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,160


175
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,160


176
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,160


177
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,160


178
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,160


179
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,160


180
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,160


181
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,480
the most famous.

182
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,460
They have landed and started to round up the normals.

183
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,440
Two of the unlucky survivors meet to discuss the future of mankind.

184
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,280
The smarter one asserts, quote,

185
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,360
I've thought it all out.

186
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,520
Right now, we're caught as we're wanted.

187
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,100
An X-ist only has to go a few miles to get a crowd on the run.

188
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,300
But they won't keep on doing that.

189
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:49,620
They'll begin catching us systematic-like, keeping the best and storing us in cages and

190
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:49,980
things.

191
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,040
They haven't begun on us yet.

192
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,060
Not begun.

193
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,920
Later, he goes on to say, all those little office workers that used to live in these

194
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,240
houses, they'll be no good.

195
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,320
They haven't any stuff in them.

196
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,920
They used to run, run off to work.

197
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:14,740
I have seen hundreds of them running and catching their commuter trains in the morning, afraid

198
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,120
that they'd get canned if they didn't.

199
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,540
Running back at night.

200
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,440
afraid that they wouldn't be in time for dinner.

201
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,980
Lives insured and a little invested in case of accidents.

202
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,220
Yay, and on Sundays, worried about the hereafter.

203
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,360
Well, the excess will be a godsend for those guys.

204
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:40,040
Nice roomy cages, good food, careful breeding, and no worries.

205
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,580
Yeah, after a week or so of chasing around the fields on empty stomachs,

206
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,540
they'll come and be glad to be caught.

207
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,460
Now, this is 1938, mind you.

208
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,260
He goes on to say, finally, that's not all.

209
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,080
These excess are going to make pets of some of them, train them to do tricks.

210
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:03,460
Who knows, get sentimental over the pet boy who grew up and had to be killed.

211
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,240
Yay, and some maybe they'll train to hunt us.

212
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,260
Yes, they will.

213
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,120
There's men who will do it gladly.

214
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:15,000
Well, friends, how much more obvious does Bob have to be?

215
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,440
When he gave this brief preview,

216
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,700
of the future in 1938 on CBS,

217
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,560
it sent millions of normals into the streets screaming for reprieve.

218
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,780
They repented, they begged forgiveness, and yet, just a few days later,

219
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,800
after Bob Orson Welles in the War of the Worlds broadcast

220
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,820
was described by the conspiracy as nothing more than a joke,

221
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,820
the normals went back to the conspiracy way of life as if nothing had ever happened.

222
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,160
They came so close.

223
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,680
To getting a second chance at mending their ways, but they blew it.

224
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,480
They went back to the conspiracy masters, and for their loyalty,

225
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,280
they were genously rewarded with yet another world war.

226
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,600
There's a strange sense of poetic justice to it, isn't there, friends?

227
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,920
Well, they haven't seen nothing yet.

228
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,100
Just wait till the real McCoy comes.

229
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,800
It's only a few miles down the road, pink boy.

230
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,360
And like Dr. Al prescribes to his patients,

231
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,400
if you're caught in a nuclear holocaust, and your skin begins to melt,

232
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,500
don't panic.

233
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,320
This is perfectly normal.

234
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,480
Yes, friends, just another normal way to die for the normals doomed to die.

235
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,960
What? Did I say doomed to die?

236
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,800
I should have said lucky to die, for blessed are the dead after X-Day arrives.

237
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,420
The doomed are the unlucky pink survivors

238
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:40,220
who must live out their wretched existence under the cruel and merciless exes.

239
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,360
Cruel to them, but not to us.

240
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,860
Not only will there be no more bowling alleys and golf courses

241
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,640
for the pinks, but there'll be no more subgenies to kick around anymore.

242
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,740
We'll be surfing the celestial stars, smoking our froth,

243
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,860
unweaving our slack, and sexing our anti-virgins like there was no tomorrow.

244
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,880
Because in space, friends, there isn't.

245
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,920
Only back on Earth will it be a tomorrow, and then the next day, and then the next.

246
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,300
It'll be an eternal hell without end.

247
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:12,380
And we'll be enjoying it all in the heavens on closed circuit TV,

248
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,360
because we won't want to miss a single revenge film minute.

249
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,040
Praise Bob! Amen.

250
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,480
One.

251
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,900
Take me off to space

252
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,420
Take me off to space

253
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,320
Come on down, you saucer man

254
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,240
And take me off to space

255
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,800
Take me off to space

256
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,000
Take me off to space

257
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,860
Come on down, you saucer man

258
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,880
And take me off to space

259
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,160
Stick needles in my belly

260
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,460
Take samples of my skin

261
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:46,840
Take samples of my skin

262
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,700
Take samples in my

263
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,820
I don't care as long as I can live with saucer man

264
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:55,480
I know that you don't take requests But I'm a special case

265
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,180
Come on down, you saucer man

266
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,060
And take me off to space

267
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,260
Take me off to space

268
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,480
Take me off to space

269
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,220
Come on down, you saucer man

270
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,980
And take me off to space

271
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,020
Take me off to space.

272
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:22,600
Hey, cow mutilators, let me join your crew.

273
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,980
Give me a knife, you bet your life I'll cut up cows for you.

274
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,240
I don't care if you're some kind of ghastly beast

275
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,380
without a face.

276
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,560
So come on down, you saucermen, and take me off to space.

277
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,060
Oh, take me off to space.

278
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,080
Take me off to space.

279
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,500
Come on down, you saucermen, and take me off to space.

280
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,680
Take me off to space.

281
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,720
Take me off to space.

282
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,860
Take me off to space.

283
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,560
Come on down, you saucermen, and take me off to space.

284
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,820
Come down, you tiny robots with your little nipper claws.

285
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,300
You pale and bug-eyed aliens with white and clammy paws.

286
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:06,580
Life is just a sucker's dream, and death is a disgrace.

287
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:11,040
So come on down, you saucermen, and take me off to space.

288
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,120
Oh, take me off to space.

289
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,480
Take me off to space.

290
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:15,700
Woo!

291
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,580
Come on down, you saucermen, and take me off to space

292
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,200
.

293
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,600
Take me off to space.

294
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,760
Take me off to space.

295
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:28,200
Come on down, you saucermen, and take me off to space.

296
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,320
Boo!

297
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:29,980
Yeah!

298
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,340
Oh, friends.

299
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:39,920
No.

300
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,360
Oh, I should mention that was Morton N programmes

301
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,820
Lowe singing Take Me Off to Space, that wonderful old hymn. That's one of the hymns that we

302
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:57,920
like to sing on our subgenius holidays. A lovely, lovely old-time gospel hymn. Yes,

303
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:06,160
yes, yes. This is Doctors for Bob in the background. But friends, you know, our critics have some

304
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:12,780
people worrying now and then that the church might become corrupt. The church of the subgenius

305
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:18,540
might become corrupted by the conspiracy and there'd have to be a replacement for it.

306
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:27,760
Friends, I tell you, we don't have to worry about that because the true church, the true

307
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:34,480
church of the subgenius is going to be up in the saucers. The pinks won't have to worry

308
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:42,000
about even seeing the subgeniuses again. There'll be all kinds of cheap cults and spinoffs left

309
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,340
behind.

310
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:50,800
Just like the cargo cults among the last mutated remnants of humanity. And also there'll be

311
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:59,120
subgeniuses left behind. The subgeniuses who didn't think they really needed that $20 membership

312
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:08,860
card. Did we just have a power failure? I believe we did. Yeah, those who, as I was saying,

313
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,900
excuse me, friends, we're having a serious,

314
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:19,100
strange poltergeist effects in here as the lights flicker on and off. Yeah, yeah, anyway,

315
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,680
yeah, there'll be some subgeniuses left behind. The ones who, who didn't think they, they needed

316
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:30,580
that $20 membership card. The, the ones who tattooed Bob's face all over their whole bodies.

317
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:36,140
The ones who put, they might've put Bob on national TV. They might've donated their whole

318
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:41,480
estate to us, but they never sent, they never sent their $20.

319
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:41,780


320
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,260
$20.

321
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:42,600
$20.

322
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:42,760
$20.

323
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:42,760


324
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:42,760


325
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:42,760


326
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:42,760


327
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:42,760


328
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:42,760


329
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:42,760


330
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:42,760


331
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:42,760


332
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:42,760


333
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:42,760


334
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:50,160
It might be confusing a bit to those left behind after the rupture. Because the rupture happens for

335
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:55,740
different people in different ways. A lot of subgeniuses, when they undergo the rupture,

336
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,360
what, the people standing around and back on earth, it looks like a burning monk or

337
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:07,300
spontaneous combustion. They just burst into flames and scream and scream. It's the most

338
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,300
horrible, painful looking thing in the world. But of course that, friends,

339
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:17,420
that's just the image. That's just sort of the, the hologram, the body being left behind. Just the shell.

340
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:25,920
Because on next day, when you are ruptured, no matter how it looks, you know, your, your youthful, perfect body is being

341
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:40,520
recreated on the vessels of the sex goddesses and a thousand clones of kitten on TV Dodd are gonna, well, I, friends, when you get on that escape vessel,

342
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:50,400
Every person you ever had a crush on since elementary school is gonna be there ready to have sex with you.

343
00:27:50,680 --> 00:28:00,160
Father. Patriarch or an affectionate, loving first Bottler. Oh, either that or else, simulacra of those people. It might as well be the same, because the sex goddesses you see can change their form completely and totally.

344
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:07,280
Oh, first there you there'll be. They'll be the say, the girl you had a crush on in first.

345
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,900
Grade. Well, now she's a perfect.

346
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:10,720
She's

347
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,040
Perfect,

348
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:11,280
right,

349
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:17,460
healthy at age 25, of course, you know. And when she leaves, why in walks the girl you had a crush

350
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:24,280
on in second grade? Or here's that boy you had a crush on when you were 13 and he almost kissed

351
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:30,640
you, but now he's going to do it. And he's still wearing the same clothes that he did at the prom.

352
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,640
Or that milkman or babysitter that you lusted after. They'll all be there. The sex goddesses

353
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:47,600
tap your mind. It's not really people. It's part of the muam system, a biomorphic toy that conforms

354
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:54,720
to the fleshly configurations to satisfy any kind of lust you might have. And they can pre-guess what

355
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,620
you're about to think, friends. They can sense a desire percolating up in your mind. And just,

356
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:06,280
for instance, just a few seconds before you think of it, that zap comic that you always

357
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:06,620
want to have. And they can pre-guess what you're about to think. And they can pre-guess what you

358
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:06,620


359
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:12,740
want to read a second time. What just happens to be over there in the pile? And you lay back and you

360
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:21,900
think, man, this is great. If only I had a frop stick. Well, here's a frop stick. Because muam and

361
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:28,260
the biomorphs and the sex goddesses can anticipate your every wish. They can whiff a desire coming on.

362
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:35,600
And you'll think, now, if I could just meet up with that haughty librarian at that one college

363
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,300
I went to.

364
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:40,920
While I'm reading this comic. And sure enough, in she comes through the door. Well, if only she'd

365
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:46,980
dance, you think. Oh, if only she had a small whip. And it happens. As you think about it,

366
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:54,020
there's no limit. No limit at all. And oh, if only she'd give me a ham sandwich first.

367
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:00,720
Ah, yes. Now I'm. And you'll sit there and think to yourself, you know, I can't believe there was

368
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,120
a time when I wondered if it was worth the 20 bucks.

369
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:11,420
You're sitting there eating the hell out of that ham sandwich, getting a scarf job from that

370
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:19,380
biomorph, watching widescreen color TV Elvis movies and thinking, how could I ever have wondered? How

371
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:26,120
could I ever have doubted Bob for a second? And to think of poor Bubba, my brother Bubba back there

372
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:33,980
on Earth, the guy that said, hell, send them $20. That's just what they want you to do. I'll pump gas

373
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,280
for $2.38 an hour the rest of my life. And I'll be out there waiting for you. And I'll be out there

374
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:44,000
before I'd send a dollar to that damn sub gum church. Oh, yeah. Well, it's hard times for Bubba

375
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:52,180
now, friends. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Where was I? We just do it. Show poltergeist,

376
00:30:52,280 --> 00:31:05,740
friends are coming at us from all angles. Ah, yes. Yeah, just when you're thinking about old Bubba,

377
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:11,560
didn't want to join the church. Well, the TV on the escape vessel in front of you lights up,

378
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:18,960
and there's this shot of Bubba down there eating a rotten rat and hiding from the death machines

379
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:26,360
that the rogue pinks made from the stolen womb parts. And Bubba will be down there muttering

380
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,820
to himself, oh, how could I do it? That was so stupid. I could have been saved. But no,

381
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:35,740
I didn't send my $20. Oh, God, here comes another robe.

382
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:43,580
And here I am in this pestering pile of rat waste and dead people and stripped bare skulls.

383
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:51,760
If only I could die. If only I could die. But I can't. I can't. Why, if only Bob was here now,

384
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:57,640
I'd give him my $20. I'd give him $40. I'd give you everything I own, Bob, please.

385
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,840
Well, friends, that just shows how much they trusted Bob.

386
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,260
They did. They did. They did. They did. They did. They did. They did. They did. They did.

387
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:13,400
They didn't trust Bob Dobbs. Didn't trust him $20 worth. Okay, fine. Fine. No skin off our teeth.

388
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:20,080
Pay lip service. Wear that Bob t-shirt. Be real hip. But when those saucers come,

389
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:29,440
well, you're either on the bus or you're off the bus, as those great proto-sub-genii used to say.

390
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:35,260
And the dumbest nerd could get on the bus for $20. Well, actually, those $20 don't count.

391
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:42,200
Their souls go into the cylinders that we trade for. But they should be proud that their souls, such as they are,

392
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:48,780
at least made it possible for their betters to ride the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

393
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,920
And there'll be an orientation film that they'll show you when you're ruptured up, you know,

394
00:32:54,920 --> 00:33:02,580
because otherwise it might be kind of confusing. This orientation film is kind of projected into your head.

395
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,620
It's introduced by Princess.

396
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:13,760
We are Doe, queen of all the UFOs, who's sort of this half-naked Flash Gordon slash Viking Brunhilde

397
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:20,920
with metal pointed breastplates and a horned helmet and all this UFO insignia or anything.

398
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,900
And she is the mistress of the path of least resistance. And she narrates this film.

399
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:32,560
And it's like, you will hear and obey. Take off your clothes. And you can watch the light.

400
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,900
You can either watch the...

401
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:41,220
orientation film or you can watch the live broadcast of X-Day or...

402
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:53,100
or you can just, you know, go back to having your fun with the different simulacra and sex goddesses and so forth.

403
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,360
And, of course, your sweetheart's going to be doing the same thing, too.

404
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:05,060
But because it's in... because it's on those spaceships on the inside the escape vessels,

405
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:09,140
it's... there's no time and no sense of jealousy.

406
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,680
It's... you'll always... it's like...

407
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:20,640
there's no sense of possessiveness because on that... in that no-zone of the saucers,

408
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,660
time ceases to exist, or at least it feels that way.

409
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,000
And you don't need to be grasping anymore like you did on Earth.

410
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:33,780
The overwhelming feeling that you get on the escape vessels is like, wow, the best part is...

411
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,240
it lasts as long as...

412
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,160
as long as I want it to.

413
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,700
And I can take forever.

414
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,480
I'm immortal for now.

415
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:46,840
And I... I don't have the... the urge to grab this and keep it so I can run somewhere else to grab some other thing.

416
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:53,540
I don't have to kill or defeat another monkey man to hang on to these... these big round soft things.

417
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:58,320
I'll have plenty of time to get to those other big soft round things.

418
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,080
More... more than I could ever use.

419
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,900
And my pipe overfloweth.

420
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,080
And the big round...

421
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,220
And the big round...

422
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:05,220


423
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,420
And the big round... soft things shall follow me through the land of Dobbs,

424
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,480
and I will dwell in the cleft in between forever.

425
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,260
It's like, oh, how are your multiple partners today, dear?

426
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,940
Oh, big and round and soft.

427
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,560
Ah, yes.

428
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,420
And there's...

429
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,580
But people ask so many questions.

430
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:34,580
I say, well, well, Reverend Stang, is there just one giant saucer, or is it a bunch of regional...

431
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,220
Well, Reverend Stang, is there just one giant saucer, or is it a bunch of regional...

432
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:35,220


433
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,920
You know, like an East Coast saucer and a West Coast saucer.

434
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,760
No, there's a million kinds of saucers, friends.

435
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,440
But it's... It's like virtual reality.

436
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:47,060
Once you're inside one of them, you might as well be in all of them.

437
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,520
You might as well be on Planet X.

438
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,260
You're not in normal space.

439
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:56,420
You can sort of phase to the other saucers or find your friends telepathically.

440
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:02,940
And you go, oh, I think I'll go to the Chinese saucer today, or I'll go to the gay and lesbian saucer.

441
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,200
Gee, I always wanted to try being a lesbian saucer.

442
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:12,440
and female. But meanwhile, those who are left behind, which is 99% of the population and

443
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:20,580
probably 90% of the subgeniuses, all those who didn't send their $20. They'll miss out

444
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:25,040
on next day. You know, come to think of it, I never sent. Technically, I mean, I've spent

445
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:31,420
a lot of my own money on the church, but I never sent my $20 in for a membership. Dr.

446
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:37,660
Palmer Vredes never did. Puzzling Evidence never did. Sterno never did. And you know,

447
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:44,040
friends, it won't matter what you did for Bob. What'll matter is whether you sent that

448
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:48,380
for that membership card. I guess I'm going to have to get around to that. Well, I got

449
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:53,700
plenty of time, plenty of time till next day. Oh, hell, that's 1998. We got all the time

450
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:59,620
in the world. There will be one big escape vessel just for the doctors, for the hierarchy.

451
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,400
And I can tell you that.

452
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:07,260
You can just see Byron and Gordon and some of those other people up there going, hey,

453
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:11,200
you know, we ought to go down and save Ivan and Philo and all those who never got around

454
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:17,740
to sending the $20. And then they'll go, well, we'll get around to it.

455
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:26,800
We're not sure where the escape vessels of the sex goddesses go, dear friends.

456
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:31,380
As far as I can tell, they'll probably just fly around. But I'm going to go, I'm going to go

457
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:31,380


458
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:37,120
to get off of this for right now we'll go to it an old hymn this is a lovely old subject i do mean

459
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:45,120
old this is like from 1981 old subgenius hymn by someone we only know as doug number four oh yes

460
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,180

461
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,380

465
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,240
and we'll all come back

466
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:18,680

We'll all come back old women

In victory parades

Ah, yes, what a wonderful, wonderful tune

495
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:46,920
There from the good, good Reverend Doug No. 4

496
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,420
Who got scared by the Church of the Subgenius

497
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,700
Very shortly after doing that very song

498
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,820
And we never heard from him again

499
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,040
And for all I know, he might be listening to this show

500
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,720
Going, where's my royalties?

501
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,020
But he's not going to lack for royalties, dear friends

502
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,100
Because he'll be on those saucers

503
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:09,480
And he'll be on those saucers

504
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,180
And I hope, I hope that you will too

505
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,300
I hope you'll join us there on that lovely day

506
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:20,080
And to make sure that, let's go through some of these things

507
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,140
To double check just before X Day

508
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:27,620
There'll be more of this in our upcoming book, Revelation X

509
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,320
This is where a lot of these notes are coming from, by the way, friends

510
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:35,800
From a research session between myself and Dr. G. Gordon Gordon

511
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,400
In conference with that man

512
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,860
J.R. Bob Dobbs

513
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,100
Yes, sort of a teleconference that we were on

514
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,340
Praise this modern day technology

515
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:49,820
That way we didn't have to be in the same room with Bob

516
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,980
Don't you see it's a dream

517
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:52,540
But anyway

518
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:56,060
I mean, you don't want to miss

519
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:01,660
Your chance to be on the escape vessels of the sex goddesses

520
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,880
On X Day

521
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,940
You don't want to end up down on Earth being fried

522
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,460
So make sure that you have a real subjection

523
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,260
And you have a subgenius minister's card on you at all times

524
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,200
Now you never know, X Day might come early

525
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,160
So keep it with you

526
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,960
Subgeniuses often lose those in the wash

527
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,040
We get a lot of mail from people saying that

528
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,760
I washed my membership card, can I have another one?

529
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,640
And you don't want that to happen just before X Day, friends

530
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,680
So if you have members who have lost their cards

531
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:34,180
But who are paid up and on the master disc of souls

532
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,960
Because we can tell, you can't fool us

533
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,300
We'll give you a free replacement card from the Dallas headquarters

534
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,140
Anytime, free of charges

535
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:45,600
By sending yourself a draft stamped envelope

536
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,940
This is members only

537
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,400
To Bob

538
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,560
And we'll be giving that post office box number soon

539
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,520
In the broadcast

540
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:58,060
P.O. Box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214

541
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,280
Is what I'll be telling you

542
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,200
But oh, X Day

543
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,520
You know on X Day

544
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,560
For those down below on Earth

545
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,940
You know it'll be a little bit of a surprise for you

546
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,660
A little different than it would be up in the escape vessels of the sex goddesses

547
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,300
They'll look up

548
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,340
Trying to put, while they're trying to put their clothes out

549
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,300
Uh, there'll be this huge eyeball in the sky

550
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,660
This giant pyramid shaped light form

551
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,100
With a big eye that just

552
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,540
Covers the whole sky

553
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:31,300
And it's filming for the escape vessel screens

554
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,860
Oh yes, when we can watch what's going on down there

555
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,720
We can watch any part of it we want

556
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,240
And we can also leave messages

557
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,060
Because the big eye

558
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,400
Projects sort of billboards

559
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,880
Holographic billboards

560
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,020
From horizon to horizon

561
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,140
That say things like

562
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:49,920
Smile

563
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,820
You know, welcome to your stupid life

564
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,500
You're being seen live

565
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,020
On the escape vessels of the sex goddess screens

566
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,400
Where the subgeniuses

567
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,400
Are now partying

568
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,080
You dumb idiots

569
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,220
I mean a big billboard

570
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,940
Stretching all across the planet

571
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,660
In all languages saying

572
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,360
Fools, we're having a great time

573
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,680
And the subgeniuses can take turns

574
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,580
Broadcasting personal statements

575
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,020
So, you know

576
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,260
This horrible pink

577
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,820
Evil person will be down there

578
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:23,980
Uh, fighting the roe beast

579
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:24,920
And suddenly there's

580
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,700
This, uh, voice will ring out

581
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,920
Hey, Mrs. Darden

582
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,300
I was in your 1959 fifth grade class

583
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,160
Remember me?

584
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,740
Steve Wilcox, ha ha, I'm up here

585
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:36,660
You're down there, ha!

586
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,860
Or, uh, like pain radio

587
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:41,180
Coming to you, Mr. Shaughnessy, the principal

588
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,100
Remember when you expelled me?

589
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,860
How do you like the pain, huh?

590
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,640
And, uh, you know

591
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,820
You get back at me anyway

592
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:50,680
Oh, you laughed at me in junior high, Max

593
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,320
You put me upside down into a trash can

594
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,780
You and your jock friends

595
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:58,200
You aren't laughing quite so hard now, are you?

596
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:58,980
Ha ha ha

597
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,160
And there'll be little

598
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:01,980
Holographic

599
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,100
Ghost-like things

600
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,660
Green slime type ghost sort of things

601
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,120
Millions of little 3-D Janers

602
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,480
Flying around, taunting

603
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,840
And saying, you should've spent your $20

604
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,360
Should've spent your $20

605
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,100
Oh, friends, friends

606
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,480
Oh, praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob

607
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,080
It's gonna be so

608
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:21,820
But, you know, and

609
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,460
And so we find

610
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,360
That the world isn't really to be destroyed

611
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,680
It's that the humans

612
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,020
What happens is the humans are given

613
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,520
All this alien technology

614
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,580
And they screw everything up

615
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,640
They've got a miracle system

616
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:36,640


617
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:37,320
They've got a miracle machine there

618
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,340
This womb thing

619
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,580
That could do anything they want

620
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,660
But nobody pays any attention to it at first

621
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:46,080
Because, uh, they don't know what its capabilities are

622
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,280
And it's real cautious about revealing itself too fast

623
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,840
And they don't know that this fungus

624
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,340
That's growing around them

625
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,660
Could fulfill their wildest desires

626
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,800
Because they don't believe it can

627
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,280
Because they don't have any wild desires

628
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,140
Because they didn't think to ask

629
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,840
And people will be down there in the ruins

630
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,220
Begging us with their last potato

631
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:14,580
To preach and deliver unto them the word of Dobbs

632
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,640
Uh, because it's the only thing that'll save them

633
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,100
It's subgenius artifacts

634
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:22,040
Like old copies of the book of the subgenius

635
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,640
Or illegal bootleg tapes of this radio show

636
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,840
Original pamphlet number ones

637
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,200
Even an old Dobbs head

638
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,660
It'll be worth a boxcar full of canned peaches, friends

639
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:34,100
Because the luck shell

640
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,640
The luck shell that we've always had

641
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,960
Always claimed was around our various products

642
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,560
That you thought we were only kidding about

643
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,260
And that's real

644
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:46,660
And it will become visible on X day

645
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,080
A glow that's visible even in daylight

646
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,740
Any given page of the printed word of Bob

647
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:55,700
Will be not only of practical use as lamps in the dark

648
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:56,560
But more importantly

649
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,600
They'll be unthinkably valuable religious treasures

650
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,420
Dear friends

651
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:04,380
The most valuable things on the whole planet

652
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,200
Because you're safe

653
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,260
And you're safer if you have that

654
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,180
If you've got a copy of this show with you

655
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,860
It tips your luck playing

656
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:13,780
It helps a whole lot against radiation

657
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:15,580
And landslides

658
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,220
And brain worms

659
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,580
And noise demons

660
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,320
And nerve runners and all that

661
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,680
It isn't nearly like having a membership card

662
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,420
But it's a lot better than having nothing

663
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,840
Because friends, your faith

664
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,940
Your faith in Bob

665
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,260
Will be all you have left on that day

666
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:35,420
And he'll know whether you believed in him

667
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,960
Wotan will know

668
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,080
And he will come

669
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,280
He will come to judge

670
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,120
The X's

671
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:54,780
Have landed

672
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:57,580
Earth's under

673
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,680
Their control

674
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,100
Bob's vision

675
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:07,820
Spans proven

676
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:11,200
The city's

677
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,020
Radioactive home

678
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:17,200
We don't know

679
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:21,340
What their game is

680
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:24,180
But their name is

681
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,060
Unpronounceable

682
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:29,880
We don't know

683
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:34,000
What they came for

684
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,400
But they came for

685
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:35,400


686
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:35,400


687
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:35,400


688
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:35,400


689
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:35,400


690
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:35,400


691
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:35,400


692
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:35,400


693
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:35,400


694
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:35,400


695
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:35,400


696
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:35,400


697
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:35,400


698
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:35,400


699
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:35,400


700
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,860
But what they aim for

701
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,640
Is impossible

702
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,620
Despair not, you beasts

703
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,560
In the second year

704
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,120
Before the millennium

705
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,600
Of the day of God

706
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,260
Come Wednesday

707
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:52,740
As in the twinkling of night

708
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,280
They will come among the Yaka-Kisma

709
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,820
Which are like unto thy great white brothers

710
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,040
They come as men

711
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,640
As grave and images

712
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,880
As a whirlwind

713
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,200
And as a cloud

714
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,440
And beyond all of the heavens

715
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,360
Where they call for thee

716
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,120
The X's

717
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,000
Have landed

718
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,520
Their machines

719
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,240
Following our tracks

720
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,200
Bob's vision

721
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,640
Spans proven

722
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,280
A world

723
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,460
Without slack

724
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,840
Hello friends

725
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,400
And welcome

726
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,520
The sermon tonight is entitled

727
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:48,460
How to prepare for the end of times

728
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:51,540
Obviously they're just around the corner now aren't they

729
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:54,120
You look on the horizon and what do you see

730
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:54,840
Death

731
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,020
Destruction

732
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,760
Nuclear Armageddon

733
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,240
All out war

734
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,260
Now move on

735
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:00,260


736
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:00,260


737
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:00,260


738
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:00,260


739
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:00,260


740
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:00,260


741
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:00,260


742
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:01,940
Do nothing but be afraid of what they see

743
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,420
Oh no we might get hurt they say

744
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:05,700
Damn right

745
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,580
And that's the beauty of it

746
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:09,120
Not only are they gonna get hurt

747
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,600
They're gonna get killed

748
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,560
Each and every one of them

749
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,100
They're gonna be slim and in their own blood

750
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,120
Now what about the subgenies you say

751
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,680
Well we're all in this together now you see

752
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,240
Right?

753
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:21,980
Wrong

754
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,860
We've got a lifeguard

755
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:26,020
Someone to toss us a life saver

756
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,180
That life preserver is none other than

757
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:30,020
J.R. Bob Dobbs

758
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,520
and the rope that connects us to his salvation is slack.

759
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,680
The only way you're going to be able to reach Bob Dobbs

760
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,460
and stay afloat is to have enough slack on your lifeline.

761
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:41,160
Now, friends, what does it take to have enough slack?

762
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,840
For one thing, you should always remember

763
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,740
who you are working for.

764
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,380
Now, the pinks, they think they're going to retire

765
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,300
for the conspiracy,

766
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,360
and the conspiracy is going to protect them.

767
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,980
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

768
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,280
Oh, they have a rude awakening in store for them now,

769
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:56,840
don't they?

770
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:59,200
It will begin as a small conflict.

771
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,100
A police action, if you will.

772
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,400
Then it will expand and grow

773
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,040
and engulf the Persian Gulf.

774
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:08,180
Next you'll know they'll be knocking at your door

775
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,520
and ringing on your telephone.

776
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,920
Guess who gets an all-expense-paid trip to the Mediterranean?

777
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,680
They don't call it Club Med for nothing.

778
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,600
The MAD stands for medical,

779
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,280
because that's where you're going to wind up.

780
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,480
But the real fun doesn't even start

781
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:24,180
until the bombs start going off in your very own neighborhood.

782
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,260
Oh, sure, at first it'll only be a local terrorist or two,

783
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,960
so it won't be as if you're being blown

784
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,280
to bits by strangers.

785
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:32,420
But then again, what difference does it make

786
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,800
when you're flying through air with the greatest of ease, eh?

787
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,360
Besides, it's only a matter of time

788
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:40,100
before it begins to rain bombs from the heavens.

789
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,800
You won't be able to step outside

790
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,780
without getting an instant flash burn.

791
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,280
What's that you say?

792
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,080
Everyone is on our side?

793
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,680
The world is united so no one would want to attack us?

794
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:55,340
Who said the bombs would be coming from anywhere on this world?

795
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,800
Friends, they'll be dropped from sub-orbit.

796
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,980
From intergalactic sanitation and sterilization ships

797
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:05,400
dispatched from our good old friends up yonder on Planet 10.

798
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:08,480
They'll watch until the pinks are pretty well pooped from killing each other.

799
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,640
And then they'll come on down and mop up.

800
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:13,320
The killdozers and amphibious land shark ships

801
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,760
will sweep across the countryside with typical efficiency.

802
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,700
They'll round up the pinks like cattle.

803
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,100
Death will take a holiday.

804
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:20,840
The lucky ones will die quick.

805
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:22,680
The unlucky ones will die slow.

806
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,640
And the moron majority won't die at all.

807
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,440
They'll be put in plastic bags and freeze-dried

808
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:28,940
for convenience.

809
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,060
Interplanetary self-service space snacks.

810
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,800
Oh, don't you believe the conspiracy lies

811
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,400
that pinks don't taste good?

812
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,020
They may not have good taste,

813
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,960
but they damn sure taste good.

814
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:43,240
This is just a plain and simple fact you must take on faith for even Bob Dobbs

815
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:46,500
does not suggest that you eat pinks before X-Day.

816
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,040
Lick pinks, now that's alright,

817
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,640
but eat them taboo.

818
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,800
They're a dessert to be savored, to be saved.

819
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,400
Something to look forward to, something to gloat over

820
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,320
as we float over to our promised land beyond the stars.

821
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,320
And we gotta keep them now fresh, don't we?

822
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:03,940
Oh, yes siree, you probably think that a pink can't be freeze-dried

823
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:06,560
and then thawed back to life, but you're wrong.

824
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,920
You're talking about a conspiracy technology there, folks.

825
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,340
But we're talking about the same brains that can go traveling

826
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:16,480
through light years and instantaneous folding of space.

827
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:19,900
Do you think that the minds that contain the wisdom of the universe

828
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:23,520
would allow the pinks to escape life with nothing more than a freeze burn?

829
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:28,300
Why, that only measures 265 candles on the Agony scale.

830
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:32,200
Why, getting sliced to death by paper cuts earns less candles than that.

831
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,100
And after all the pinks have done to you,

832
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:37,120
you're willing to send them off with a mere million paper cuts?

833
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,240
Have you no human dignity?

834
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:43,840
Have you at long last surrendered all semblance of common decency?

835
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:47,820
Bob said, do unto them as they have done unto you.

836
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:51,900
So anything short of the glass rod ramming routine is fair game.

837
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:54,280
Then again, nah.

838
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:58,060
Don't let anybody say that subgenius don't have a little compassion here and there.

839
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,800
So where does this leave us today, dear friends?

840
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,680
It radiates new hope amongst the dark and dreary horizon,

841
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,500
while some whine and whimper about the possible loss of a few million lives,

842
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,080
hither, tither, and yawn.

843
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:15,920
We celebrate, for bub-lical prophecy is coming to fruition.

844
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,700
At long last, the exes will come forth to wreak Bob's revenge.

845
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,660
For lo, these many years of yearning, burning, and churning

846
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,720
amongst the pseudo-suitable substance some say sucks,

847
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,600
but let my people go.

848
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,920
Swing low, sweet chariots of fire.

849
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:34,640
They're coming to take us away, ha.

850
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,540
Yea, the end is nigh.

851
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:41,040
So eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow they die.

852
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,880
Praise Bob, amen.

853
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,660
Oh, praise Bob, praise Bob.

854
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,560
What a beautiful, beautiful thing.

855
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:53,640
That was Father Joe Mama, also known as Papa Joe Mama.

856
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,900
We call him that sometimes.

857
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,700
And before that, of course,

858
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,120
the redoubtable Pastor Bucknaked,

859
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:03,680
Bucknaked and the Jaybirds doing a classic subgenius song,

860
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,580
The Way It Should Be Done,

861
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,540
The Exes Have Landed.

862
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:09,720
Ah, yes.

863
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:11,820
And while I'm thinking about show,

864
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,460
if anybody out there got a copy,

865
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,200
a good stereo copy of this show,

866
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:19,960
particularly somebody who lives, like, in Arlington,

867
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,940
give us a call up here at the station,

868
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:25,600
and, uh, cause we'll probably, there's probably two or three people,

869
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,260
and there's no sense of all of you sending your copy,

870
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:32,640
cause I got, I got a copy, but it's not a good one.

871
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:33,580
It's not stereo.

872
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,900
And, uh, I like to have a good one,

873
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,660
uh, cause we send them out.

874
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,000
And you can call the station, of course,

875
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:44,760
here at 823-7490.

876
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:48,780
It's ironic, too, because old Reverend Sheldon DeWerr

877
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,320
called me up not long ago and said,

878
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:54,620
and left a message saying, should I keep copying our slack shows, or,

879
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,400
cause it's gonna be a hassle, and I said,

880
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,800
and I didn't call him back.

881
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,120
I didn't call him back cause I was too busy.

882
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:00,500
Mm-hmm.

883
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:01,360
Thought I was too busy.

884
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,720
Well, maybe old Sheldon got one of his copies,

885
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:04,640
and maybe he didn't.

886
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,520
If he didn't, it serves me right.

887
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,680
But, friends, let me tell you where to,

888
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:13,060
where to write for more information

889
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:15,580
on the Church of the Subgenius.

890
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,300
Cause you've been listening to the, uh,

891
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:20,500
the preachings of the Church of the Subgenius

892
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,620
from me, your host, Pastor Reverend Ivan Stang,

893
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,300
and, uh, this show is called

894
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:29,900
the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

895
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:33,000
We bring you one hour of slack every week,

896
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:35,460
and that's all the slack you're gonna get until...

897
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:37,840
X day. Ah, yes.

898
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,860
And I know you wanna have all those materials

899
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:42,400
in your pocket that you'll need

900
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,000
for all the paradise that we've been describing.

901
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,620
And you can get write-for-free information

902
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:51,800
on all those other things we have to offer besides radio waves.

903
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:53,740
Just drop by.

904
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:53,740


905
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,400
Drop us a postcard. Send it to...

906
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,540
B-b-b-Bob.

907
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:58,860
That's right.

908
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,360

909
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,580

00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,140
And coming up here, we have this song,

918
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:33,460
uh...uh...uh...

919
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:37,360
the most lovely, lovely Subgenius hymn,

920
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,520
Hymn 999,

921
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:44,420
uh, by the good Reverend Gore Don Trueby in New York.

922
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:46,780
Ah, yes, baby!

923
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,540
Before I play that, I should also mention

924
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,740
for Dallas audiences, there is a referral.

925
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,280
Revival coming up Thursday, July 9th, 9 p.m.

926
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,700
Uh, a modest revival at Chumley's Coffee House

927
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:04,680
in Deep Ellum, right on the corner of Ellum and Good Latimer.

928
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,740
That's Thursday, 9 o'clock, at Chumley's.

929
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,640
Chumley's Coffee House.

930
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,260
Small Subgenius revival.

931
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:13,680
Well, I shouldn't say small.

932
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:16,920
There's about 40 different Subgenius local preachers gonna be there,

933
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,840
including Buck Naked and, uh...

934
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:23,680
Why, just the whole strange gang and Reverend Eddie Lee Banks.

935
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:24,040
Deshalb.

936
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:26,220
Da ignite,

937
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:27,100
And got the city on fire

938
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:27,260
Bride Young or Christina

939
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,400
I...I...I named myself

940
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:31,400


941
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:31,400


942
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,040
I...I never show up

943
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,140
Watching GIZ

944
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:45,300
Thank you, occurs

945
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:04,600
The End Times are near, but there's nothing to fear

946
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:09,320
If you just send us a dollar

947
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:13,160
Get ready, get set

948
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:20,940
Prepare for the launch of the bleeding head of a bomber

949
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:27,500
Remember the motto, perform the salute

950
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:32,940
Slack off and study the pamphlets

951
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:39,080
And if you shoot water, then look to the sky

952
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:43,240
Cause Bob's always somewhere nearby

953
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:46,160
There's a pipe in the sky

954
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,560
And I'll follow

955
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:50,920
Remember the motto, perform the salute

956
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:50,920


957
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,800
And if you shoot water, then look to the sky

958
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:20,260
And if you shoot water, then look to the sky

959
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:50,920
And if you shoot water, then look to the sky

960
00:59:56,340 --> 01:00:14,940
And if you shoot water, then look to the sky

961
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:24,700
And I'll follow with any way

962
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:30,040
Through the sun, make more power

963
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:36,020
Through the hurricane's eyes

964
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:41,380
There's a pipe in the sky

965
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,700
And I'll follow with any way

966
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,920
Through the sun, make more power

967
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:53,780
Through the floor of the ocean

968
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,780
Through the floor of the ocean

969
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:58,800
Through the mountain so high

970
01:00:58,800 --> 01:00:59,040
Through the mountain so high

971
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:04,500
There's a pipe in the sky

972
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,220
There's a pipe in the sky

973
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:09,860
And I'll follow with any way
