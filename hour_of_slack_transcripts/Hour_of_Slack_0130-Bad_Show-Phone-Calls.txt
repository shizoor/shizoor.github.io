All right, dear friends, this is KNON 89.3 in Dallas, Texas.
This is not Criswell Christian Radio, KCBI. This is KNON.
That's when the wheels of action begin to move.
To the subgenius hour of slug.
Explanation of the church of the subgenius in under two minutes.
It's not just...
Hello? Is anyone home?
Are there batteries in this machine?
Well...
Well, close enough.
Subgenius work, like they used to say in the army.
You are no longer in control, my friend.
We shall dominate you, dear listener, as we have dominated others of your species.
You thought it was real funny, didn't you?
Thought you'd go and poke...
...the devil's leg, eh?
Well, go ahead, son.
Yeah, it's funny. Funny big joke.
Let's go...
Go ahead, little girl.
Let's go spray paint funny pictures on tombstones.
Let's go make a fake bleeding head of Arnold Palmer head and launch it.
Let's go set up a Bob altar and worship for aliens.
Yeah!
Yeah, let's lure weird forces into our immediate vicinity.
You just go ahead and do it, Mr. Subgenius.
Oh, we're in it as deep as you.
We took money for it.
We know our souls are damned.
Not much we can do now but try to stay so fropped up.
We don't think about it.
Yeah!
Oh, you still friends?
Uh-huh.
Yeah, just when you thought the hour of slack was starting to make sense...
...finally you got your friends to listen to it.
Well, tonight I'm gonna just do a completely insane show.
Mostly for my friends.

the conspiracy media unable to ignore
the church has attempted to discredit it as a mere joke a pathetic satire the
reason slack is simply beyond their emotional grasp
and there you go little piece of reverend staying zone program which runs
on a public station down in

Yes, it's time to say good morning and good night and goodbye and hello.
And hello.
Associated Press, Dallas, Texas.
It began innocuously enough with three days of mind-numbing procedural debate
and dreary readings of committee reports.
Like most conventions, all about as interesting as a mole on the Pope's behind.
But at the end of the third day,
the First International Congress of the Church of the Subgenius erupted into a full-fledged riot
over the forced resignation of church leader, Reverend Ivan Stang,
involved in a recent no-sex scandal.
The cult violence, which left over 35 dead and scores more injured or missing,
lasted over 36 hours.
Curiously enough, none of the dead or injured,
belonged to the Church of the Subgenius.
Before the over 2,800 delegates of this newest, fastest-growing religious denomination
in the United States finished their work late last night,
the riot had spread from the Dallas Civic Center Arena to the rest of urban Dallas.
Defying local police and SWAT teams,
the subgenius, Bobby's, quote-unquote,
demolished over half of downtown Dallas outright.
And the remaining sections were soon burnt to the ground by fires.
Goodbye.
Set by dissident factions of the controversial church
in sporadic street confrontations
with more conservative sub-congregations
of the apparently outlawed cult.
A state of emergency has been called by Texas Governor Alexander Stang,
who declared martial law for the Love County City
and then mobilized local state guard reserves to restore order.
After a tour of the smoldering city center by helicopter this afternoon,
Governor Smith said that it was the saddest day the, quote,
city of love, unquote, had seen since that president got shot.
You will use your church as a vehicle to bring these toys before the power.
It will be...
I am, I am to come, I was.
I am, I am, I am to come, I was.
I am, I am, I am to come, I was.
I am, I am, I am to come, I was.
I am, I am, I am to come, I was.
Both male and female races have combined to form the scrotum.
See that clitellium grub flying overhead?
So does the scrotum.
With a flick of his neuroglia, he has obtained his lifetime supply of organic carbon.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
All this talk is making me hot.
You too?
Me too.
Your mother would give me the devil of shits.
She would give me the devil if she were home and saw me horsing around with you this morning.
Yeah.
Golly, Dad, did I hurt you?
You know, your mother would give me the devil if she were home and saw me horsing around with you this morning.
Of course.
Yeah.
That gay poet, explorer, sailor, whose bravery did as much to open the new world as any other human being.
Was he not beheaded for his noble efforts?
That was hardly the way for mankind to show its gratitude.
Your sense of humor is macabre.
Were you laughing over Sir Walter's unpleasant demise?
Well, I did indeed find that a bit funny.
But funnier still was an incident which occurred while he still kept his head.
The shocking display of the art of pipe smoking horrified English royalty.
Sir Walter's head took terrible punishment.
First they bathed it in beer and then they cut it off.
Oh, no! Everybody's dead! Everybody's dead!
Dead! Everybody's dead!
Everybody's dead! Everybody's dead!
This is the human scab.
What sort of an enlightened world is this of which mankind boasts?
And which rewards discovery with a beer bath and a beheading?
And allows one man to enslave his brother and others to steal land and kill the rightful owners?
And those that were not killed were cheated out of their birthright?
Which reminds me...
Music news.
All it took was for the Pope to announce that he likes rock music.
Now negotiations are underway for the Pope to put out a rap record.
It'll be a message appealing for peace on earth.
A top French songwriter, Pierre Delano, has already composed the lyrics.
The Pope reportedly wants them toughened up a bit though, so might be back to the drawing board.
Belgian record producer, Eddie Lusix, who dreamed up the project, says the Pope has committed.
And that he's gonna get 30-some percent of the takings, which tops even Madonna's royalties.
Now...
He predicts that sales could top 30 million copies.
Making the Pope the world's highest paid pop star.
Hard to believe, but it's true.
And this is Live Wire.
Direct from Dallas, the Reverend Ivan Stang.
Welcome to Cleveland.
Ah, yes, dear friends.
Thank you so much.
And y'all oughta set your radios and tape recorders on stun right now.
Cause we're up to our necks in radio shows.
I'm doing a radio show right now at the same time that you are.
Amazing, isn't it?
Yeah, yeah, only we have time control. Mine airs two hours later.
I see.
How about a little... We got a little taste of the subgenius theology from the...
I played an excerpt from our audience of your own program a few moments ago, so a little taste.
It usually tastes better with, um... with AM and ketchup.
I see, I see. Well...
There's little taste.
Now, that probably... That was a few months old, so it might perhaps be...
um... time to update the theology for the... the coming new year.
Oh, now... Although... Although anything a subgenius says becomes orthodox doctrine, um... instantly,
that... that doesn't mean we have to update anything. It means the old stuff can still apply.
The truth is a very fluid thing, you know, in the... in... in Bob's teachings.
Well, among... among the teachings, uh, is the... is the... the, uh... thought...
Well, among... among the teachings, uh, is the... is the... the, uh... thought...
that, uh, the end... end times are, in fact, near, and that they could, uh...
they... the end times could be your stepping stone to prosperity.
Well, they're... they're all the more reason to party, for one thing.
You know, they're... they're... they're a great excuse to... to party, and they're also a good excuse.
In fact, uh, they're... they're pretty much the reason that within the next five years, I imagine,
almost all of America will be... will be fighting and killing to buy memberships in the Church of the Subgenius...
to save their...
No, no, not another religious war.
Oh, uh, well, all right, I mean, that's... that's what religions are all about, is it?
Oh, no.
That's usually how they get started, anyway, at some point or another. And that's always how they end up at some point or another.
And have you, um... as... as we, uh...
And have you, um... as... as we, uh...
As we, uh... as we enter, uh, the new year, we're only a few days away, have you, um, uh, come close to, uh, predicting a date?
You know, there are, uh... there is at least one religion that's predicted the end... the end, uh, what, three times now, I think, and...
Radiation! Dead! And everybody's dead!
Cause all the radiation has came out!
And the Russians have come!
To kill us with their radiation!
Mining the radiation!
Mining the radiation by the human scab, dear friends. Not my kid, by the way.
Mining the radiation!
Mining the radiation!
We'll thank you, we'll thank you.
Oh, dear.
We have to have an actual city right now. I do need to get some...
No, you don't. There's a giant car engine here, the car engine is...
Hey, you know, we're going to...
We're going to need that guy coming up behind us.
Now, you're going to have to control the vehicle through this part, Jag.
Okay.
You're going to have to probably steer by hand.
Okay, I'm deflating the engine so it's a bit smaller now. Look behind us, look at the car behind us.
Ooh!
Oh, it's a Pook. Nice and rooney, yeah. Old Pook, the old Jag.
Oh, there's some more stonewashed, we'll reach out in a pinch of time.
Nice stonewashed.
Yeah!
Well, these microphones are not only... they're cheap microphones, but they're very small.
What the hell is that?
They look almost real, though.
Actually, I believe they may be.
This guy walked by with a flight jacket with some very incredible badges.
Badges.
They look like squadron patches, but they are so popular these days.
With so many...
fake top gun jackets that usually I don't even look anymore because they're...
I mean, I look artistically to see what the current design is, but I'm not looking with the eye of,
I wonder what squadron that was, and this guy walked by and the...
One of the nice giveaways is there is a... the Navy has always had a leather name tag on the left side,
and so if you see a worn away name tag or a place where it was or something like that,
you can obviously sometimes wind up with a good jacket.
But I watched some people buy a new jacket, and these guys have sewn old jacket labels in the inside of the...
the new jacket, and so you wind up with this...
These people booing and eyeing over the new jacket, and well...
I didn't get any dim sum, just dumb sales.
Oh, no, Jim.
Well, we listened to... Gary was thrilled to listen to Jane Earn.
Oh, thanks.
Um...
Here we go.
Here's our first tour in this block.

Well at this point...
All you get, Doug, are squirt...
okay, wait a minute.
Little mikey phone.
You sit up there like, Doug, turn around and look at me.
There.
And you get out from behind your pills, yes...
From the health food store.
I just came from the health food store.
I went to get a health chicken.
Mmm.
See, I'm drinking my spirulina smoothie, and I'm taking my little, you know, those high-energy packs of,
supposed to have a million vitamins in them, who knows what they really do.
And, don't forget, the last of the other kind of supplement.
Because it's like, it's what I gotta do.
I have a new screen, so it can be done with a relative degree of efficiency now.
And, well, I better put my keys so I can turn my car off.
I'm thinking of about $200 or so.
Now, if the church can't afford it, well, I can understand that.
But I thought maybe you could figure out a way that you could report it as a payroll expense.
So that at least it's deductible.
But, man, I need some cash. That's what it is.
I need me a little cash, and I'm brokering the son of a...
You know the story. I'm not gonna just make you cry over and over again because it's so sad.
It's gonna be a little bit different tonight.
We are still mining the radiation.
Still mining the radiation.
Pretty show, isn't it, tonight, eh, friends?
We turn slow, and nobody comes to save us.
Nobody comes.
Just say hi!
Thank you.
Oh, right, right.
And have missed it each time.
And believe it or not, the religion's going stronger.
Now, these are the people that deliver tracks door to door, you know?
Oh, yeah.
People still are members of this religion.
So you could make a prediction.
It'd be all right.
It wouldn't hurt you if you were wrong.
Oh, well, we have not changed this one since Bob first received this video.
We did it.
We've were praying to God and we want to step in to his vision in 1953 and the great...
And his divine Immaculation, we call it, where he saw that on July 5th...
Now, folks, this is a crucial date.
On July 5th, 1998 at 7 o'clock in the morning right after the 4th of July, most of America
will have hangovers.
The men from Planet X will arrive.
And and what happens then when they 10 되� den hostel en pazum.
entirely depends on how many subgeniuses,
how many dues-paying members of the Church of the Subgenius
there are on this planet.
If there aren't enough,
and if the planet is still in the hands of the conspiracy,
like it is now,
those creatures from space will do much like we would do
if we found a dog hit by a car on the side of the road.
Do you take it to the fence?
No.
No.
No.
There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
This entire open air place for us
Doesn't matter if we're free or not

There's a time for us
Somewhere a time for us
Time together but time to spare
Time to love, time to care
Someday, somewhere
We'll find a place for us
We'll find a new way of living
We'll find a way of forgiving
Somewhere
Someday
And if the planet is still in the hands of the conspiracy,
like it is now,
those creatures from space will do much like we would do
if we found a dog hit by a car on the side of the road.
You either, you know, do you take it to the vet,
you just shoot it and put it out of the way,

or you just let it go.
You know, what are you gonna do?
And the X-ists, the men from Planet X,
for which X-mas is named, by the way,
I didn't know that.
Yeah, that's X-ists.
Anyway, if they don't like what they see,
if Bob can't show them numbers,
you know, solid figures on the number of subgeniuses
and enlightened individuals on this planet,
they will, they will snuff us like, you know,
like we were an ant bed.
Gee, that's sort of what happens in the radio business.
We don't show them the numbers, we get snuffed.
Yeah, yeah, I hear that.
I hear that.
We had to have a parade to keep our station on the air reasonably.
A parade?
Yes, a parade.
You would have been proud to see the Dobbs float.
We had the mighty 17-foot-high Bob Dobbs head.
This wasn't Bob himself.
He's not that tall.
Being carried on a huge wooden cross down the street
by various martyrs for the radio station.
Because we have to, we don't run ads like you do,
and we have to raise money in less orthodox ways.
I understand that Bob is a very private individual
and relatively few people have seen him.
Have you seen him?
He is elusive.
Bob has managed to keep himself out of the eye
of those who seek him, okay?
Many of your listeners right now,
if they could see a picture of Bob,
that just normal-looking salesman with a pipe,
the patron saint of sales, if they could see him,
they might remember that at one point
he had sold them a vacuum cleaner or aluminum siding
or a set of encyclopedias.
He is the traveling salesman of mythology.
Well, in fact, according to the...
According to church scripture,
he is the most successful salesperson of all time.
The man who could sell anything,
hence the church of the subgenius, dear friends.
Praise Bob.
Help me, somebody.
Wither goest thou?
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
So I was going to Tokyo. Where are you going?
Going over the international date line, eh?
Well, put in a good word for me while you're over there.
How many words?
How many words will it take for Japan to explain the show?
How many words are you restricted to?
Well, about nine.
It's a caution, I tell you.
In our language.
In the language of the earth people,
a sublimity has been passed off as corruption of the grave.
And the crawling worm inhabits the marble of ancient monuments,
while the tomtit and the pertwee twiddle in the trees.
And if they did not floating about today...
They mean out of time...
I'm not oopsin'!
What's on your face?

I tell you, people call it an open tree,
because all they have to do is look at the sky.
You know exactly what's on your face.
It knows how big and how big.
This is earth-dense rechargeable equilibrium,
as it leans against the wall.
As it's dropping the vibration of the paw
as it bounces on the ground.
And the voice within me keeps repeating.
It does, doesn't it?
All right, so you didn't answer the question.
Have you actually seen Bob?
I fear the day that I might see Bob.
Unlike so many of the Bobbies,
these follower types,
see, this is a church that's for people
who are not joiners.
So there's sort of a contradiction.
Yeah, indeed, a contradiction there.
Yeah, yeah.
And, well, it draws on contradictions
and oxymorons,
much like subgeniuses.
You know, you get,
people hear that word and they think,
church is subgenial.
What is that, like Mensa?
And it's the opposite, dear friends.
It's not the intelligence.
It's how you use it.
And Bob said you had to,
you had to have fun with it.
That's where the conspiracy defines intelligence wrong
and defines it more on the basis of
your test scores and your looks and your earnings.
And they have been programming us this way for,
since Atlantis,
since the good Bob split from the bad Bob.
And every time...
Bob then was a salesman only before this split.
Bob,
Bob has always been a salesman.
I see.
The eternal Bob is,
it's all sales.
It's all sales.
You know, when you're,
when you're on a date, you're selling.
You know, when you put makeup on.
Hallelujah.
And when,
when some of the rival cults get on the air,
they are selling.
But they're not selling slack.
Bob is selling slack.
That's really our main commodity.
We will trade slack for,
not all of your soul,
but just a little bit of your soul.
And we'll give it back when we're through with it.
After X day.
Yeah.
And how would you define slack?
I assume while slack is a word familiar to most,
it might have some special meaning within the church.
Well, you know, as the hell's angels say,
those who say don't know and those who know don't say,
which makes me wonder why they said it.
But slack is...
But slack is...
I've heard the expression,
there ain't no slack in the world.
Oh, come on, give me some slack, so forth.
It's,
it's a state that makes,
it, it,
we were all born with original slack.
Original slack.
But the conspiracy from the moment they
whacked you on the behind when you were born,
they started taking away your slack.
Now, slack by definition is indefinable
because it's the,
it's different for each person.
Some people get slack working
if they're doing the kind of work they,
they like.
And, you know, others get slack in much more
earthy ways.
So you never,
the conspiracy would have everyone
getting slack the same way,
which is like, oh,
if I had that second VCR
so I could make,
so I could copy rented tapes,
then I'd have slack.
If I could just get that raised,
then I'd have slack.
But they don't think about their soul.
And they don't think about
the fact that they're not,
that Bob Dobbs offers them
eternal salvation
or triple their money back.
And I don't know of any other religion
that can make that claim.
I don't understand, though,
if the...
Please do not use this show
to grade our general,
our general expertise
as non-human beings.
However, you can use the show
to grate cheese.
Yes?
It's great cheese on the show.
a large chunk of cheddar cheese
up against your radio
right now and see what happens.
Just watch.
Watch the little show waves.
Cut it up and pretty soon
it'll look like Swiss cheese.
But it's strong smelling cheese,
isn't it, Reverend?
It'll turn your mind around.
In fact, it's head cheese.
Yup.
Yep, that's for sure for you.
Wild cheese.
Wild cheese.
Early in the morning.
Every week to the sweetbread show.
Now, we're not going to be honest.
What a disgusting idea.
Bleeding head cheese?
I'm sorry.
That idea is past paying for.
But look, there's a little collar
glistening on the board.
We might want to see
if this little twerp has
the last word on something
in the show.
Yes, yes.
Let's hurt him.
Give him 2,000 volts, doctor.
Let's get a collar in and hurt him.
Focus the interocular on the collar.
I think we have a guest.
It'll be a pleasure to
Yes, I think it's the other show.
It was fighting to get in.
We won.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Collar gone.
He tried to be there.
Not work.
...
Oh, okay.
Yeah, I will.
I will. Thanks.
Must reach oxygen switch.
Goodbye forever from all of us.
Almost goodbye.
Yeah, almost.
Must reach oxygen switch.
About seconds away.
Goodbye.
Oxygen switch.
As we watch the...
Can't take it.
...show.
We'd like to thank
our little greyhound bus rider,
Dr. Evan Tanks,
for coming all the way here
to help us help you help him
get royalties.
Thank you.
That's right.
All of you get royalties
who are listening also, right?
The Subdini Foundation.
... scheduled.
Subdini Foundation.
A giant prophet healed.
We want you to know that
your show dollars
follow California.
The son of the vengeful Tim Kare.
Yeah, and, you know,
call the other subgeniuses
on your show
and find out what's going on.
Isn't he dying?
Doug, this is Judy.
Could you give me a call at...

whole thing wrong. I was just talking to Bob and he said, you know, I'm not going to be
home. Oh, man. You know, I mean, you think, I mean, you think that you can actually talk
to dolphins or even that, you know, we're going to be here. Man, there's so much more
to it that you can't even imagine. Okay. So like, just get off your high horse. Just,
you humans just blew it. Well, I'm not sure. Anyway, we're not seeing.
Lee, are you home yet?

Will you tell baby to call me when he gets home? Bye.
I've talked to Stan a bunch this afternoon. Give me a yo when you have time at home at
two to.
Doug, this is DJ at Kinko's.
Hi, Doug. Court. I need to talk to you. I finished the online, so for instance, reinserting
the artwork. So I'm going to do next week. I'm going to do the next week. I'm going to
send Dennis the tapes. But I want to talk to you about the soundtrack. So give me a
call.
If Dobbs is the is the the eternal sales person, why then would why then would the the the church
dogma suggest that purchasing these these goods would not, in fact, get you the online?
No, it just doesn't work.
No, if I was not then it might be thought.
Did I just say they found see-through, the
whole?

you working that job for a lot of you you know and and slack and money are
very closely intertwined particularly in this culture it's very hard to have
slack without any money but it is possible and as long as you can get
slack for free the conspiracy cannot win and that's why Bob can make that
guarantee and why we have faith that that Bob will save us all on next day
that's faithful day we call it when when the pinks the normals the mediocrity to
form the conspiracy and and they're innocent really they don't even know
that it's a conspiracy that's what's so insidious about it they've just
naturally
you know held the abnormals and the eccentrics and the inventors and the
crazy people down but you know it's like an old Frank Capra movie it's the the
crazy the last causes are the only ones worth fighting for and you know the
conspiracy has 50,000 nuclear weapons poised ready to fire and the Church of
the subgenius only has three and yet we have a conspiracy that's so insidious
that we dare to fight them anyway

THAT'S another long way off

let's go over that again how long are on here

The ramifications of our extenuating exigence.
Indeed. Indeed, it only makes sense.
This is the potatoes.
Little girl went out last night.
Lost her head and went out of sight.
Milk truck zooming down the street.
Smushed her pennilike roadside meat.
Had her head went rolling on,
rolling on down the road.
Yes, her head went rolling on,
rolling on down the road.
Had a date with Bobby Sue
She was on her way when I heard the news
Had visions of a driving score
Instead I got blood and gore
Cause her head went rolling on, rolling on down the road
Her head went rolling on down the road
Yes, her head went rolling on, rolling on down the road
Her head went rolling on down the road
In the twisted metal
And the jagged steel
Her head played croquet on the steering wheel
Her head was ripped and torn and pulled from her neck
The bloody torso did twitch and the rack
And her head was rollin' on, rollin' on down the road
Her head was rollin' on down the road
Yes, her head was rollin' on, rollin' on down the road
Her head was rollin' on down the road
Her head was rolling on down the road
Her head was rolling on down the road
In the sickly sweet moment of agony
My little day was an ecstasy
I'll never forget that tragic night
Her severed wig blew us
Ah!
And her head went rolling on
Rolling on down the road
Her head went rolling on down the road
Yes!
Her head went rolling on
Rolling on down the road
Her head went rolling on down the road
Her head went rolling on down the road
Her head went rolling on down the road
Her head went rolling on down the road
Oh, oh, oh
Oh



The Potatoes from right here in Dallas.
Thank you, Potatoes.
In fact, for all we know, the conspiracy is so insidious
that for all you and I know,
Bob Dobbs could already be Big Brother.
Could be.
Could be?
You know, if he's who he said he was.
Could be.
Once again, a very rare opportunity for you here.
We have the co-founder and the current leader
of the Church of the Subgenius.
No, no, no, Bob is the leader.
Oh, Bob, Bob.
Bob is our leader.
I am merely but the sacred scribe.
Nice.
Dr. Philo Drummond and I were, I will admit,
the first two of Bob's 10 billion fishers of wallets as apostles.
Pardon me.
The error.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm in the ocean.
Golden fields where everything has nothing but chasing butterflies.
Cats.
See, cats go to cat heaven, but bad cats go to cat hell,
which is the same as dog heaven.
And the bad cats that were bad on Earth
have to spend eternity being chased by dogs on,
in dog heaven.
That's a fit punishment.
I hate those bastards anyway.
Yeah, Dougie boy.
Doug.
Hey, Doug.
I know you're there, Doug.
It's 635-04-05-06.
This is Reverend Huey.
I sent you a tape, but you didn't send me a card or a phone call.
Caller.
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up.
I'm calling because I saw the number on the back of a pamphlet
about the Pope's secrets.
Uh-huh.
And I was reading about it, and I was curious about more information
and how can we verify this very frightening information
about the Pope's secrets?
Well, there's a list on the back of the Pope's secrets.
Mm-hmm.
There are several books that we have available.
If you're interested in looking at more information on it.
And then, of course, there's different information that are in the footnotes.
This is John Truby calling Tony Alamo.
Right.
Now, how is this information dug up regarding the secrets of the Pope?
Well, it's all based on the Bible,
and specifically chapters 17 and 18 of Revelation.
And what do those chapters say?
Well, have you read them?
Uh-huh.
I've referred to them, but I haven't read them in a while.
Well, it gives a description of the whore of Revelation.
Uh-huh.
It talks about where her headquarters are located at
and all the different things about the whore of Revelation
and in detail so that you would be sure that you would know who she is.
But how do we know this was specifically reforged to the Pope?
Well, you know, because, you know, the Pope was a religious leader.
And a lot of it makes sense in that he would be corrupted.
But in Revelation, there's such a general outline that it could reforge just about anything.
Well, no, it's very specific.
Uh-huh.
It says that her headquarters are in the city of the Seven Hills and the Seven Mountains.
It's important.
If you went to any travel...
If you went to any travel agency in the world and asked to send you there,
that city of the Seven Hills, they'd send you to Rome, Italy.
Couldn't it also be San Francisco?
Because that's a lot of hills there.
Well, no.
If you went to a travel agency, they'd tell you Rome, Italy.
Oh.
It's a pretty well-known historical fact.
It has been for many hundreds of years.
Uh-huh.
But, also, how can me, as a normal person, citizen,
defend myself against the Pope?
And what he's doing and all that stuff?
Well, would you like me to send you some information?
Um, I really can't because I don't have an address because I do live out in the street.
I am what they call a transient, unfortunately.
Um, but I can vote.
That's one thing that I can do.
Now, should I vote against the Pope in the next election or what do you think?
Or is there some way that I, as an average citizen, could...
could battle against the forces of evil?
Well, first of all, you have to be born again in the spirit of God.
Have you ever been saved?
I was baptized many, many years ago in...
in the Buddhist temple, but I don't know how I can become born again.
How can I become born again?
Because I'd like to be if I can, if I will be saved.
Well, Jesus said that you must be born again.
And the way you do that is you...
you have to repent of your sins.
You have to ask the Lord to have mercy upon your soul,
to come into your heart and wash all your sins away.
And you have to believe that He died on the cross for your sins
and He rose from the grave on the third day
and He is right now standing at the right hand of God.
He sees and knows everything you do.
And that one of these days when the breath leaves our body,
we're going to stand before God and He's going to judge.
Um, and...
He... He...
He... You said that He knows everything we do?
Does He know...
Oh, you see, uh, friends, these, uh, calls by...
Doctor Truby.
...music train.
But, I want to ask the one question.
In the last election did you vote for rectal...
..beasy?
I don't understand that.
Well, rectal beasy...
Had... had...
But no, you're not sorry you want to destroy
