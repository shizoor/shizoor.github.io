1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,880
Awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius power of SWAT.

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,100
And the race is on.

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,840
And if the first album wasn't hit.

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,740
It's time to break the rules.

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,340
On your mark, get set, go!

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,700
OBE and the tools.

7
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,320
On your mark, get set, go!

8
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,520
Forget what used to be.

9
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,300
On your mark, get set, go!

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,680
Forge a new territory.

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,320
On your mark, get set, go!

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,200
Take the leap, you must begin.

13
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,480
The race to the future is the race to win.

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,640
The race to survive, the course is last.

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,320
The race to defeat, the race to pass.

16
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,680
Free a new design.

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,520
On your mark, get set, go!

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,400
Unlock the void of your mind.

19
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,480
On your mark, get set, go!

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,320
Ignore the plastic scenery.

21
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,440
On your mark, get set, go!

22
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,080
Or entail yourself on the machinery.

23
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,240
On your mark, get set, go!

24
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,040
Law.

25
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,000
Cause' تي specificationbull a

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,120
The Time Is Isso

27
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,200
The Tipinho

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,660
The Neverending

29
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:49,660


30
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:49,660


31
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,520
That makes you come to saying

32
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:58,680
the Time is This!

33
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:58,680


34
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:10,260
Otherwise, take it from them, take it from them, you must take it from them now.

35
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:27,480
Oh yes, dear friends, OBE, you must take it from them now.

36
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:37,200
OBE, they're from their wonderful CD, it's got, yeah, OBE stands for Out of Band Experience.

37
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,240
This is their CD, Open Your Ear.

38
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:47,340
Open Your Ears, which also has a whole lot of subgenius songs by their other name, Kings of Feedback.

39
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:54,440
And you can, the OBE CD is real cheap, I think it's like five bucks or six bucks or something,

40
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:01,440
and you can call them at 1-617, you got that pencil ready?

41
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:07,480
It's an easy phone number, 617-LICK-OBE.

42
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,740
That's 617-LICK.

43
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,820
617-LICK-OBE.

44
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:18,720
Also at Box 221, Boston, MA, 02123.

45
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:27,700
Yeah, man, OBE can save you, and the Church of the Subgenius must save you,

46
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,280
even if it means you must die, or something like that.

47
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,200
Well, an hour, two hours ago, I did last week's show,

48
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,240
and now I'm doing this.

49
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,720
I'm doing this week's show, but in between, I had to do an interview with a very nice reporter

50
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,760
from Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Weekly there, because we're doing a show in Pittsburgh,

51
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,380
which I'm about to tell you about, on February 17th.

52
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,780
This is my only real bit of news that, and I know you don't all live near Pittsburgh,

53
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:07,700
but, well, those WCSB listeners do, and those in Philly certainly do.

54
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,100
Okay, Pittsburgh.

55
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,400
Pittsburgh.

56
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,760
Eye of Horus Bookstore.

57
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,120
February 17th.

58
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,700
That's Friday.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,660
That bookstore is called the Eye of Horus.

60
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:24,180
Now, they may decide that they're going to have too many people to hold it in the bookstore,

61
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,600
so you might give them a call if you're thinking about going to that show.

62
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:34,580
That number is 412-481-7887.

63
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,240
You Pittsburghians, that's 481-7887.

64
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,220
To find out at the last minute before February 17th,

65
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,700
whether it's going to be at the Eye of Horus Bookstore.

66
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,840
And it's a full classic revival with head launch-ins.

67
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:55,340
We'll probably do a watch smashing and the old short-duration marriage ceremony,

68
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,060
which we actually haven't done in about a year,

69
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,340
because I figure people will get tired of it, certainly the radio audience.

70
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:06,920
And I won't go into the Japanese revival, because you're not going to go.

71
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,120
And, uh...

72
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,120
And, uh...

73
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,640
What else have we here?

74
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,520
I'm looking through my little list of news.

75
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:20,620
I'm not going to try to sell you on the necessity of getting a connection to the internet,

76
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,880
so that you can talk to us back and forth better.

77
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,060
I could also say, why don't you start your own radio station?

78
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,640
And you can broadcast stuff.

79
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,600
Hell, I can't even...

80
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,980
They don't even allow me to broadcast here in Dallas, Texas.

81
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:36,880
No, sir.

82
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,760
It's too raw.

83
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,420
Too rough for the...

84
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,880
Polished ears of the Dallasians.

85
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:42,880
Uh-huh.

86
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,900
Well, I actually have a wonderful CD here that's nothing but Dallas bands,

87
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,740
who never get played on Dallas radio,

88
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,040
and I may just use a lot of that stuff.

89
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,160
With this, uh...

90
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,460
Yeah, what was I going to...

91
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,040
Well, I've got...

92
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,680
Actually, I've got...

93
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,000
Before I get into any of that,

94
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,040
I've just got some news and rants to get off of my chest.

95
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,380
Let's see how...

96
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,320
If this...

97
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:07,940
Rawr!

98
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,140
Uh, yes.

99
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,560
Now, keep in mind that the opinions expressed here

100
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,300
are definitely not the opinions of any radio station

101
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,700
or radio listener anywhere, probably.

102
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,940
I really don't care.

103
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,220
There's a radio station in, uh...

104
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,320
San Francisco

105
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,800
called...

106
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,580
A pink rock and roll station called KITS.

107
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,400
KITS.

108
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,540
In San Francisco, which, uh...

109
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,440
At 5 o'clock at night, they...

110
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,920
Well, a friend of...

111
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,580
A friend of ours heard, uh...

112
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,780
A, uh...

113
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,740
Hey, where's my...

114
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,440
Oh, there we go.

115
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,020
There's my volume.

116
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,120
A friend of mine heard...

117
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,180
Was listening to this station and heard them say,

118
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,140
At 5 o'clock!

119
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,100
Coming up at 5 o'clock!

120
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,540
The hour of slack!

121
00:06:59,060 --> 00:06:59,500
Rawr!

122
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,040
Yes!

123
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,420
And this...

124
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,000
My friend tuned in, thinking,

125
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,620
My God!

126
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,180
This station is going to play the hour of slack?

127
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,400
And they proceeded to play...

128
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,680
An hour of classic rock.

129
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,640
Uh...

130
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,120
Classic 70s or contemporary rock.

131
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,600
You know, I mean, the stuff that you hear in the elevators.

132
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,160
And, uh...

133
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,740
They just thought that was such a funny title to call their show.

134
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,540
Them and Bill Gates with Microsoft

135
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,660
and his foolish Microsoft Bob.

136
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,920
Oh, they can have their Bobs.

137
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,300
But they cannot have that one true Bob

138
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,940
like you can.

139
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,360
Unless they spend...

140
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:39,840
$30.

141
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,140
In which case, those rich asses

142
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,320
can have a lot more Bob than you.

143
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:44,940
How about that?

144
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:46,820
$30.

145
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,680
Well, we shan't go into that.

146
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,420
Um...

147
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,740
Because, you know, friends, I'm not a new ager.

148
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,840
I want you to know that.

149
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,280
I am no new ager.

150
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,120
And I'm not speaking for every other subgenius.

151
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,800
But I'm a new ageist.

152
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,080
I'm an old cantankerous preacher.

153
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:02,720
And I...

154
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,420
I'm...

155
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,520
I'm kind of sick and tired of this...

156
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,460
This, uh...

157
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,920
Oh, well, everybody's opinion is equal.

158
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,620
That's not true.

159
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,440
Most people are...

160
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,380
Well, I don't want to say stupid

161
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,400
because, gosh, I mean, that's what makes Bob so special.

162
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,540
But...

163
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,260
So...

164
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,540
Duh.

165
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,460
So lacking in that...

166
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,600
Spark.

167
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,580
That spark of originality or eccentricity.

168
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,620
It's our abnormality power, my friends.

169
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,820
But the pinks, man, I mean, they...

170
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,800
It gets depressing.

171
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:46,740
Just as much for a famous subgenius TV star like myself as it does for you.

172
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,860
Hearing everybody griping about how they're a victim.

173
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,260
Oh, yeah.

174
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,160
Everybody's a victim nowadays.

175
00:08:53,360 --> 00:09:00,100
They're whining about, oh, I can't get ahead in the world because they messed me up.

176
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,680
Oh, I'm a victim.

177
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,840
They've held me back.

178
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,020
Our people have been mistreated.

179
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,400
I hear that.

180
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,640
I hear that night and day, all that whining.

181
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,700
You hear it all day long on the liberal biased media.

182
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,080
But, you know, what weirds me out is that

183
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,440
what they're whining about is they're all saying they're victims of the liberal biased media.

184
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,460
All day long.

185
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,860
People on the radio and on TV and in the newspapers

186
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,420
complaining about how they're victims of...

187
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,940
and whining about how the liberal biased media...

188
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,140
The liberals.

189
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:54,440
Which means, you know, the satanists, you know, creatures, mud things, the evil, the queers, you know, the Jews, you know.

190
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,520
I know what that means.

191
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,480
And the godless, too.

192
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,900
I mean, it's all part of one.

193
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,820
But I'll tell you what, I'd like to admit that I'm a liberal, dear friend.

194
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,320
In fact, as far as I'm concerned, what these people call liberals are...

195
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,960
are middle-of-the-road-to-right-wing cranks.

196
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm so damn liberal that I'd like to have all the liberals lined up against a wall and shot.

197
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,280
Right after forcing them to do that to all the conservatives.

198
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,660
I'm a patriopsychotic anarcho-materialist, my friends.

199
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,700
And, you know, it's the normal biased media is what it is.

200
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,560
It's the media trying to tell you that you can label somebody.

201
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,480
And, boy, it's amazing how...

202
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,560
Think about all those people you knew that when it was cool to be a liberal, they were liberals.

203
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,600
When it was cool to be a feminist, they were feminists.

204
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,320
Now it's cool to be a conservative, so they're conservatives.

205
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,760
It's so nice to know that people put so much...

206
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,120
Oh, they've wised up now.

207
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:50,960
Right? Yeah.

208
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,780
Uh, so, um...

209
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,820
Oh, you can tell they've wised up because, um, here in...

210
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,160
Oh, the news lately, friends.

211
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,320
It's the Dallas Morning News.

212
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,660
That's to talk about liberal biased media.

213
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,700
Heh. Heh. Heh.

214
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,200
Um...

215
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:09,740
Uh, yeah.

216
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,200
Plano Schools, uh, here.

217
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,840
This was a wonderful paper.

218
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,340
Science Book Creating Dissent.

219
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:18,880
Plano...

220
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,640
That's a... Believe it or not, that's a little town, or a suburb of Dallas.

221
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,420
Plano.

222
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:32,480
School trustees are considering use of a science textbook that some critics say espouses a thinly disguised version of creationism.

223
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,620
And it sure does.

224
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:39,240
And this was the entire school board, or not the whole school board, but most of the school board in Plano.

225
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,240
You know, this is the typical thing of these people going, uh,

226
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,880
Yes, we just want more family values in our schools.

227
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,120
And then when you elect them, then they go,

228
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,440
By the way, we are members of the religious right.

229
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,540
That's the polite term, you know.

230
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,540
I don't... I'm sorry, I think that's too polite.

231
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,880
I prefer to call them religious nuts.

232
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,660
Religious fanatics. How about that, okay?

233
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,400
Because get this!

234
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:03,800
Um...

235
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,260
This book called Of Pandas and People

236
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,420
is something that this... these...

237
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:14,560
brilliant Texas school board people want to put in the classrooms.

238
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:15,940
Um...

239
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:22,020
Now critics have branded the text as a thinly veiled religious dogma.

240
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,740
They note that the words creationism and God

241
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:33,340
are purposely absent to skirt a 1987 Supreme Court decision that banned discussion of biblical creation in the classroom.

242
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,060
Actually, I think people should be able to discuss biblical creation.

243
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:37,960
But!

244
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,720
Get this stuff, man.

245
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:45,040
The book argues that living things are too complex to be explained by natural causes.

246
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,160
It maintains that they began fully formed.

247
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,500
Fish suddenly appeared with fins.

248
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,700
Birds with feathers as the handiwork of an intelligent designer.

249
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,140
No, I don't know.

250
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,480
This whole... this whole article seems to disprove the...

251
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,000
that there's an intelligent...

252
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,220
If it's an intelligent designer, friends,

253
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,660
it has a sick,

254
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,240
sick,

255
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:07,920
sense of humor.

256
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,740
Uh, the book makes a point of avoiding creationist red flags.

257
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:17,600
For example, it does not assert that the Earth is less than 10,000 years old,

258
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,200
or refer to the story of Noah's flood.

259
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,720
So, you know, they've like, cleaned it up.

260
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,080
Now it's not God.

261
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,260
It's the handiwork of an intelligent designer.

262
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,300
We won't...

263
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,600
Well, we believe that the... it was...

264
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,720
the Earth was created 10 thou... 4,000 years ago,

265
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,100
and God put... invented carbon dating,

266
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,440
to test our faith,

267
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,320
and invented geological...

268
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,580
the geological record in the apparent age of fossils,

269
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,280
and the apparent, uh...

270
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:46,540
uh...

271
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,700
activity going on throughout history of evolution.

272
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,400
That was just a... a... a red herring

273
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,040
to test the faith of those godless scientists,

274
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,500
and it serves them right to go to hell,

275
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,380
because, you know, friends,

276
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,920
what it comes down to

277
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,980
is it's not that those people love God so much.

278
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,620
It's that they love the idea of you and me

279
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,440
going to hell.

280
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,000
That's what keeps them going.

281
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,660
Well, this... the guy... this, uh, school board guy,

282
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,700
defen...

283
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,540
He denies that pandas is closet creationism.

284
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,580
Sure, it has theistic implications,

285
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,400
or religious implications,

286
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,580
just as Darwinism has atheistic implications.

287
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,620
Well, friends, uh, probably, um, the parents...

288
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,940
And then that's what's been happening.

289
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,200
The parents get together and go,

290
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,360
God, I didn't know we were, uh,

291
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,220
uh, electing these, uh, nuts.

292
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,500
But then they did know they were electing, uh,

293
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,220
Kay Bailey Hutchison here in Texas.

294
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,540
She's our new senator.

295
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,560
She was running against a Democrat

296
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,540
who was, uh, an... like a... a... a...

297
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,320
conservative.

298
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,280
Very, very conser...

299
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,200
fiscal conservative Democrat.

300
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,900
You know, I wasn't too sure about this...

301
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,880
things like gays or people, too,

302
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,080
or anything like that, but, uh...

303
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,920
But instead, uh, he... uh... uh...

304
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,920
he's a.... a... a...

305
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:08,980
a responsible Democrat.

306
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,380
Uh, and everything's gonna be, uh...

307
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,060
uh, fair and square and honest

308
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,040
and no more of this silly mucking around.

309
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,040
Uh, you know, now the... the, uh...

310
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,700
the new Republicans are gonna save us and so forth.

311
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,140
Kay Bailey Hutchison wants Congress to freeze

312
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,760
any new government action under the Endangered Species Act.

313
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,080
Uh, no.

314
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,080
According to...

315
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,780
The Republican introduced legislation Wednesday

316
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,780
that would prevent the federal government, uh,

317
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:41,240
tree-hugging damn Democrat bureaucrats from listing any new species as endangered or threatening,

318
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,420
pending congressional rewriting, blah, blah, blah, of the Endangered Species Act.

319
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:52,160
So in other words, I'm sorry, it doesn't matter if those animals are just about to die out

320
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,720
and their spleens are the things that cure cancer, and we just don't know it yet.

321
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,380
You know, it's all or nothing.

322
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,520
That's what they're trying to make it look like.

323
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:08,060
Everybody's either one of those things or another of those things.

324
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:14,240
When was the last time you heard about even something so normal as the libertarians?

325
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,520
Much less us patriot, psychotic, anarcho-materialists who happen to believe that

326
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,600
no matter who's in charge, they're going to be tools of the conspiracy,

327
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,800
the conspiracy of the normals, friends.

328
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,980
It's not Republicans or Democrats that are victimizing anybody,

329
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,980
although they all do, and we all victimize everybody.

330
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:42,180
But it's the normals, the winning team, whatever the winning team is, boy,

331
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,600
that's the one that's going to earn their loyalty.

332
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:53,380
And just before I, you know, like I say, I hate to find myself appearing to defend

333
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:59,020
something as corrupt as the Clinton administration, for instance.

334
00:16:59,180 --> 00:16:59,680
But!

335
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,500
Get this.

336
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,620
Okay, there's this survey that was done.

337
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:14,660
Los Angeles Times did a poll and tested attitudes towards various contrasting agendas

338
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:21,720
by asking Americans to choose between the competing proposals in five distinct areas,

339
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,960
but not identifying the alternatives as Clinton or Republican ideas.

340
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,780
In other words, they said,

341
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,360
Well, do you think...

342
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,100
Let's see.

343
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,480
Do you think the assault weapons bill should be repealed?

344
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,480
You know, all these different subjects.

345
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,000
Do you think we should school illegal immigrants?

346
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,160
Do you think we should do this?

347
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,260
Should we build more prisons or spend money on prevention?

348
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,660
You know, should we throw all the marijuana smokers in jail?

349
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,180
Or should we give them jobs?

350
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:53,920
You know, whatever.

351
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,340
Just this ridiculous stuff.

352
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,360
But they wouldn't say whether it was Republicans or Clintoners.

353
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:00,560
They would say it was Clinton.

354
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:09,040
In all but one instance, those surveyed backed the Clinton alternative by margins of two to one or greater.

355
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:16,220
And in most cases, the support was consistent across racial, income, gender, and ideological lines.

356
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,980
So, in other words, they go up to any American on the street,

357
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:27,700
most of whom would tell you that they're behind the, you know, the winning team agenda contract against abnormals,

358
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,120
and, uh...

359
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,360
and, uh...

360
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:36,040
and, and you, you, you, you specify, you know, what do you think about this, that, or the other?

361
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,360
Do you think we should do this?

362
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,380
Do you think we should do that?

363
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,580
And they'll go, oh, no, definitely don't, you know, don't do that.

364
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,680
God, it'd make things worse.

365
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,200
Then they'd say, well, that's what, you know, the Republicans said.

366
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,880
And you said you wanted what Clinton says he wants.

367
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,420
And then, of course, they go, well, that can't be because, you know, Clinton...

368
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,820
Didn't he make out with girls or something that he's not married to?

369
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,220
I mean, I heard something like that.

370
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,460
Didn't he kill everybody?

371
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:03,900
So...

372
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,080
And he probably did.

373
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,520
Or if we gave him half a chance, he would.

374
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,120
I sure as hell would.

375
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,460
God, put these creatures out of their misery.

376
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,540
But, oh, but here's the one to top it off.

377
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,940
I will play tapes and music, friends.

378
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,680
I just gotta share this with you.

379
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,360
In the wired subgenius era...

380
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:25,520
Whoa.

381
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,180
Excuse me!

382
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:27,700
Excuse me!

383
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,800
We're trying to do a radio show.

384
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,020
It's probably the conspiracy.

385
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,220
Yeah, that's what it was.

386
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,800
Oh, it's a fax.

387
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,900
It's a fax coming in.

388
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,480
Well, that's good.

389
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:45,880
You can fax the subgenius foundation, friends, at 214-320-1561.

390
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,800
We'll give that number again at the end of the broadcast.

391
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:55,420
A friend of ours was poking around in America Online,

392
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,900
and they feature Wired Magazine in there.

393
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,800
And he...

394
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,420
You can kind of...

395
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:04,620
Users of that system, that closed system, America Online,

396
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,900
can leave little messages there for other people to read.

397
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,500
Well, there apparently is a Wired subgenius part of the magazine.

398
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,560
I didn't know about that, and I haven't looked at it yet.

399
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,980
But somebody left a little message there saying,

400
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:24,620
I am writing a book on the true history of the Church of the Subgenius

401
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:29,460
and its ties to the weather underground, the Sendero Luminosa,

402
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,260
and other fringe radical groups.

403
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,660
If anyone that has not already contacted me has any information about the Church or its core members,

404
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,080
please write to me.

405
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:44,300
For obvious reasons, privacy and anonymity will be strictly respected.

406
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,900
And this is signed, and you can...

407
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,860
If you have email, you can send this man what you've learned.

408
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,760
His address...

409
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,880
Oh, no, I shouldn't do that.

410
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,860
I shouldn't do that.

411
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,900
We'll keep that online.

412
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,500
I'm sorry, but...

413
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,440
Anyway, that's the letter that was posted out there.

414
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,240
You know, friends, I thought I'd seen everything.

415
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,380
Obviously, this alert citizen and master detective has figured out a whole bunch of things that none of us knew about.

416
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,660
You know, he must have already deduced that,

417
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:20,740
even though the phone number, address, and email address of all the main church evildoers

418
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,140
are plastered over everything we've ever published,

419
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,300
to ask us would do no good, you know,

420
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,300
because we'd just keep telling our cover story over and over again.

421
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,960
About how, oh, it's just a joke.

422
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,840
No, it's a religion.

423
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,820
No, it's a joke.

424
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,540
No, it's a religion.

425
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,520
No, et cetera.

426
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,760
Praise Bob, friends.

427
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,140
Our red herring worked.

428
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,120
He's trying to figure out our connections to the weather underground in the Sendera Luminosa.

429
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:54,200
And, you know, that'll keep him from figuring out the real ties to the Symbionese Liberation Army

430
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,440
and the Branch Davidians and the Illuminati.

431
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,440
Not to be confused with the Illuminati.

432
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,320
And the CIA and the Flat Earth Society.

433
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,020
So, man, God, what a fool.

434
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,520
By the time this guy's on to us, the globe will be ours, friends.

435
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,400
He's the only one who stands in our way, though.

436
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,220
Whoever it was that already contacted this guy, I'd like to shake your hand.

437
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,260
And I think we, you know, well, this is what we said on the net,

438
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,980
that everybody should contact him and tell him everything we know

439
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:29,280
about the arms sales to Comini and the secret love affairs with Senator.

440
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:29,440
Oh, yeah.

441
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,720
Phil Graham and Dr. Legumes Hell's Angels connections.

442
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,780
You know, it's a quest, friends.

443
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,240
At last, a quest.

444
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:42,500
And that, oh, I almost forgot.

445
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:48,280
There's one other example of church truth inspiring laughable gullibility.

446
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,380
Our friend Steve runs the Flying Lemur,

447
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:58,540
which is a wonderful bookstore for weirdos in Lakewood, Ohio, in Cleveland.

448
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,600
And a lot of folks hang out there at the Flying Lemur

449
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,600
and yak about the same oddball subjects as the books that Steve sells.

450
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,800
So these young folks come into the bookstore, right,

451
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,520
and start yakking about things.

452
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,000
They tell Steve that they're worried about their friends

453
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,800
because their friends have sort of gone over the edge

454
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,060
about some impending saucer landing.

455
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,760
And they've heard, these friends of these kids talking to Steve, the bookstore owner,

456
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,100
these friend kids have heard that something really big,

457
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,960
seriously, is going to happen on July 7th or 5th or something, 1998.

458
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,220
And they're going to throw this rave near Akron this week.

459
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:44,140
And they're building a giant wooden pyramid to contact aliens or some such.

460
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:50,040
And they're telling Steve that, you know, hey, our friends are off the deep end.

461
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,220
They're taking this stuff seriously.

462
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,640
And Steve goes, oh, they're just subgeniuses.

463
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,440
You're being put on.

464
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,720
See this book, Revelation X, blah, blah, blah.

465
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,280
And these kids look at it and they go, yeah, that's the day.

466
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,140
That's it, July 5th, 1998.

467
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,840
Yeah, yeah, and something about Planet X.

468
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,740
But they didn't say anything about this Bob guy or this church or any of this stuff.

469
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,020
I don't think they've run into it.

470
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,360
I don't think they know about this.

471
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,760
They're dead serious.

472
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,860
And somebody's convinced them about this alien thing.

473
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,480
And they're acting like nuts and building landing strips.

474
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,440
And they really had, these, had never heard of the church of the subgenius.

475
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,080
And yet they were acting upon the advice of the book of the subgenius.

476
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:28,320
Hmm.

477
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:34,440
Now, friends, you know, this is a case of a tiny portion of Dobbs' teachings getting,

478
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:39,660
taken just a bit out of context and wreaking havoc on young Pobucker minds.

479
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,440
What was that?

480
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,400
What was that?

481
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:49,680
Why, that background music must have been running like, that was the other, the other mixed board.

482
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,840
So anyway, our friend Steve decided to turn it around.

483
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:58,480
He's going to show up at this Akron rave with a briefcase and wearing a nice three-piece suit

484
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,260
with his hair in it.

485
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,780
And he's going to walk up to the kids that are hidden in the back and smoke with a pipe.

486
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,600
And he's going to walk up to the diluted kids that are, who've been, will have been pointed

487
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,660
out to him in advance.

488
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,420
And he'll give each of them, he'll walk up and hand them a copy of subgenius pamphlet

489
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,160
number one.

490
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:18,260
Say, you've, Bob told me you have your name on this, or this has your name on it and it

491
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,320
will have their name on it.

492
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,420
And then he'll disappear.

493
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,260
He'll walk away.

494
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:29,040
You know, cause the idea of a bunch of innocent dumb ass Akron, redneck kids worshiping exes,

495
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:35,280
and waiting faithfully for X day, but without the knowledge necessary to get them the subgenius

496
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,760
membership card by then.

497
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,800
That's a sad thought friends.

498
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:46,600
And you know, we have to look after the lame and the infirm of mind.

499
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,820
It's just something we have to do.

500
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:57,420
We have to be angels, friends, angels of mercy and light.

501
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,920
Uh, yeah, that's us.

502
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:11,640
Well, I guess, uh, I, I, I just don't know what else to tell you.

503
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:20,760
It's, but I guess we could just lean back and see what we have on tape this week.

504
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,220
Shall we?

505
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,700
Yeah.

506
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,320
Yeah.

507
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:25,380
Yeah.

508
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:25,380


509
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:25,900
Yeah.

510
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:26,340


511
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:26,840


512
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,020


513
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:38,580
I, I, I, yeah, yeah.

514
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,540
All right.

515
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:39,540


516
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:39,540


517
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,380
It's gonna be.

518
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,320
Me

519
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,860
and is gone and be.

520
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,780
We're gonna do it.

521
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,620
We want to.

522
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,900
Got a peanut.

523
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,240
I can.

524
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,420
Wear it.

525
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,020
All that pain and hate is back before the Ei.

526
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,020


527
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,020


528
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:05,600
Oh, like a flaming baton that's ready to twirl

529
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,840
Like George Bush on that thing, singing the two chords

530
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,460
Gonna be a new world, gonna be a new world

531
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,920
I wanna feel like Jack Lord's hair

532
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:37,220
Be on ESPN, all covered in air

533
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:42,120
Cut on your radio, Jack Debo

534
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,440
WWF, go to WWF.com

535
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,620
Gang, 8-7-D-A-M

536
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:54,100
Like a flaming baton that's ready to twirl

537
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:59,260
Like George Bush on that thing, singing the two chords

538
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:05,260
Gonna be a new world, gonna be a new world

539
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,080
Come on, sing it, George

540
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,720
Don't, don't, don't come around

541
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:32,500
Don't, don't, don't come around

542
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,780
King Curtis is dead

543
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,260
Crazy horse ain't done

544
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,760
I'm gonna visualize

545
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,160
Armed insurrection

546
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,320
Get off of the couch

547
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,560
Blow up your TV

548
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,820
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme

549
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,780
Anarchy

550
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:06,000
Like a flaming baton

551
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,380
That's ready to twirl

552
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,240
Like George Bush, old ass, and

553
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,300
Singing the duper

554
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:22,240
Gonna be a new world

555
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,780
Gonna be a new world

556
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,900
Everything gonna, gonna, gonna be a new world

557
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,220
Oh

558
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,820
Gonna be a new world

559
00:29:44,820 --> 00:30:05,180
Gonna be a new world

560
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,740
Whoa, Reverend Mojo Nixon, dear friends.

561
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:19,000
Yes, from his Otis album.

562
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,820
Praise Otis.

563
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,500
Praise Mojo Nixon.

564
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:30,940
It's so nice to hear somebody getting off their butt now and then.

565
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,800
You know what I mean?

566
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,820
Okay, okay.

567
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,100
Slack, slack.

568
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,260
Slack.

569
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,340
Bronner.

570
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:35,880
Bronner!

571
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,220
The pink light!

572
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,480
There's a baby in a pool with a dollar bill

573
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,560
That he wants to use for a rattle

574
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,060
And a local nowhere rock band

575
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:04,020
That used to come from Seattle

576
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:08,520
And the grunge and the rap and the new age crap

577
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,160
That all the stations are playing

578
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,620
Said to you on a silver platter

579
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,180
Never mind what they are saying

580
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,500
Got a new release that the critics had

581
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,100
Cause they said it wasn't you

582
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:29,560
So you tried to stay in La La Land

583
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,080
Cause you don't know what to do

584
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,000
And it's true that you're not alone

585
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,400
It smells like something's riding away

586
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,100
Deep inside your brain

587
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:44,380
And I think it kinda smells like Kurt Cobain

588
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,600
Never mind

589
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,020
Now rock stars just can't handle the grind

590
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,660
Of all the fortune and fame

591
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:03,980
Of all the fortune and fame

592
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:03,980


593
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,920
And all of the guitars that they left behind

594
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,740
It proves they can't play the game

595
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:15,000
Well I guess there's a message here for some of you

596
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,120
If you've got enough guts to find it

597
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,820
When you hear somebody sing

598
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,020
I'm so dumb

599
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:25,120
Well you might as well never mind it

600
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,420
Got a brand new music video

601
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,640
You're the latest big thing to me

602
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,980
But you're finding me

603
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,980
Is slowly melting down

604
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,680
And you don't know what to say

605
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:42,140
You smell like something's crying

606
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,600
Deep inside your brain

607
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,540
You smell like something's crying

608
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,880
Like Kurt Cobain

609
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,120
And then you get a flashback.

610
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,840
I got so high I scratched until I bled.

611
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,160
A man in a brown leather jacket.

612
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,680
At the end of the rainbow.

613
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,620
Giving you the finger.

614
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,240
I've got this friend you see.

615
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,240
In a trendy distorted rock band photo preview.

616
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,080
I don't regret a thing.

617
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,680
And a guy in the foldout with big teeth.

618
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,720
The animals I've trapped have all become my pets.

619
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,460
Oh well.

620
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,360
Whatever.

621
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,300
Never mind.

622
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,660
Never mind.

623
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,280
Well you know you're probably right.

624
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,960
And you tried to be cool.

625
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,540
But you're only a fool.

626
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,200
And now you're clean out of sight.

627
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,860
And they'll say you were a genius.

628
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,600
And you'll go down in history.

629
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,620
As another famous stupid fool.

630
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,140
Just another casualty.

631
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,740
And the smell is getting stronger.

632
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,640
Whatever.

633
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:33,300
Good.

634
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,360
Don't you paved me.

635
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:39,540
I think it kind of smells like you and me.

636
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,260
Like you and me.

637
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,660
Like you and me.

638
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,200
Like you and me.

639
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,840
Like you and me.

640
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,240
Like you and me.

641
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,460
Like you and me.

642
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,540
Like you and me.

643
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:00,540


644
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,280
Yes.

645
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,400
Yes.

646
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,120
You and me

647
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,000
guitar solo

648
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,020
guitar solo

649
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,720
guitar solo

650
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,280
guitar solo

651
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:08,760
guitar solo

652
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,800
guitar solo

653
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:13,880
guitar solo

654
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,300
guitar solo

655
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:17,720
guitar solo

656
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:17,900
guitar solo

657
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,200
Yes, dear

658
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,360
friends, and that's Dr. Bizarro.

659
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,660
I'm going to give you Dr. Bizarro.

660
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,820
Actually, it's Dr. Bizarro

661
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,640
and the Disgustos. I think

662
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,360
we're mainly hearing the Disgustos

663
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,920
in the background, either Rich Poston

664
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,260
or Jimmy Ryan on

665
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,360
lead there. I don't know.

666
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,600
Anyway, here's that address.

667
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,740
I'm Bob Digital for Dr. Bizarro

668
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,640
Tapes. That's P.O. Box

669
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,000
3405.

670
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:45,720
Are you

671
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,880
hearing me? Now,

672
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,260
that's P.O. Box

673
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:50,920
3405

674
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,700
Skokie,

675
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,780
Illinois. Skokie,

676
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:56,940
Illinois.

677
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,500
6-00-

678
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,420
7-6.

679
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,220
Or you can call

680
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,840
708-982-WOWS

681
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,780
W-O-W-S

682
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,260
W-O-W-S

683
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:14,260


684
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:14,440
W-O-W-S

685
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:14,900
And, uh,

686
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,000
it's been so long since we've heard Dr. Howell

687
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,920
and Puzzling Evidence, and gosh,

688
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,800
who knows who else might even be

689
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,760
Gary Brokfran on this tape. This is from the

690
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,780
Phineas Narco edit

691
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,580
of the best of the

692
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,440
Berkeley Subgenius Show, number

693
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,500
three.

694
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:31,500


695
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,160
That's an old, uh,

696
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,720
professional radio trick.

697
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,880
Okay, let's just do it,

698
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,260
man. Forget the clean cuts.

699
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,880
Dear Dr. Animal, my grasshopper,

700
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,620
I'll call him Hoppy, spits

701
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,600
tobacco juice like nothing else.

702
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,740
The other day, I squeezed him with

703
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,660
the vice grip, and he let go with

704
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,720
a large chaw right

705
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,120
into my left pupil.

706
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,840
Will I go blind?

707
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,840
Sign me Twitchy in Petaluma.

708
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,180
Oh, my

709
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:01,780
grandfather.

710
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,080
You're a little, uh, hopper.

711
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,020
Merely needs, uh,

712
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,100
R&R brake.

713
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,800
R&R brake. R-R-R-R-R-R-R

714
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,360
R&R brake. Give me an R&R brake.

715
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,260
Bring me the head of

716
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,100
R&R brake.

717
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,660
Ew, that's an

718
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,300
awfully small head. I, uh, can you give me

719
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,340
that five heads? Yeah, we've got this miniature

720
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,380
corn, this miniature cabbage, and, uh,

721
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,480
grasshopper paintings.

722
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,900
Jig legs off one at a time.

723
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,340
Uh, that's past paying for. He's the

724
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,800
only grasshopper with a full,

725
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,640
Six-tuple prosthesis.

726
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,480
A miracle of tiny engineering.

727
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:43,460
Look at him writhe and attempt to hop and fulfill his little insectile destiny.

728
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,300
Look at him go.

729
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,640
We love to do it to him.

730
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:54,720
Yes, they're tortured by our evil whims.

731
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,560
And that's the way it should be.

732
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,500
That's always the way it's been.

733
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:04,180
They want to sacrifice these victims inside the blazing wicker man they call the drug

734
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:08,760
minister to attract the eye of the gullible public from their own wickedness, greed, and

735
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,260
mendacity.

736
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,600
Hold Kitty still while I make my mark on her.

737
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,040
Is that Flea-Wee?

738
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,120
Flea-Wee!

739
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,020
Not anymore.

740
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,400
They come from the bowels of hell.

741
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,200
A transformed race of walking dead.

742
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,300
Zombies.

743
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,360
Guided by a master plan for complete domination of the earth.

744
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,560
Plan 9 from outer space.

745
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,440
Starring the most slight marriage cast ever.

746
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,800
Bella Lugosi, the seductive vampire.

747
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,080
And Ford Johnson as the walking dead.

748
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,540
Turn off your electric gun!

749
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:52,500
No!

750
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,000
Stop!

751
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,360
Stop it now!

752
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,260
I can't do this!

753
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:57,700
I can't!

754
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,480
I mean, you can't!

755
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:58,700
I can't!

756
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,400
I mean, the Jets!

757
00:40:59,400 --> 00:40:59,680
Pull it!

758
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,100
You're gonna talk!

759
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:00,480
You're gonna talk!

760
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:00,940
We're gonna talk!

761
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,780
Rockets, missiles, jets cannot stop their death ship.

762
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,900
What earthly power can stop this terror?

763
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:08,620
The other side!

764
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,080
For a glimpse of things to come.

765
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,640
See this blast of scream suspense.

766
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,740
For it could be happening right now.

767
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,620
No, it's gonna happen.

768
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,020
The Jets.

769
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:19,860
The Jets.

770
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:20,980
The Jets.

771
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,280
The Jets.

772
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:23,280


773
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:23,280


774
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:23,280


775
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,500
The Jets.

776
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,060
The Jets.

777
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:25,120
The Jets.

778
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:25,460
The Jets.

779
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:25,720
The Jets.

780
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:25,720


781
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,180
The Jets.

782
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:26,180


783
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:26,200
The Jets.

784
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,360
The Jets.

785
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,360
The Jets.

786
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:31,200
Nope...

787
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,480
Yeah, there's a lot of science behind this.

788
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:36,580
We're gonna help it.

789
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,020
These Jets could massage us with Cool Coug Oczywiście je egy!

790
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:39,220


791
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:39,220


792
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:39,980
You don't need a resurrecting semua anxiety in you.

793
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:40,120
Yes!

794
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:40,120


795
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:40,120


796
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,000
In fact, it probably begins with theıı racist tweet the straight away wavelengths.

797
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,000


798
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,000


799
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,000


800
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,780
We got a...

801
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,420
We gotta pretend like there's a teacher.

802
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:52,960
Well, there's a good reason to think that there's not going to be anymore evolution.

803
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,300
So hoop it up!

804
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:58,400
Well, we gotta... we gotta pretend like there's a future. I mean, what's the point?

805
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,160
I ain't saying there's no future. I'm saying there is no more evolution. That is, no more

806
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:07,160
extrasomatic forces that cause evolution. So we've hit the ceiling, as it were.

807
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:10,840
Not necessarily, but we're gonna have to take charge of it ourselves now.

808
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:17,560
Why? What do you mean? Well, because, uh, your evolution, your natural selection, if you

809
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:23,340
are a good Darwinian, is a result of what happens to you. But if you are one of these so-called

810
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,780
intelligent beings, you're controlling what happens to you. That's what the Nazis...

811
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:30,480
Thus, you're a monkey in with your evolution. That's what the Nazis tried to do, wasn't it?

812
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,360
They tried to take matters into their own hands and shape the genetic, uh, pool themselves.

813
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:41,400
Well, that was one slight aspect of it. If it had turned out that breeding for their so-called

814
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:47,700
Aryans, which, uh, of course, don't actually exist in genetics, if that had been for good survival

815
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:52,440
characteristics, then they might have indeed improved the race. But unfortunately,

816
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,320
that's not the case. It's not the case. It's the race that's the one that's going to be the

817
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,720
most important. That was not really their intention. It was not evolutionary.

818
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,520
It was a, it was a kind of fuzzy, uh, thinking, I guess?

819
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,700
Well, I wouldn't call it fuzzy, but they believed some strange things. For example,

820
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:07,900
most of your top flight Nazis believed that giant chunks of ice were flying through space

821
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,860
and were going to hit the Earth and cause the doom of everything.

822
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:11,360
Really?

823
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:17,440
Yes. It was called the, well, I forget the German, but it was called the World Ice Theory. And the

824
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,740
top SS men believed in it, even though this was scientifically thought to be absurd. No one dared

825
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:27,740
to explain about it. It was one of the ritual beliefs that was fostered by Heinrich Himmler and

826
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,860
his pan-Germanism.

827
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,220
Does that relate to Velikovsky or anything?

828
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:36,900
It's even more absurd than Velikovsky, but of course, uh, your unstable political minds are

829
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:41,500
always susceptible to these cosmic mish-mashes of nonsense and non-sequiturists.

830
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,820
So they like destructionism and everything?

831
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:49,180
No, they, like fundamentalist Christians and other misguided souls, like to live in a tiny,

832
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,280
cozy, neat, orderly universe that they can comprehend.

833
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:58,540
Instead of the large, unfathomable, and frightening evolutionary universe that we actually are forced

834
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:58,940
to inhabit.

835
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:03,460
Yeah, the rationality just breaks down when you try to apply it to the universe. It just doesn't

836
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,880
work like that. We're surrounded by things that just don't make sense.

837
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,520
Well, I don't know about that. I'd rather choose to suppose that...

838
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,800
How do you explain mass murders and earthquakes killing...

839
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,160
That's the fact that we don't make sense. The universe makes perfect sense.

840
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:21,880
We're the nonsensical particle in the equation. And yet...

841
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:27,000
Without a position outside the spectrum of logic and truth, how could we observe it at all?

842
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:31,220
Otherwise it would be a case of not being able to see the forest for the trees,

843
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:36,860
or the flowers for the bees, in this great land of ours, from sea to shining...

844
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,960
The grappler.

845
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:46,980
And so, once again, fat triumphs over thin, tall triumphs over short, and big triumphs over little.

846
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:47,580
Sea!

847
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:51,760
In the coming order, everyone will wear special shiny shoes.

848
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:58,460
And on each shoe will be a portrait of the Fuhrer, J.R. Bob Dobbs!

849
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,260
And so Hal became crazed with radio power.

850
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:05,120
And soon he had Dobbs' image all over every column.

851
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,080
I did not ask for more! No one's ever wanted me in broadening eyes!

852
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:10,780
Even Frank Bent was bent for the will of Uncle Harry.

853
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,780
We have been betrayed! We were stabbed in the back by the politicians!

854
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:13,920
It is our destiny!

855
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,280
Don't worry, I've never been current, but we've got to go along with him for now.

856
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,660
We will make these aerial orders so that the Trump-Panarian race can suppress the invention!

857
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,500
We'll just go right here. We cannot do that.

858
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,220
We'll get the infidels upon the face of this planet!

859
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,140
Get out! I'll shoot out the car from underneath.

860
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:30,940
It is every subgenius' duty to exterminate these vermin.

861
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:41,780
They say we are prejudiced against minorities, but I say we, we, we are the minority!

862
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,240
And so we witness the self-immolation of an entire religious group.

863
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,480
My soldiers! My soldiers! My soldiers! My soldiers! My soldiers!

864
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:51,860
Salute you!

865
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,860
I want you to go out and kill

866
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,400
for old subgenius tech.

867
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,460
I want you to give them a price

868
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,160
they won't forget.

869
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:05,220
Hey!

870
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,880
Hello, you're on the air.

871
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,000
I'm talking to you from inside, Bob.

872
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:09,380
Hi.

873
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,440
Oh, no.

874
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,860
I'm trying to give a speech here.

875
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,040
Get this man off the reviewing stand.

876
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,100
There he goes.

877
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,600
No, you're going to have to hang up.

878
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:19,900
We're trying to rescue you.

879
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,180
Uh-oh, Frank Bandits.

880
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,240
He's been frustrated.

881
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,240
He's being carried away now

882
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,220
by the security forces.

883
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,640
This is my last territorial demand in Europe.

884
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:28,140
Yes?

885
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:29,340
How is life?

886
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:33,060
Show my absorptive power.

887
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,340
The greatest of genius.

888
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,020
Life will last for a thousand years.

889
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:37,880
Why?

890
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,560
Your radio personality so decreed.

891
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,900
Lost in power, he struts down Shattuck Avenue.

892
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,300
People call emergency services.

893
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,560
There's nothing the Berkeley police can do.

894
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,260
Out of my way!

895
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,420
I know I was wrong.

896
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,940
But for you, caller, it's just another crazy night.

897
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,180
Sieg Freud!

898
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:00,700
On KPFA.

899
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:01,480
Oh, man.

900
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:05,160
That's the first time I've heard that one.

901
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:07,300
We listened to that for the first time together.

902
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:11,180
Friends, a classic, classic, wonderful stretch

903
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:14,360
from the KPFA in Berkeley subgenius show

904
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,540
with Dr. Howell there.

905
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,700
Sieg Howell.

906
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,920
Sieg Howell.

907
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:19,880
Ranting away.

908
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,400
Puzzling evidence giving commentary.

909
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:26,040
and superb calling by Phineas Narco, the caller,

910
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:32,240
who has compiled several of these best of the subgenius show tapes.

911
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:35,020
He just tapes them off the radio and puts the best stuff together,

912
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:40,080
which is more than I can say puzzling evidence to, or Hal does, so there, or me.

913
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,980
So, well, actually, I have been.

914
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,480
Now I don't have to because you can get them from Phineas Narco.

915
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,280
You internetoids will recognize Phineas Narco.

916
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,780
At P.O. Box 1247.

917
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,880
Let's get the Phineas Narco background music.

918
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:06,200
That's P.O. Box 1247, San Jose, California, 95108.

919
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:10,020
Now P.O. Box 1247, San Jose.

920
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:15,360
It looks like San Joes, but it's San Jose for you non-Spanish speakers.

921
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,200
California, 95108.

922
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:21,220
And that's all I can.

923
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:21,840
Tell you.

924
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,280
That's all I'm allowed to tell you.

925
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:25,840
Yeah, I was saying earlier,

926
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,600
sometimes it seems like we might as well just do the radio show on the internet.

927
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:35,580
And in a way, it sort of makes sense because in the subgenius corridor,

928
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:45,240
alt.slack, one is apt to frequently run into these various following subgenius radio personalities.

929
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:51,100
Pope Charles in Houston, who runs it on, I think it's KPFK down there,

930
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:58,000
Salute to Pope Charles, the enemy, Scientology's greatest enemy.

931
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,320
Dad of Dad's New Slacks up there in Portland, Maine.

932
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:04,820
Salute to Dad.

933
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,900
Dad, these guys both put lots of really funny stuff in there.

934
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,340
You ought to get your computer, man.

935
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,040
Buy a computer, get a modem, it's cool.

936
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:18,100
And why, even Pastor Craig in Philadelphia.

937
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,320
So, Sterno.

938
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,640
Or Phyla.

939
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,040
Or Nensla.

940
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,560
And speaking of Nensla, let's just see what Nensla has to say.

941
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,100
Old Dad, he hates them Nensla rants.

942
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:29,720
He said so.

943
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,820
But I like them.

944
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:42,020
It's the tradition of the peevish crackpot sitting alone in his room recording tapes

945
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:49,500
as if he were making a radio show that people might be listening to somewhere out in their world later on.

946
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,520
Oh, okay, let's see what comes up.

947
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:56,340
Yeah, that sounds Nenslatic.

948
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:01,280
The thing that bothers me is there ain't no sense to nothing.

949
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:04,000
And I'm getting pretty fed up with these they folks.

950
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,980
Who are they anyhow?

951
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,860
Who are they anyhow?

952
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:16,220
Who are they anyhow?

953
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,220
Just the other day, we heard an ignorant blow.

954
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:24,060
And I thought, well, I'm just a product of society.

955
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,920
Well, we would very much like to know just exactly who or what is this society

956
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,800
which is turning out so many useless, ineffective, and repellent products.

957
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:38,800
We begin to suspect that, like victim of circumstance,

958
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:45,660
the idea of product of society is merely a cheap cop-out for losers ashamed to admit

959
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:48,260
that they are the products of their own minds,

960
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,300
responsible for the results of their own actions.

961
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:55,040
And are the sole architects of their fouled-up lives.

962
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:00,180
We saw a movie once about two kids raised in the same environment,

963
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,460
with the same advantages and hardships.

964
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:05,920
One grows up to be Humphrey Bogart with a machine gun.

965
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:12,680
The other grows up to be the district attorney who has to send his chum of childhood days to burn in the hot seat.

966
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,380
A Hollywood fantasy?

967
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:19,640
Yes, but one which has its analogues in daily life, even now.

968
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,280
And I think that's the thing that bothers me the most.

969
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:20,280


970
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:20,280


971
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:20,280


972
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:20,280


973
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:27,180
Maybe this society thing is one of those secret societies we read about.

974
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:35,720
Guys with fezzes and tinsel scimitars who sneak around making harmless kids into teenage mothers and juvenile delinquents.

975
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,660
Turning bums and drunks into the homeless,

976
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:43,300
who suddenly have the right to get loaded and pass out on the steps of the Capitol building,

977
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:46,580
dreaming of that little white cottage with green shutters,

978
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:48,800
a picket fence, and a concrete duck,

979
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,280
which that self-same self-righteousness is trying to get rid of.

980
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:50,280


981
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:50,280


982
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:50,840
And I think that's the thing that bothers me the most.

983
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:55,820
Maybe this society has cruelly denied to hand over to them for free so they can kill the lawn,

984
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:59,020
fill the backyard with old water heaters and refrigerators,

985
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:03,280
with the doors still on for the neighbor's kids to play hide and seek in,

986
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,060
and put up an old truck on blocks in the driveway.

987
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:11,380
We shudder to think what the women's auxiliary of this society must be up to.

988
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:19,980
A highly influential pre-founder of the Horizon Unlimited Master Control Programming and Ray Enhancement System,

989
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:20,260
and the first ever in the history of the American public, the American Public Broadcasting System, is the American Public Broadcasting System.

990
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,560
Known only as John, once told us,

991
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,260
the system you buy is the system you get.

992
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:34,540
We suspect that some folks have bought the patently fraudulent system in which things are run by someone.

993
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:41,600
You know, some mysterious intercooperation of persons with a different set of values from regular folks,

994
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:47,780
people of a different class with a secret way of thinking which puts them one step ahead of everyone else,

995
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,160
and everything would be oh, like, okay again.

996
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:56,740
Like it used to be, if we would all get together and rise up in a glorious people's revolution and overthrow the oppressor.

997
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,960
Of course, such a group of persons does exist, but they certainly aren't running things.

998
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:09,260
In order to be one of them, one must be unsuited by nature to running things.

999
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:14,260
Yes, we are very much in favor of rising up against the oppressor,

1000
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:18,760
and feel that the sternest measures must be taken against the one who holds you back.

1001
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:22,420
We wholeheartedly support organized resistance,

1002
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:27,180
but suggest that before forming a mob and pulling down statues,

1003
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:30,880
one might want to stop and think for a moment.

1004
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:35,720
In the relatively free and liberal culture of these modern times,

1005
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:43,940
the amount of power others have over us is usually in direct proportion to our own negligence in maintaining a free existence.

1006
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,580
We knew a fellow who went to sleep with a...

1007
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:52,160
who went to sleep a wild and happy teenager,

1008
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:55,500
and woke up a married man with wife and kid,

1009
00:53:55,600 --> 00:54:00,380
and about a skillion bucks worth of home, cars, stereo, sofa and dinette,

1010
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,880
and a six-piece waterbed suite with mirrored headboard to pay off.

1011
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,180
He never knew what hit him, because he had his eyes closed the whole time.

1012
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,440
We knew a gal who just wanted to have a good time,

1013
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:15,740
who ended up a familiar face down at the women's health clinic,

1014
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,700
and the possessor of some ugly infections, and...

1015
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,180
very nasty habits.

1016
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:24,040
She had stopped paying attention for about five years.

1017
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,960
Could this be the work of...

1018
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:27,520
society?

1019
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:33,400
You may be sure there are those who would like very much for you to buy such a fiction,

1020
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,280
and buy it directly from them.

1021
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:42,320
The more people they can get to agree with them in blaming personal failures or perceived injustices

1022
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,820
on an inaccessible third party,

1023
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,520
the more they are confirmed in their own belief that all their problems

1024
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:53,460
are caused by conspiring inferiors, miniature invisible robots,

1025
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,620
or some other not-fully-human group.

1026
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:00,660
It makes no difference if the bandwagon jumpers are themselves,

1027
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:03,960
but one barely upright step away from the trees.

1028
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,280
It's numbers that matter here.

1029
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:11,280
One need not commit oneself to a nut cult to pass the buck, however.

1030
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,620
Evasion of responsibility is as simple as saying,

1031
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,100
look what you made me do.

1032
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:21,260
If the consequences of one's actions are not strictly in line with those expected,

1033
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:24,560
surely the fault must lie in the reaction,

1034
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,100
not the action, however ill-conceived.

1035
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:36,120
We find it difficult to make it through a single day without catching ourselves blaming some aspect of our personal state on external causes,

1036
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:40,520
and we have been training ourselves against that sort of thing for years now.

1037
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:44,840
Who can blame these poor people who have never really thought about anything,

1038
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,080
who avoid thinking about it,

1039
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:50,460
who avoid thinking about things as much as possible by means of constant inundations of popular culture,

1040
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:52,680
dance music, and poisonous chemicals?

1041
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:58,660
Who can blame them for seeking solace in the thought that their lives have been fouled up from before the outset

1042
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:02,200
by forces beyond their control against which they are powerless?

1043
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,800
Running one's own life requires constant vigilance,

1044
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:10,100
a lot of hard work all the time, every day.

1045
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:15,660
It's simply an awful lot easier to admit defeat as soon as the going gets rough,

1046
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,480
than to get off the field entirely,

1047
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:22,840
to go flop down in the gutter with everybody else and grouse about what a raw deal they got

1048
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,460
from those millions of evil enemies who never even gave them a chance,

1049
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:29,980
then drug themselves and turn on the radio or the TV

1050
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:34,660
so they'll be distracted for a moment from the fact that they quit before the game even started.

1051
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:40,460
Despite claims of supernatural influence or robotic control,

1052
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:45,060
the major cause of emotional conflict lies in proclaiming one thing as fact,

1053
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:49,340
while secretly knowing that something very different is true.

1054
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:52,400
No matter how high the stack of mattresses,

1055
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,660
the princess of fables still felt that tiny pea way down at the bottom

1056
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:59,060
and couldn't get a wink of sleep until it was gone.

1057
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:01,140
Whether we think about it or not,

1058
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:08,900
even one tiny conflict between what we say and what we know is going to stay there,

1059
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:13,260
making us black and blue, never letting us really rest until it's disposed of.

1060
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,020
Sound difficult?

1061
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,460
Well, it is.

1062
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:17,880
But don't give up yet.

1063
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,680
There's still one quick and easy way out for you.

1064
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,960
Can you guess what it is?

1065
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:27,260
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

1066
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,960
send a self-addressed stamped envelope to...

1067
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:30,920
Got your pencil ready?

1068
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:37,440
Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1069
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:43,240
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1070
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:47,600
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

1071
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:04,880
Well, I guess that's another show down.

1072
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:08,440
Just about, about down.

1073
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,140
You gotta wrestle these things to the ground.

1074
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,240
That's what you have to just dive right in.

1075
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:13,240


1076
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:13,680
You gotta get into it.

1077
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:14,900
It's the only way.

1078
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:19,860
You gotta let them stack up till it's real light and they had to play reruns.

1079
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:24,120
And then you just, you just, you just go after it.

1080
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:27,760
You just get right down in there and go after it.

1081
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:28,320
Damn it.

1082
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:29,360
Hey, yes.

1083
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:32,100
And I'm gonna, well, I know who, well, what have we got near?

1084
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:34,260
We've got just a few seconds left.

1085
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,120
I don't know what next.

1086
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:40,060
Tonight I'm gonna give you more than you come for.

1087
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,660
I ain't lying.

1088
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,360
Everybody kneeling ain't praying.

1089
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:45,100
Remember that.

1090
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:52,100
I'm not going to church tomorrow, but no one knows where the nose goes when the nose

1091
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:52,600
is closed.

1092
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,380
Yes, I'm Petey Wheatstrome.

1093
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:02,020
The devil's son of the high shelf of men.

1094
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:08,260
And friends, those are about all the segments that I can play from the entire best of Rudy

1095
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:09,660

Yes.

1097
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:12,820
Rudy Ray Moore finally came out with a CD.

1098
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:14,860
The great Rudy Ray Moore.

1099
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,980
Well, I had the, the, uh, well, this CD is autographed.

1100
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:18,680
Let me put it that way.

1101
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,700
Um, from that Doolin Fireman game.

1102
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,500
He's the star of this upcoming CD ROM game.

1103
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:29,660

00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:41,740
