The Hour of Slack
How can we live with this threat?
Our best life insurance may be summed up in four words.
The Hour of Slack
This will take some doing on your part.
It will take slack to survive.
Bob.
Bob, hello.
From PR News in Washington, I'm playing with matches.
NASA is still trying to find a way to repair a torn suicide bomber.
NASA has mylar and it might be sewn shut.
Discovery Commander Pam Melroy says...
So, and, uh...
On Wall Street 689.
Federal Reserve policy makers are warning residents to keep an eye on PR's PR.
But some say,
Some warn that the Fed runs the risk of worse PR news in the fourth quarter.
They say it could pick up strength in central Russia.
Russian authorities have recently warned Russians of the potential for increased PR news.
I'm gonna get me an aeroplane.

I'm gonna get me an aeroplane, fly it inside of your brain.
Look, there's a bunny rabbit jumping around.
Fuzzy wuzzy rabbit make a squeaking sound.
Cute fuzzy bunny got a puppy black tail.
Tone around the sack for the US mail.
I'm gonna get me an aeroplane, fly it inside of your brain.
Me and my bunny in my aeroplane, squeaking inside of your brain.
Squeaking inside of your brain.
Did you say it's funny?
Yes, love, yes it's fun...
Screaming in the rain depends on brilliance.
He's trying to get in the boat.
Better tasted candy.
Isn't he?
How are you today?
Is your bunny gonna take a trip?
Flying down into your lung?
Rutherford Hayes built a landing strip
He built it on the tip of your tongue
Starting at your eyeball near the macula
Circling your mouth and your uvula
Drop down the throat, there you see what he done
He's flying down into your lung
Flying inside of your lung
He's flying down into your lung
He's flying down into your lung
And yours truly, your dear friend and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang.
Oh, and Reverend Wat D. Falk and his brows.
But first, this.
I want to read a wonderful rant by Reverend Uncle Dr. Onan Kenobite.
A sermon on hypocrisy.
It is not my place to put down my fellow religionists.
The Church of the Subgenius believes every part of every religion.
Don't take these words as saying other religions are less than ours.
It's just that our religion is more than theirs.
You've come here tonight to hear more on religion.
And if we got a moron religion for you.
The Catholics believed in purgatory.
Until they didn't.
The Muslims believed each revelation was the final one.
Until they didn't.
The Mormons believed in polygamy.
Until they didn't.
Until they didn't.
This appears to the modern and skeptical eye as unto hypocrisy.
They say one thing.
And then they say another thing that is a different thing.
Gotcha.
There's a whole industry of one religion saying the other religion is hypocritical.
And atheists saying that all the religions are hypocritical.
It's not an industry that pays the bills.
But it does keep people busy in the important work of declaring their beliefs.
And it's not just the religious beliefs.
It's the religious beliefs that are superior to all other beliefs.
But wait, dear friend.
Do not view these contradictory claims as hypocrisy.
View what is said instead through the lens of religion.
The point was never to have you believe any particular belief.
The point was to have you publicly declare you believed it.
To convey your loyalty to the cause.
This is why religions can offer up a claim as an eternal truth one day and a forgotten
heresy the next day.
The experience of religion is a great way to show that religion is not a lie.
It's a message of belief.
The expression of commitment was the thing.
Not the particular thing committed to.
Remember that day when you found out you were the only one who really believed and for everybody
else it was just kind of a social thing?
It's that times seven billion over thousands of years.
What you need is to stop using your mind to think about your religion.
What you need is to remember that you remembered.
Belief is a thing to wear for a time.
And that if other people haven't remembered that yet, it's an opportunity for you to show
them how it's done.
What you need is the church of the subgenius.
Praise Bob and thank you Onan.
Again.
Talk about retro.
Onan has redesigned subgenius.com.
Now it's not.
This is just in on his computer.
Satan finds work for nimble little fingers.
Onan is inspired by Buckminster Fuller.
He's really into the Dimexion approach of simplifying, you know, making things direct.
That's better than being inspired by Buck naked.
And he has made this.
It's even you don't have the way I've got it now.
It's black and white.
It's ancient HTML one.
Of course.
That's only because I got bored with all that web stuff after about five years.
But this is even more down and dirty.
It's literally a picture of Bob and a list of subjects.
And they go to the same places that the current one does.
But of course, all of that would then be made in that cascading form to become very spare.
So it would totally lose the psychedelic aspects and go straight into the black and white.
Purity.
The purity, I tell you, of your straight Bob, your true Bob, your black and white Bob, your
dots Bob, the post photographic Bob that may be true.
And yet we know by its stripes it is false.
That beefy faced photo Bob.
Oh, you don't like that one, huh?
Is that now the official position of the church?
I'm beginning to suspect, Dr. Haldeman, this is making me feel better the more I think
about it.
It could not be that the conspiracy found a man who looked almost like Bob and aged
him, fattened him, did plastic surgery on him.
With good cape and line.
And used an ancient camera to take a portrait of him, got the pipe perfectly placed and
the brill cream in the hair just right.
And then half toned that and worked it into perfect replicas of old newspapers.
Maybe that's where that so-called original Bob comes from.
Who paid for this elaborate imposture?
Well, they followed the money.
Exactly.
Who's making money off Bob?
Bob.
It was just an early...
Bob hired this guy that looked sort of like him and he uglied him up and then, you know,
because he was trying to get us off his back.
They didn't ugly him up.
No, no.
It was just one of his early jobs.
This is an absolute...
This is an absolute photo representation of the living, breathing Bob.
I know, but the true...
What's the model job?
...Dog's head is pristine and perfect.
He's inhumanly perfect.
He's not perfect.
That's the problem.
They chopped off the head at the chin and they don't show the cascade of double chins,
the beefy, rotarian body and the sleazy, pinstripe suit.
That's not the real Bob.
The real Bob always looked young.
Well, the glyph does.
He looks young.
The glyph is separated out.
He's separated from reality.
The glyph is in eternity, but the actual fleshy edifice of Bob is aging, towering,
tottering.
Yeah, he's probably 35 or whatever.
He's about 35 years old.
Yes, but you don't see the flesh under the face because the chin is an arbitrary cutoff
line.
Well, Bob, in...
People were always confused by the asymmetry of the chin.
That's because it represents a line cut by something.
Well, we all know that Bob was a model before he was born.

That would mean he's like...
One of his early jobs was modeling.
He's about 90 now.
It was written in the book of the subgenius, the last word.
So, then it turned out to be absolutely true and I know that terrifies some folks.
But anyway, he'd be 90 years old now.
Yes, 90 years young as we say.
As with most good...
Yeah, 90 is the new 45.
Some of those guys don't age.
Even short duration saviors don't age.
Some of them don't age.
I didn't think he aged.
No, he doesn't.
He doesn't age really.
He does age, but it's just...
Age as well.
He ages in the word.
Can you see back in the Bible that people used to live to be 600 years old?
900.
See, there you go.
Bob is still a child.
Moses was more than nine centuries...
Not Moses, Noah.
Methuselah was 976.
Yes, Noah lived almost as long.
His years were very great at the time he had sex with his new-born daughters.
Well, that was because...
They got him drunk.
There were no other guys except their brothers.
Oh, it wasn't his fault.
Oh, no.
They got him drunk.
Oh, yeah.
He didn't know what he was doing.
Sure.
Of course he didn't know.
Yeah.
It's all their fault.
Right.
Yeah.
Noah didn't do anything.
That whole thing is a bunch of hooey.
The ark sunk.
He's asleep in a cave and they go in there and...
Well, it's in the Bible.
I can show you the wreckage of Noah's Ark on Stang Ranch.
Noah's Ark sunk on the site of the Paluxy River.
The cave subgeniuses...
It came down with a bump.
...had jumped ship.
They had jumped ship long before.
That's why they survived.
And they're not seen on any of the Noah's Ark...
And all those dinosaurs bolted out of the ark, leaving those tracks that you see.
Have you got the Noah's Ark photos?
Is that what you said?
No.
We've got the wreckage of Noah's Ark.
He's got the beams, the ribs of the hull...
Oh, you can barely tell it's theirs.
...decking plants, the portholes, the lifesavers.
You know that Noah's Ark that we were talking about earlier that's in Kentucky?
Yeah.
I hear that when you're looking at the places where the...
Yeah.
...animals were stored that the aisles are very narrow so that it's hard to walk behind
somebody who's reading, you know, like a plaque that's really small.
It's a real small...
Terrifyingly claustrophobic.
And so they're standing there reading the plaque and you know how you have to kind of
bend over and it makes your butt stick out?
And now you're reading the plaque and somebody wants to come by and it's like they have to
scrape their crotch against your butt as they squeeze by.
Oh, these fundamentalist...
How do you do that?
You know, that's weird.
That's weird.
Please, God.
Please, Noah's Ark.
That happens in Noah's Ark.
Yeah.
Well, if it's that narrow, how the hell do they get the hippopotamuses through there?
I don't know.
Can you imagine walking behind the hippopotamus?
You wouldn't want to do that.
And having to scrape your crotch across their ass.
You do not want to walk behind a hippopotamus if there's any factual information to take
away from...
I'm learning all the time from top to bottom.
Well, the hippopotamus takes its little tail...
Think about the poor guy...
And it whirls its tail and it flings shit as it walks.
Which one of Noah's sons had to muck those stalls?
I'm talking about how the hippopotamus...
Think about mucking those stalls.
You don't want to walk behind...
Noah's son had to do that.
Oh, well.
Listen, all I'm asking...
Hey, can you guys share that mic in a more equitable way?
No wonder they hated it.
Well, it's because I'm not eating it, Louie.
Well, Philo's overpowering everybody.
I know.
And that's what he told you he was going to do.
Whichever way I do it, it will be wrong.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, sir, but every...
It doesn't matter which way...
Can't both of you just lean into that thing a little bit?
Come on, get close.
See, it's like...
Just like...
We're going to touch beards here.
Oh, God.
Oh, Jesus.

Lean in.
Why don't you tie me in and knock together?
How's that?
That's what we need to do.
Listen, how many lifeboats were on Noah's Ark?
None.
That would have been a blasphemous...
Yeah, absolutely.
See?
And what happened?
That would mean the Lord wasn't going to provide.
See?
It's not going to sink because God is at the...
But the Lord also didn't, as Philo just said, somebody had to clean up all that muck from
the rhinos and the tigers and the bears, oh my.
Well, if you saw the recent movie, the bad guy stowed away on the Ark.
I mean, all this other stuff that they added with the long-suffering Jennifer Connelly
as Mrs. Noah rolling her eyes and doing all the chores on the Ark.
I like thinking they could design the Ark.
I think they could design the Ark in such a way that they knew they were going to have
to muck it out, you know, like from an elephant.
They got to muck out an elephant stall every day.
You open the forward...
But you know, in that version that John Huston...
...Sea water washes through.
Yes, in the Bible, in the beginning.
They fed them milk.
They would milk the other animals and feed the...
Like the tigers were drinking milk.
They didn't know it was bad for them.
And that would calm them down.
That made the tigers all calm, you know.
So they didn't want to...
Why didn't they just make like a trap door in the bottom of the ship and just let it
just go out the bottom?
They swill the ocean water through the Ark.
I think that would have been a good idea.
That would have been a great idea.
Yeah.
Like the Aegean stable.
But God...
They may have, you know, may have like...
I would think that the animals drinking milk, their capacity to crap was increased, but
it would have been easier to clean up.
Oh, yeah.
It would have been like baby shit everywhere, you know.
And then they recycle that and feed that to the monkeys.
Yeah.
You open the petcock at the front of the Ark.
Or at least the insects.
Exactly.
And it swills the water through at hoof and paw level.
They have two flies in there.
I was going to say they would have brought a lot more flies with them than I think they

Well, they had two flies.
They had two cockroaches, two mosquitoes, and those two tapeworms.
They had two flies and those two flies have to eat all that shit.
Yep.
They had plenty of food for the flies.
There you go.
That's the answer to the question.
Can you guys say...
They grew unnaturally large and buzzed around the boat.
A flop of poo or a scat or something.
Yeah.

I don't know if there's some other word that's not against the law.
Besides, we don't say...
Besides what?
We don't say...
Poop.
Besides the Anglo-Saxonism.
We can say flop.
Poop.
Let's say flop or plop.
Feces.
Hold on, everybody.
Get this out of your system.
Let's say ejecta.
Oh, other words besides excrement?
Shite.
Excreta.
Scat.
Fumets.
Scat.
For animals.
Effluvient.
How about fumets?
Anal effluviant.
What do you mean by that?
Subgenius Bible.
Subgenius Bible.



And the Bible study class is on Noah's Ark.
Is it over yet?
Do you want it to be over?
We didn't talk about the radio mast and the radio operator's room.
Do you want it to be over?
I can find the theme music.
Oh, yeah.
Philo's dancing with impatience to unleash his theme music.
Hello, this is Children's Bible Hour with Aunt Bertha.
Oh, there you go.
And Billy and Billy...
Billy and Billy.


A new excrement.
...a new inimitable instrument.


...eternally in the wrong.
On Noah's Ark.
Noah's Ark.

Noah's Ark.
No way.


No way.
No way.

Many people ask how we dealt with the excrement on the ark.
It's metaphor!
A metaphor.
The metaphor shoot is where we place the ark's refuse.
I hope you like this story, boy.
Into the chute.
It says metaphor on the lid.
Do you think maybe they brought extra animals so they could eat them?
Or did they just eat plants?
No, they drank that milk.
They drank milk.
All they did was just drink milk.
No, no one in his family.
They drank milk, too.
They just drank milk.
That's all they did.
They just drank milk.
In the Russell Crowe movie, the bad guy ate several species in the ark while he was stowed away.
They ate the unicorn.
Which never survived.
The unicorn was the first one to go, wasn't it?
Well, it has its own skewer, you know?
Yes, it does.
Yeah, so you use one to kill the other.
Yeah, and then you hold it.
When you roast it, it's got the handy holder on it.
Like corn.
The Noah's Ark movie also showed the Nephilim, the ones who came in bread with the daughters of men,
as looking like the giant bunch of rocks creature left over from Galaxy Quest.
This was not in the Bible, but it was an eye-burning special effect created just for the movie.
You did see the Noah's Ark movie.
Yeah.
With Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly and a million creatures.
I saw it and I forgot it.
It wasn't like the book.
It was not like the book, but it was good.
Well, it had its moments.
You like the George C. Scott version better?
Did you prefer the George C. Scott?
It's narrated by John Huston, sir.
Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible.
And according to occultists, the next two books.
Did he get royalties for that?
Probably not.
I don't know.
He did not get to go into the Holy Land.
He had to hang around outside at the border there.
He was given a special treat by God.
God allowed Moses to see God's buttocks at the end of Moses' life.
You can look at God's butt.
That's what he got.
Hang here at the edge of paradise.
You can stay there.
That's as close as you're going to get to.
Moses was not allowed to enter into the promised land.
No, he couldn't go in.
He had to.
They made a little gate.
The Moses Gate.
Where he had to hang outside that gate.
And just look wistfully in between the gate itself.
Into the paradise.
He claimed magic power for himself, supposedly.
That was actually from God.
And so God became Roth, as he would in those days.
He said, no, you can't do that.
After 40 years of leading these arguments.
Plus he struck the rock.
Remember, he struck the rock.
And water came forth.
Yes.
He wasn't supposed to just, you know, say, come forth.
But he actually struck the rock.
And Edward G. Robinson said, yeah, where's your God now, Moses?
Yeah.
Yeah, where's your God now?
Well, so God, Moses asked of God, could I see you as a result for my lifetime of service?
And God said, no, because my glorious.
You can see my ass.
It burned your face off like what happened to Philo.
Yeah.
The glorious.
The glorious effulgence of God's being would burn and frizzle him like a bug zapper.
But if he waited till God passed and looked at God's hind parts, as it says in the Bible.
The multitude of hind parts.
So he got to see God's bottom before he died.
The million asses of God.
Yes.
That's astonishing.
That's exactly right.
There's a million different asses.
They had to wait, waiting there for everyone to pass by.
The incalculable manifestation.
The incalculable manifestation of the almighty.
Very interesting that you said that because that is the name of the band that will be playing.
Uh-oh.
The million asses of God.
Yeah.
This is a squirrel mill, or speaking English, a high-speed nut house.
A mill is a hot rod or souped up jalopy, which was once just a car.
A squirrel is a space kid who can't get off the earth, but is always crying.
The making of the universe.
The day I left town where the heavenly acerca erase.

Thanks, Lee Murr,
for that touching ode to
lumbar spondylosis.
And now, let's see what the old
doctors are doing.
What are you doing?
Now let's see,
here's the schedule.
give up the mic.
Today is the day when we forget what day it is.
You've already done that once, Hal.
Totally reserved schedule.
Stay up all night
and upset everyone.
I'm not going to do that. I'm going to go to bed early.
It's intrepid.
Well, if Mike
gets up early,
get up and go off to the parade field
intrepid as all get out.
And greet our alien
masters when they finally descend.
When they gleaming
saucer craft.
Yeah, and we don't want to do it
all bleary-eyed and grumbling
because we had to wake up
or stay up.
So stay up all night then.
No, that's even worse.
Well, you can't.
It's all intrepid and stuff, man.
What are you guys
distracted with now?
I was just trying to figure out what that vibrating
the stage was vibrating. It was actually making your voice
vibrate.
It's vibrating.
Maybe it was
your thing down here.
That's what was amplifying all that
stuff.
You have
solved the mystery, Shaggy.
How about if you and Scooby go and have a nap?
Scooby snack.
A snack.
Hey, Susie,
you want to come up here and touch my knee?
Want to come up and touch bases?
Somebody get Philo
out of there. That's all I care about.
I don't care what sits in that chair.
As long as it's not Philo.
Yeah, I've been noticing that probably.
Well, see, he's fixing the sound.
He's fixing it.
All right.
Yeah, I'm getting a serious 60 cycle.
Huh?
He's fixing it.
All right.
That will actually waver and it will it will knock
spacecraft off course.
The dark phase shifts the sound.
Yeah.
And once again, you can blame the dog.
The dog did it.
The reason why X day is not going to happen tomorrow is because
the dog ate it.
I told those guys to fuck off.
Phylo or Fido, one of the others.
They came to me and said, Hey, are we still on?
I said, fuck off.
And they were like, OK, that's all you know.
Fido just means faithful.
Phylo means love.
Phylo means love.
Yes.
Yeah.
The Fido also means love.
I mean, God backwards is dog faithful.
Loyal.
Leg out.
Yeah.
Say what?
Ah.
2019 is going to be a good year.
Especially effects.
It comes Bob gets it all together.
What, so you think 19 is going to be a good year.
Maybe for some genie, I bet.
Pinks and dwarfs.
No, never.
Do we have every reason to be super?
optimistic because I know when Bob smiles I'll ignore bad weather no what
about the dog what about the dog what about the dog he'll pee the floor and it
goes on like that we have the entire rock opera or pot rot opera pop rock a
pop dog X Day Opera called buddy princess we and I have worked our way
all through it and you're gonna perform it right I get little oh it's what's 15
minutes long if we do the whole thing I have to go up to the main stage could
tell by you and mom's reaction in the car that we shouldn't do it brown white

Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Onan just now trans-channeled this through his phone.
Some people are just so ready to tell you what to do.
They'll tell you what you did wrong, and they'll correct you.
Well, I'm tired of their co-rectal examinations.
Let me be.
What looks like a screw-up to you might also be a screw-up to me.
But it might also be a carefully contrived art prank,
infinitely delicate and subtle.
And if some pink boy comes hee-hawing in with their
actually to fix it,
then the whole thing's a mess.

Everything is ruined.

And now we welcome a new member of the subgenius brethren.
I have to say, I believe that your eyebrows should have their own zip code.
Or their own name.
You have your name and your eyebrows, because I find them very awesome.
Thank you, thank you.
I only wish you could have seen my eyelids 20...
Well, my eyelids are there.
The eyelids of mourning.
20 years ago, women would come up to me in bars and say,
I would kill to have your eyelashes.
I'm batting them at the moment, in this.
Anyway.
Yeah, but a moth would kill to have your eyebrows.
A moth would kill to have my shirt.
Batting every gentleman.
Oh, I have a subgenius hymn that I worked on long and deep.
Let's have it.
That's why Bob's so deaf, yo.
That's why Bob's so gnarly, dude.
That's why Bob's so groovy, man.
That's why Bob's so cool, cat.
That's why Bob's so hep-gate.
Tis why Bob has such virtue, sirrah.
Indequoad Bob, genua dea pibus es meritrice mea.
Bob.
There you go.
Reverend Wat B. Falk, dear friend.
And by the way, the Latin in that meant,
that's why Bob is the knees of bees, my whore.
Whoa.
Thank you.
Yes, he's the bee's knees.
Because everyone is going to be looking that up.
Well, I had to, of course.
Listening to the Hour of Slack, they're going to go,
what did he say?
Oh, okay, good, he just told us.
So now it saved me the time of having to do that.
But that was the internet that told me, so who knows if it's correct.
Bob Dobbs, he's no slob.
Gentlemen, question mark?
He's the head of that sub-genius church, which means he's super...
I'm glad you answered to Bob's call.
I bet I know why I'm all here.
No, I'm not all here.
My name is Ivan, and I control the trademarks all.
Redacted.
And if you want to copy Bob, you'll have to cut my balls.
So pull down your pants and pull them up.
Pull out your wallet.
You cannot escape our thrall.
Dun, da, da, da, dun.
There's that 60 cycle, hum.
There we go.
There we go.
Finally, somebody's been reading their prescriptions.
We're not going to take it.
That's your line.
Oh, is that?
Okay, then it's something...
Never did and never will.
Don't want no religion.
See, we don't have to change that part.
I wanted to thank you, Reverend Stang.
I'm getting a marvelous placebos off this pill that I took.
I did want to emphasize I'm aware it's a placebo,
so that you're not in any legal trouble.
I mean, dispensed medication without a license on the public.
Did you get your pill?
Yeah, he did.
Oh, okay.
He did.
And a wonderful placebos it is.
Okay.
The Placebo Domingo, okay.
Placebos.
Placebos work better than conspiracy medicine.
Did you read the placebos?
Studies have proved it, especially for mental problems.
Placebos.
A placebo works slightly better than antidepressants.
Well, we are well supplied here.
Yes.
So, okay.
Placebos.
You know, Princess, we and I thought about sending you the edited tape of a...
It's like we cut...
We really did translate all of Tommy, but then we cut it down to 15 minutes of Buddy,
the dog opera.
Okay.
And we thought about...
She wanted to send you the 15 minutes so you could play it while we sang it.
And I was going, let's not do that to him.
Although he may not even know that old record that well.
I don't know.
Well, I do own a record store in the Who.
I've been a Who fan forever.
We used the Live at Leeds version.
Oh, that's even...
That's one of my favorite records.
Yes.
Well, you see, you should have done it, but you...
Yep, see.
Lacked the gumption.
And I've got the 15 minute cut down.
Some of the songs we're saving for my sister to write about the other dog, Claudia.
Gotcha.
I'm the pit bull.
I'm Claudia.
Or something like that.
I don't know.
We'll see.
Wow.
Yeah.
We're here.
This is what we have to look forward to.
Somebody likes our song.
Susie's the one who...
I knew somebody would like our Buddy opera.
We love it, actually.
But yeah, look at that.
We got it all worked out.
Pete Dog Send on guitar.
Yeah.
John N. Weiss.
Yeah, it's amazing how easily Dog and X-Day worked itself into that whole thing.
It's a boy that can't see or hear.
Well, this is a dog that better not piss and poop.
Yeah, but they all do that.
You're not gonna pee here.
Buddy, can you hear me?
Well, that's when he escapes and you're looking for him.
How can he be trained?
That's awesome.
Yeah.
When he has no brain.
Yes.
Buddy, can you hear me?
See me, feed me.
Feed me, feed me.
Pet me, rub me, see me, hear me, spoil me, feed me.
Yeah.
Towards the end, he's just saying, feed me.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Yeah.
Right.
What is right behind you?
Oh, right behind you.
I smell your butt hole.
I can tell you are in heat.
Heat.
Follow me.
Let me see.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, we have it all.
We have it all down.
It's a dog's view of, you know, outside, I smell the varmints.
Outside, I smell the varmints.
Outside, I smell the varmints.




I'll get my quarry.
Yeah, it's majestic.
It's all about peeing, crapping, sniffing, tearing up pillows, digging out from under
the fence, jumping over the fence, ripping the throats of groundhogs.
And mail men.
And mail men.
Yeah, there's all mail men.
Yeah, there's a mail man in there.
And
Oh yeah
The mail carrier
Now see Reverend Angry Larry
Is all wrapped up in the opera
Yeah you should have sent him that disc
Yeah you should have
The pop
Rock
This would have actually been one of those things
To where if you had sent it to me
And Andrew the Impaled
You know we probably could have done
A full on
Well let me put it this way
We had
This suddenly started jumping
Into our heads about two weeks ago
About the same time that
We had to get X Day Ready and Starwood
And then I got those 200 orders
And it was our slack
Our slack was
Okay we have all these things we have to do
We're subgeniuses
Instead let's write a rock opera
And we did
We got all the way through the whole damn thing
And I have a background tape
That we could lip sync to
But we're not
We're not


We're not
We're not

It needs work
We need work
We will be able to finally do our duet
Of Geek Acres
When Princess We finally wakes up
From her enchanted slumber
Yeah
Yeah it's
Yeah we did
It's very very carefully thought out
You end up
You cry at the end of it
Of course you do
Well your ears hurt at that point
Yeah
Pee on the bed sheets, chew up the pillows, tearing things up, tearing things up.
I like how you put father and the people that are saying it.
That's me.
Right.
Yeah.
That's what I'm saying.
The owner.
Do you think it's all right to leave the dog while we go shopping?
Do you think it's all right?
He's been a little frisky tonight.
I think it's all right.
I just think it's all right.
Boy, are they wrong.
A harsh stench of human sweat creeps up on me.
All at once a pink mailman I suddenly see.
He smells like a butcher shop viscera pail.
And his stupid sack stuffed all packed full of mail.
Places to play, mailmen to bite, hydrants to pee.
Each urination makes a note in my symphony.
And here's the part about me.
His rules are the rules that fuck up all my slack.
Won't let me off leash, won't give me a snack.
He is my warden, my prison guard.
I'll either escape him or bite off his nard.
And then...
Did you ever see the faces of the bobbies?
They get so excited.
Waking up on X Day morning hours before the atmosphere's ignited.
They believe in Bob and all the slack including Connie's generosity.
Peeping in the pond to see what girls look like unclothed in curiosity.
And Buddy doesn't know what X Day is.
He doesn't know who Bob is or what paying is.
And so on.
Feed me, feed me, feed me, feed me.
So we've been through the whole thing.
That's almost...
The whole thing.
Out of order, but you get the idea.
The work has been done.
So next year, on my escape vessel, you and Andrew...
Yeah, we'll do it.
And Fat Mandy...
Sure.
And that way, I don't have to sing.
The whole stage version with all the...
In other words, you want us to sing it and do the whole thing.
Well, your name will be on the credit.
And Pete Townsend.
Yeah.
I had a feeling that you guys would say I was more Oliver Reed than Roger Daltrey.
Okay, well...
Remember the movie of Tommy?
Yeah, yeah.
Oliver Reed?
Uh-huh.
What were they thinking?
You didn't think that worked well?
No.
He was terrible.
I mean, he's a great werewolf.
He's a good lecher.
He's real good at lots of roles, but...
He's singing.
He's singing.
And they had Jack Nicholson singing in that.
Yeah, that was probably a bad idea, too.
Crazy stuff.
Kid stuff.
You know...
That's Ken Russell, man.
Kid stuff.
He was out there.
Ed Wood with a budget.
And now, the Psychoskeletons.
Skeletons.
A tune called Overpass.
Overpass.
Então fricking overpassi.


Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Take them as needed or as often as necessary.
And Susie chucked one right before us.
How do you feel, Susie?
Good.
She looks very smooth.
Should you take more than one at a time or just do one every 30 seconds?
Well, that's the start.
Work on that.
You'll feel kind of good when you're finished, too.
You'll be able to feel well.
You'll feel pain very well.
You see, the thing about demon worshippers and all that sort of folk is that the stuff written about them is all written by their enemies.
It's a cute sensitivity.
I'm not talking about devil crud.
Devil crud.
Satan worshippers, that's another form of Christianity.
Satan is this Christian character.
If you're into Satan, you're a fundamentalist Christian.
I'm worshipped.
Satan from India.
Shaitan.
That's the A-Ram Satan, I believe.
And then there's the Satan of the future, of the far future, Lord Thessidon.
You probably remember that.
The sandworms are also called Shaitan.
The future of Zophique.
Sandworms.
I hate them.
You hate them?
There was a cult in the U.S. military.
A demon worshipping cult.
And they got in trouble.
But they said that was their own freedom of religion.
And they defended themselves eloquently.
What are you doing over there?
No thanks.
I can stay for ourselves.
Well, you know, the reason we didn't get into Sundance with the subgenius documentaries
is because there was a really good documentary about the Church of Satan.
And their attempt to put up a statue.
Sundance people didn't want to have it too Church of things.
Satan had a bigger name.
So there you go.
It's only because he's been around a little longer.
Well, yeah, sure.
Well, you're a feat.
Film festival critics of Sundance.
Right. They know who he is.
They think they know.
Yeah, they think.
They think they know who Bob is.
Yeah, but they don't know who Bob is.
What they know would not clog the foot of the fool.
It's funny, you know, in that documentary movie, of course,
Philo and I and the other old-timers said,

we just have to do the usual,
oh, it's just like Mad Magazine, officer.
It's just a joke.
We're a satire, a mirror of society's defects.
That's all.
You know, it's just a takeoff.
Now, of course, we have to do that in order just to survive.
But the important thing is,
plain ordinary audiences that watch that movie
at these film festival premieres, people have never heard of Bob,
they come away.
They go and praise Bob.
And it's, I mean, it does a really good job.
It's a much better subgenius recruitment film than Arise is,
because Arise only appeals to people who are already saved.
Whereas this thing explains to them.
What a relief that was,
that this movie does not only claim that we're still active
and not moribund, something that ended in the 80s,
but they bring it forward and connect it to today's intellectual and political
landscape.
So all my reservations about the film have vanished,
and I will enthusiastically promote it.
Well, before I was ready to denounce it,
I thought it was going to be this terrible thing that was totally distorted.
That's because you've never edited five feature length documentaries, Dr. Howell.
The documentaries usually end up making themselves.
Because of all the great stuff you've got in the can.
Because you only have so much good footage.
And, yeah, it's funny, we were so afraid that she,
that Sandy was going to turn it into a Connie-ite film.
A Namby Pamby.
She was like possessed with that.
But Connie is never mentioned in the whole film.
At no point.
She wanted to.
She wanted Connie on the poster, even.
Well, that was before her wisely hired editor
and wisely hired writer and other people kind of,
like, here's how it works.
Lewis Black actually said,
now, Sandy, you know, nobody gives a shit about Connie.
It's all Bob.
No offense, Connie, but, you know, let's face it.
I told her, I had to say, you know, Sandy, to tell the truth,
we've sold Connie products, but nobody ever buys any of them.
And, in fact, they just like the straight black and white old-time Bob.
They don't even buy color Bobs.
Yes, they're retro in every way.
It's like a behind the curve, helpless, hopeless.
But there is hope at subgenius.com.
In fact, that's also part of my email, stang at subgenius.com.
But here's the important part.
Now you listen to this.
Can I still have my dog?
No.
Oh, no, please.
Hey, Bob.
I have a special report on the camps to make to the Ministry of Education.
For the children.
Teletubby.
You get 152 hits.
It may sound silly to you, but...
Something bothering you, boy?
Nuclear jet.
Oh, God.
Oh, OK.
When I take it, this place, this Maple Street, is not unique by no means.
The End

You
