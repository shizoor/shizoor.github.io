1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,300
Most young people will continue through life as normal responsible citizens.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:10,740
Others, the shunted and unloved, the unguided, the seekers of thrills and kicks

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,680
are candidates for the slave world of lifelong...

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,480
How does it happen? Where does it start? What are the signs?

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,320
The pattern is generally the same.

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:21,780
Bob?

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,700
Take a lack of responsibility, the inability to make right choices,

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:31,020
add to it ignorance and indifference, and top it off with a desire for escapism and kicks.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,980
The sum total is then...

10
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,440
The subgenius power of...

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,180
SWAT!

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,340
This is the real action. This is the test.

13
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,780
The time to separate the man from the boy.

14
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:50,040
Willpower, individuality, character are slipping down the drain.

15
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,240
In their place comes Bob.

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,860
Don't be chicken.

17
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:00,960
We shall not be the slaves of the lawful, but the slaves of the lawful.

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,980
Five minutes after! Okay, it's time to get started.

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,680
What am I doing here? How did this happen?

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,940
Oh, now I remember.

21
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,460
First, thank you for coming to the subgenius devival at Starwood 36.

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,740
But before we get started, I'd like you to share in one of our very solemn ceremonies

23
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,680
if you could just bow your heads.

24
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:35,160
your head for a silent and yet actually incredibly noisy moment of noise! Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise damn God Bob!

25
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,860
Music to my ears, friends. It's time to open your heart, close your mind, unzip your

26
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:52,240
lips, and pull out your wallet because the word of Bob is coming. But having done

27
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,420
the moment of noise we do have to, now don't call the fire marshal or the

28
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,520
Federal Reserve because this is highly illegal. This is a dollar bill. I'm

29
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,100
sacrificing this thing because we did sell at least one one dollar pamphlet

30
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:15,460
over there to proving I'm not completely insane. We burn these dollar bills so that

31
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:22,220
when the the aliens up in space who promised they will save us, when they

32
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:28,000
smell the burning of the meat of this dollar bill then that reminds them that

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,320
there is still something on earth still worth saving that cares more about slack

34
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,300
than about money. However notice it's not a $20 bill. That would be a whole

35
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:49,140
different thing entirely. Whoa! It's the hour of slack and I usually don't run

36
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,940
shows where I talk the whole time but

37
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:58,180
every year there is one show where I talk for a whole hour on a stage to an

38
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:04,300
audience of people who actually paid. And I'm short on time this week so here's my

39
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:11,700
full rant from the Starwood Festival of 2016 recorded at Wisteria Event Center

40
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:19,080
on July 16th. Actually it's the second rant. There was an earlier Pufferdome rant

41
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,240
which we'll play next week.

42
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:27,720
And all right let me let me figure out what it is I'm supposed to do here. I

43
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:34,360
usually have to read this the Starwood tour guide just to see what the hell I

44
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:41,260
promised to talk about. The most powerful drug it says here. Sorry but we

45
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,140
can't tell you what it is. You'll have to sit through at least part of Reverend

46
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:51,460
Stang's sermon to learn the secret. But be warned he says it's not pretty and it's

47
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:57,180
gonna make you wait longer. Stang promises also to unveil some sizzling new

48
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,660
proclamations from the elusive slack master and subgenius cult guru.

49
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:09,040
Cult? This is a major world religion now. Way bigger than Jonestown.

50
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:15,760
J.R. Bob Dobbs including a heartfelt warning about the dangers of that trendy

51
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,900
new alternative health fad penis candling.

52
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,200
Are the gods and deities

53
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:28,420
goddesses overrated or is that exactly what makes them divine? These and other

54
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:33,200
deep questions will be sidestepped artfully until the Q&A starts which due

55
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,580
to the cues is usually the best part of a subgenius revival at Starwood. Oh if

56
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:44,180
time allows Stang will also deliver his oracular interpretation of the Starwood

57
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:51,120
guidebook and workshop list. Well yeah that's traditional. Oh and the other

58
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,200
traditional thing is that the Starwood guidebook is the most popular of the

59
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,200


60
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,200


61
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,020
time.

62
00:04:53,020 --> 00:05:00,720
I'm supposed to explain the church of the subgenius. Subgenius 101. Let's see how

63
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,420
fast because just in case there's anybody here who doesn't already know and

64
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:15,860
wasn't inculcated at birth with the truth of J.R. Bob Dobbs. Seen here and

65
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:22,020
there's a there's a rather stylized artful Bob face over there. It's a little

66
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:32,480
prettier than he normally looks. Okay in 1953 that man J.R. Bob Dobbs already

67
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:39,460
considered by other salesmen to be a literal saint of sales underwent a

68
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:45,800
supernatural intervention. He was something we call his divine immaculation.

69
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:51,980
While working on an amateur television set of his own design he was seized up in the spirit by a

70
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,420
man named Joseph. He was an alien space monster calling itself Jehovah One. It has a

71
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:02,460
creature that has masqueraded as a sort of a patriarchal style God and

72
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:08,480
occasionally goes in drag throughout recorded history and probably a long time

73
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:16,440
before. Probably the near-sighted cave, the first near-sighted caveman, may have

74
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,120
been the first tool of Jehovah One. I have a theory about religion. Anyway,

75
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,580
Jehovah One showed Bob in a vision that throughout history the weirdos, the

76
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:33,100
abnormals, the well you know the down-home for real people had been put

77
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:39,920
down and oppressed by let's call them the normals, the mediocritans, the pink

78
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,620
boys, the Barbies and Kens, the cage-dwellers, you know who I'm talking

79
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:50,280
about? The guy sitting next to you that you don't really like that much. Any

80
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:58,220
any way he was promised that in the year 1998 aliens from the planet X would

81
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:04,320
arrive on earth at July 5th 7 a.m. and this would this event would be called

82
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,880
the rupture. The subgenius would be lifted up and rewarded for their faith

83
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:18,020
by being given their own basically anything they wanted forever. Not bad for

84
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,260
35 bucks that's all that's all Bob had to say. Well, that's about it. Thanks for watching. See you in the next episode of the show. Bye bye.

85
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,040
asks, and he'll make that promise along with the

86
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,100
old promise of

87
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,860
eternal salvation or triple your money back.

88
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:36,180
Nobody else offers that one. And thus Bob founded the

89
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,480
Church of the Subgenius, not on a

90
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,760
rock like some more sturdy churches, but on a shifting

91
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,840
sandy beach of hypocrisy and $35

92
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,560
bills, which he used to manufacture apparently.

93
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,640
A disorganized religion, a non-organization for non-joiners,

94
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,620
for sinners, mutants, misfits, disbelievers,

95
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,640
or those who will believe anything. All subgeniuses are

96
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,620
different. There is no typical subgenius, and we catch any two being

97
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,220
alike, one must die. So

98
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,620
I should probably load up on ammo.

99
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,900
Anyway, that is

100
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,160
a

101
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,320
a

102
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:47,320


103
00:08:47,320 --> 00:09:17,320


104
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:47,320


105
00:09:47,320 --> 00:10:17,320


106
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:47,320


107
00:10:47,320 --> 00:11:17,320


108
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:47,320


109
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,740
, and that makes me happy because

110
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,960
occasionally people ask me what my real background in religion

111
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,100
is, you know. Monsters. I used to say, oh, I've

112
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,840
returned to my childhood religion, science fiction, or comic books, but that's

113
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,360
fancying it up too much. It's just monsters.

114
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,700
Monsters are often seen in their promotional materials carrying

115
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:15,060
beautiful girls. That might have something to do with it too.

116
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,300
I don't know. But I'm not,

117
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,280
I'm not the only monster lover. If you think about it,

118
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:27,140
a lot of the world's most basic original literature are stories of

119
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:31,080
monster hunts. Gilgamesh, I think, is one of the first recorded

120
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,140
written stories, and that's a monster

121
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:39,020
hunt story. Beowulf, the oldest known

122
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,160
novel or whatever in the English

123
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,980
language. That's a monster hunting thing. The Bible. That stars

124
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:52,440
all kinds of monsters. And all the way up to Moby Dick, which, if you think about it,

125
00:12:52,500 --> 00:13:00,900
is really a cool monster hunt. And as I said, Wisteria and this whole area of

126
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:10,500
southern Ohio has its share of monsters. Now, of course, so you you say you thought

127
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:16,960
you saw some kind of a monster. Well, you know, the thing is, a monster hunt is all about monsters. And I'm not

128
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:23,140
human mind plays funny tricks on us sometimes, but come on now, this is the

129
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:29,060
modern age. We have telescopes and microscopes. We know there's no such

130
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:39,820
thing as... That's how it often goes, friends. So, you know, you've probably seen

131
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:45,000
flyers with stereo hands out warning you about the Candiru toads. Walk down

132
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,620
the trail, just be careful about where you decide to make water, because they

133
00:13:52,620 --> 00:14:00,420
are very accurate if tiny hopping and venomous creatures related to the famous

134
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:08,080
snakes of the Amazon. We have arboreal tree squids here. They're not

135
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,680
as sexy as the prairie squids. They can be used for that, but they're venomous

136
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,760
and whether or not you de-beacon

137
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:14,980
birds, you're not going to be able to do that.

138
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,960
Before you have your way with them or whatever you people do with them now,

139
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,780
they still will hurt you. So avoid... If you don't know the difference between an

140
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:29,460
arboreal tree squid and a prairie squid, don't fuck it.

141
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,920
Okay? I mean, and I'm not worrying about the squids feeling either. They love it.

142
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,660
It's you that I'm more worried about. And of course, everyone here knows the

143
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,000
legend, or is it, of old Sequaw,

144
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,880
the prehistoric giant snapping turtle that dwells at the bottom of a mine shaft

145
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:57,800
in the deep end of the pond where you have been swimming. Maybe. If you don't

146
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:07,580
mind the strange hair that it makes grow all over you, the yeti hair. We had...

147
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:13,900
Was it you? Somebody... I'm not gonna name names partly because I can't remember and I always get

148
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:20,840
these stories wrong. But according to somebody, someone ran up to her and said,

149
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,700
that old Sequaw thing is true. I just saw him. I saw him crossing the road at night

150
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:34,940
or one of his children. And yes, there are large snapping turtles on this land. And

151
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:41,160
and I heard that Charlene told us that she intercepted one heading for the pond

152
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,220
and took it to another pond.

153
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,840
But I've since been told that there actually are at least three of them in the pond, but they avoid

154
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:54,780
humans who are splashing around and doing things. It's when you just kind of stop and sit there and

155
00:15:54,780 --> 00:16:03,080
they see a toe or some other little wiggling, nubby object. They want to swim up there and bite it.

156
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:09,640
You know, they think it's food. And when one of those snapping cooters gets hold of your toe,

157
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,200
you know, they won't let go until lightning strikes.

158
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,540
Or a holy man urinates upon the back of the turtle.

159
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,700
So don't call me, call Oberon for your tortoise peeing.

160
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:37,280
There's a certain type of bear that inhabits these woods, the Ursus canola, but I'm literally not supposed to talk about that

161
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,680
because it might trigger something. I don't quite get it. I'm old fashioned.

162
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:43,940
I'm not sure I'm going to get into that.

163
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:49,020
But I've heard of feral hogs or mutated hog bear things.

164
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,640
Somebody heard one the other night.

165
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,680
Actually, our friend Dr.

166
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:01,320
Howell heard something really large rooting around in the trash cans up the road that scared even him.

167
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,680
He thought he didn't believe in monsters.

168
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,500
But someone else heard this unearthly.

169
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,420
First, they heard crashing in the underbrush.

170
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,120
Then I'm guessing.

171
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,840
They might have smelled something weird.

172
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,280
Then they started hearing a really weird noise.

173
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,020
It sounds like a cross between a giant owl and a bear.

174
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,560
And I forget what happened.

175
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:31,060
Either they started to run, but out of the woods crashed my neighbor, Joe Rothenberg,

176
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:39,420
with some unearthly musical instrument he had just purchased in Brazil that made those horrible noises.

177
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,620
So again, you.

178
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,300
You thought you saw some kind of monster.

179
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,820
Maybe you did.

180
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,840
There are key stealing pixies out here.

181
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,900
I'm I'll bet that one of you at least has had that problem.

182
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,640
They're pixies.

183
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,380
They're invisible.

184
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,020
Although I've heard they're really sexy, but it doesn't do you any good.

185
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:11,160
And they steal car keys or any kind of really small, important objects.

186
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,440
Glasses.

187
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:12,920
Maybe.

188
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,200
Your.

189
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,320
Phone.

190
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,680
I don't know.

191
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:20,040
They often bring them back and put them in a place that makes you feel stupid.

192
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,340
But it wasn't you that lost them.

193
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,740
It really was the pixies.

194
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,100
And I've been told that by experts who've lived out here for a long time.

195
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:35,860
Of course, we also have any forest or wooded area has the Bigfoot or Sasquatch or whatever.

196
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,720
Big hairy man, ape thing.

197
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,360
Around here.

198
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,840
They tend to live in the.

199
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:42,940
The.

200
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,500
Merit.

201
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,500
The hidden illegal marijuana growing fields.

202
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,380
Because then you don't notice their smell.

203
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,620
Apparently they smell roughly the same.

204
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,340
And that's kind of a like a disguise for them.

205
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,260
So you never know if you smell that smell.

206
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,120
Maybe it's maybe it's Bigfoot.

207
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,120
Maybe somebody is holding out on you.

208
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,940
A moth man.

209
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:12,820
The famous moth man was reported as existing around Point Pleasant, West Virginia, which is really a big place.

210
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,460
Really close to here.

211
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,300
They have a great museum and a moth man statue in town.

212
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:25,040
Now, this guy named John Kiel wrote the book literally about moth man.

213
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,080
And one drunken night of the subgenius devival.

214
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,780
He told me he made it all up.

215
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,440
He came from a carnival background.

216
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,000
Apparently no one else ever really noticed that.

217
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,220
He also wrote the book on UFOs, too.

218
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,480
He was really, really good at that.

219
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,020
And of course, then there's the ultimate monster.

220
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,300
I don't know if he's here, but it's Bob.

221
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,220
He looks so normal.

222
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,160
That should be a warning sign.

223
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:03,020
You know, anything that looks that normal.

224
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:11,800
God be something hiding under that mask of strangely dumb normality.

225
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:17,020
Which makes me wonder about Donald Trump, too.

226
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,700
But we'll get back to that.

227
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,640
The mind does play very strange tricks on you.

228
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:41,080
In fact, our friend who projects movies in the puffer domes, Bonds, James Bonds, brought up a conspiracy theory just this morning that I had never heard of.

229
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,200
Probably you.

230
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,080
Probably because I'm not on the internet enough.

231
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,660
Called the Mandela Theory.

232
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,000
And it's...

233
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,100
Has anyone heard of that?

234
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,220
This is really creepy.

235
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,260
Especially if you're reading the science fiction book I was reading this morning.

236
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,960
Proxima by Stephen Baxter.

237
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:08,800
Anyway, according to the Mandela Theory, a lot of people remember Nelson Mandela dying in jail, not becoming president.

238
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,900
And the Berenstain Bears.

239
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,640
Now, they were called the Berenstain Bears, right?

240
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,460
Well, childhood books, you know, kid books.

241
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,060
But now they're called the Berenstain Bears.

242
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,460
Yet everybody remembers him being the Berenstain Bears.

243
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,900
It's like, what's going on here?

244
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,160
Alternate? What's the other one?

245
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,000
Oh, and the Bible.

246
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,020
The Bible had changed.

247
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,220
I said, well, it's always changing.

248
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,580
They've rewritten that a million times.

249
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,780
He goes, no, but it means perfect.

250
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,060
It means permanently.

251
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,960
It used to say the lion will lie down with the lamb.

252
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,000
And now it says the lion will lie down with the wolf.

253
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,180
And so some alternate universe kicked off somewhere.

254
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,840
We have vague memories of another one.

255
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,560
Or, here's my theory.

256
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,140
It's just the marijuana.

257
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:04,400
That would actually explain damn near everything.

258
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:06,880
Depending.

259
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,460
Okay.

260
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:17,020
Now, see, as an emergentile dentist, I actually have a script, just in case.

261
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:26,680
And this is where I would take the Starwood 36 tour guide and make fun of ridiculous-sounding workshops.

262
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,300
The problem is, that's really rude.

263
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,280
And also, there weren't that many that were ridiculous-sounding.

264
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,480
There were some that were intriguing-sounding.

265
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:43,200
And they always turned out to be about something completely different from what the title indicated.

266
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,540
Much like mine.

267
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:51,740
The first one I noticed, Tom Swiss did one called Discordianism Through Its Literature.

268
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,400
Well, that must have been confusing as hell.

269
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:59,080
I mean, you could say the same thing about Church of the Subgenius.

270
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,860
That would be, yeah, it's literature?

271
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,120
That's pretty confusing.

272
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,460
I wanted to see this one, but couldn't.

273
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,620
Consciousness expansion through astronomy.

274
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:22,880
Well, if using a telescope means consciousness expansion, all those years I spent filming bugs with microscopes, I must have achieved consciousness compression.

275
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:30,200
So, oh, the microscopes, they're really great.

276
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,240
I've had people complain, say,

277
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,880
Stang, you're so locked to the mud plane.

278
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,100
You're so tied to the base things.

279
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,940
I prefer astronomy looking outwards at the greater things.

280
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,120
It's like, well, I prefer to, that's fine too.

281
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:46,980
Why not both?

282
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,580
But, you know they're crawling on you right now.

283
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,280
You're full of them.

284
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,240
There are millions, billions, billions of them inside you.

285
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,040
And the ones covering the ground and under the ground,

286
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,220
they outweigh all of us.

287
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,720
They're just surface creatures by a long shot.

288
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,880
And, yeah, consciousness compression.

289
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,320
Look down.

290
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:19,720
A subgenius, a true subgenius, can find incredible beauty and inspiration in a handful of dirt.

291
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,340
And that is not in any way a joke or an exaggeration.

292
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:28,160
And I'm sure a lot of you know what I've been talking about.

293
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,940
Some handfuls of dirt are more interesting than others.

294
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,280
But there's always something in there.

295
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:37,900
And if you look close enough, you'll see monsters all right.

296
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,200
That's why I got into it.

297
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,700
It's like, I'm bored with all these, there aren't any more monsters.

298
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:49,200
And then I looked through my first kid's microscope at a handful of dirt.

299
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,420
Oh, man.

300
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,560
There's a whole world of cool monsters down there.

301
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,620
What else here?

302
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,260
Oh, yeah.

303
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,300
Werewolves of wisteria.

304
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,980
That sounded so promising.

305
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,120
But it's a board game.

306
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,820
The werewolves are geeks.

307
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,200
They might be werewolves also, but they're geek werewolves.

308
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,600
And, boy, nothing wrong with that.

309
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,580
I'm a geek monster hunter.

310
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:21,760
The magic of perception, that was Phil Farber's title.

311
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,980
Yeah, that is magic, isn't it?

312
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,560
Perception.

313
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,740
That's a damn magicous thing I ever saw.

314
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:32,680
You can perceive monsters that aren't even there sometimes.

315
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,780
Not to mention invisible space gods.

316
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,320
What else here?

317
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,880
Oh, yeah.

318
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,080
Mommy, there's a Republican under my bed.

319
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,680
I missed that one, too.

320
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:55,540
But that brings me to my big subject here.

321
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,440
We don't normally do politics.

322
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,240
We don't do politics in the Church of the Subgenius.

323
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,240
But we have our own political party.

324
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:08,880
It's called patriopsychotic anarcho-materialism.

325
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,220
I'll say that again.

326
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,900
Patriopsychotic anarcho-materialism.

327
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,160
To sum it up, it's really pretty simple-minded.

328
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:22,520
Every yard a kingdom, that's about it.

329
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,240
Or every checkbook a queendom, I think was our old 80s joke that was added to it.

330
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,440
But that's kind of sexist.

331
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:33,640
But as you can tell, it's not real well thought out.

332
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,540
Because what do you do when you need to call a cop?

333
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,720
Or the roads need fixing.

334
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,660
We never crossed that bridge.

335
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,100
It's too much thinking.

336
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:54,320
But I have been thinking about another political party that might make more sense to people

337
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,040
and would certainly have a more attractive name.

338
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,840
The loudly complaining party.

339
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:08,040
Because, you know, despite all these prattling pray-bobs of positivity that you run into at places like here,

340
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:13,400
you get on the Internet or a normal coffee shop out in the world,

341
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,920
and you find that what people most want to do is apparently is to complain.

342
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,420
They love to complain.

343
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:26,020
And this brings me to the sad, sad part.

344
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:38,820
description of the most powerful drug, which I'm afraid is moral outrage. Oh, people love to get

345
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:46,540
butt hurt. It is so habit-forming. The feeling, that great feeling of being morally superior

346
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:54,220
and saying that incredibly cutting and demeaning line and then making that decision,

347
00:27:54,220 --> 00:28:03,980
I could push save and sleep on it or I could push send. Yeah! I'm gonna push send. That'll show them.

348
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:14,140
And the internet and specifically Facebook is the filthy needle that they all share infecting each

349
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:22,720
other with a new and worse disease every day because there's always something to get outraged

350
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,200
about and the internet is the filthy needle that they all share infecting each other with a new and

351
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:24,200


352
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:35,960
it gets to a ridiculous point. And I think it's been heating up because of the elections thing and

353
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:45,180
the ungodly return of, well, it was always here, the re-eruption of race problems in America. And

354
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:54,180
people now can become, it's like, they can get upset with you for being too PC or not PC, but they can get upset with you for being too PC or not PC.

355
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:54,180


356
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,740
enough but what i'm saying more and more is people get frantically outraged

357
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,020
neue

358
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:14,920
I'm talking on both sides of the spectrum. We subgenius's prefer to think

359
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:19,580
of ourselves. There's an illustration and book of the subgenius. It's classic. Over

360
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:24,180
here there's the left wing guy. He's skinny and bearded and yelling and

361
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,520
And over here's the right-wing guy.

362
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,840
He's fat in a business suit and yelling.

363
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,240
But they almost come full circle at the extremes.

364
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,340
And there's some poor, pathetic, normal person down at the bottom of the circle.

365
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,160
That's probably me.

366
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:46,340
But in between those two extremes is Bob, lifting a wallet out of the pockets of each of those dumbass extremists

367
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,460
who are so morally outraged about everything.

368
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:54,000
This started bothering me last year.

369
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:59,460
And I remember coming up with the slogan, anger is the new slack.

370
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:04,280
And apparently, for a lot of people, that really got to be true.

371
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:11,920
The Internet was so much more polite back when nobody knew what it was.

372
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:20,020
When only, you know, in the 80s and the early 90s, when only people with college educations knew what it was.

373
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:25,580
And now it's like TV, only you can talk back.

374
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:35,080
And there's, no matter what silly notion has entered your head, you can easily find a million other people who agree with you.

375
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:47,900
So I'm, and that would tend to start to explain what I call Trump and the stupid people pride movement.

376
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,440
Because what I keep seeing over...

377
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:55,800
And I'm going to say this over and over again, is, well, he just says what I've been, what everybody's thinking.

378
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,600
Speak for yourself, lady.

379
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:03,120
I say the same things, and I just feel like a stupid idiot saying that.

380
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,760
But when he says it on TV, well, he sounds just so smart.

381
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,180
And I think, I think that the smarty pants that think they're so smart, they ain't so smart.

382
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,780
They're all talking about how, oh, the climate's changing.

383
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,080
Well, duh, summer's hot, winter's cold.

384
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,440
I guess them libtards...

385
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,240
Libertards don't know nothing.

386
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,440
Them smarty pants.

387
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:31,460
And at this point, friends, along with anger being the new slack, I must say that orange is the new pink.

388
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:37,020
Pink being our derogatory term for people we don't agree with.

389
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,860
What you might call squares.

390
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:45,360
Of course, the real point of all this is that you can't judge a book by its cover.

391
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,020
Trading in stereotypes is the dumbest thing you can do.

392
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,080
And yet...

393
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,360
That's what it's come to, apparently.

394
00:31:54,500 --> 00:32:02,060
I have a lot of friends and relatives who are, well, not conservatives with a big C,

395
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,000
but they're probably a lot more conservative than me.

396
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:12,700
And my friend was saying, well, you know, a vote for Trump is a vote against boredom.

397
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,120
Because at least things would shake up.

398
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,740
And I thought...

399
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,400
In world politics...

400
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,820
Boredom is a good thing.

401
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,220
Boredom is what you want.

402
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:29,740
Apparently my friend has not had enough excitement in his life.

403
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,360
I've had a lot of excitement.

404
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,280
Praise boredom!

405
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,820
I love boredom!

406
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,820
Me and that Rincewind guy in those Discworld books.

407
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,980
We love boredom and potatoes.

408
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,560
Bring on the boredom when it comes to world politics.

409
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,980
Yeah, that's fine.

410
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,440
What people really want, I think, is to have a good time.

411
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:50,440


412
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:50,440


413
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:50,440


414
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:58,520
I think is for things not to change, which is why I'm for Havelock Vetinari for World Overlord.

415
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,840
He's the dictator in that...

416
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,500
Benevolent tyrant in the Discworld novels that I love so much.

417
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:12,840
On the other hand, if Bob is who he says he was, Bob's already been World Overlord for some time now.

418
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,460
Nonetheless, we've got this Revenge of the Caveman.

419
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,430
I think somebody else called it.

420
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,510
And, honestly, I think that there's a...

421
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:27,890
The surprise wasn't that they were there.

422
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:37,570
The surprise was that they formed such a big percentage of people who really want to get rid of that boredom.

423
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:45,510
Well, what I think they mean is get rid of all those pesky people who don't look and think just like them.

424
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:49,510
Which is a little bit scary if you're a minority.

425
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:56,310
Subgeniuses are the most understood minority, Philo said.

426
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,830
I still don't understand why he said that.

427
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:02,730
Which makes me feel stupid, but maybe that was his point.

428
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:12,290
We didn't call it Church of the Genius, so me making fun of the stupid People's Pride Party might be considered kind of stupid.

429
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:18,190
The difference is I can spell the phrase, you're stupid.

430
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:23,610
Without using an E in the word stupid.

431
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:29,570
And I wanted to make a big sign that said, you're fired.

432
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,890
Without using any Es.

433
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:43,450
But I think that an incomplete education leaves kind of a trump shaped hole in the brain.

434
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,590
Or any, it doesn't have to be Trump at all.

435
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,330
It could be any kind of strong man.

436
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:53,110
And I'm not singing the praises of Hillary Clinton either.

437
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:57,350
But that's the boredom my friend was talking about.

438
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:02,430
I prefer the boredom myself.

439
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:10,530
There's a leak in the nation's attic a mile wide.

440
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:13,590
It's much bigger than we thought.

441
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:18,250
And the last time I looked, they were neck and neck.

442
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:25,630
I remember the time I made George W. Bush into the President a second time.

443
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:30,450
Because I was so sure that my fellow Americans wouldn't fall for that again.

444
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,350
Boy was I wrong.

445
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,790
And I went and wasted my vote on a third party candidate.

446
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:41,870
And George W. Bush won by that one vote.

447
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:46,710
Of course there was cheating involved and they'll say that on both sides.

448
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,250
But that's what it was.

449
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,330
It was my fault.

450
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:52,270
Don't be like me friends.

451
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:56,270
Get off your butt on that day and go on down there.

452
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:58,330
Even if you think it doesn't make any difference.

453
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:02,250
If you don't vote, you're voting twice for somebody who wants you dead.

454
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:03,610
Seriously.

455
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:09,610
But these people see it seems like they're literally against progress.

456
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:14,890
Because a liberal might like a progressive.

457
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:17,410
Even if a Republican came up with it.

458
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:19,390
Like the Affordable Care Act.

459
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:23,190
Which was actually something Mitt Romney was pushing years ago.

460
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:28,450
Suddenly when Obama decides to do it, then it's Satan incarnate.

461
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:29,810
Go figure.

462
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:37,650
I sometimes wonder if the internet hasn't made democracy into a bad idea.

463
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:43,890
Because it's such a fertile ground for misinformation, disinformation, bigotry.

464
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,850
Narcissism and cowardice.

465
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:51,450
Because you can be anybody you want on the internet.

466
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:55,430
And they're all trumped in the head if you ask me.

467
00:36:55,470 --> 00:37:00,970
And I think people ought to get off their damn phones and get back into meat space.

468
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,850
I've heard that used as an insult.

469
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,650
Oh he's so meat space.

470
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,370
Yeah, I'm a meat space kind of guy.

471
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,870
That's where I was born.

472
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,890
And where most of my fun happens.

473
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,060
Well, I don't know.

474
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,100
Maybe I'm just old.

475
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:23,800
Oh, now here's where I announce the thing that Princess Wee doesn't want me to say every year.

476
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,280
The real title of my sermon.

477
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:35,680
Last year the title was, the secret title, which I revealed in the end, was Astrology and Autism.

478
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:43,240
The secret title of this one was going to be When Psychics Have Car Wrecks.

479
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,920
Okay, we've got 10 minutes.

480
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,060
No, about 20 minutes left.

481
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,880
And that's good because I have somebody else's rant.

482
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,680
I'm going to read to you.

483
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:02,300
I usually don't like to just read, but this is a really good one.

484
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,460
It's not written by me.

485
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:08,420
It's written by the good Reverend Roger of Tucson, Arizona.

486
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:14,100
And you might have heard this on the wonderful weekly.

487
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,000
radio show called The Hour of Slack.

488
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,020
Oh, before I get into that, I almost forgot.

489
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:25,800
Speaking of the elections, are you going to feel embarrassed afterwards no matter what happens?

490
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,140
We've got a solution.

491
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,740
Don't blame me.

492
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,380
I voted for Bob.

493
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,560
This big pin in red, white, and blue.

494
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,080
Don't blame me.

495
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,440
I voted for Bob.

496
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,940
Unfortunately, our shipment did not get here in time.

497
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,080
But if you look at subgenius.com, you'll see that it's a little bit different.

498
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,780
I'm going to go to subgenius.com and poke around a little bit.

499
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:53,260
You'll find in our cafe press shop that you can get 10 of them for $15 or something like that.

500
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,240
So don't waste your vote.

501
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:02,560
But waste your $1.50 or whatever these cost for an excuse.

502
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:03,960
Okay.

503
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:08,480
The rant by the good Reverend Roger is a page and a half long.

504
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,000
It's about Godzilla and things.

505
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:25,540
Distinguished colleagues, the government has been screaming at me for my whole life that crackhead Godzilla is on a bender and is screwing our collective shit royally.

506
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:30,620
When I was a young man, Godzilla was a communist.

507
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,600
Later, Godzilla was a drug-crazed maniac.

508
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,540
Then he was a madman in a turban.

509
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:42,980
Then, just a little over 10 years ago, the government came out and made a big deal out of it.

510
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,060
And told us the truth.

511
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:49,900
As Pogo once said, we have met the enemy and he is us.

512
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:54,140
In short, I'm now told that I am the enemy.

513
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:58,000
That if I talk about the Constitution, I should be watched closely.

514
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:04,960
If I oppose the endless wars we get in, I'm to be put in a dossier and hassled at every opportunity.

515
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:09,520
It turns out that after all these years, I am Godzilla.

516
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,960
And dear friends, you can be Godzilla too.

517
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:19,500
Yes, the government and the electorate that puts up with them is really that sick.

518
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:29,160
But, if I'm Godzilla and I don't want to go to reptile jail or some camp in Guantanamo Bay or the Arctic,

519
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,680
Oh, but you didn't hear that from me.

520
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:35,580
Then I'm going to have to be Godzilla in disguise.

521
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:41,420
Everything, metaphorically, of course, falls down.

522
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,600
Catches fire.

523
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:42,940
And dies.

524
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,260
And sinks into the swamp.

525
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,040
And yet, no giant lizard to be seen.

526
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,500
Everything does come apart one way or the other.

527
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,800
But there's, where's the Godzilla?

528
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,260
Call me the enemy, will ya?

529
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,420
I'll give you the enemy, you swine.

530
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:04,780
And I will not rest until I've penetrated you with my gigantic dinosaur appendage in your ear hole.

531
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:10,520
I'm censoring this slightly for the, those under 40 people here.

532
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:16,480
I was content to sit by and stack up my pitiful pile of filthy lucre.

533
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,000
I was content to run my mouth about you bastards.

534
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,380
But leave it at that.

535
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:25,220
I never even got off my ass about the camp x-ray thing.

536
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,800
Or even Abu Ghraib.

537
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,180
But, as the great Saint Vince once said,

538
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:34,300
If they do it for ya, they'll do it to ya.

539
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,100
And he was, of course, utterly correct.

540
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,900
Everyone believed him.

541
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,500
Him being a holy man of God.

542
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:40,580
Not at all.

543
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:44,100
But we didn't really believe it.

544
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,000
So now, there's armored vehicles.

545
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,460
Lots of armored vehicles.

546
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,900
In Tucson, where this guy lives.

547
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,640
Who the hell needs armored vehicles here?

548
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,940
It's too hot to riot.

549
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:03,500
And I don't see the ghost of Irwin Rommel leading the D.A.K. out of the Santa Ritas any time soon.

550
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,900
I see buses without windows.

551
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,380
And the name Wackenhut on the side in small letters.

552
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:15,140
windowless buses taking people from one prison to another. What are they guilty

553
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:20,540
of? Arizona has a fairly low violent crime rate so how do they have so many

554
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:25,660
people that they have to move three or four buses a day? Oh yeah, they're

555
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:30,960
shipping people to the facility south of Tucson where we store the worst and most

556
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:37,420
violent offenders for being caught with a pocket full of sunshine. Bear in mind

557
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:42,540
they're stacking them six to a two-man cell in that place. This isn't so much

558
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:47,120
punishment for being caught with some weed or happy pills as it is a warning

559
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:53,200
to the rest of us. Stay in line or else go to hell before you die. Although that

560
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:59,260
can be arranged to. All of this may make me sound like an anarchist. I'm not. I am

561
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:04,380
in fact a bit of a statist but a statist who is mad at the state in the same

562
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,260
manner a libertarian would be mad at pay cops

563
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:07,400
and a little bit of a libertarian would be mad at pay cops and a little bit of

564
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:22,980
temperament would be mad at police and that kind of thing. Get many minutes at

565
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:28,000
a regular police station every day and you can't beat them. How can we beat

566
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,380
them, the parent of an average rip man, enough to bring down our safety online

567
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:33,520
council and just sign the inspector. There there, Walter Cnesnics comes to

568
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:33,760
every American state department in the state department. Asthma and

569
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,380
infection, TBI, KIW, it's all kind of on analysis. They can't get sick with

570
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:40,160
Torment your local, state, and federal government.

571
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,020
Not threats.

572
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,600
They know how to deal with threats.

573
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,980
Just abuse.

574
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:45,960
Weird shit.

575
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,280
And more abuse.

576
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:52,780
Write your congressman and tell him he's shit neck.

577
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:54,740
Hadn't heard that one.

578
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:58,460
Call the city offices and tell the comptroller he's a swine.

579
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,320
I'm not calling for action here.

580
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,560
I'm reading this guy's thing.

581
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,180
Prank call the local Wells Fargo bank manager.

582
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,120
You're a pack of creative bastards.

583
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,960
I imagine you can come up with a trick or two.

584
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,760
The thing is, it's not just Congress and the president.

585
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,600
It's the entire system.

586
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,100
Every squirrely little bastard with an ounce of pretend power.

587
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,640
So, be Godzilla.

588
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,240
A compact, quiet version of Godzilla.

589
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:29,680
A velociraptor-sized model.

590
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,420
Eat what you can.

591
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,620
Burn the rest.

592
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,160
And grin through your six-inch face.

593
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:36,560
And fangs.

594
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:40,180
I remain or kill me the good Reverend Roger.

595
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:41,260
Well, no.

596
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,680
He's the good Reverend Roger.

597
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,800
I'm the mean Reverend Stang.

598
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:54,020
And now it is time for me to close the monologue part of the

599
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:59,020
devival by saying, quit your job, jack off.

600
00:44:59,320 --> 00:44:59,700
No.

601
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,680
Quit your slob.

602
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,340
Repent.

603
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:05,480
Quit your job.

604
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,160
Slop.

605
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,780
Back off while you still know how.

606
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,880
Question authority.

607
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,760
Or else.

608
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,800
Bob is not the answer, friends, and neither is anything else.

609
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:22,080
And we only have one rule in this church, which is, pardon my language,

610
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:25,140
but fuck them if they can't take a joke.

611
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:31,760
And if we can't focus, focus if we can't take a joke ourselves.

612
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:36,000
And that brings me now to the famous,

613
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:39,360
Q&A, which I hope there are some Qs.

614
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,500
And I hope that they're really loud.

615
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:46,580
Because my hearing has not gotten any better.

616
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,960
In fact, it's a lot worse.

617
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,760
Can you translate?

618
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:55,100
The one thing, friends, that you can do is run up to the stage and yell.

619
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,580
You know, at X Day we have a thing called Ask Dr. Howell,

620
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:03,720
where you give Dr. Howell a dollar and he'll answer any question.

621
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,540
Pretty damn well.

622
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,160
Well.

623
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,220
Well, this is tell Reverend Stein.

624
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:12,360
If you want to throw a dollar at me, you can really tell me off.

625
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,080
But you can also ask.

626
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,220
Usually the questions are the best part.

627
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,380
Max has asked a question.

628
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,200
Are we not met?

629
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,760
That's a good question.

630
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,360
Those are good peanuts, too.

631
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:39,740
Was that from Max Darkpaw?

632
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,000
Did you say?

633
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:45,180
The question is, are we not men?

634
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:53,120
A question first asked by the animal people on Dr. Moreau's island.

635
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,680
And they actually were not men.

636
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,340
They were hideous travesties of humanity

637
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:06,120
made by a mad scientist into shambling human life.

638
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:06,720
They were not figures.

639
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,620
Not man.

640
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,360
Not beast.

641
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:12,060
Thing.

642
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:13,560
Thing.

643
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,040
Are we not men?

644
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:25,800
Using men as a general term for humanity, I'm assuming, and not the ones with peeners.

645
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,600
The answer is no.

646
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,180
We are subgeniuses.

647
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,520
We are not.

648
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,680
We are human.

649
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,120
Yes.

650
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,420
Why not both?

651
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,320
We can't escape from that.

652
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:43,080
But we're also subgeniuses.

653
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:49,440
Whereas the non-subgeniuses, yeah, they are men.

654
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:55,820
The subgeniuses are men plus or men minus.

655
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:59,260
The women even more so.

656
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,240
I'll just say that to be polite or funny or something.

657
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:06,160
But we're not subgeniuses.

658
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,620
We're not men.

659
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:07,800
We're not men.

660
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,540
Are we not men?

661
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:16,700
That question was then asked by the great band Devo, who also, like those animal people,

662
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:24,680
were wondering, if there is no pain, then is there still law?

663
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:33,660
You see, the house of pain is the only reason the laws are obeyed.

664
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,380
Or is it?

665
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:38,100
Are the laws there because they make sense?

666
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:43,580
Or is it just because somebody gets a kick off of putting you in the house of pain?

667
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,540
It is still a very good question.

668
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:50,400
Ask yourself that question on voting day.

669
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:51,900
Are we not men?

670
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,680
Okay, another one.

671
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,420
What do the UFOs really look like?

672
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,320
What do the UFOs really look like?

673
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,360
Well, they're not men.

674
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:04,720
They're not women.

675
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:04,720


676
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:12,340
So I'm going to talk about the X-ists of subgenius prophecy, unidentified flying objects.

677
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,520
Of course, they're just simply unidentified.

678
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:15,700
Screw them.

679
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:16,300
Who cares?

680
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,540
They're not even going to say who they are.

681
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:21,220
And they're the kind that crash their saucers.

682
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,940
We're not talking about the Grays.

683
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:27,620
What do the X-ists look like?

684
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:30,960
Anything you want them to.

685
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,120
That is the really weird.

686
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:34,360


687
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:42,940
thing about X day. You're limited only by your imagination. If you join the

688
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:48,160
church, which can happen today for 35 bucks and the membership pack is really

689
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:55,520
it'll keep you busy for a long time. You'll get your 35 worth all right. But

690
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:07,800
the again, what you have to know when X day comes what is it you really want? Are

691
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:14,040
you limited to just things like a new car or a better job? That might be all you

692
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:20,480
get. So don't let your imagination be limited. Those aliens can look like

693
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:25,360
anything you want them to. I might want them to look like scary monsters

694
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:31,780
for a while and then like the real birdie girls or something. I don't know I'm

695
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:38,140
many people fantasize about X day for the revenge fantasy. They finally got

696
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:42,660
power and then get back at all those people that made them feel small. Some of

697
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:47,760
us are kind of all kind of already got our revenge by the fact of still being

698
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:54,040
alive and having slack. So we're just thinking of how much more fun can I have

699
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,340
and what can we do to travel?

700
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:55,340


701
00:50:55,340 --> 00:51:01,920
we preserve from planet Earth that's worth preserving? Well, if X-Day had happened last

702
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,160
weekend, we'd be on our escape vessel right now because we promised y'all a star would,

703
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:12,560
and we would have lifted up all of Wisteria. Now, I could combine it with the Grand Canyon,

704
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:18,660
which I have dibs on. And because, see, I want to, I'm more concerned about collecting all the

705
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:24,720
cool stuff. You can have the robots replicate anything, but the originals are going to be worth

706
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:33,240
something. Money won't be worth anything, but, you know, people still have that need to

707
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:38,200
compete on some level. I don't know. We got another one.

708
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,600
Can we ever expect that Connie will go into politics?

709
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:49,940
Can we ever expect that Connie will go into politics? That is, well, how do we know she hasn't?

710
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,820
How do we know she hasn't? She's pretty tricky.

711
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:54,700
Connie...

712
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:54,700


713
00:51:54,700 --> 00:52:00,780
Connie is Bob's wife, or actually, more accurate to say, Bob is Connie's husband.

714
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:09,300
She's really the one wearing the pants in that family and the various other kinky things.

715
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:15,800
She's the one with the brains. Bob isn't smart. This isn't Church of the Genius. Bob's just lucky.

716
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:22,760
He's the luckiest entity in the universe, but she's the one with the brains. If I were you,

717
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:24,020
I'd be real scared.

718
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:32,220
I'd be real scared if Connie Dobbs got into politics. She'd talk about being able to tell people what they most want to hear,

719
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:40,580
but with her, you wouldn't even be suspicious. She's learned from Bob how to tell people what they most want to hear.

720
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:44,780
Now, some of us, when you hear somebody telling you, like that old lady,

721
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:50,260
when Donald Trump just says all the things I'm thinking, it sounds so smart when he says it, it sounds so stupid when I say it.

722
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,200
Well, it is stupid.

723
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,320
It's unbelievably stupid, but

724
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:02,140
if you, it's actually very, very dumb

725
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,140
to seek out people who are telling you what you already wanted to hear.

726
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,400
That's how you get dumber.

727
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:19,100
That's why people who were born rich are often the dumbest people in the universe. They don't have to face

728
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:23,640
consequences of their actions. They can afford to be stupid.

729
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:29,900
The most dangerous thing on the planet, short of some viruses, is a rich drunk.

730
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:36,860
So, I used to, the reason I say that is I once had a job

731
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:38,360
moonlighting

732
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:43,440
videotaping debutante parties for the richest people in Dallas.

733
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:49,060
That's why I know that the deadliest monster out there is a drunk rich bastard.

734
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:53,960
So, I'm not sure if that answered the question.

735
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:58,100
Or anything, but I hate rich people.

736
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,620
Well, now if you were rich, would you still hate rich people? Yes.

737
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,440
I'm not so sure.

738
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:11,720
I would love to find out, and you can help by checking out our wonderful swag table over there,

739
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,780
run by the beautiful princess,

740
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:20,680
we are doe, queen of all the UFOs, the ones we don't identify, that aren't identified.

741
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:24,000
If we could only figure out what planet she was from,

742
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:27,180
then we could find out whether we still hate rich people when we're rich.

743
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:32,280
But really friends, you know what? I am rich. I'm

744
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,320
richer than the richest king of

745
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:35,860
previous

746
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,600
millennia. I have access to aspirin.

747
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:49,440
I was vaccinated as a child. I have air conditioning if I want to pay for it.

748
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:53,840
I've got things that the richest and knowledge.

749
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:57,100
Unbelievable knowledge and disinformation.

750
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:01,000
And friends, I suspect if you were to sit and count your blessings,

751
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:03,760
you would actually run out of fingers pretty quick.

752
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:10,620
We all have problems, and those are probably not going to go away.

753
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:14,680
But a lot of people focus on those and

754
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:21,980
forget to count their blessings on their little fingers and toes and their calculator.

755
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,000
Because that's the problem.

756
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,960
And that's easy for me to say, because I really did get slack.

757
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:33,440
As well I should, because I busted ass for that bastard J.R. Bob Dobbs.

758
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,640
He still owes me a lot of money too.

759
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,760
But at least I got the slack.

760
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:41,500
And I got to come to Starwood 26 times without having to pay.

761
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,360
I even used to get paid.

762
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,680
I would get paid now, but honestly,

763
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:51,600
Starwood's not as big as it used to be after that identity theft.

764
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,740
We lost a lot of...

765
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:55,500
income.

766
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,620
And then when Jeff died...

767
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:02,560
Friends, you don't know how much that guy was putting in out of his own pocket.

768
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,040
But we found out.

769
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:08,580
That's why things have changed a little bit.

770
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:12,600
But they haven't changed much, and we still get slack at Starwood.

771
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,580
We still have the bonfire tonight.

772
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:19,420
And I'm going to be off work almost instantly,

773
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,760
which means I can frop up again.

774
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,520
Oh, one more question.

775
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,980
One more question, which is, what is the question?

776
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,020
What is the question?

777
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,540
Well, that is the question, isn't it?

778
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:33,760
And I have a question myself.

779
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:36,560
What is this Walkers for Trump thing here?

780
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,340
Oh, the Walkers for Trump.

781
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:46,240
Well, first I have to mention that I had a question for Dr. Timothy Leary.

782
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:50,100
The very first time I opened for him, I didn't really know him very well.

783
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,340
And... at all.

784
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:57,660
And I shyly said, I hate to bug you, but I have one question.

785
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:00,480
How do you deal with the input?

786
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,180
And he went...

787
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,700
Well, now that's the question, isn't it?

788
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:05,820
That is the question.

789
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:08,540
That's why I said, well, that is the question.

790
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:13,820
I just was repeating Tim Leary's question to my question.

791
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,960
Now, as for Walkers for Trump...

792
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:17,580
...

793
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,440
I was just really proud of this gag.

794
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:29,600
And this was my costume for X-Day at our theme-less costume ball.

795
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:37,540
And I'd originally had the idea of just walking around with this zombie mask.

796
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:42,740
I started watching that show Walking Dead ten years after everybody else saw it.

797
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:45,780
And they call zombies walkers in that.

798
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,560
And I thought it would be cool to watch that.

799
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:51,780
And I walked around dressed like a zombie with a sign that said, Walkers for Trump.

800
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,240
And then I stumbled upon this thing in our basement.

801
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:56,560
And I went, alright.

802
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,620
Then another friend said, spray paint it white and say it's White Walkers for Trump.

803
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:08,900
I didn't get it because it'll be ten years before I start watching Game of Thrones.

804
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,800
Which apparently those are characters in Game of Thrones.

805
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:13,700
White Walkers.

806
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:15,620
But, yeah, this is...

807
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:19,600
These are horrible.

808
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,520
Walkers for Trump!

809
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:39,260
Ta Da!

810
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,000
Hey, that works pretty good, that ta-da thing.

811
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:46,640
Yeah!

812
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,760
Thank you, folks. We're out of here. It's dinner time.

813
00:58:52,300 --> 00:59:02,020
If you see a flying demon that sounds like angry bees in the sky tonight, it might be that, but it might be my camera drone,

814
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:10,260
which I'm going to try to judiciously, carefully fly and get a picture of the bonfire from up kind of high.

815
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,960
And hopefully it'll be far enough away from anybody that you won't even see it.

816
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,940
And it won't see anybody's faces. Don't worry about that.

817
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:25,160
Price Bob! Price Starwood!

818
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:31,460
And if you're not a member of the church yet, oh, there's many more secrets you can learn.

819
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:34,840
Some of them in meat space.

820
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:38,620
Cut.

821
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:44,940
And dear friends, this year's Starwood is from July 11th.

822
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,660
To the 17th.

823
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:48,400
And I, for one, can't wait.

824
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:57,820
I'm going to be doing a stage rant there and a pufferdom psychedelic extravaganza with the band Mayan Ruins.

825
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:02,560
More details at StarwoodFestival.com.

826
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:04,480
Praise Bob.

827
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:10,420
Friends, are you a subgenius minister yet?

828
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:14,200
Have you joined the Church of the Subgenius?

829
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:14,940
And by that, I mean, are you a subgenius minister?

830
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:24,580
And by that, I mean, actually send in your $35 payable by PayPal or credit card on subgenius.com,

831
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:29,040
where it says become an ordained minister or where it says stores.

832
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:36,380
And even if you have, do you have your well-made Bob t-shirt from anticonformity.com?

833
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:40,380
Do you have your Arise DVD?

834
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:43,240
Sure, you can watch it on the internet.

835
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:47,120
It's not the same.

836
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:48,520
And it isn't the same.

837
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:55,620
It hasn't been kissed by the lips of Princess Wee, who kisses every copy of Arise that goes out.

838
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,260
And I sign every copy of Book of the Subgenius.

839
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,300
How about that?

840
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,000
You can still get those from us.

841
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:06,120
But yes, the $35 for the minister's pack, you really ought to think about it, folks.

842
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:12,620
You don't have to meet any subgeniuses ever.

843
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,920
But you will have to.

844
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:15,780
You will have that option.

845
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:19,220
You can't come to X Day unless you're a member.

846
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:26,920
You can't go to the members only kind of smarty pants internet forum called Scrub Genius.

847
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:32,340
I do a lot more there than on Facebook.

848
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:34,840
Because Facebook's just a bunch of gimme bobs.

849
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:36,480
People who can't even spell Bob's name right.

850
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:37,640
Do you know that, Princess Wee?

851
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:40,520
They can't even spell Bob's name right, half of them.

852
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,400
They leave off the quotes.

853
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,900
Oh yeah, gimme bobs.

854
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:45,580
You can tell.

855
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:47,500
It's so easy to tell.

856
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:53,360
Anyway, friends, we'll be back next week with more X Day recordings.

857
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,340
And hopefully with the lonesome cowboy.

858
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,380
Hopefully he won't be lonesome next week.

859
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,920
Rock house old Dammit, do it over there.

860
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,440
Dammit, the hound dog's doing fine.

861
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,380
Well, thank you.

862
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:05,400
Good night.

863
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:06,780
And praise Bob.
