1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,980
I think we're in big trouble.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,680
A few details about the operation.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,900
The operation underway tonight, taking place in the pre-dawn darkness of the Persian Gulf, involves...

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,620
The subgenius.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,320
Powerhouse.

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,160
Watch.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,460
Can you take the radio along?

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,360
Radio along.

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,180
Norm says four Iraqi nuclear reactors have been crippled.

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,820
Sales are also up.

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,080
Merchants say it's not the lunatic fringe stocking up.

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,880
It's a cross-section of men and women looking for protection.

13
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:43,040
In New York, this store used to keep gas masks on hand for props and movie sets.

14
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,640
The fear fueled the sale of 500 masks over the past couple of days.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,040
Bring out your dead!

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,540
Bring out your dead!

17
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,160
Want to know more about talking to your children?

18
00:00:59,180 --> 00:00:59,760
About AIDS?

19
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,240
Send for a free information guide.

20
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,560
...a cabin up in the hills.

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,960
I'm going to try to wait this out.

22
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,240
...toward Haiti.

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,840
What he plans to do to force Haiti's brutal military to step down and deal with Haitian refugees fleeing to America.

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,560
Should ducks in Dallas County be saved or killed to stop the spread of a deadly plague?

25
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,500
Join us for the News 8 Update at 10.

26
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:29,160
Although city and government spokespersons vehemently deny it, reliable sources continue to report to news radio that troops opened fire earlier today on unarmed pedestrians attempting to flee New York.

27
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,160


28
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,160


29
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,160


30
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,420
...by way of the Lincoln Tunnel.

31
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,440
As many as 60 persons may have been killed, with hundreds wounded.

32
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,780
Although travel to some of the outer boroughs is still possible, news radio advises you to stay off the streets.

33
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,960
...under way, and that doesn't mean that people are breathing any easier.

34
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,260
Gas mask sales are booming.

35
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,760
CNN headline news.

36
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,740
And the great showdown has begun.

37
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,720
Quoting further here, the glorious sons of our nation.

38
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,920
Uh, he said, uh, sorry.

39
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:06,420
He said he was addressing the glorious sons of our nation and said the battle was one of justice against vice, of the believers against the infidels.

40
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,880
Two hours, there are new reports of alerts in Saudi Arabia, which is possibly undergoing a missile attack.

41
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,980
Very busy update desk too, Chuck.

42
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,280
Hello there, this is Ray Flowers on Speak Your Peace.

43
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,260
I guess this morning there's only one topic of conversation.

44
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,980
There have been some horror stories about the army clamping down on everything.

45
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,140
The army?

46
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:32,740
Just be patient with me. Remember, I'm running the show all by myself. Everyone else called in sick.

47
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,360
The numbers are the same as always, though. 555-TALK and 555-CHAT. So let's go.

48
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,700
Hello there, this is Ray Flowers, and it's time to Speak Your Peace.

49
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,640
I'm calling from Portsmouth, Ray.

50
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,440
What's your name, Portsmouth?

51
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,140
Leonora.

52
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:52,680
Listen, Ray, I just want everyone to know that there are soldiers burning bodies across the state line in Kittery.

53
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,680
I have my gas mask on.

54
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,660
Journalists watching the missiles immediately put on their gas masks.

55
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:06,700
Again, it's not a very similar to the first one in which the Patriots rocketed overhead and intercepted the Scud, which were aimed, we understand, at...

56
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,340
In the battle of radios, we should probably also report that...

57
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:21,320
Meanwhile, in the People's Republic of China, agitation continues to foment and burble up through the repressed psychic substratum of the Chinese people.

58
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,680
This just in on the teletype.

59
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,560
Tibet has invaded China.

60
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,600
Yes, the UN is debating...

61
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:40,520
The Dalai Lama, at the head of an international force of mercenaries, has circled the capital of Beijing and threatens to subdue the country by tomorrow afternoon at the latest.

62
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:49,140
The UN is deliberating over possible sanctions that can force this terrible breaking down of the world's new order.

63
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,120
And we'll have the latest in the sports news in a moment.

64
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,660
And we'll be back on Sunday.

65
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,280
On the stupid four-hour radio news.

66
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,140
This just in.

67
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:08,460
In the fiercest engagement so far this year, units of the 23rd Pacific Combat Group inflicted severe losses of men and material on Chinese aqua bandits in mid-ocean this morning.

68
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,700
Our own casualties are reported light.

69
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:19,780
However, Chairman Yong of China today sent a personal message of congratulations to the daring sailors of the blood-red banner flotilla,

70
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,640
who yesterday inflicted great damage in men and material on the Chinese people.

71
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:29,520
And they also sent a message to the imperialist aggressor, claiming that their casualties were very light.

72
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:45,040
However, friends, just remember that lonely on the edge of space, patrol pilot Eugene Flood and his co-pilot Bob Dobbs keep watch and ward over the security of your homes and families,

73
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,660
thanks to this radio station.

74
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:53,320
Weapons capable of taking out from orbit anything from a single boatload of saboteurs.

75
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,280
To an entire megalopolis lie under their hands.

76
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:06,600
And you can keep Bob up there in orbit and off of your back porch by calling 8-1-1.

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,660
And they talk about peace.

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,500
And they talk about peace and justice.

79
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,840
You see, it goes back to what I tell you before.

80
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:20,400
When I was in college, during the late 60s and early 70s,

81
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,960
when I was in a place...

82
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,300
These people in the street that are yelling,

83
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:23,300


84
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:23,680
they're saying,

85
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm in the bottom, I'm in the bottom.

86
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,660
They're saying,

87
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,720
these people are in America,

88
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,720
these are African Americans.

89
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,520
That is a genocide.

90
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,260
And George Bush is at the forefront of it.

91
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:38,340
And it's absolutely deplorable that he used Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday to start this war.

92
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,080
Next, Nicosia.

93
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,820
Now, radio message, shortly after the Gulf War began,

94
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,480
you watched Saddam Hussein call US President George Bush a hypocritical criminal.

95
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,880
Earlier, Saddam Hussein,

96
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,020
or rather,

97
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,320
what appears to have been a recording of Saddam Hussein,

98
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,840
was broadcast on this frequency.

99
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,160
If it quacks like a duck,

100
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,920
if it walks like a duck,

101
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,840
and if the water runs off its back,

102
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,740
it's a duck.

103
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,160
On the Pentagon, the AP's Thelma Labreck reports that the Iraqis have only seen the beginning.

104
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,120
One enemy machine destroyed.

105
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,040
Enemy now discharging heavy black smoke in direction of...

106
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,020
This is Newark, New Jersey.

107
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,560
This is Newark, New Jersey.

108
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,380
Warning.

109
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,740
Poisonous black smoke pouring in from Jersey marshes.

110
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,380
Reaches South Street.

111
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,980
Gas masks useless.

112
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,800
Urge populations to move into open spaces.

113
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,260
Automobiles use Route 7, 23, 24.

114
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,560
Avoid congested areas.

115
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,140
Smoke now spreading over Raymond Boulevard.

116
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,560
Of course, that's never stopped the real patriots among us, has it?

117
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,060
You try to hang in there, Lenora.

118
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,060
I'm trying, Ray.

119
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,840
But have you ever smelled bodies on fire?

120
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,420
I can't say that I have.

121
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,800
It's awful, Ray. It's just...

122
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,120
You just try to hang in there, hon.

123
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,460
This is Ray Flowers. You're on the air, and it's time to speak your piece.

124
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,400
Ray, uh, first of all,

125
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,320
I just want to tell you that I love your show, Ray.

126
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,520
What does that mean?

127
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,740
...desert storm...

128
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,680
All of them early in the society already on the United States...

129
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,180
There has been a series of militaristic songs and prayers,

130
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,300
and just a short while ago,

131
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,280
the radio began broadcasting a chant,

132
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,380
Ado Akba, God is Great.

133
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,980
That is one of the war cries of the Muslims who fight the infidels.

134
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,520
And this just in.

135
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,860
Frenzied mobs in Tokyo last night burned the effigy of the emperor

136
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,640
in protest against his intention to abdicate.

137
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,540
A spokesman declared that if he does resist,

138
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,480
he will sign his throne, they will recognize Mr. Oyoshita,

139
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,300
head of one of the country's oldest noble families,

140
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,020
as his successor, and will refuse to cooperate with the new government.

141
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,640
Victims of the rioting are already being described as martyrs.

142
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,680
And that's post office boxing.

143
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,660
807 Glen Rose, Texas.

144
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,460
76043.

145
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,240
Bob?

146
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,400
How much money do you need to prove something?

147
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,200
A lot of money.

148
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,560
The money you need to prove something is the money that you can take to make America a better place.

149
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,220
The most important funding for this look back at one of the most dramatic events in 20th century history

150
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,260
is provided by General Dynamics.

151
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:41,980
General Dynamics, a strong company for a strong country.

152
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,240
You say you saw these GIs gunning down unarmed civilians?

153
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,740
Open in the name of the United States government.

154
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,200
Tell you what, Portland, it looks like the Marines have landed.

155
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,120
They don't look too happy.

156
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,120
This is a joke.

157
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,480
Right? I mean, this has got to be a joke.

158
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,080
I don't think so, Fred. I really don't think so.

159
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,220
Hi there. You're on the air.

160
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,640
Greg, you all right?

161
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,360
Well, to tell you the truth, honey, it doesn't look real good for the kid right now.

162
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,820
Several soldiers have just broken into the studio.

163
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,920
They're fully armed, and they're dressed in some kind of protective clothing.

164
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,240
They're wearing respirators on their faces.

165
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,100
Hey, Bluto, you ever heard of a little number called Freedom of Speech?

166
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,340
Bill of Rights? Any of that ring a bell?

167
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:31,000
Folks, I've just been ordered by my uninvited fascist guest to shut down, and I've refused.

168
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,220
I think...

169
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,960
President Bush told a television audience the world could wait no longer.

170
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,720
We are determined to knock out Saddam Hussein's nuclear bomb potential.

171
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,220
This virus is much more advanced, and we can go on and on.

172
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,700
But the Bible says some trust in chariots, some in horses.

173
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,580
The beginning is a very delicate time.

174
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,460
Peter, I am looking directly west from our hotel now,

175
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,280
and throughout the entire sky, there are flashes of light.

176
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,780
Something is definitely underway here.

177
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,380
Something is going on.

178
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,380
I must... I must...

179
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,280
I must... seize the power in the cylinder.

180
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,980
No, no, not the cylinder. Don't open the cylinder.

181
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,820
I have it now.

182
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,400
If he uses the cylinder, we will escalate the war.

183
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,180
I have unscrewed the caps.

184
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,480
We are going up the war escalator.

185
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,080
It's hard to read the ancient hieroglyphics on the top.

186
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,080
He's activating the...

187
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,420
...lead them to true peace.

188
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,880
The hieroglyphics. It's not true which way I should turn this.

189
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,120
I'll try to the left.

190
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,080
The planet Arrakis.

191
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,740
There we go.

192
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,180
On the planet Arrakis, yes.

193
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,400
My God, look over there.

194
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,440
It's the sandworms.

195
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,960
There's a little smoovy here. What are you doing?

196
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,180
Sorry, I hate to be the first one to tell you, but you got sandworms.

197
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,520
Oh, man.

198
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,640
Worst case I've ever seen.

199
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,440
Downwind, boy.

200
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,720
And so becoming a social undesirable can warp your entire life.

201
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,020
With some, it's sandworms.

202
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,300
With others, it's personal uncleanliness.

203
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,520
And thus begins the original one and only live subgenius Albert Slack

204
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,540
brought to you in memory of the ground war fought with sandworms.

205
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,840
You are about to experience a full-length subgenius show.

206
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,820
It means stereophonic sound.

207
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,220
Sound.

208
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:47,220


209
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,600
So relax, sit back, and enjoy our feature presentation.

210
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,100
Presented the way it was meant to be heard.

211
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,980
If your brain should lather to the front of your head and explode to your eyeballs,

212
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,660
do not head over. This is completely normal.

213
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,240
Long live the succotash suckers. Death to the onion eaters.

214
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,480
Long live King Hussein, the almighty vulture of this country.

215
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,260
Vulture?

216
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,220
To all intents and purposes,

217
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,020
it was nonexistent in this crucial phase of the war.

218
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,840
The wave of American warplanes has been continuing to bring devastation.

219
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,060
Darkman! He's coming!

220
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,360
He's closer now!

221
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,180
The Darkman!

222
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,040
Once more, that's Bob at...

223
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,240
P.O. Box 807.

224
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,400
Glen Rose, Texas.

225
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,260
76043.

226
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,900
Which means there's no need for you to knuckle under to anybody from now on.

227
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,220
With your bare hands, with a knife, with an axe or a broadsword,

228
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,420
with a narrow sword, with a projectile sidearm, a longarm or spraygun,

229
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,560
with a bolt gun, a rocket launcher, with pocket or non-pocket nukes,

230
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:13,020
with chemical explosives, with instant or delayed time bombs, with gas,

231
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:17,860
with infectious bacteria, with hot iron or razors or poison, or a club or a rock,

232
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,520
with a lance or a mace or a book of matches,

233
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,360
with thermite or acid, with your teeth or your nails, or hypodermic,

234
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:34,860
or a diademic with a flame thrower, or a kitchen carver, or a length of rope,

235
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,520
or a hammer, or a belt, or a chisel, or a boot, or a bath of water,

236
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,000
or a modified domestic laser, or a quarterstaff, or a broken bow,

237
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,360
or a bottle, or a bucket of cement, or an ordinary door or window,

238
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:51,220
or a staircase, or a pillow, or a cooking pan, or a long hair,

239
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:55,480
or a sewing needle, or a splinter, or a bottle of medicine,

240
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,080
you can give those humans a taste of their own medicine.

241
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,900
And he's been drinking so much caffeine every day.

242
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:25,320
Put it like this, some trust in F-15 jet fighters,

243
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:32,060
some trust in aircraft carriers, some trust in sophisticated surveillance

244
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:36,000
like AWACS planes and modern equipment,

245
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,960
but we will remember the name of the Lord our God.

246
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,000
I thank God for sophisticated weapons.

247
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:47,280
Weapons that can protect our interests and our soldiers.

248
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,820
But that's not where my faith is.

249
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,520
My faith is in God.

250
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,780
Yes, dear friend.

251
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,240
My God, I think we've got incoming planes.

252
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,320
Okay, run the hole.

253
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,060
What a turkey. Our own technology can run that stuff.

254
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,460
Get them, boys!

255
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,440
They took out those turkey choppers.

256
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,020
Space bleed kit!

257
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,180
That's right.

258
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,960
Hey, I've got my APHE-EM10 rifle grenade handy.

259
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,100
What you need is your T-33 Scottox trainer, Tal.

260
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,500
The bombardment has started.

261
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,520
They're beginning with the artillery at the rate.

262
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,580
Work out with ferry hydraulics.

263
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,920
Commence firing on the hour.

264
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,960
These rounds are falling short at the moment,

265
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:34,120
but as the range increases, the hapless enemy is going to find itself

266
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,720
peppered by salty dashes of high-heavy artillery.

267
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,480
More of what?

268
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,600
Or its high, high heave for the field artillery.

269
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,420
The TOS, which gives the access user internet...

270
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,620
Live from Sandcastle Stadium in Baghdad, it's time for Monday Night Hardball.

271
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,980
Good evening, everybody. I'm Jim McVeigh.

272
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,600
And I'm Don McKay, welcoming you to World In Your Face Monday Night Hardball.

273
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,800
Tonight, two teams locked in heated combat for world domination

274
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,060
are going head to head as the Iraqi Jihad Joes under coach Saddam Hussein

275
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,300
take on the defending champions, the Fighting Doughboys of the U.S. of A.

276
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,940
under head coach George Bush.

277
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,540
You know, Jim, this is going to be the big test of the season for Bush here today,

278
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,300
and it has been a long one.

279
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,800
He's had that problem with his son Neil and the whole SNL-CIA story,

280
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,200
the read-my-lips tax debacle, Chief Justice Souter...

281
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,440
Not to mention the Wimp Factor Syndrome, Don.

282
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,720
That's right, Jim. But as they say, everybody loves a winner,

283
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,400
and there would be nothing better for Bush's image at home

284
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,380
than a big victory at Sandcastle Stadium today.

285
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,680
Yes, the man known to his players as Mr. President certainly has a lot to prove here,

286
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,760
and I must say...

287
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,960
This looks like war.

288
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,360
Uh-huh.

289
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,860
I mean it, folks. There is so much pride here at stake

290
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,160
that somebody could really get hurt.

291
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,140
This is going to be smash-mouth warfare at its very best.

292
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,780
Folks, we'll be back to take a look at the Jihad Joes lineup

293
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,400
after these words from Bud Roe Beer.

294
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,540
Make mine a Bud Roe

295
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,620
The official beer of the U.S. Army

296
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,920
Make mine a Bud Roe

297
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,060
I'll be there with a can of Bud Roe

298
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,520
Fight to win and win to fight

299
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,640
Ninety-nine calories taste just right

300
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,660
If you get back home

301
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,780
Have a Bud Roe on me

302
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,300
Bud Roe Beer, the official beer of the U.S. Army

303
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,940
and proud sponsor of Monday Night Hardball.

304
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,400
If you get back home, have a Bud Roe on me.

305
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,820
We're back live at Sandcastle Stadium in Baghdad here

306
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,480
where this long-awaited matchup is about to get underway.

307
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,500
Coach Bush's Fighting Doughboys have elected to kick off,

308
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,260
so let's take a look at Coach Hussain's defensive line.

309
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,980
Well, Jim, as you know, the Iraqi Jihad Joes

310
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,160
coming to this game is a bit of a wild card.

311
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,020
You know, they bullied their way to the top of the Middle Eastern Conference,

312
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,480
leaving a trail of blood and tears behind them.

313
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,180
They're dangerous, they're unpredictable,

314
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,580
and Coach Hussain has literally whipped these boys

315
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,480
into a fever pitch for this game.

316
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,900
So, all though willing, they're sure to have a few surprises lined up for us here today.

317
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,540
Not to mention the press he's been getting the past few months.

318
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,960
Is he going to use the bomb? Isn't he going to use the bomb?

319
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,260
Does he even have a bomb?

320
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,440
I don't know if I've ever witnessed a game with such preliminary speculation and uncertainty.

321
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,800
Well, this isn't called the Game of the Millennium for nothing, Jim.

322
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,580
Oh, excuse me. That's right. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

323
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:37,260
Right now, let's go down on the battlefield for an up close and personal with Rashida.

324
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,480
Rashad Rashad.

325
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:43,840
Hi, guys. This is Rashida Rashad Rashad on the field with a fellow that,

326
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,260
well, just being able to introduce him makes me proud to be in this business.

327
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:55,120
Drafted right out of high school, this young phenom has literally captured the hearts of the entire USA.

328
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,000
Jimmy Hoghead Jackson.

329
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,640
Hoghead, what do you have to say for yourself?

330
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,060
Well, I'd just like to say hi to my mom and my girlfriend.

331
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,960
And listen, all you folks at home, don't worry.

332
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,040
We're going to be kicking some Iraqi butt all over the stadium.

333
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,740
That's the spirit, Hoghead. So what do you...

334
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,820
You all right, ma'am? Here. Want some Frog Aid?

335
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:21,060
Thanks. Frog Aid, official thirst quench beverage of Monday Night Hardball.

336
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,020
So what do you think it's going to be like out there, Hoghead?

337
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,500
Well, they've had us on the virtual reality simulator for quite a few weeks now.

338
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,860
So I guess it'll be like a big video game without the quarters.

339
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,060
That's a pretty good analogy.

340
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,020
Well, I'm not a big fan of the

341
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,100
Well, I'm not a big fan of the

342
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:58,460
I'm sure she'll have a nice cold bud roe waiting for you when you get home.

343
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,760
That too, ma'am.

344
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,100
Back to you, Doc.

345
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,160
Sorry, folks. Gee, I don't know what this is.

346
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,020
Must be something in them mic cables here.

347
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,640
Or the water.

348
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:17,640
By the way, Don, Jimmy Hoghead Jackson was voted Zao Chemical Offensive Player of the Game.

349
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:22,640
Zao Chemical, maker of those new biodegradable body bags, will hopefully be seeing an action soon.

350
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,540
Remember, when you need it now, it's Zao.

351
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:32,800
Well, let's take a look at the strategies we might be seeing throughout today's little skirmish.

352
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,720
George Bush, the beleaguered coach of the Fighting Doughboys,

353
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,420
is a man who cannot afford to back down.

354
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,780
He certainly can't, Don.

355
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,080
The team itself has had its share of problems these past few years.

356
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,800
They're still the dominant force to be reckoned with in the Western Hemisphere Division,

357
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,800
but more and more of their victories have been clouded by scandal and intrigue.

358
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,700
So, if there ever was a time to...

359
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,540
George Bush and the Doughboys really need to pull one out for the record books here to...

360
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,500
But let's look at Coach Hussain.

361
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,600
Now, here's a guy who's a real animal.

362
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,540
I mean, you almost have to respect the guy.

363
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,000
One other coach would have the moxie to come right out and say,

364
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,100
OK, come at me. Hit me with your worst.

365
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,460
Not only will I hit you right back,

366
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,180
but my first strike will be at a team in a whole separate conference.

367
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,440
You're talking about the Israeli wandering Jews, right?

368
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,920
Exactly, Don. You don't think he'll do whatever it takes to win ugly?

369
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:31,320
Just look at how utterly ruthless he's been when it comes to making cuts on his own team.

370
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,940
He's definitely a worthy opponent.

371
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,700
Hey, with all that said, I think we're going to have to go.

372
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:35,700


373
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,440
Yeah, it's all that talk of us...

374
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,200
Oh, God.

375
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,440
Secret weapon!

376
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,460
Yes, Monday Night Hardball, there, dear friends, by...

377
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,520
Who is that by?

378
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,440
World In Your Face.

379
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,460
Yes, a comedy group out of San Francisco.

380
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:13,600
rolled in your face and have hold the conspiracy has been celebrating the D

381
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:20,740
day orgy this week so we thought we'd shake the moths off of the Gulf War you

382
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:29,960
remember that was I know it's kind of old hat it's just another old miniseries

383
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:39,260
now like Shogun or something but you know what the heck it could happen again

384
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:46,900
and again and again and again by the way before I forget this is Ron

385
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:57,380
slave in the background recorded at the sonic disturbance festival probably in

386
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:57,940
Cleveland

387
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:05,360
yeah the collage that we've been listening to and more of which it will

388
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:13,280
be coming up but of course from old hour of slack collages of more stuff plus the

389
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:23,940
tube neck news material from Orson Welles and GE a lot of KPFA there with

390
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:29,800
dr. Howell the KPFA subgenius show with dr. Howell and father Joe

391
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:35,220
mama with puzzling evidence mixing and probably talking and ones coming up

392
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:42,900
there's some material taken here from a video called Iraqi campaign the next

393
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:49,900
genocide by I think the guy's name is Pete Patiris it was a on a videotape the

394
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:56,040
puzzling evidence sent me and had some wonderful little juxtapositions which is

395
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,380
what we like to do

396
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:06,760
a mess the Gulf War operation desert storm

397
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:15,900
yeah old past history except for those guys that are missing body parts and

398
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,600
cellular cohesion

399
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:27,900
this is my confession friends every time I think about that quote war unquote I

400
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,000
am abashed

401
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,380
yeah yes embarrassed because as my wife reminded me I was the one who wanted to

402
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:43,680
put an American flag on my car and oh I was pulled in friends I was a sucker

403
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:50,060
I'll admit it I was a flag waving American during that time I felt like

404
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:54,320
there must be something fishy about it but I was so concerned about people

405
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,760
getting killed and because I try to be tied into the hideous

406
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:05,360
fitful pulse of our nation's waves of normals I fell for the lion my almost

407
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:11,260
halfway believe that the news media wasn't totally controlled and because of

408
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:18,280
that stupid unforgivable naivety I actually thought that there was some

409
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,240
good reason for the whole mess

410
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:32,000
ass. God, what a human I was. And I am, believe me friends, I am duly alarmed at myself for

411
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,480
having been such a dupe of the lynch mob fever that does sweep humanity, our good friend,

412
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:46,120
humanity every now and then. Because as much as I try to stay at one remove, you see, from

413
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:53,300
the human race, I can't help but be part of it, to monitor it, if nothing else, to even

414
00:25:53,300 --> 00:26:00,840
become emotionally involved in it, to even, yes, it's true, even of Reverend Ivan Stank,

415
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:09,460
to trust that the mass media wasn't lying in every detail, every tiny detail, out of

416
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:16,020
every pore. The false front of the conspiracy, friends, profit first and the end.

417
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,840
Nothing justifies the means.

418
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:27,920
They had to die. They had to die. They might have interfered with our plans. It was for

419
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:35,740
their own good. It was for a good cause. It's not our fault that they got in the way of

420
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,340
our business practices.

421
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,280
Yeah. Yeah, I gotta confess.

422
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,100
Because I've realized what a bad guy I am.

423
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:51,880
I'm not a bandwagon jumper. I can be, given enough stirrings of the collective unconscious.

424
00:26:52,820 --> 00:27:01,840
You know, even though I'm a professional anti-establishment rabble rouser, I'm no more immune to the waves

425
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:08,420
of bloodlust and righteous fervor erupting from the national subconscious than is old

426
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:14,840
Bubba pumping gas down there at the Exxon station. And that makes me sick. Makes me realize

427
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,080
what a delusional, delusional, delusional, delusional, delusional, delusional, delusional,

428
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,920
delusional, delusional, delusional hypocrite I can be. I'm not being one right now, of

429
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:29,640
course. But you know what I mean. It's a hideous truth that even the most ornery hater of the

430
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:37,680
conspiracy can be roped in by a smooth enough line combined with a relentless enough media

431
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:45,220
tease. And by gobs, they did that war up right. Media-wise, it was definitely not another

432
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:45,740
Vietnam.

433
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:55,120
They learned their lesson. GE, the owners of NBC, realized that the war would go over

434
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,320
much better as an arms commercial than as a body count. And it was. It was. It was more

435
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:08,140
like the Super Bowl. It was beautifully covered visually. And think how many young folks

436
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:15,860
who were anti-war liberal types gave the most of their talents working for CNN.

437
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,220
And making that war look sweet as a Coke commercial.

438
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,680
Good evening. The United States of America is at war.

439
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,500
We missed!

440
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:39,100
That wraps up our pre-game show. Reminder, it's coming up at halftime.

441
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,460
This is World News Tonight with Peter Jennings.

442
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,080
Thank you.

443
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,000
Brought to you by Preparation 8.

444
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,060
It starts with itch and irritation.

445
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:53,920
And then...

446
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,340
Yes, defense technology producing security.

447
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,140
And then he spacketh to the troops and he said,

448
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,720
Forget your sounds of violence.

449
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,300
Bring forth peace.

450
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,720
We no longer want war.

451
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,140
We want peace.

452
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:15,020
I am convinced that the chimpanzees and orangutans can exist, sir.

453
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,500
They're in peace, sir.

454
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:19,980
And as he spoke, silence pervaded the battlefield.

455
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,700
The crickets welled up with almighty peaceful ringing of songs.

456
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,340
Those rotten cricket no-goodniks.

457
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:33,360
And again the Middle East became the spawning ground of the philosopher king,

458
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,000
the messiah, the man-king.

459
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,660
He will be known as the king of Arrakis.

460
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,780
There, there, my dear son.

461
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,900
Mo Habib.

462
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,880
Have you ever stopped to think?

463
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,780
Just how much Iraq resembles...

464
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,260
King Hussein.

465
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,260
Mo Habib.

466
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,280
They're both messiahs.

467
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,340
The evil Baron Harkonnen and his republican guards.

468
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,220
And don't forget Sting, alias Bushmaster.

469
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,740
These are all issues we've discussed broadly and fully on the other side of the earth.

470
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:09,560
And tonight, I want to share weapons of mass destruction with you.

471
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,680
I think it's not perverse at all.

472
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,000
Well, there's always...

473
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,540
You know, when we talk about having sex with weapons of mass destruction,

474
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,160
why don't we use the idea of sexuality in corp...

475
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,240
You know, having sex with weapons of mass destruction

476
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,160
to quench the idea of weapons of mass destruction,

477
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,080
weapons of mass destruction, weapons of mass destruction.

478
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,880
Well, what you do is you make a big hole where you...

479
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,220
Yeah.

480
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,660
...where you want to, you know, do it.

481
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,660
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

482
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,120
That's the first thing you need is the big hole.

483
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,260
Then you need the pole.

484
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,180
They did a pole in France where they asked...

485
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:42,200
The hole in pole.

486
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:42,880
...who...

487
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,180
What?

488
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,960
The three...

489
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,700
Technique.

490
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,740
The biggest threats to world peace were for the French folks.

491
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,100
And what I read was that they said...

492
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,940
They were on top of the list.

493
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,540
They actually...

494
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,320
The top...

495
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,280
No, not at all.

496
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,260
The top of the list was Iraq.

497
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,240
The second...

498
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,260
Number two was Israel.

499
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,880
And number three was the United States.

500
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:00,520
Ha, ha.

501
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,160
Number three.

502
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:01,940
You know, wow.

503
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,360
We try even harder.

504
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,380
Where our Congress voted three to one to let George Bush do whatever the dang field...

505
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,980
I'm going to make a gun out of soap.

506
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,240
And I'm going to paint it with boot black.

507
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,680
And I'm going to break out of here, man.

508
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,680
I'm going to break out of here, man.

509
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:14,680


510
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:14,680


511
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:14,680


512
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,220
It's you, I'm out.

513
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:20,120
I'm going to run off to some more civilized country like Mexico or Canada.

514
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,580
Oh, wait.

515
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,940
I forget it.

516
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,280
I'm going to wear a huge thermonuclear bowling ball.

517
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,320
Canada, right, Dave?

518
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:27,760
It's hell.

519
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,940
It's hell, baby.

520
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:29,420
It is hell.

521
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,900
You can lay down, but you can't sleep.

522
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,300
It's hell, baby.

523
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,000
It's hell.

524
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,460
And what's much, much, much worse than hell, my friend?

525
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:37,860
Yes.

526
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:44,260
Any moment, one of those dumpsters could explode with a virulent mass of toxic materials like...

527
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,580
Abthrax.

528
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,680
Z-Hoffo.

529
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,280
That's right, man.

530
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:48,860
Vepticarboline.

531
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,160
Ceregos.

532
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,400
The genius of it all.

533
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,060
And necromania.

534
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,160
We'll use the ores we have.

535
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:02,560
We were selling that Cere nerve gas for a while and telling them it was always a soul.

536
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,380
It's the LSD gas or whatever.

537
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:05,820
Yeah.

538
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,500
And to the rival cults overseas.

539
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,120
I don't know where most of that stuff is.

540
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,740
I have some of that stuff and it didn't get nothing wrong to me.

541
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,300
Because the...

542
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,960
There it comes.

543
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,540
Here comes the cavalry.

544
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,260
Look out, factor.

545
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,660
The new gun is on its way to your town.

546
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,620
Here comes the Apache helicopters.

547
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,120
Little children.

548
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,180
That's right.

549
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:40,200
You don't want to do that too much because you'll all start waving the flag and screaming

550
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,100
and foaming at the mouth and falling to the ground.

551
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,600
You're getting so patriotic now.

552
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,180
Go, Michael.

553
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:44,580
And we're...

554
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:44,660
Go, Michael.

555
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:44,660


556
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,600
Paraplegic danger.

557
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:46,360
Yes.

558
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,100
Not to reason why, there's but to do and die.

559
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,400
Okay, folks.

560
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,460
It's time for war.

561
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,640
It's going to be funny.

562
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,300
The following is a special presentation of ABC Sports.

563
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,920
We are going to win.

564
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,620
Nothing like Vietnam.

565
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,340
That'd be like Lawrence of Arabia in movies.

566
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:14,660
Yeah.

567
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,560
It's one big sand dune.

568
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:27,300
You know, I'd hate to see a man as rich and powerful as you take off on some scheme that

569
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,700
would get our country into a lot of trouble.

570
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,860
Oh, no way.

571
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,460
Uh-uh.

572
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:35,240
As much as I want to shut down the Arabs, I'd never do anything to hurt my country.

573
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,540
Ladies and gentlemen, our corpus and bones.

574
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,640
Turn the key.

575
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:43,740
Feel free.

576
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:44,940
Feel free.

577
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,000
Feel free.

578
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,200
Feel free.

579
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,480
Feel free.

580
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:51,760
Feel free.

581
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,780
Feel free.

582
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:57,400
And now, to honor America, especially the brave men and women serving our nation in

583
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,820
the Persian Gulf and throughout the world, please join in the singing of our national

584
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,200
anthem.

585
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:14,640
Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's

586
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:24,180
first light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's first light?

587
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,040
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,

588
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:15,980
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,

589
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:44,300
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,

590
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:44,460
civilized at the fight, the你們 portrayed in their стоils,

591
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:48,680
Back by ten thousand gangster millionaires.

592
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,600
Yeah, America's sure feeling good about herself.

593
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:10,860
And it's practically drooling, watching Rocky and Rambo, watching the good, fat, and car

594
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,420
crashes.

595
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,280
Horror and gore, Logan and Ash could never forget Hatter исторias, in theirfic stream enter

596
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:14,280


597
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:14,280


598
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:14,280


599
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,180
A little cheap sex and a lot of advertising.

600
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,180
America's practically drooling.

601
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,300
Yeah, come on, do it for me one time.

602
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,800
America's feeling good again.

603
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:57,700
If nothing sells like America feeling good.

604
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,540
America's beer, America's car, made the American way.

605
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,920
America's never been like it is.

606
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,120
Born in the USA.

607
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,180
Yeah, America feels good.

608
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,600
Selling herself.

609
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,340
America feels so good about herself.

610
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:34,960
So thug and proud and offensive and aggressive and frustrated and anxiety-ridden.

611
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,140
That she can fly off the handle at any minute.

612
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,080
Playing McDonald's with the chicken gang fire.

613
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,040
Or a fine abortion clinic.

614
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,440
Or maybe mine or hers.

615
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,580
Or invade a few islands.

616
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,240
Or bomb a small Canadian country.

617
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,860
America's feeling good.

618
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,160
America's feeling good.

619
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:01,160


620
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:01,160


621
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:01,160


622
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,100
Yeah.

623
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,600
Yeah.

624
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,300
Yeah.

625
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:06,420
Yeah.

626
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:07,860
Yeah.

627
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:08,340
Yeah.

628
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:14,620
Yeah.

629
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,440
Yeah.

630
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:15,440


631
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:15,440


632
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,960
With people and things cared about yesterday.

633
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,820
Cause America's feeling good.

634
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,460
Damn anyone who deserves her masturbatory leverage.

635
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,620
America's feeling good.

636
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,680
Yeah.

637
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,020
Yeah.

638
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:02,280
Yes, a marvelous piece there

639
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:08,560
by Kyle Kossop of San Francisco.

640
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,620
Heck, I'll give his address.

641
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,680
Here's 9-1-1.

642
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,500
California Street, number 12, San Francisco.

643
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:21,240
9-4-1-2-1 for those of you with your tape decks running.

644
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:27,080
Yes, that's by Kyle Kossop and Severe Tire Damage.

645
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:30,400
Just out of the blue, Reverend Kossop there

646
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,360
sent this tape full of vicious anti-conspiracy songs

647
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,600
and videos and postcards.

648
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,100
It's amazing.

649
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:45,320
It's amazing what somebody can get a membership pack for these days.

650
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,100
But, on the other hand...

651
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:51,580
Yes, and I'm afraid there's a lot more trouble than we asked for tonight out here, you know.

652
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,700
The Bob Zone.

653
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,980
I've got a message from Bob for all of you.

654
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,960
Don't give up.

655
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,400
Yep, he didn't say what not to give up,

656
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,080
so I'll tell you what, I'm not giving up.

657
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,240
I'm not giving up drugs.

658
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,080
I'm not giving up surfing.

659
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,640
I'm not giving up surfing.

660
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:09,920
I'm not giving up coming down.

661
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:10,560
I'm not giving up going to this station

662
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,380
and being a bad noise in your ear.

663
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:19,460
And I'm also not giving up the hope that our boys over there in Malaysia

664
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,280
will be able to assassinate Bob for once and for all

665
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,320
and get rid of his kind before you become one of him.

666
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,520
And I'm afraid we'll not be able to take calls tonight.

667
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,540
You know, wartime situations such as this,

668
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,440
we just don't care what you have to say.

669
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,280
You can call the station all you want and we aren't going to listen.

670
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,420
It's time you got to realize that it's people like me

671
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:46,060
are going to have to come up with the answers for you

672
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:49,360
and that you're just going to have to live with our decisions.

673
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,860
We're taking a lot of notes here tonight,

674
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,400
so we're going to be thinking about what you're thinking about.

675
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,340
And we know what you're thinking, believe me.

676
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:07,140
Tonight's show, unlike normally, we do have a sponsor tonight

677
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,580
and we'll be revealing that sponsor.

678
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,660
Thanks, thanks.

679
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,780
Out here in the horrid, horrid future.

680
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,720
But like I said before, please don't give up.

681
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,760
Don't give up drugs.

682
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,320
Don't give up going crazy.

683
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:26,160
And don't give up the hope that someday our nation will be run by people like me.

684
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,600
Gary Shepherd, do you hear us in Baghdad?

685
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,240
Gary Shepherd, can you hear us?

686
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,400
The liberation of Kuwait has begun.

687
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,800
You're watching CBS News continuing coverage of Showdown in the Gulf.

688
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,320
Come on, guys. Over here. This way.

689
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,020
They're shooting at us. Come on, hurry up.

690
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,100
It's going to be a war soon.

691
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,120
Hey, I didn't sign up for this. What happened?

692
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:06,920
How long has it been like this? It was peaceful when I left for Arizona.

693
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:17,580
Oh, look at that guy over there. He really bought it.

694
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,660
Yeah, that anti-bar I wanted. He bought it.

695
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,160
Oh, yeah.

696
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:27,320
It doesn't melt in his hands in Operation Desert Dalkon Shield.

697
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:29,860
God, boy.

698
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:32,500
We're going to prophylaxis the world from bad people.

699
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:37,560
Yes, a prophylaxis against bad people is necessary in this day and age.

700
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,700
Come, my friends.

701
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,500
It is not too late to seek a newer world.

702
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:47,660
Push off and, sitting well in order, smite the sounding furrows.

703
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,000
Yes, indeed.

704
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:55,320
Those sounding furrows aren't going to bother our brave boys and gals

705
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:01,360
out in the hellish inferno of the Saudi Arabian whatever it be.

706
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,920
Bacon out there in the sand.

707
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:07,060
Either our Jesse and Mama will come.

708
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,680
Jesse and Mama are out there fighting side by side.

709
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:09,680


710
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:14,140
Dressed in tacky khaki.

711
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:21,880
Overflown with a camouflage pattern by Mr. Phyllis of Hollywood, California.

712
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,660
Which we'll all be wearing from our copies of Banana Republic in about a month.

713
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,180
It's simply stunning, and my ensemble is adorable.

714
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,700
And now they're playing some music for us.

715
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,220
To THIS.

716
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,160
If we're all together...

717
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,360
AND .

718
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:44,360


719
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,660
.

720
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,200
.

721
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,360
Don't you know we got smart bombs?

722
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,240
It's a good thing that our bombs are clever

723
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,540
Don't you know that the smart bombs are so clever

724
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,000
They only kill bad people now

725
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,240
Don't you know that our kids are dumb

726
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,200
We got smart bombs, what a joyous thing now

727
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,620
Here we go, so let's drink and toast

728
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:39,720
To those clever bombs and the men who built them

729
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,080
There they go now

730
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,860
There go all my friends

731
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,380
There they go now

732
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,120
Marching off to war again

733
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,500
Smiling proudly

734
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,840
With their heads in the clouds

735
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,000
Yeah, yeah

736
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,760
Yeah

737
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,180
Yeah

738
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:04,740
Yeah

739
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,480
Yeah

740
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:05,700
Yeah

741
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:07,580
Yeah

742
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:08,720
Yeah

743
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,480
Yeah

744
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,200
Yeah

745
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:10,800
Yeah

746
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,280
Yeah

747
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:11,760
Yeah

748
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:11,940
Yeah

749
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:12,140
Yeah

750
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:12,180
Yeah

751
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:12,280
Yeah

752
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:12,280


753
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:12,340
Yeah

754
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:12,540
Yeah

755
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:15,780
Don't you know this is better than any video friend

756
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,320
It's an action movie

757
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,980
Here we go, watch the bad guys get their butts kicked

758
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,880
When it makes me feel good

759
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,420
Here we go, watch and see it end

760
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:28,480
You're dreading them, we're just the room I think it's now

761
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,020
Don't you know it's a feel-good show, you ain't trying to mess

762
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,660
It's a video, video

763
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:34,900
Yeah, yeah

764
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:35,660
Here we go now

765
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,000
There go all my friends

766
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,560
There they go now

767
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,180
Marching off to war again

768
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:47,200
With their bright lights

769
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,700
Waving in the wind

770
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,460
There they go now

771
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:55,080
Marching off to war again

772
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,380
Smiling proudly

773
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,820
With their heads in the clouds

774
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:11,060
The tadpoles trying to stop this

775
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,320
Honk their horns

776
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:12,820
laughing

777
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:12,820


778
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:12,820


779
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:12,820


780
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:12,820


781
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:12,820


782
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:12,820


783
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:12,820


784
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:13,540
Yo

785
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:13,820
Yeah

786
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:14,040
Oh

787
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:14,500
Dance

788
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:14,860
Aye

789
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:16,380
Yeah

790
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:33,660
Matt

791
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah

792
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah

793
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:19,040
Here we go, watch the bad guys

794
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,140
Get their butts kicked

795
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,140
And it makes me feel good

796
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,040
Don't you know it's Nintendo

797
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:27,360
It gets the blood flowing through my veins

798
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,800
Now, don't you know

799
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,100
It's a feel-good show

800
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,320
It ain't time to miss

801
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,920
It's a video, video

802
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,540
There they go now

803
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,260
There go all my friends

804
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,820
There they go now

805
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:43,500
Marching off to war again

806
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,760
With their bright

807
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,180
flags

808
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,080
Waving in the wind

809
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,660
There they go now

810
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,340
Marching off to war again

811
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,780
Slightly proudly

812
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,980
There they go now

813
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,680
There go all my friends

814
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:05,280
There they go now

815
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,860
Marching off to war again

816
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,820
With their bright flags

817
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,440
Waving in the wind

818
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,740
There they go now

819
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,740
Marching off to war again

820
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,960
Smiling proudly

821
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,600
With their heads in the clouds

822
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,340
See them smiling out

823
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:30,080
Marching on in the lightning

824
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah

825
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah

826
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:43,320
There they go now

827
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah

828
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:45,740
There they go now

829
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:45,960
Outside the door

830
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:45,960


831
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:45,960


832
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,740
Oh, yeah

833
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

834
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,320
That's them

835
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,380
Oh my friends

836
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:55,440
Mm-hm

837
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,140
Oh, yeah, yeah

838
00:48:56,140 --> 00:49:00,160
Bop-a-dee-dub

839
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah

840
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:05,080
There they go now

841
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:11,340
Some people say

842
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:12,520
T Visionaries

843
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:12,520


844
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:25,880
Good evening. The United States of America is at war.

845
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,700
The war in the Persian Gulf has begun.

846
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,960
What was known for so long as Operation Desert Shield

847
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,860
is now called by President Bush Desert Cloud.

848
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:36,400
Desert Storm.

849
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,960
Desert Storm, I beg your pardon,

850
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,320
he made a statement from the White House a short while ago

851
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,760
simply saying the liberation of Kuwait has begun.

852
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,900
Squadron of F-15Es took off from central Saudi Arabia

853
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:51,480
and one of the Air Force officers in charge said,

854
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,520
quote, this is history in the making.

855
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,920
This is history in the making.

856
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:55,780
This is genocide.

857
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:00,140
The deliberate and systematic destruction of all life on Arrakis.

858
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:04,380
Yes, George Leroy Herbert Walker Sting Bush

859
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:08,580
in his leather loincloth now takes on Madman Saddam

860
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,840
and he threatens in his little voice

861
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,080
to,

862
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:11,400
uh,

863
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:14,360
blister the buttocks of the beast of Baghdad,

864
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:15,300
Saddam Hussein.

865
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,700
It was the king, the emperor Saddam

866
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,260
in the Dune series,

867
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:23,000
but here we have Saddam Hussein.

868
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,060
The resemblance is uncanny.

869
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,360
There they fought for spice.

870
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,560
Here we fight for oil.

871
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,240
Yes, Duel in the Desert, day 664.

872
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,640
It was when we realized that the crickets were chipping

873
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,500
that we knew there was water deep underneath the crust of Arrakis.

874
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:39,860
And,

875
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:40,020
uh,

876
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,160
covered with,

877
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:44,620
uh, milk chocolate shell which makes it purely delicious.

878
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,020
Once we realized that deep in the underbelly of Arrakis,

879
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,440
Deep in the belly of Babylon, man.

880
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,760
that the water surged and purged,

881
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:55,400
Who is this hero?

882
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,560
we knew that there was a dramatic possibility of a war.

883
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:00,360
We're talking about some serious,

884
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,320
Oh, it's nice in here.

885
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,880
possible problems here in this Arrakian war.

886
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:07,480
A sudden racking cough overcame me and respiratory troubles.

887
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,440
The Freeman made me sign...

888
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,560
Pass me the EM-11.

889
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,380
Move your...

890
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:10,880
...mason, sir.

891
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:11,920
Is that this one?

892
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:12,220
Out there hiding.

893
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:13,280
I think they...

894
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,660
Rumor has it that they wear their Freeman suits.

895
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:16,920
I think they find their make car rounds.

896
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,260
Yeah, they're wearing those Freeman suits on the base.

897
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:19,860
It smells like vegetables.

898
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,160
If it tastes like vegetables, they fell...

899
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,280
They keep that water stored and they never go pee.

900
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:23,760
I mean...

901
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,180
There it comes, the green turnip...

902
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:25,480
What's the deal?

903
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,420
...landing at the Burpleson Air Force Base.

904
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:27,660
Where do they store that water anyway?

905
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:30,940
Strategic lift is the true force multiplier at these bases.

906
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,780
Yes, the United States faces both a dangerous challenge and a significant opportunity...

907
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:36,160
Both, ma'am?

908
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:36,940
This is the United States.

909
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:39,320
...in the area of military mobilization and deployment.

910
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:39,540
This is the United States.

911
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:40,280
...in the area of military mobilization and deployment.

912
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,080
We're talking about...

913
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,080
Given increasing unpredictable requirements...

914
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,300
...the Subgenius Foundation...

915
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,860
...subgenius foundation or the Pacific Ocean...

916
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,920
...the need to increase...

917
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,620
...the standard self against the problems...

918
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:52,740
...is unbeknown.

919
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,240
...in the ray-a-thon angle of continuous...

920
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,320
...wayback of this radar...

921
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,240
...from the radar system.

922
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:57,140
Clear.

923
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,160
...the Air Force team...

924
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,560
...the United States...

925
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,220
...chaparral...

926
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:01,260
...seems to work...

927
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:09,380
That scene...

928
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,680
...says a lot about America.

929
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:15,280
A lot about who we are.

930
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,640
Americans are a caring people.

931
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:20,460
We are a good people.

932
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,920
A generous people.

933
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,060
A little people.

934
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:24,860
A silly people.

935
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:28,480
Greedy, barbarous, and cruel.

936
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,520
We are Americans.

937
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,320
And we're proud of you...

938
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,600
...for your courage to stand tall.

939
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:39,200
Yes, we're proud of you...

940
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:40,080
...for your courage to stand tall.

941
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,140
You gave your very all...

942
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:44,700
...you fought the desert storm...

943
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,440
...in the air, on land and sea...

944
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,360
...to keep America free.

945
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,780
Welcome to freedom...

946
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:56,100
...and the President's New World Order...

947
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:56,780
...tonight.

948
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,720
You will believe.

949
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:01,440
We believe...

950
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,300
...we believe...

951
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,140
...we believe...

952
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,580
...we believe...

953
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:05,560
...we believe...

954
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,320
...you will believe.

955
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:11,480
I believe.

956
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,000
I believe.

957
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:13,000


958
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:13,000


959
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:13,000


960
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:13,000


961
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:13,000


962
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:13,000


963
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:13,600
A great athlete...

964
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,220
...it was a tragedy...

965
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,660
...one of the worst duties I ever had to perform...

966
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:17,740
...is to bury all those...

967
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:21,120
...those innocent boys and girls' stubs in the desert sands.

968
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,820
Yeah, but if you don't bury the stubs...

969
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:24,720
You mean, those 81 murderers mounted...

970
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,740
...piggyback on 50 caliber machine guns didn't save them all?

971
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,460
Well, I'm afraid not.

972
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:29,880
You see...

973
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:30,220
...you see...

974
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:34,440
...it comes a time in every young boy or girl's life...

975
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:34,460
...it comes a time in every young boy or girl's life...

976
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:34,460


977
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:36,100
...that it's time to bury those stubs...

978
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:39,280
and get on with the business of living.

979
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,300
But scientists discover that by covering the stubs

980
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,980
with some strange new protoplasm,

981
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:47,100
they were able to resurrect the stubs

982
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,920
into a new form of life that had been...

983
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,400
Boy, my stub resurrects just hearing about it.

984
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:54,800
It wasn't enough just to simply bring them back to life.

985
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:56,420
These stubs had a mission.

986
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:57,720
Millions of years ago,

987
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,080
guns belonged to missiles rolling through the earth.

988
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,000
...to win the war.

989
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:05,200
So these stubs were not content to be buried.

990
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:07,240
They wanted revenge.

991
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:09,340
Here comes another one!

992
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:13,640
What scientists didn't count on, however,

993
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,900
was the difficulty in controlling these stubs

994
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,720
once they were resurrected from the grave.

995
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:20,040
We're having electrical interference down here,

996
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:20,560
ladies and gentlemen.

997
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:21,500
It's part of the barrage.

998
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,180
We hope we're going to be able to continue

999
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,160
bringing our program to you, but sit tight.

1000
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,260
Hey, what'll it be, guys?

1001
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:28,180
I'll have a coffee, please.

1002
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,480
Coffee for me, too, Joey.

1003
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:29,700
Yeah.

1004
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:31,340
Thank you. Coffee's great.

1005
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:33,180
I got that war anxiety.

1006
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,560
I know what you mean.

1007
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:35,380
My nerves, I'm a bundle of nerves.

1008
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:35,980
It's like it's...

1009
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:37,240
It's coming at you from all sides.

1010
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,160
You try to forget it, and you turn on the TV.

1011
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:39,900
There's a story.

1012
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,000
Yeah, it's everywhere, that stuff.

1013
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,660
And Tel Aviv, and the blood, and it's gonna get bad.

1014
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,880
You look like a bundle of nerves.

1015
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:46,100
Maybe you could use something to eat.

1016
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:47,820
Look, they got nice Danish over there.

1017
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,560
Yeah, I wouldn't touch those Danishes.

1018
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:50,860
They're as hard as a rock.

1019
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:51,460
Maybe.

1020
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:51,960
The Iraq.

1021
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:52,920
Iraq!

1022
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:53,720
Iraq!

1023
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:55,140
Ah, there it is!

1024
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,160
Again, Iraq!

1025
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:56,860
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1026
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:57,800
It's getting a little late, but...

1027
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:58,620
The bomb's going off!

1028
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,320
Maybe a nice bowl of cereal.

1029
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,140
Settle your nerves.

1030
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:01,880
A bowl of cereal.

1031
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,220
Well, it's a little late in the day for cereal.

1032
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:04,780
Cereal.

1033
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:05,520
Cereal.

1034
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:05,580
Syria.

1035
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:08,200
That's the country that borders the north of Israel.

1036
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:08,960
Hey, hey, hey, calm down.

1037
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:09,760
You're going crazy.

1038
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,960
They're gonna get sucked into this war as soon as the Arab coalition goes under.

1039
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,360
Let's change the subject.

1040
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:12,660
Ba-boom!

1041
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,200
Change the subject, okay?

1042
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:14,800
All right, all right, all right.

1043
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:14,980
I'm sorry.

1044
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:16,120
Your birthday's coming up, right?

1045
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:16,580
My birthday.

1046
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,520
That's a happy thing, you know?

1047
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,420
That's a happy thing.

1048
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:18,920
No more war talking about me.

1049
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,740
Maybe you want a nice watch like the one I got here.

1050
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:21,520
Look at this nice Rolex.

1051
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,660
Hey, yeah, it is a nice watch.

1052
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:24,800
Is that a fake Rolex, or is that real?

1053
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:25,040
It's real.

1054
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:25,800
It's real.

1055
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:26,720
It's real.

1056
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:27,160
It's real.

1057
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:27,840
It's real.

1058
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,740
It's real again with the Israel and Tel Aviv, those poor people.

1059
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:32,240
They got the scuds dropped on them.

1060
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:32,800
They don't know.

1061
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,860
They're gonna snap those people, and I'm not gonna blame them when they do.

1062
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,860
Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave, let's just talk about our family, right?

1063
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:39,340
I'm sorry.

1064
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:40,000
I'm all...

1065
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,240
You're obsessing on this war thing.

1066
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,200
I'm not obsessing on it.

1067
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:42,380
You don't have to do that.

1068
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,200
It just happens to be that we're in a crisis.

1069
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,160
You know, life goes on.

1070
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:46,080
All right, all right.

1071
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:46,720
How's your kid?

1072
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:47,840
Oh, my big guy.

1073
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:48,600
He's great.

1074
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,020
I get...

1075
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,780
Well, you know, he gets into trouble sometimes.

1076
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:51,100
Yeah.

1077
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,520
I had to have a talk with him, you know?

1078
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:53,940
I sat him down last night.

1079
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:58,760
I sat him down, and I sat him, sat him, sat him, who say, hell, the bloodthirsty butcher

1080
00:55:58,760 --> 00:55:59,500
of Baghdad.

1081
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,040
Stop it.

1082
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:00,640
Stop it.

1083
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:04,480
He's like another Hitler, and somebody's gotta stop him, but I don't know how we got...

1084
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,440
Well, it's over big oil.

1085
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,920
It's not about naked aggression.

1086
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,160
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1087
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:10,080
You know, I know what you like.

1088
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:10,500
Football.

1089
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:11,580
Let's talk about football.

1090
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,080
Let's talk football.

1091
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:13,840
Now, who's gonna do it?

1092
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,960
The Giants or the Bills, huh?

1093
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:15,740
Oh, the Giants.

1094
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,140
You can bet the Giants.

1095
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,220
I'd put money on that.

1096
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:21,300
Nah, I bet it's gonna be the Bills, because, you know, it'll be over quick, man.

1097
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:21,700
The Bills.

1098
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:22,080
I think so.

1099
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:22,940
Half hour, I bet.

1100
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:23,740
The whole thing.

1101
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:24,720
Half hour, you bet.

1102
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:25,260
Half hour.

1103
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,700
Half hour, Albertin.

1104
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,500
Half hour, Albertin.

1105
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,700
What are you talking about?

1106
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,300
Half hour, Albertin.

1107
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,180
Don't you read the papers.

1108
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:36,340
Half hour, Albertin is a base where they keep missiles there, those Tomahawk cruise missiles.

1109
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,700
They're launched from command centers, and they're gonna go up against the sky.

1110
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:39,420
Hey, hey, so here comes the waiter.

1111
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:41,660
He's gonna take the order.

1112
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,260
We can have something nice to eat.

1113
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,100
All right, all right.

1114
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,220
You guys ready to order?

1115
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:45,640
Yeah.

1116
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,140
What are your specials today?

1117
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,500
Specials today is barbecued spareribs.

1118
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:51,380
Spareribs.

1119
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:52,060
That sounds pretty good.

1120
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,360
That sounds pretty good.

1121
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:53,640
I'll try the spareribs.

1122
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:54,960
Spareribs I like.

1123
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:55,800
Spareribs.

1124
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:56,440
Spareribs.

1125
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:56,920
Arabs.

1126
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:57,720
Arabs.

1127
00:56:58,060 --> 00:56:59,820
And there we go in the war again.

1128
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:01,960
I can't stop thinking about it.

1129
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:02,480
Arabs.

1130
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:03,680
Who's Arabs?

1131
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:05,560
We're gonna fight the Arab coalition.

1132
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:06,880
It's going crazy.

1133
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,580
The world is gonna go nuts.

1134
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,240
My head is gonna explode.

1135
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,780
Oh, maybe I'll try something else to eat.

1136
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:15,140
How about the big stuff scud?

1137
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,120
I mean, scrod.

1138
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:17,460
See, I'm doing it now.

1139
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,420
I'm doing it.

1140
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,160
Look at my plate.

1141
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,420
Rhymes with Kuwait.

1142
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:21,140
Kuwait.

1143
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:21,600
Kuwait.

1144
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:22,460
Kuwait.

1145
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,520
Kuwait.

1146
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:30,800
And that was our good friend, Reverend Bleepo Abernathy,

1147
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,660
and his good friend, Billy West.

1148
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,820
Billy West, who's now, since that was recorded,

1149
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:42,000
has become a big star as the voices of Ren and Stimpy.

1150
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:47,940
And gosh, we could go on with sickening Gulf War material for forever.

1151
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:51,860
Bleepo Abernathy.

1152
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,020
Using a DARPA TAT breaker right now is weak.

1153
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:57,880
You can see ATGW3LRs flying over your head.

1154
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,020
They're going to Marine troops running across Kuwait's cities in major streets.

1155
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:07,440
Now the Fog-Am fiber optic guided missile is hurtling down and turning left to the stairway in front of you.

1156
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:12,180
And up, it's going through each bedroom sniffing for the one person typed into a computer printer.

1157
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:17,340
Stick your hand in the ballot box, my boy, and taste my Karim Abdul-Jabbar.

1158
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:17,700
Haha.

1159
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,760
It's old Saddam Hussein.

1160
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,480
He can sit right in the basket.

1161
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:23,920
If you pull your mitts out, that's it.

1162
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:25,360
Kaput.

1163
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:31,160
And so, Reverend Mother swept majestically from the room.

1164
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:35,340
Feigning out under the tables and...

1165
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:36,560
We're breaking up, we're breaking up.

1166
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,980
Look, I think we just gotta, you know...

1167
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:41,880
It's not like a trip, bro.

1168
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,300
The problem is that there's not enough...

1169
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:47,960
We're not selling enough tennis shoes with lights in the heels over there in the Middle East.

1170
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,640
We want to sell tennis shoes made out of human skin.

1171
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:52,700
I'm doing my best to change that.

1172
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:59,060
I just cranked out five new subgenius products to sell to those people and give them slack.

1173
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:02,780
And www.subgenius.com

1174
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,860
So is it done.

1175
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:08,200
And by the will of his will and the magic of his...

1176
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,760
His will, his magical will.

1177
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:11,600
And by...

1178
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,840
And by the...

1179
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:14,160
Fight!

1180
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:22,580
Fight the fighters and make war on the warriors and kill death by sending money to Bob.

1181
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:27,180
Yes, your money is like a pole and Bob's post-op box is like a hole.

1182
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:28,560
Have sex!

1183
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:30,260
With Bob!

1184
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:31,900
It is just a transition.

1185
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,360
Plastic transition.

1186
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,540
It's just a kiss away!

1187
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,580
You will have 17 virgins waiting for you.

1188
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:38,760
Give me a chance.

1189
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,180
Well, we're back in the studio with Eric Scheib.

1190
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:46,980
And the author of the book, the 18th virgin.

1191
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,980
And Doris, what do you have to say?

1192
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:49,940
Until next week.

1193
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:51,000
What is the idea for...

1194
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:51,340
What?

1195
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:56,620
If you're old enough to be registered for the draft, you might start paying attention to what's going on out there.

1196
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,080
Keep your hat on tight.

1197
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,560
You're back to the land and you're sacking the saddle.

1198
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,960
Desire for peacefulness.

1199
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:02,900
At least in...

1200
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:03,300
See y'all.

1201
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:03,940
When you're...

1202
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,280
Oh, look.

1203
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:07,360
The thing in your sock.

1204
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,300
Or kill me.

1205
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:08,960
Ha, ha, ha.

1206
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:09,760
Ha, ha.

1207
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:10,440
Bye.

1208
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:10,860
Bye.

1209
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:11,040
Bye.

1210
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:11,360
Bye.

1211
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:11,460
Bye.

1212
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:11,840
Bye.

1213
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:11,840


1214
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:12,220
Bye.

1215
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:13,060
Bye.

1216
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:13,060


1217
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:14,280
Bye.

1218
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:14,280


1219
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:14,280


1220
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:14,280


1221
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:14,280


1222
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:14,280


1223
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:14,480
Bye.
