1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
That sire, there is no more money.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,820
We gotta get some money.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,120
That dirty purgish harker, that flat-footed...

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,960
You people think we just improvise this stuff from the keyboard and stuff.

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,060
But no, we have to rehearse this stuff all week long.

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:23,980
And we have to ride this bicycle treadmill that runs the electric generators that make the power spew out over the airwaves,

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:31,600
out into the invisible air where your ears pick up the rare material and strange music that this station plays,

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,000
such as the Hour of Slash.

9
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,900
Stuck in an availability room somewhere deep beneath the surface of the earth,

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:46,020
the Reverend Ivan Stang, made of pure cream cheese and three pieces of toilet paper,

11
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:53,060
has rebuilt his entire personality from a foam-like mug distributed by the Church of the Subgenius

12
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,420
through the...

13
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:59,420
I'm screaming into this paper cup as much as I can and it's just not getting out of this underground...

14
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:05,300
Welcome to the Hour of...

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,360
Nothing.

16
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,200
Slash.

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,440
Slash.

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,000
We had such a good cue there, I thought maybe you could use that.

19
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,840
No, I don't care about... I don't care about creative...

20
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,640
No, Dad.

21
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,540
That's all you need to buy.

22
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,180
For this station!

23
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:30,020
There's only one thing that matters between birth and death and that's donating to this station to keep it on.

24
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:36,260
This station will be hauled off dead in a casket tomorrow if they can't pay their electrical bills.

25
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:44,780
And homes in California will have to quit writing those scripts because no one will be able to pay them $75,000 a year to do this show.

26
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,180
It costs money to do these kinds of elaborate productions, friends.

27
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,840
But friends, it's not real money.

28
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,400
It's the kind of money that you...

29
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,380
You need to make your life twirl around like a little twinkie stick.

30
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,160
It's the kind of money they give you in outer space.

31
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,580
The kind of money from deep, deep in the cosmos.

32
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,400
It's not paper money.

33
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,620
Nothing as flaccid and tricky.

34
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,780
Nothing as...

35
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,120
No, it's just...

36
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,360
No, it's just...

37
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,160
No, we're talking about psychotronic subphonic money.

38
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,900
The kind that'll bring you a long-sleeved shirt.

39
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,860
But, Sire, there is no more money.

40
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,280
We gotta get some money.

41
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,760
That dirty, perky, sharkaback, flacky, walkie-talkie!

42
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,740
They're here!

43
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,520
One minute.

44
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,260
It's showtime, my friends.

45
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,620
Time for the subgenius hour and a half.

46
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,180
A show that dare not even exist.

47
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,660
Join us now as we rocket away out of normal time into showtime.

48
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,740
Phenomenal.

49
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:52,280
It's mysterious, evil, spooky, eerie, creepy, wacky, kooky, fun.

50
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,400
Phenomenal.

51
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,620
The subgenius hour of slacking.

52
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,680
And here we got brains the whole operation.

53
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,180
Faster signal goes up near the satellite.

54
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,020
We bump it out all over the world.

55
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,620
Pretty fancy, huh?

56
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,080
Not too big.

57
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,900
Thank you for letting us out.

58
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,680
You're buying time.

59
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,580
Time, friends.

60
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,500
Because Mr. Moneybags, he's paying a salary.

61
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,560
A salary?

62
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,340
A salary?

63
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:23,380
A salary?

64
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,200
$200 a week.

65
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,700
And consequently, I can't preach against drinking because his icebox is full of beer.

66
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,800
I hope he's talking about you, my friend.

67
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:31,960
WCSB, then.

68
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,400
I can't preach against cigarettes because they all smoke.

69
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:34,880
Schwartz.

70
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,300
I have to let him out for 15 minutes between Sunday school and worship service,

71
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,920
so they can go out and light up a Chesterfield or something.

72
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,600
And what kind did Jesus smoke, my friend?

73
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,720
It's time to open your heart.

74
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,660
Close your mind and zip your lips and bend over.

75
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,060
Because you're about to receive.

76
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,340
I see you.

77
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,580
The word about...

78
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,120
Yes, friends.

79
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,000
You're normally such a slacker.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,060
It's the first time you've heard of him.

81
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,680
Yeah, that's right.

82
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,120
All four of us.

83
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,960
Bone Bendover and his sister Eileen.

84
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,220
Oh, yes, friends.

85
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,860
Tonight's show is an exclusive to WCSB only.

86
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:25,040
Only no other station on the planet will be allowed to play this show.

87
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,580
Most stations don't even want to play any of our shows, but some stations do.

88
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,880
And they do not qualify, friends.

89
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:41,280
Although we'll probably put it on the podcast as alternate hour of Slack number 1437B or something.

90
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,560
Friends, this show is just for you.

91
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,320
Just for you.

92
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,660
No, we don't care if you're a dues-paying subgenius.

93
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,960
We're not out to save you.

94
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,080
It's a gift.

95
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,920
It's our gift to you.

96
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:04,420
The gift of asking you to gift us your money.

97
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,420
Because it is pledge drive time.

98
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,260
You knew that.

99
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,040
Oh, before I forget, friends, there are photographs of the famous WCSB Halloween.

100
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,800
Halloween Masquerade Ball up on the internet now.

101
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,680
Godzilla was there.

102
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:22,600
Huh?

103
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,940
Godzilla was there.

104
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,720
Godzilla was there in person.

105
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:34,320
And, in fact, he caused the lights to go out just before the headlining band, the Dead Milkman, came on.

106
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,460
But it was still a great party nonetheless.

107
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,780
A great party.

108
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,680
And you can...

109
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,020
If you were unlucky enough...

110
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:51,440
If you were lucky enough to get there late and were just in the crowd going around several blocks in the rain...

111
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,260
Or, for that matter, if you were stranded...

112
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:00,040
If you got there just before the lights went out and, therefore, didn't really see any of the cool costumes...

113
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:07,880
Princess Wee's photographs are on my website or, rather, the Church of the Subgenius website.

114
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,960
And I'm going to tell you how to find them at subgenius.com.

115
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:16,920
There's a...

116
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,500
On the bar at the top, events is one of the choices.

117
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:30,120
Well, you can click on that events thing and it'll tell you about things that happened and X Day coming up.

118
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:30,780
But...

119
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:38,820
Also, at the top of that page, it says there's a link to past devivals, events of yore.

120
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,820
Click on that.

121
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,800
Then, look down the list of things.

122
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,740
Don't be distracted by the ones offering nudity.

123
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,740
Like X Day and Starwood.

124
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:54,020
And find the 2012 WCSB Halloween Masked Great Ball link and click on that.

125
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,880
And then, when you're looking at 2012, just reach up to the top in that link and change the 2 in 2012.

126
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,680
The last 2.

127
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,540
Well, the last one letter, 2.

128
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,880
Change 2012 to 2013.

129
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,280
And then refresh that page and you'll be looking at a week or two ago.

130
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,820
So, at the...

131
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,080
NYWCC.org.

132
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,360
NYWCC.org.

133
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,860
I wish I could be that cool.

134
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:33,860


135
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,120
I wish I could be that cool.

136
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,120


137
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,140
I wish I could be that cool.

138
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,200
Except for the deaf ones like me.

139
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,860
People who work hard for nothing.

140
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,000
Nothing, friends.

141
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,560
Don't you wish you could be cool like a WCSB DJ and work for nothing?

142
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,020
I wish I could be that cool.

143
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,580
You can. You can be that cool. All you have to do is give all your money to the station.

144
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,400
But what number do I call to give out all my money to the station?

145
00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:04,460
Well, even if you're only given $15, because that's all you make per week, you would call 687-6900.

146
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,780
Yes, friends, you'll hear that number again in the 216 area code.

147
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,720
And we welcome people from all lands and planets.

148
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,340
216-687-6900.

149
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:24,460
I hardly need to dwell upon the occult significance of that phone number.

150
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,960
We're not numerology nuts around here.

151
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:32,020
But we are nuts, friends, because we've been giving this show away for free, like crazy people.

152
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:38,680
And you can be a crazy person, too, by giving everything away for free.

153
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,420
Like your money.

154
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,780
To the station. 687-6900.

155
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,320
That's all you have to do.

156
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,320
You don't have to actually spend the money now.

157
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,640
You'll just be promising.

158
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,680
And we'll hound you to your grave until you whip it out.

159
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,840
That sounds so easy.

160
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,880
It would be easy.

161
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,160
How easy and convenient that would be.

162
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,580
You can do it just by picking up that phone and calling 687-6900.

163
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,300
You could talk to Dr. Sinister.

164
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,100
He's manning the phones right now.

165
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,760
He's standing by, patiently awaiting your call.

166
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,140
Your call.

167
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:09,520
Rattling.

168
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,980
Rattling his can of pennies.

169
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,920
See, the station left the traditional can of three pennies here.

170
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,580
We all have a little can of pennies.

171
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,160
It's our three-penny opera for the night.

172
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,200
Yes, we're beggars.

173
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,980
And we're choosers.

174
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,280
We chose you, personally, the one listening right now, to be a listener to this station.

175
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,340
Because we knew that you had taste.

176
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,760
Not necessarily good, but special taste.

177
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,020
The kind of taste that makes you just...

178
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,560
But to you, the corporate radio stuff just doesn't taste good.

179
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,540
Because you know it was hand-picked by a computer with no hands.

180
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,860
We have hands here, most of us.

181
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,920
And ears.

182
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,820
And obviously, mouths.

183
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,360
Flapping lips.

184
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,800
The tongue of the preacher.

185
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,960
That music in the background, by the way, is by the Flying Ryan Brothers.

186
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,980
An unsigned and unsignable band.

187
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,600
From Chicago area.

188
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,400
Reverend Jimmy Ryan is one of the brothers.

189
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,820
And they're good for pledge drive music.

190
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,780
Now, I'm going to get into berating moochers.

191
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,260
This is a special moochers show.

192
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,700
How to be a moochers.

193
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,380
October was moochers month, friends.

194
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,060
And...

195
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,400
But before, I show you what you're like.

196
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,960
If you don't know.

197
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:38,960


198
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,660
I pledge.

199
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,140
By example.

200
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,160
I wanted to mention that we have...

201
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:53,020
You don't just, you know, get the good feeling of supporting one of the few really independent radio stations left.

202
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,600
You get stuff.

203
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,460
For instance, for just $15.

204
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,040
A mere $15.

205
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:05,320
You can get your choice of a cool skull pennant.

206
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,180
With the WCSB logo.

207
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,980
A black winter hat.

208
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,960
Which is cool because it's black.

209
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,600
And it has WCSB logo.

210
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,860
Two ashtrays.

211
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,920
So if I was in the snow and I had the black hat on, I wouldn't get lost.

212
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:22,720
Right.

213
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,700
You'd be able to find your hat.

214
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,920
And that's yourself underneath the hat.

215
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,540
From a great distance.

216
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,660
Even in a Cleveland snowstorm.

217
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,820
And there's pint glasses too.

218
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,980
That's a different $15 donation.

219
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,520
But then you'd have something to drink while you were...

220
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,960
Finding yourself.

221
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,660
Yes.

222
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,820
And the black hat does have some glimmers of white in the logo.

223
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,500
So it's pure black.

224
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,000
Now for $20.

225
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,820
You can get not only the WCSB premiums I'm about to list off.

226
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,760
But the subgenius premium.

227
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,920
For $20 and up.

228
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,420
The Bob Dobbs Head Cloisonne Pin.

229
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,860
A metal pin.

230
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,320
In color.

231
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,960
With colored polished paint.

232
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,780
And a little bit of black metal.

233
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,280
Those are really nice looking.

234
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,840
Nickel and other fine minerals.

235
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:14,900
Yeah.

236
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,420
They're slick looking.

237
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,700
They're a $30 value.

238
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,660
Which we're letting you have for $20 pledge.

239
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,640
Plus...

240
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,040
Hold on.

241
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,980
Are you going crazy?

242
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,640
Well, yes.

243
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,320
I went crazy a long time ago.

244
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,500
And that's what this show is all about.

245
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,940
And that's why this is the only station that would let us do this show.

246
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:37,940


247
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,040
Because it's kind of crazy too.

248
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,560
They're so crazy that for that $20 you get not only the Bob Dobbs Cloisonne Pin.

249
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,960
But a black ceramic travel mug.

250
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,520
Or a green casual cap with the logo on it.

251
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,720
Or a black mesh trucker's cap.

252
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,620
Or, and this is my favorite because I don't know what it looks like.

253
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,640
The black and gray pom pom hat.

254
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,940
Oh, those are great.

255
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,480
I don't even know what a pom pom hat is.

256
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,380
It's a winter hat with a pom pom on the top.

257
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,760
Like elves wear?

258
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,260
Yes, like elves.

259
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,500
Just like elves wear.

260
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,600
Friends, that's magical.

261
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,840
Magically delicious.

262
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,020
It's pom pomi.

263
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,080
For $25 there's all manner of t-shirts.

264
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,580
Which your call answerer, Dr. Sinister, can describe.

265
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,320
Or engraved pint glass and a bottle of the beer I'm about to describe.

266
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,080
Or a Stein.

267
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,920
But see, if I was a WCSB listener.

268
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,800
And I was going to spend $25 to save the station.

269
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,100
And get the phones fixed.

270
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,860
So that Lonesome Cowboy Dave could be heard properly.

271
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,500
Yeah.

272
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:53,160
I would donate the $25 and ask for the twin pack of Schwarz beer.

273
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:57,640
Which is a beer brewed by WCSB personnel.

274
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:03,140
And we tasted this year's batch at that masquerade ball.

275
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,240
Mmm.

276
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,760
And then we tasted it some more.

277
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,060
And then we tasted another one.

278
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,480
And then we tasted another large pitcher.

279
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,900
And then we pitched flat over on our faces.

280
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,620
Because it's that good, friends.

281
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,360
It's like chocolate cake that gets you drunk.

282
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,100
That's exactly right.

283
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,720
It's like having a pet you can make sweet love to, friends.

284
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,360
That's how good the WCSB Schwarz beer is.

285
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,320
Speaking of dark things.

286
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,120
Yes.

287
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,180
Dr. Dark himself has made a donation.

288
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,380
Dr. Dark, that cheap guy.

289
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,640
Why, he's never, ever donated anything to the church before.

290
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,060
And yet, look, friends, how the luck plane is moving.

291
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,320
But he has been a good friend to this station.

292
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,380
And you should be just like Dr. Dark.

293
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,560
And call us up at 216-687-6900.

294
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,240
Every little bit counts.

295
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,040
We have many ways of saying thank you.

296
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,100
Yeah, I think you know what that means, ladies.

297
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,520
And boys.

298
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,740
What else here?

299
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,880
The $35 pledge gets you the bubble umbrella.

300
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,720
It's clear.

301
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,640
So you can see through it.

302
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,380
And they can see you.

303
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,120
They can see how dry you are.

304
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,520
They're going to be jealous.

305
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:23,440
For $40, there's the silver lunch pail, which looks just like the football thing that the president has handcuffed to him.

306
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,760
Even when he's asleep.

307
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,600
And making sweet, sweet love to his wife.

308
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,220
He's got that football.

309
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,600
And you can have one like it.

310
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,500
That's the silver lunch pail.

311
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:42,040
With a WCSB logo instead of a logo that says USA bomb launch codes or whatnot.

312
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:46,140
And then for $50, you get hoodies or four pint glasses.

313
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:50,160
But there usually aren't subgeniuses with $50.

314
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,860
If there is one, prove it.

315
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,880
Prove it.

316
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,540
I'll bet you don't even have 50 bucks, do you?

317
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,060
Listener X911C.

318
00:15:59,380 --> 00:15:59,960
You don't.

319
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,760
That's sitting out there in Mentor.

320
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,300
You're barely hearing this thing in your car radio.

321
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,640
You don't even have 50 bucks to spare on WCSBD.

322
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:16,800
I believe there are devoted listeners that have not just 50 but 100, even $150.

323
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,900
Well, good for them because I am less account than they are and have not that $50 in my pocket.

324
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,700
Because I spent it on blank CDs that are involved in making this show.

325
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:41,100
So, friends, you know, you really do have to whip it out because you don't want to be like the people that have been emailing me all month.

326
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,680
Or the ones leaving messages on my answer machine, which I'm going to play soon.

327
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,660
This is a sad letter here from Brian.

328
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:58,320
First he wrote and said, if I join forces with the church of subgenius, will I be allowed to choose my own ministerial name?

329
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,800
Can I call myself Reverend?

330
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,440
Reverend whatever if I so choose.

331
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,080
Well, duh.

332
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:07,140
I wrote him back politely and said, yes, hardly anybody uses their human street name.

333
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,580
Incidentally, the name Reverend Funny Name is taken.

334
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,800
Well, he wrote back and said, right now I am broke.

335
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,220
No, actually he wrote back and said, you may call me at this such and such number.

336
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,000
And then he sent another email that said, or this number.

337
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,740
I was like, why should I call this guy?

338
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,140
He goes, right now I am broke.

339
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,780
But I believe that I ought to receive a free order.

340
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:35,240
I have been in the ordination since I have come up with such a fantastic ordination name.

341
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,640
Would you like to know what it is?

342
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,420
No.

343
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:49,380
This fact of my inspired name, says the moocher, and the fact that I have no money is the justification behind my asking this boon of you.

344
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,940
Can we please talk about it?

345
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,800
Thanking you in advance for your time, which the time I gave him was the time it took to copy and paste.

346
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:08,460
The fact that we have a thousand inspired names at hand and no money is the justification behind our asking this boon of you.

347
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,580
Send $35 to WCSB.

348
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,300
That's not what I said.

349
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,180
But get this, the guy couldn't leave it at that.

350
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,780
Listen to this from my M.

351
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:26,780


352
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,660
This is a

353
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:54,840
I want to talk about joining forces with you.

354
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,640
I want to talk about joining forces with you.

355
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,820
However, I'm broke because I'm so sad.

356
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,120
I have no money, but I hope we can talk about it.

357
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,760
And I emailed as well.

358
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,700
Thank you so much.

359
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,540
Bye bye.

360
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,180
Hi, Brian Birmingham again.

361
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,420
Just trying on this different number I found on the internet.

362
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,600
Apparently it's the same.

363
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,740
Anyway, I'd like to join, but I'm broke.

364
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,000
Slack, Slack, Slack.

365
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,480
And I emailed too.

366
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,080
Thanks a lot.

367
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:22,640
Bye bye.

368
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,600
Yes, he did email too.

369
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,380
That's correct.

370
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,320
One other thing.

371
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,280
This is Brian again.

372
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,400
Sorry if it's a bother.

373
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,440
It is.

374
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,180
If it means anything to you, I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

375
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,060
It doesn't.

376
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,520
And lived up here in Boston.

377
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,140
I have for about four years.

378
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:45,460
But I remember from way back in the day, so to speak, the subgenius.

379
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,380
Thanks for your time.

380
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:48,760
Bye bye.

381
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,740
You're not welcome.

382
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,540
Hi, my name is Brian.

383
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,240
I called last week also.

384
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,360
Never received any reply.

385
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,380
What?

386
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,280
Please return my call at 630221.

387
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,520
I feel your earliest convenience.

388
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,900
I'd like to talk to you about becoming ordained, but I'm tenuous.

389
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,080
Thank you.

390
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:12,540
Bye.

391
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,080
Hi.

392
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,100
This is Brian again.

393
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,700
I'll tell you my reason for asking for this.

394
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,140
He's persistent.

395
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:26,220
I've been inspired with a really strong passion.

396
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:26,220


397
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,660
cool organization name that I'd like to choose.

398
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,120
And as well, I have no money.

399
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,020
So I've emailed as well as called a couple of times.

400
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,240
Please call me if you can.

401
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,740
I'd love to talk with you about this.

402
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,740
And I'm from Dallas.

403
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,720
Born and raised.

404
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,320
So thank you so much.

405
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,980
He really shouldn't have said anything about...

406
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,140
Oh, bye.

407
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,960
Shouldn't have said anything about being from Dallas, really.

408
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,380
Hi, Brian Bullock again.

409
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,740
I understand your position about my mysterious stranger

410
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,580
that I am.

411
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,420
Sent you an email earlier today.

412
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,520
And I am looking forward to your reply.

413
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,580
So God bless you.

414
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,340
Bye-bye.

415
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,260
Yeah.

416
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:07,860
Okay.

417
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,100
Well, now, you see, just as you were too busy

418
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,540
to type out an informative email about why,

419
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,440
besides your funny name,

420
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,240
we should give you something for nothing,

421
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,820
I, likewise, am too busy to take phone calls

422
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,720
from mysterious strangers.

423
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,720
Unless they're donating to this station.

424
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,060
Also, I'm partially deaf and avoid phones.

425
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:32,760
So good luck.

426
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,500
We hear the Flying Spaghetti Monster folks are recruiting

427
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,080
and the Discordians have always offered

428
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,700
all their services for free.

429
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,720
They may have a greater need for funny names than we do.

430
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,040
So maybe you should write them.

431
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,220
Friends, everybody's a critic

432
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,820
and nobody's calling 216-687-6900.

433
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,720
That's 687-6900.

434
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:55,720


435
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:55,720


436
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,820
Besides, Dr.

437
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,780
Well, I can tell you who else did.

438
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,500
Oh, we actually got another call.

439
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,040
We got Reverend Wombat himself.

440
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,160
No!

441
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:04,920
Yes.

442
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,160
From Australia.

443
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,580
Actually, he's living in California nowadays.

444
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,900
Well, poor guy.

445
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,900
Well, or rich.

446
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,780
He stood up, though.

447
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,060
He stood up for CSB,

448
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,020
even though he lives thousands of miles away.

449
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:19,880
All right.

450
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,340
Friends, that's what the Internet is all about.

451
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,220
That's why it exists.

452
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,560
And here's another.

453
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,140
Letter we got from somebody

454
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,160
who wants to tell us our business.

455
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,760
Hello, Ivan Stang.

456
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,360
Please use torrents to distribute

457
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,600
the Hour of Slack MP3s and Og Vorbis.

458
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,040
This will cut down on web hosting costs.

459
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,620
You worry me with all this Apple nonsense talk.

460
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,080
I think the young Stangs are steering you

461
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,360
in the wrong direction.

462
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,660
Yosemite Sam crying about being out of money.

463
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,200
As for jobs, good riddance

464
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,640
to that.

465
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,240
Egotistical, non-techie POS.

466
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,460
Style and design loser.

467
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,480
Well, I'm sorry that Steve Jobs

468
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,480
suddenly upset this listener so greatly

469
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,740
that he had to go into a spontaneous rant

470
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,080
about that style and design loser.

471
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,440
I have a theory about people

472
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,340
who judge others on their operating system

473
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:24,000
or their favorite bands

474
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,720
or their...

475
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,840
clothes they wear

476
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,360
or their haircuts.

477
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,400
And again, the Flying Spaghetti Monster people

478
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,420
are hiring.

479
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,540
Well, I made fun of that guy

480
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,000
and I said, wow, you must be really broke

481
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,020
if you hate Apple that much

482
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:44,960
or something like that.

483
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,340
And he goes, actually, I'm not broke

484
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,020
because I don't buy Apple products.

485
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,500
I was kind of picturing Yosemite Sam

486
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,760
bitching about being broke.

487
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,440
Did Jobs ever send Dobbs 30 bucks?

488
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,720
Or in the old days, 20 bucks?

489
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:55,720


490
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:55,720


491
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:55,720


492
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,160
$25?

493
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,180
I don't remember the 25.

494
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,180
I did.

495
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,220
Jobs was about all look and feel

496
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,100
instead of bang for the buck.

497
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,080
I have an Asus I bought at the mall for $350.

498
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,780
It has a 10.1 inch touchscreen

499
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,200
with good sized keyboard.

500
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,760
Fast as ever.

501
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,400
I'm running hacked Windows 8.1

502
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,200
with a lot of conspiracy apps scrapped from it.

503
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,100
I don't even have Java loaded.

504
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,680
Man, I'm so jealous.

505
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,980
So I suggested he try Mensa.org.

506
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,140
I said, that's for super aware folks like you.

507
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,780
Dumbasses aren't even allowed.

508
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,700
So you won't be worried by Apple users like me there.

509
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,460
And maybe they can put your diplomatic skills

510
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,500
to use as well.

511
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,300
And he wrote back and said,

512
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,960
yeah, but the church of the subgenius Bobby pin

513
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,780
already gets me laid.

514
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,440
Huge Robert Anton Wilson fan.

515
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,700
End of transmission.

516
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,900
So friends, don't you wish you were me?

517
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,240
Sitting there checking your snares, basically.

518
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,460
I go out and check the snares every morning

519
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,540
and see what animals we've caught.

520
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,960
If we've caught any $35 membership or any WCSB.

521
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,600
There's even some compliments.

522
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,000
And this is what we get, friends.

523
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,940
But we want to thank those of you who have been

524
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,520
and who aren't like that and did call

525
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,260
to make us know that you care.

526
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,380
Speaking of callers, I'm kind of half expecting Dave.

527
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,760
But that's not blinking, is it?

528
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:42,620
No.

529
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,200
That was just, see friends?

530
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,760
See, that just doesn't cut it.

531
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,520
That don't cut it.

532
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,280
That don't cut no eyes.

533
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,620
For $15 pledge, we also have some interesting things.

534
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,620
That y'all may like.

535
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,820
Because you're weird.

536
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,720
This is for weirdo obscure people.

537
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,420
When was the last time you played a VHS tape?

538
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,460
Well, if you're like me, that happens every couple of months.

539
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,960
There's always something that only exists on VHS.

540
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:15,080
And you're sharing it with others on YouTube.

541
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,820
Or you just dug it out because it's the only copy of...

542
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,260
Submit to me.

543
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:30,060
And submit to me now by Richard Kern that still exists.

544
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,040
But we have a few old VHS tapes around here.

545
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,900
Almost all horror and sci-fi.

546
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,260
And I wrote down the names of just a few.

547
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,320
There's a horror movie called Cupid.

548
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,200
I've never seen it, but it sounds really scary.

549
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:46,720
Yeah.

550
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,880
A horror movie about Cupid.

551
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,420
Mm-hmm.

552
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,640
Reptilian.

553
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,240
Not to be confused with...

554
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:54,920
Reptilicus.

555
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,100
I'm sure it's terrible, but the name is interesting.

556
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,960
The She-Creature.

557
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,160
And Not of This Earth.

558
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,820
And Earth vs. the Spider.

559
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,020
And the sad thing is, I bet they're all the sci-fi channel remakes

560
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,960
and not the original AIP Earth vs. the Spider.

561
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,220
She-Creature.

562
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,460
Or Not of This Earth.

563
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:14,740
Probably.

564
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:16,860
Um...

565
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:22,180
However, there's only one movie of the great H.G. Wells classic,

566
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,680
Things to Come.

567
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,480
And you can get a VHS tape of that fabulous...

568
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,420
It really is a cool movie.

569
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,820
A little dated.

570
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,380
I believe the future for them is 1985.

571
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,560
And World War II is still going on.

572
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,440
But you want to see Things to Come

573
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,500
if you aren't listening to this station and this show.

574
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,800
They also have books.

575
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,200
And I read down the list of books,

576
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,300
but I didn't see too much that would be interesting to subgeniuses,

577
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,060
but two for $20.

578
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,960
And both that I saw, the two I would get,

579
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,480
were Marvel Comics collections.

580
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,500
One was X-Men Origins,

581
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,040
and the other one was called Girl Comics.

582
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,180
Mmm...

583
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,640
Princess, what do you think that means?

584
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,500
I don't know.

585
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,620
It's Marvel, so would it be like She-Hulk?

586
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,860
Or would it be...

587
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,820
Romance stuff?

588
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,000
Did they ever do...

589
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,780
I don't even know.

590
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,020
I really don't know.

591
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,040
Friends, we're old.

592
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,300
Girl Comics.

593
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,220
We're old and we don't really know.

594
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,440
Although we did watch a...

595
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,360
Oh, no, this wasn't Marvel.

596
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,780
It was DC, of all things.

597
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,980
We saw the movie of The Dark Knight Returns.

598
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,720
Not the Christopher Nolan movies,

599
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,260
but an animated movie done from Frank Moore's original graphic novel

600
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,220
from the 80s,

601
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,060
the one that started that whole Batman cycle.

602
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,220
With the Tim Burton movies,

603
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,000
and then the really, really bad ones,

604
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,040
and then the pretty good ones.

605
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,460
That all started with The Dark Knight Returns,

606
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,440
a graphic novel.

607
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,300
And the station doesn't have that,

608
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,120
and I don't care.

609
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,860
I don't even care.

610
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,340
Well, you know who does care?

611
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:08,960
Who?

612
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,320
Reverend Sigmund Void cares.

613
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,700
And he has put his money where his mouth was,

614
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,120
and he donated it to WCSB.

615
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,300
What a guy!

616
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,740
All right, Sigmund.

617
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,600
Now, see, that's a...

618
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,040
What kind of a name is that?

619
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,800
His name is Void.

620
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,640
You know, I've known some good Voids and some bad Voids.

621
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:26,980
Yes!

622
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,220
Sigmund Void.

623
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,940
But friends, now see,

624
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,580
you can get your name shouted out on the radio

625
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,800
and be famous as a good person

626
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,880
instead of famous as a jerk.

627
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,760
Because we've made a couple of jerks famous.

628
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:49,560
What other jerks have I got queued up there?

629
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,120
Let's see.

630
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,680
Poor Josh.

631
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,520
Oh, here's a good jerk.

632
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,880
But, um, let me make sure I'm doing this right.

633
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,200
This will be track five.

634
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,660
Okay.

635
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,040
How about this jerk, friends?

636
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,400
Dear friends, this is your dear pastor,

637
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,780
Reverend Ivan Stang, calling out to you

638
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,400
from the depths of my heart.

639
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,840
And I can see so many of you sitting there hovering

640
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,280
by your phones, waiting.

641
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,380
Now, the phones are ringing here.

642
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,280
We're doing great.

643
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,880
This time we got all the beautiful girls,

644
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,440
the mighty studliest of genius ministers sitting here.

645
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,880
Actually, friends, that wasn't the jerk I meant.

646
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,420
That sounded like some little punk boy,

647
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,900
Reverend Ivan Stang, as a baby.

648
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,360
Yeah, that was probably me at that Dallas station

649
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,980
that kicked us out because we made fun of liberals one time.

650
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,860
Actually, that wasn't the reason.

651
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,900
But, oh, here's the jerk I was thinking of,

652
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,240
the jerk on my message machine.

653
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:57,780
The concept of a clear message could also preclude

654
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,280
that the call was about anything, I suppose,

655
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,580
even though the message was itself very, very clear.

656
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,760
And to the point, or to no point,

657
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,840
and yet, what was the message?

658
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,760
What was it about?

659
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,700
I don't know.

660
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,940
Princess Wee, do you know?

661
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:22,940
Do you care?

662
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,540
Do you know who that was?

663
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:30,060
It sounded like Reverend Philodrumas.

664
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,240
It was Dr. Philodrumas.

665
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,420
He was, he's one of the jerks that leaves

666
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:39,520
non-sequitur messages filling up my phone.

667
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,900
What happened to Dave?

668
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,260
You know, Dave was going to try to call tonight,

669
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,480
even though our phones are crazy.

670
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,920
Maybe his phones got crazy, too.

671
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,660
I don't know.

672
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,840
I don't know what's going on here.

673
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,440
Friends, I'm going to play some music for you

674
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,560
for a little while to give my lips a rest from flapping.

675
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,120
We're not getting quite the number and amounts

676
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,060
that we were dreaming of,

677
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,660
which were involved a lot more zeros

678
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,960
than we're seeing so far.

679
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,980
So remember the number to call 687-6900

680
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,780
in the Cleveland area,

681
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,880
or if you're out of town,

682
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,940
you can call the

683
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:20,940


684
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:25,460
That's area code 216-687-6900.

685
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,740
The music in the background has been

686
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,920
the Flyin' Ryan bros,

687
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,940
but I'm going to play a live tune

688
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,960
by my old favorite band,

689
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:36,880
the Rainmakers,

690
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,540
called Reckoning Day,

691
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,200
because that's what day this is,

692
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,120
Reckoning Day.

693
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,560
Reckoning Day

694
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,440
Well, I was thinking about Abraham Lincoln

695
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,180
And the enemies of the truth

696
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,980
But I could not tell

697
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:12,360
Kennedy from John Wilkes Booth

698
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,800
Out of my way

699
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,320
Out of my way

700
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,800
Out of my way

701
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,760
How do I get on Reckoning Day?

702
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,480
And I feel like picking a fight

703
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,140
With anybody who claims they're right

704
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,600
All the preacher men, the politicians

705
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,220
All the critics and the things they write

706
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,620
Out of my way

707
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,140
Out of my way

708
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,700
Out of my way

709
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,520
Hard rockin' on Reckoning Day

710
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,700
And this is a call to arms

711
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,060
This is a call to hands

712
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,800
This is a call to the buzzers

713
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,020
And the minds of the people

714
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,180
In every land

715
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,780
Out of my way

716
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,120
Out of my way

717
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,640
Out of my way

718
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,600
Hard rockin' on Reckoning Day

719
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,140
Reckoning Day

720
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,540
Put the money in the mattress

721
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:05,760
Reckoning Day

722
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,100
Put your penis in a couch

723
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:07,860
Reckoning Day

724
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,700
Is this the place?

725
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,720
Are these it?

726
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,480
For the donation?

727
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,180
Dave, Dave, you made it.

728
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:14,760
Dave?

729
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,240
Yes.

730
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,240
I wonder if this is the place

731
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,400
where they make the donation

732
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:24,000
to WCSB in Greenbridge.

733
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:24,940
You got it.

734
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,340
You got the right number.

735
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:30,580
And then they go to the 687-6900?

736
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,700
That's the one they call to make the gift.

737
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:40,120
Ah, do they have to put the piece of cheese

738
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,700
or a little baby onion

739
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:46,400
or perhaps a bouquet or a wrapper?

740
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,920
Or a...

741
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,320
Yes.

742
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,420
Yes, to all the above.

743
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,660
Ribbon on the gift?

744
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,560
Yes, all the above.

745
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,240
And then the stuff you've mentioned and more.

746
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,100
The piece of onion and the lilac blossom.

747
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,560
Lilac.

748
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,280
I like lilac.

749
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,400
It's good for incompetence.

750
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:09,020
I have bad incompetence.

751
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,220
My incompetence all went down my britches

752
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,020
and I'm all bad on incompetence.

753
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,840
Incompetence and incompetence.

754
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:18,480
I heard it.

755
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,080
I heard it and it leaked out.

756
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,960
You sound like you are losing your marbles in one sweaty poop.

757
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,080
I'm losing my precious bodily fluids.

758
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,040
We were set on auto-loads.

759
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,120
No, Manric.

760
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,420
We're on auto-loads.

761
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,440
Auto-loads.

762
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,240
I think we are living right now.

763
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,300
I'm auto-loading.

764
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,480
Now loading.

765
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,880
And that's going to be very, very painful.

766
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,580
Now loading.

767
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,700
Need the right shoes.

768
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,360
Size six.

769
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,120
Too big.

770
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,060
No more feet for you.

771
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,860
Secret code 687-6900.

772
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,100
That's the super cool code, kids.

773
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,120
Super cool code?

774
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,040
That's where the super cool kids call.

775
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,760
687-6900.

776
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,340
No, is that cool?

777
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:21,120
They revel out some stupid stuff that makes no difference to anyone.

778
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,680
And it's too much.

779
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,020
It becomes a cult favorite among everyone.

780
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,420
Funny how that happens.

781
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,120
How does that happen, man?

782
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:34,000
Some stuff dribbles out and somebody picks it up and turns it into a whole religion.

783
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,380
Yeah.

784
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:41,300
The state of Utah used to be a tropical jungle and look at it now.

785
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:42,640
Yep.

786
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,640
And it's all because of the dribble.

787
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,700
Mm-hmm.

788
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:46,900
That's the only thing.

789
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,800
I think that's why.

790
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:48,640
And you know who?

791
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,200
Howard Hughes was involved, too.

792
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:55,200
The guy when he had breast reduction surgery in the early days.

793
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,440
Charlie and Charlie Egmore.

794
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,080
It's the wave of the future.

795
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,920
It's the wave of the future.

796
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,180
Yep.

797
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,680
It's the wave of the future.

798
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,560
We got a pledge from APO Stacey.

799
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,000
What a mystery.

800
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,780
What a mystery.

801
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:13,800
It is.

802
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,800
That's APO Stacey.

803
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,240
You know, it's funny.

804
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,860
By coincidence, that name.

805
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:23,840
I wonder if anyone's ever told her that when you put those letters out, it almost looks

806
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,840
like it says apostasy.

807
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,360
Yeah.

808
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:32,000
Because that's those little marks you put over a word to make it mean there's more than

809
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,680
one, right?

810
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,280
Don't think that she hasn't thought of these things.

811
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,240
Or when something belongs to something, you say, if it's the dog's bowl, you say, that's

812
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:40,920
its bowl.

813
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:48,740
You put it and the apostasy and then the S, and that means that it's ... And that's the

814
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,660
same when you go herd.

815
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,820
No, you've got that backwards.

816
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:56,880
You go her, apostasy, S, and his, H-I, apostasy, S.

817
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,820
It is just an H-I-C-S.

818
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,180
And that shows you're not ignorant.

819
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:03,500
But thank you, apostasy, Reverend APO Stacey.

820
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,400
Miss Torrey, how she manages to put up with this show.

821
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,980
It is a Miss Torrey.

822
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,420
Quite a Miss Torrey.

823
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,520
Obviously, APO Stacey is ... I'm sorry.

824
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,700
I just ... Of course that is.

825
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,240
That's one of the third laws of rhetorical knowledge.

826
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:19,640
It's a myth.

827
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:19,640


828
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:19,640


829
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:19,640


830
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,140
It's being able to baffle people with names like that.

831
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:28,240
And of course, he figured it out quite easily because it's perfectly plain to see.

832
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,640
I'm sorry I took so much time agreeing with you.

833
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:37,000
Dave, did you know that when you join the Church of the Subgenius or donate to WCSB,

834
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:41,880
you have the right to make up any funny name for yourself and a title?

835
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:47,460
But that's the only way you can do that, is to join the Church of the Subgenius or pledge

836
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,100
to WCSB, or both.

837
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,200
Or both would be best.

838
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:56,840
But pledge to CSB is of the utmost importance because of the community service wonderful

839
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,540
WCSB provides to its native inhabitants.

840
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:06,680
Included on the left, Miss Laurence Lottie Seals, our program mistress, kind of a little

841
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:10,220
joke among some of the guys down in the basement who've never been released.

842
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,020
Yeah, yeah.

843
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,160
Uh-oh.

844
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,380
Six, seven, 6,900.

845
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,080
Uh-oh.

846
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,080
Six, eight, seven, 6,900.

847
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:29,100
And that is the number to call because what you're seeing right now is not only useful

848
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,340
for everything in your home.

849
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:35,400
If you make a $20 pledge, Stangy, tell them what they'll get with a $20 pledge.

850
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:40,640
A $20 pledge, you get a Subgenius button with the Bob Cloy's and A pen on it.

851
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:45,560
It's a metal, a Dobbs head pen that looks like it would be a cuff link.

852
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,780
In fact, we had cuff links, but they're sold out.

853
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:57,200
And friends, you can have that WCSB, I mean that Subgenius slick-looking metal pen, multicolored

854
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,920
Dobbs head as seen in the Subgenius.com catalog under new crap.

855
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,500
Completely faithful here.

856
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:03,560
Yes.

857
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:11,000
And, or, well actually and, you can get one of the black ceramic travel mug, the green

858
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,460
casual cap, black Trepiker's cap, or the pom-pom hat, all with WCSB logo.

859
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,760
By the way, did I mention that?

860
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,600
Remember, the WCSB logo on the T-shirts is done like the Star Wars logo.

861
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:30,760
And so it looks like as if you think it says Star Wars, and then it turns out it's WCSB,

862
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:34,180
it's just in that same funny Star Wars font.

863
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,080
It's tricky that way.

864
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,360
That's knowing.

865
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,300
It fakes you out.

866
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:42,740
Didn't you have some peacenik Star Wars shirt, Princess Wee?

867
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,660
Stop Wars.

868
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,620
Yes, I have a Stop Wars.

869
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,640
Yes, and it was written in Star Wars.

870
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:47,740
Stop Wars.

871
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,020
logo talk

872
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,180
font.

873
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,260
That's a mid-

874
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,880
in the 1970s

875
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,480
type of

876
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,200
computer font.

877
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,400
Didn't you understand

878
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,440
from the dawn of

879
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,120
history there have always been people

880
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,320
trying to get a font on everyone else?

881
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,240
Yes.

882
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,880
I'm sorry.

883
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,300
I know that.

884
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,440
My personal favorite

885
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,700
font, Dave,

886
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,660
is Times Roman.

887
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,640
So is mine.

888
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,220
It looks like textbooks

889
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,480
fonts.

890
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,360
Very similar to paperbacks.

891
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,120
Yes.

892
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,480
And newspapers.

893
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,940
You can say the most absurd

894
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,120
things, but when it's in Times Roman

895
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,860
font, it looks like

896
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,600
it's important and true.

897
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,220
And believable.

898
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,980
Whereas if you use Helvetica or some

899
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:45,180
modern sans serif

900
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,440
font or

901
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,240
God forbid, comics

902
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,160
font,

903
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,960
then you're just

904
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,780
well, that just seems

905
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,600
silly and frivolous.

906
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,760
It doesn't carry the weight

907
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,040
of

908
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,960
your Times Roman.

909
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,760
Much less

910
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,080
your Times Roman bold.

911
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,740
Especially, you know, if you're

912
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,640
middle, if you're not only your

913
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,820
third nostril, but the very, very

914
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,740
middle point of your third

915
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,240
nostril is in point of east,

916
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,260
you're going to have a hard time

917
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,320
arguing with Jelly Belly and some of the

918
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,000
big other fat guys around the table.

919
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,160
Because they have infinite

920
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,020
wisdom. And we just have a little

921
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,280
team spec until we call

922
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,620
687-6900

923
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,120
and pledge $20 right now.

924
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,220
That's why I'm so fond

925
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:34,900
of that font.

926
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,380
Me too.

927
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:40,320
Really, friends, we do actually

928
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,720
the station needs the money

929
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,080
so that

930
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,180
people like me won't have to

931
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:46,640
like

932
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,040
get a real job.

933
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:49,780
No. Yeah.

934
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,060
Yeah. And see, here's the thing.

935
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,240
I want to be able to

936
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,900
give all my money away.

937
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,920
I want to be so rich that I

938
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,980
give everything away and have

939
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,920
nothing. And that'll make me feel like

940
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,800
a richer man. See?

941
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:07,040
But I can't do that unless you help, friends.

942
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,860
You have to start that

943
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,660
process by being

944
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,440
the richest one of all

945
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,840
and being the first to give us all

946
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,960
your money. Well,

947
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,980
and then we'll be so rich

948
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,700
we can give it all back

949
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,080
to everybody. We're already doing

950
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,760
that. We just haven't been paid for it.

951
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:23,980
See?

952
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,960
But we're not redistributing

953
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,480
the wealth or redistributing

954
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,620
the wealth or anything.

955
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,040
Any kind of political notion like

956
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,860
that. It's just a way

957
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,600
of you showing that you're really

958
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,540
freaking wonderful.

959
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,000
Just because you support community

960
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,700
radio like WCSB,

961
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,120
which is Cleveland State's eye

962
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,340
on the world, when you really think about the programs

963
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:45,740
available,

964
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:48,040
and especially the hour

965
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:48,800
of storm.

966
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,080
Well, you know, when I'm out on the street,

967
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:53,940
and I'm sure this is true of every

968
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,920
listener, if somebody

969
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,080
walks up to me and says, hello, sir,

970
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,160
I'd like to, well, if

971
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,140
they're not wearing a WCSB t-shirt

972
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,120
or a Bob shirt, I'm not going to give them

973
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,740
the time of day. Whereas

974
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,700
obviously, the exact

975
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,980
opposite is. If they're

976
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,880
wearing a CSB t-shirt or

977
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,080
cap, they walk up and go,

978
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,800
sir, could I try? And I go, I'll try.

979
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,620
Where do I sign?

980
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,160
You have telegraphed coolness.

981
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:21,680
How much do you want? How high do you want me to jump?

982
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,300
Instantly. I'm your friend.

983
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,200
You put that limousine

984
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,460
cab driver's hat on right away,

985
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,620
and you say, step right in, sir. Anything you demand.

986
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,300
You can keep your heart's desire.

987
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,540
And did you know that if you

988
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,960
come to the WCSB

989
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,300
open house to

990
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,540
pick up your pledge premium, or to

991
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,780
actually hand

992
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,060
over your hard-earned cash,

993
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,640
here at the station, you can actually come to

994
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,560
the station November 22nd, that's

995
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,280
Kennedy Day, or November

996
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,220
24th. Princess

997
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,760
Wee and I will be here

998
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,720
some of the time.

999
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,540
And Dr. Sinister will be

1000
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,280
here. We met many of the famous

1001
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,420
listeners of the Dr. Sinister show

1002
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:03,420
who are allowed to call in. Yes, and

1003
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,000
lots of interesting people come.

1004
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,260
Right. We even meet their parents

1005
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,520
sometimes. Yes. Because they have

1006
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,940
to be brought here.

1007
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,340
Speaking of Kennedy, we sound like

1008
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,640
Marilyn Monroe lately.

1009
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,460
Who? Princess Wee sounds like

1010
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,460
Marilyn Monroe? Yeah, lately

1011
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,440
she sounds like Marilyn Monroe. What's up with that?

1012
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,280
I'm sorry, when you said Kennedy,

1013
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,400
she said, I don't know.

1014
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,360
Happy birthday, Mr.

1015
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,560
President.

1016
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,180
Mr. High Scribe.

1017
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:32,500
I mean...

1018
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,920
Happy birthday, Mr.

1019
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,300
Hyde. Happy

1020
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,340
birthday to you. You're all

1021
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:41,460
Dorigo. Reverend

1022
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,660
Hyde. That's Reverend Hyde,

1023
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,180
sir. It's Mr.

1024
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,460
Jekyll. You can call me Mr. Jekyll

1025
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,000
or Reverend Hyde.

1026
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,260
Yes, please.

1027
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,220
Friends, 687-6900.

1028
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,380
We're not just...

1029
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,160
This isn't just a big J-O.

1030
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,440
That's not all it is,

1031
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:01,660
is what I'm saying. No, actually,

1032
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,140
the transmitter here

1033
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,320
is aging and needs to be

1034
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,460
replaced, and the needles

1035
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,340
that play the vinyl that

1036
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,500
you're so lucky to get to hear,

1037
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:13,980
those needles are

1038
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:14,440
expensive.

1039
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,600
Is that your way of making fun of me

1040
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,560
and my hearing problems and my

1041
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,500
aging? No, not at all.

1042
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:22,940
No, not at all.

1043
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,600
Absolutely not. You mean you're serious? The transmitter

1044
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,980
really does need to be

1045
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,160
replaced? Absolutely.

1046
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,620
I don't make these things up.

1047
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,460
And friends, as you've heard over

1048
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,580
the weeks, the phone lines have

1049
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,460
needed repair, although strangely enough,

1050
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,200
tonight it seems like it's fine.

1051
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,440
And our monitor that allows

1052
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,400
us to see if anyone is breaking into

1053
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,280
our cars. That's all

1054
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,380
so broken. Oh my gosh, that is.

1055
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,120
Somebody could be broken into the car.

1056
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,160
Everything. So we need donations

1057
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,340
so we can continue to go forward

1058
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:54,920
and not be stumbling.

1059
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,280
Now she sounds like Emma

1060
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,300
Watson. That's that girl in

1061
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,080
Harry Potter. I caught the Brit from her.

1062
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,160
Talk like she does in that movie

1063
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,300
This is the End. Yeah, only don't

1064
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,800
make the same smelly sounds.

1065
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,460
Give me all of your drinks

1066
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,380
or I'll kill you.

1067
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,180
Something like that. She's a

1068
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,040
pretty good in This is the End.

1069
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,100
But you still need the breast

1070
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,340
implant, Stang. Let's just face it.

1071
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,600
I'm serious. No kidding.

1072
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:25,120
You're an email kind of guy. You can't even go

1073
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:25,980
into Monty Python.

1074
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,620
No, you

1075
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:33,160
gotta sound like Stang kind of almost

1076
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:33,880
doing a girl.

1077
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,940
I wish I was a

1078
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:43,040
girly just like my dear

1079
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:43,480
mama.

1080
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:44,120
Bye-bye.

1081
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,200
And we are.

1082
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,600
I'm sorry. I just love that song so much.

1083
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:50,660
It makes me want to call

1084
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,020
687-6900.

1085
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,680
Be a lumberjack.

1086
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,260
Be out there among the mighty giant

1087
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,400
fur of the Scots pine and rip

1088
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,540
off your shirt and have some weird

1089
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,520
guys with funny looking hats behind you

1090
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,200
and stuff like that. Smell that sweat.

1091
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,340
It's pledged. $50. Hell with

1092
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,320
this $20 stuff. Why be

1093
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,720
a yammy-pammy wuss?

1094
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,380
Send $50 and make sure the

1095
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,260
station stays on the air because you need to.

1096
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:16,580
It needs to be on the air

1097
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:19,300
almost as much as the Reverend Ivan Stang

1098
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,360
needs a podium to pull

1099
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,460
his forceps from.

1100
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,740
I don't need an audience, friends.

1101
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,180
All I need is a podium.

1102
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,540
We don't care if you listen.

1103
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,560
We just want to be able to broadcast.

1104
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:32,200
No, wait. That doesn't sound right.

1105
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,240
But we will give you an audience with a high

1106
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,180
E-pop anytime you

1107
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,280
pop in 89.3

1108
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,280
on your radio dial.

1109
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:40,840
That's right.

1110
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:43,140
You will be glad you did.

1111
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,020
You can talk to Bob anytime.

1112
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:47,900
You can be alone with Bob.

1113
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,840
You can come right to the station

1114
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,660
at Open House and be alone

1115
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:52,580
with Bob.

1116
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,740
You can psychotronically fondle Bob

1117
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:58,120
in your own membranes of your own

1118
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,240
We can put you

1119
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,280
in a room and say

1120
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,120
Okay, you're alone with

1121
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,060
Bob in here now.

1122
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,940
You're with Bob and yet you're alone.

1123
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,060
How about them apples?

1124
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,760
Schmapple. Credlapple.

1125
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:12,500
Schmedlapple.

1126
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,180
See, you've got your

1127
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:15,240
cultural parents.

1128
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,500
Paralloxism right there.

1129
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,600
It's a paradox.

1130
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,540
How can you be alone when you're in two places

1131
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:22,880
at once with Bob?

1132
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,620
And that's why you've got to call

1133
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,620
right now because if you don't call right now

1134
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:29,500
you're condemned to an

1135
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,140
inferior form of lifestyle.

1136
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:33,100
Let's face it, friends.

1137
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,640
If you haven't contributed

1138
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,520
to an alternative

1139
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,100
or a station that

1140
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,500
really, really needs funding because

1141
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,260
it gets support from the public and you

1142
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:45,040
listen every damn

1143
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:47,440
stinking day, 24 hours

1144
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,180
a day, you're like

1145
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:51,080
and you're enjoying

1146
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,260
the music and you're listening to the crazy stuff

1147
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:54,100
and everything like that.

1148
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,820
What do you do to support it?

1149
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,060
Absolutely nothing.

1150
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,300
What he said.

1151
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:02,940
What he said.

1152
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,420
What he's saying.

1153
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:06,960
I'm sorry.

1154
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,340
It makes WCSB have that

1155
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,920
taken for granted feel.

1156
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:13,000
We want to know that you

1157
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:13,380
care.

1158
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:17,200
We want to know that you tear.

1159
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:18,960
Tear.

1160
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:19,480
Tear.

1161
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,140
Right down the middle.

1162
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:25,140
We want to know if your foreskin

1163
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:26,540
is strong enough

1164
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:29,100
to withstand all the terrible

1165
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:30,700
incredible tortures

1166
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,340
arranged for you in advance

1167
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,360
and so forth

1168
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,640
and things like that.

1169
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,000
I don't like it

1170
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,320
when I see you putting

1171
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,720
those rubber gloves on.

1172
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,640
Princess was laughing

1173
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,560
because she heard me say those words

1174
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,420
to a doctor.

1175
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:53,480
It makes him quite nervous

1176
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,240
when she slaps on the plastic gloves.

1177
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:58,660
When you want to have

1178
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,640
your areas explored like that,

1179
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:03,040
you don't go to an anthropologist,

1180
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:05,220
you go to an endocrinologist.

1181
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:05,460
A cop.

1182
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,620
Because a cop will do it at a moment's notice

1183
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:09,900
at the drop of a pant.

1184
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,280
They'll give you a cavity search for free.

1185
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,560
Friends, and this station wants

1186
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,920
to do that for you

1187
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,600
if you'll just let us.

1188
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:19,560
But you have to enable us.

1189
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:22,180
You can't always

1190
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:25,380
get what you won't.

1191
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,800
But you can be

1192
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,520
what you won't.

1193
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,260
As Dr. Philo Drummond said,

1194
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:33,180
you can be what you won't.

1195
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,960
You won't really be

1196
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,320
a great

1197
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:38,900
philosophical millionaire

1198
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:41,480
that gives money to people

1199
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,760
but you can still be one

1200
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,800
by giving everything

1201
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:46,980
you can spare

1202
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,960
to WCSB.

1203
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:49,860
It's not...

1204
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:52,920
Who do you think Bob cares the most about?

1205
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:55,020
The rich man who could give

1206
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,640
a million dollars but only gave

1207
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,320
$25,000 or the little old lady

1208
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,400
who gave her last?

1209
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:02,940
That's right. He don't care about

1210
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:04,680
that rich guy or the little old lady.

1211
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,940
He cares about the Neanderthal man

1212
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,760
because he's your ancestor

1213
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:09,640
and mine.

1214
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,760
I thought he cared about the WCSB listeners

1215
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:13,740
most of all.

1216
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,920
The Neanderthal men

1217
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,760
and ladies who listen to WCSB.

1218
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:18,880
Right.

1219
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,300
The proto-men and women.

1220
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,760
The ur-beings.

1221
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:24,840
Right.

1222
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:27,260
The Yetinsani. The Yetis.

1223
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,780
You know, the sons of Bigfoot.

1224
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,160
The daughters of the Sasquatch.

1225
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:33,720
Dang, shut up.

1226
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:35,300
The WCSB listeners.

1227
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,440
The sub-bean listeners.

1228
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:38,320
Bob's people.

1229
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:41,100
People who speak Bob's language.

1230
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,500
I refuse any kind of credit or money

1231
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:43,740
for...

1232
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,760
from Cro-Manyans either.

1233
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:47,360
If they want to send us $20 in,

1234
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:49,400
they can send one of those

1235
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:50,880
little...

1236
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,500
What's the thing hanging from your

1237
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,720
medulla oblongata?

1238
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:55,800
The tea chain.

1239
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,380
The tea chain.

1240
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,220
You can have a tea chain.

1241
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:58,820
You feel a...

1242
00:52:58,820 --> 00:52:59,480
You feel a...

1243
00:52:59,480 --> 00:52:59,760
You feel a...

1244
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,500
Read your mind

1245
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,920
and then list everything wrong with you

1246
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,120
in plain sight.

1247
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:08,040
Yeah, the beeper.

1248
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,760
Things don't be like the beeper.

1249
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,000
Be like the leaper.

1250
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,880
And Mr. Lemur.

1251
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:19,940
And all the other great subgeniuses.

1252
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,360
Be like Spring-Heeled Jack.

1253
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,940
Don't be like Slumpin' Eddie.

1254
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,300
Don't be like

1255
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:28,320
Tiny Mumblebunt.

1256
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,760
Be like Spring-Heeled Jack

1257
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,820
springing over the telephone lines

1258
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:33,440
to call

1259
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,320
687-6900

1260
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:39,220
and 216-SERY-CODE.

1261
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,780
Don't be like those people

1262
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:42,740
who leave messages

1263
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,680
on my machine

1264
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,920
that I play on this show

1265
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,920
to make fun of them.

1266
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:47,460
No, they want to make the gift

1267
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,160
so they can have that great feeling

1268
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:49,920
that they get

1269
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,160
when you make a gift

1270
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:51,860
and they know

1271
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:52,760
that they helped

1272
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,740
keep the radio station going.

1273
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:55,620
And they do a purchase too.

1274
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,000
I like it when they make purchases.

1275
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,140
How about...

1276
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,100
They can make a purchase.

1277
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,840
They can purchase a donation.

1278
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,280
You've got a very hip relative and stuff.

1279
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,880
Why not give them a gift,

1280
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,120
a Christmas gift

1281
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,020
or holiday greetings gift card

1282
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,200
of...

1283
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:12,740
Of...

1284
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:12,740


1285
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:12,740


1286
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:12,740


1287
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:12,740


1288
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:12,740


1289
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:12,740


1290
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:12,740


1291
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:12,740


1292
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:12,740


1293
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:12,740


1294
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:14,000
Of WCSB.

1295
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:14,900
And then they'll wonder

1296
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:15,660
what the hell...

1297
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,900
They'll be forced to listen

1298
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:18,560
to the station

1299
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,100
just to see what it's like.

1300
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:21,660
Literally forced.

1301
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:22,400
Where is this...

1302
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,300
In chains

1303
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,280
and those weird manacles and stuff.

1304
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,300
That's why they call it

1305
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:27,260
forced skin.

1306
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,080
Exactly.

1307
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,800
It forces your skin

1308
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,960
to peel off your ears

1309
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:33,720
so you can hear

1310
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,980
the greatest stations.

1311
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,680
To reassign itself

1312
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:37,820
to different locations

1313
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,120
that you can get anywhere

1314
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:39,940
while you're riding

1315
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:40,880
in the elephant,

1316
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,220
the tubes,

1317
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:43,500
or the...

1318
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:43,840
You know,

1319
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:45,120
any of the great conventions

1320
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,700
we have in Cleveland right now

1321
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,220
in the year 2073.

1322
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:49,840
I didn't know...

1323
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,180
Send in that call.

1324
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:51,720
I didn't even...

1325
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:51,740
Call.

1326
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:53,200
I didn't either.

1327
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:54,320
67...

1328
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:55,540
6900.

1329
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:57,820
The number to call.

1330
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:58,780
to talk to Dave.

1331
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,360
Yeah, man.

1332
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,500
You can call...

1333
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,920
Dave is on the phone lines

1334
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:03,520
right now.

1335
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,140
You can call him

1336
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:05,980
and talk to him

1337
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:07,220
and give him

1338
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,760
all your expensive information.

1339
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:12,260
And that consists of...

1340
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:13,000
Hey.

1341
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:13,280


1342
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,140
Hey.

1343
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:15,460
Hey.

1344
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:17,580
Hey.

1345
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:17,640
Hey.

1346
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:17,900
Hey.

1347
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:18,620
Hey.

1348
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:18,780


1349
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:18,800


1350
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:18,800


1351
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,020
Hey.

1352
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:19,120
Hey.

1353
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:19,300
Hey.

1354
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:20,280
Hey.

1355
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:20,540
Hey.

1356
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:21,380
Hey.

1357
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:21,720
Hey.

1358
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:21,720


1359
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:22,700
Hey.

1360
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:23,200
Hey.

1361
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:23,400
Hey.

1362
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:23,400


1363
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:23,400


1364
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:23,400


1365
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:23,560
Hey.

1366
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:23,560


1367
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:23,560


1368
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:23,560


1369
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:23,560


1370
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:23,560


1371
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:23,560


1372
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:23,560


1373
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:23,560


1374
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:23,560


1375
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,800
I love this.

1376
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,320
It is 11-12 in Japan right now

1377
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,820
and people are having arguments

1378
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:30,620
and two-fakes

1379
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:32,160
and people getting divorced

1380
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:32,820
and everything

1381
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:35,600
because of some religious holiday

1382
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,500
in the Shinjuku Island

1383
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,080
or something.

1384
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:39,960
And their jello is melting too.

1385
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:41,260
Exactly.

1386
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,200
Because of Fukushima.

1387
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:42,520
Fukushima.

1388
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:43,860
And nobody really cares.

1389
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:44,340
Right.

1390
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,560
Unless you really could care.

1391
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:46,660
If you want to really care,

1392
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,840
you could send in 687...

1393
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,520
I mean, you could call 687-6900

1394
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:55,860
and pledge at least something.

1395
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:56,360
Pledge.

1396
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:59,560
To WCSB 89.3 Cleveland

1397
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,340
and be glad you did

1398
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:02,720
and you will.

1399
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,760
There's no cure

1400
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:05,960
for a lot of the malaise

1401
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:06,580
that's going around.

1402
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,540
It's very, very deep.

1403
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:10,340
It's in our culture.

1404
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,780
Things are not as good

1405
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:12,240
as they used to be.

1406
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:13,820
Whatever the hell that means.

1407
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:15,540
But somehow,

1408
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,720
if you pledge now,

1409
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,360
from the bottom

1410
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,420
of the smelly parts

1411
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:21,160
of your heart,

1412
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:22,900
you will in some way

1413
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:23,520
be rewarded.

1414
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,300
Absolutely.

1415
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:24,820
By yourself.

1416
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,760
You'll have a lasting lift.

1417
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,220
That's our favorite part

1418
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,280
of your heart too.

1419
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:30,800
I mean,

1420
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:31,540
you might as well

1421
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:32,820
pull your pants down

1422
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:33,380
or up

1423
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:34,700
whichever way they have to go

1424
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:35,500
when it's important

1425
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,840
right now

1426
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,060
in anticipation

1427
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:39,540
of the delight

1428
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,560
and the deep

1429
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,280
aromatic pleasures

1430
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,780
you will enjoy

1431
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:46,640
of making a simple

1432
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,860
common pledge.

1433
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:52,600
Yes,

1434
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,140
my little darling.

1435
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:54,880
It turns me on

1436
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,260
when Dave talks like that.

1437
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:56,760
Me too.

1438
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:57,300
Yeah.

1439
00:56:58,740 --> 00:56:59,660
It's quite easy

1440
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,380
to control them

1441
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,720
with this electric wrench.

1442
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:07,780
Oh, no!

1443
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:08,100
No!

1444
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,720
I feel the spirit.

1445
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:15,340
The spirit

1446
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:17,620
is moving in Cleveland tonight.

1447
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:19,540
And, uh,

1448
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,680
but, you know,

1449
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:21,400
this,

1450
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:22,760
it's,

1451
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,540
the time goes by so fast.

1452
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,160
We started a couple

1453
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,200
of minutes late.

1454
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:29,920
And what,

1455
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,280
what's old Dr. Sinister

1456
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,040
doing in there?

1457
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:33,300
Is he in the pocket?

1458
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:34,220
Oh, he's taking pledges

1459
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:35,140
from all of your

1460
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:35,620
generous,

1461
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,720
generous listeners.

1462
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:37,520
Oh, finally.

1463
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,340
Oh, now they want

1464
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:38,880
to get a call.

1465
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,700
In the very last few seconds

1466
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:41,460
they call in

1467
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:42,400
so that they can

1468
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,140
get a shout-out.

1469
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:43,840
Okay,

1470
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:44,940
Reverend Funny Name

1471
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:46,640
donated $5.

1472
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:47,300
Whoa!

1473
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,740
That's really big

1474
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:49,040
of you,

1475
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,080
Reverend Funny Name.

1476
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,940
No, but seriously.

1477
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:52,700
Thank you,

1478
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:53,860
Reverend Funny Name.

1479
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:54,880
Thank you, thank you.

1480
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,740
Reverend Funny Name

1481
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:57,760
only had $4.50

1482
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:58,440
when he pledged that.

1483
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,160
We have a shout-out

1484
00:57:59,160 --> 00:57:59,600
approaching.

1485
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:01,840
I can see that look

1486
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,580
on his face.

1487
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:02,960
Question.

1488
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:03,580
Something about

1489
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:04,240
Dobbshead Pen?

1490
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:04,820
Yeah,

1491
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,520
Dobbshead Pledge and A-Pen

1492
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,500
is the $20.00.

1493
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:07,500


1494
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,420
$20.00 and up

1495
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:09,840
subgenius premium.

1496
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:10,500
All right,

1497
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:10,860
thank you.

1498
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,560
The cloisonne.

1499
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:13,340
Back to Reverend

1500
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:14,080
Chocolate Velvet.

1501
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:15,600
Oh!

1502
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

1503
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:18,400
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1504
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,180
She's listening in

1505
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:20,000
from, I think,

1506
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,220
Colorado then.

1507
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:21,740
You see?

1508
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:22,140
Wow.

1509
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:22,780
Maybe a CSB.

1510
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:23,240
Wow.

1511
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:24,500
Here we bitch about

1512
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,280
the Transmittal.

1513
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:25,660
Oh,

1514
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,340
preternatural

1515
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:26,560
existence.

1516
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:28,640
She's warmed

1517
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,000
all of our hearts.

1518
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,780
We actually had a

1519
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:32,620
we have a

1520
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:34,040
Chocolate Velvet rant

1521
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,540
that Princess We

1522
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:36,940
is planning to read

1523
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:37,480
on the

1524
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:37,780
air.

1525
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:39,740
And this wasn't

1526
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:40,700
the night to do it,

1527
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:41,060
obviously.

1528
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:42,380
We had it ready

1529
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:43,220
for a couple of nights

1530
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:43,980
ago, but it wasn't

1531
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:44,620
quite ready

1532
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:45,500
because it was

1533
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,300
full of cussing.

1534
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,980
And you have to be

1535
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:49,220
very careful about that

1536
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:49,980
because we're not

1537
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:51,080
in safe hold.

1538
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:51,740
Nope.

1539
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:53,560
We're in prime time,

1540
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,000
baby.

1541
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:54,860
Prime time.

1542
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,140
But we're not for long

1543
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:58,120
because it's time for

1544
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:58,540
Friends,

1545
00:58:58,880 --> 00:58:59,480
you're listening to

1546
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,760
WCSB Cleveland,

1547
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,120
just in case you wondered.

1548
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:03,740
We have to say that

1549
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,060
near the top of the hour

1550
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:05,700
no matter what.

1551
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,500
And we want to,

1552
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,160
we'd like to.

1553
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,020
We'd love to.

1554
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:09,740
And we want to be able

1555
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:10,740
to keep saying that.

1556
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:12,000
And, uh,

1557
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:12,940
well, Dave,

1558
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:13,540
I'm going to have to

1559
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:14,560
let you go.

1560
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,260
Do we ever really

1561
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:17,680
have to let him go?

1562
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,120
the phones are working again.

1563
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,260
We can, maybe we can do

1564
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,780
a for real show next week.

1565
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:22,140
Yeah.

1566
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:23,120
Yeah.

1567
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:23,520
Yeah.

1568
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:25,600
Let's do that, kid.

1569
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:26,460
Let's do that.

1570
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:27,140
We'll have the party

1571
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:27,760
right here.

1572
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:28,640
Yeah.

1573
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:29,680
I, uh,

1574
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:30,800
forgot that I

1575
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,540
had to,

1576
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:33,080
yeah, yeah, okay.

1577
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:34,240
Thank you, Dave.

1578
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,060
Thank you,

1579
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:37,200
Reverend King.

1580
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:37,840
Thank you, Dave.

1581
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:38,900
And thank you

1582
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:39,580
to the listeners

1583
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:40,480
who, uh,

1584
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:41,740
who still will

1585
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:43,180
call in.

1586
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:44,320
And I'm going to put on

1587
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,960
some more hits

1588
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,320
from my answer machine.

1589
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:48,300
Our friend Bernard

1590
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,360
has started calling in again.

1591
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,020
And I'll just let him

1592
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,560
explain all about

1593
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:56,160
the conspiracy.

1594
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,260
This goes on for 16 minutes,

1595
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:00,180
by the way.

1596
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:00,380
Oh, my.

1597
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,060
The Bernard sequence.

1598
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:04,200
So, and that is...

1599
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,460
We'll see you next time.

1600
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:06,240
Praise God.

1601
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:06,560
Well, uh,

1602
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,540
I...

1603
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:08,620
Yeah.

1604
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,660
Hello, this is me, Bernard.

1605
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:14,840
I'd just like to know,

1606
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:15,900
how does,

1607
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:17,440
how does a subgenius

1608
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,320
deal with humans

1609
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,340
who represent

1610
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:21,020
a human society

1611
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:22,540
that I don't believe in anymore

1612
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:23,720
and show that it's,

1613
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:24,760
you know,

1614
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:25,120
has,

1615
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:25,860
has,

1616
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:28,580
has turned into

1617
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,120
something you can't believe in anymore

1618
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,740
in which the breakdown of,

1619
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:34,940
of the psyche,

1620
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,240
the breakdown of ethics,

1621
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:36,860
of the human race,

1622
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:36,940
of the culture,

1623
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:36,940


1624
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:36,940


1625
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:37,960
is, is, is,

1626
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:38,540
is, is, is,

1627
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:39,260
is subject to everyone,

1628
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,200
including my mother.

1629
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,140
And I talk to my mother

1630
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:42,580
and, you know,

1631
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:45,000
she don't think rationally

1632
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,260
when I tell her about things

1633
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:48,400
in which she try to help.

1634
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:49,880
But at the same time,

1635
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:50,520
she's like,

1636
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:52,300
making it an inconvenience

1637
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:53,720
when I tell her I'm not at home here.

1638
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,180
And she says I need to make myself at home

1639
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:57,200
after I told...

1640
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,320
even after I told her

1641
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:58,980
what I'm...

1642
01:00:58,980 --> 01:00:59,760
what I've been dealing

1643
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:00,900
and going through here.

1644
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:02,360
PHONE RINGS

1645
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,000
Hello, this is me, Bernard.

1646
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:05,920
A second message.

1647
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:12,640
I just hope that the UFOs that have been appearing from 2006 up to 2010 will return again and

1648
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:20,940
take me off this world that has gone bankrupt mentally, ethically, with people who represent

1649
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:26,320
mainstream society regardless of who they are, whether they are your relatives or troublesome

1650
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:32,200
humans who represent so-called mainstream society that has been taken over by the beast

1651
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,660
element of humanity now.

1652
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:41,380
I just hope that the UFOs, the aliens will come back and take me off this world in which

1653
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:47,020
you can't live in anymore because of what's going on in every level with the humans, the

1654
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:51,640
breakdown of ethics, the psyche, with those who represent mainstream society and they're

1655
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:52,640
not thinking rationally.

1656
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:57,400
Hello, this is Nathaniel.

1657
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:59,100
I'd like to leave a message.

1658
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:03,640
You know, not that serious, just a cabal of co-conspirators who are trying to get me

1659
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:03,640


1660
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:03,640


1661
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:03,640


1662
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:03,640


1663
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:11,620
out to get me and one of them, you know, that Andre Francis, who died, but he's still

1664
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:15,480
trying to bother me and threaten me saying he's going to beat my ass or something like

1665
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:15,960
that outside.

1666
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:24,440
But, you know, I'm trying to save myself for the aliens to come and take me away from here,

1667
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:30,020
but they still, they think like they're trying to close in on me with their targeting against

1668
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:30,440
me.

1669
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:32,320
And I'm trying to save myself.

1670
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:33,620
I'm trying to save myself.

1671
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:35,360
Yeah, I'm trying to save myself.

1672
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:37,340
Hello, this is Nathaniel.

1673
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:42,940
You know, it seems like a bankruptcy of the 20th century end time with these troublesome

1674
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:44,560
humans that are targeting me.

1675
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:48,840
They're making it really hard to wait for the aliens to come and rescue me.

1676
01:02:59,180 --> 01:02:59,720
W...C...A...S...B...CLEVELAND!

1677
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:03,200
E helper but not you.

1678
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,280
Thank you.
