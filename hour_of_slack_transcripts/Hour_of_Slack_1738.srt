00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:11,640
We thought about doing a live show tonight, but the current affairs news were just so depressing,

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,320
and really there was an Onion headline that kind of said it all.

3
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:26,220
So I'm going to tell you that Onion headline and then play a canned show from a little bit earlier that you haven't heard on Hour of Slack.

4
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:32,160
And it's all slack. It's a welcome respite from the news.

5
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:44,500
But as the Onion said, nothing can make this stop, says only country where it ever happens.

6
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,780
The Self-Genius Hour of Slack.

7
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,300
What?

8
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,940
What?

9
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,460
The FBI says 2% by 6.5%.

10
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:42,580
On Wall Street, 29, 6 snowmobilers detonated a blast that killed personal trainers following a ski trip to Telluride.

11
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:49,160
The presidential candidates from both parties injected Hillary Clinton with performance-enhancing PR news from Washington.

12
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,720
If only the news were really like that, my friends.

13
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,980
Pure surrealism. Thank you, Lee Murr.

14
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,680
And now coming up.

15
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,280
Well, we weren't.

16
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:08,500
We weren't going to talk about it, and we're not going to, but this great song came out from Little Theodore,

17
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:18,680
our old friend Little Theodore and Babushka from Denver, the greatest spaz band since Devo.

18
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,460
And it's a heavy metal song.

19
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,980
Love you.

20
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,760
Love you.

21
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,500
Trump loves everybody.

22
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,920
Trump loves you.

23
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,760
Trump molests you.

24
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,520
Trump molests you.

25
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,180
Trump molests everybody.

26
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,520
Trump molests you.

27
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,380
Trump molests you.

28
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,260
Trump's getting rid of you.

29
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,760
Trump's getting rid of you.

30
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,700
Trump's getting rid of everybody.

31
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,800
Trump's getting rid of you.

32
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,040
Trump is going to make everything close.

33
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,560
Trump's going to make it until he gets to the finish.

34
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,400
And he's jumpè‰³

35
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,260
He is about to fall, just like Bubba peer.

36
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,240
The Blacklist is going to make it work.

37
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,280
The show is about to get popular.

38
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,120
guitar solo

39
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,280
trombone solo

40
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,260
trombone solo

41
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,520
trombone solo

42
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,800
trombone solo

43
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:00,760
trombone solo

44
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,260
trombone solo

45
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,460
trombone solo

46
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,320
trombone solo

47
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,240
trombone solo

48
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,260
trombone solo

49
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,260
trombone solo

50
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,760
trombone solo

51
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,560
trombone solo

52
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,260
trombone solo

53
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,260
trombone solo

54
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,000
trombone solo

55
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,880
trombone solo

56
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,600
trombone solo

57
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,680
trombone solo

58
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,240
trombone solo

59
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,480
trombone solo

60
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:18,480


61
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:18,480


62
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,920
And you know what I think?

63
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,140
I just made a horrible mistake

64
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,720
while we took that little break.

65
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,640
Yes?

66
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,860
My mistake on the break, I think I left the phone turned all the way up

67
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,440
so people heard Lonesome Cowboy Dave clearing his throat.

68
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,180
They did, did they?

69
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:37,600
No.

70
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,840
I think that might have happened.

71
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,140
I don't know if that was me clearing my throat or another part of my body.

72
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,820
I mean, we have been known to get alien transmissions

73
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,320
accidentally intercepted on our lines here.

74
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:55,380
Someone making a discreet cough to demonstrate that it was time.

75
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,060
I've actually had to fight that.

76
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,540
I've been dealing with it all evening and all last several shows

77
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,560
because on November 2nd, I suddenly became allergic

78
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,300
to the atmosphere of the planet Earth.

79
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,100
Seriously, I never had any allergies at all before

80
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,160
and suddenly I became allergic to any kind of pollen.

81
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,600
You know, in theory, you can develop allergies later in life,

82
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,820
but in practice here, we don't know how much of that is

83
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,820
just like you changing or me changing or whatever over life.

84
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,560
And the climate changing because maybe the volume of pollen

85
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,560
is greater because of the warmer climate.

86
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:39,220
This was the first year that I spent in living in the middle

87
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,820
of a cedar and juniper forest.

88
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:42,820
Yes.

89
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,380
I'm pretty sure that that's what finally brought it on.

90
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,080
I've been going to that juniper and cedar forest all my life,

91
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,760
practically since I was a teenager.

92
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,760
That has to smell good.

93
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,180
Where my parents lived.

94
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,040
It does smell good.

95
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,040
Oh, it does smell great.

96
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,700
It's beautiful.

97
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:05,080
It's green year round, but the air has kind of a yellow haze

98
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,100
near the horizon.

99
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,380
It's yellow.

100
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,540
That's the trees trying to sexually assault you.

101
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:10,860
Yeah.

102
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,360
They are trying to shove their seed up your nose.

103
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,360
Well, after one solid year of breathing that stuff,

104
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,360
it finally kicked in.

105
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,720
I thought I had a terrible cold at first,

106
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,880
but then it just stayed and never went away.

107
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,860
It wasn't in my lungs.

108
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,040
It was post-nasal drowsiness.

109
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,220
It was just a drip that causes this.

110
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,480
I just have to go like that.

111
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,700
And for a radio professional like myself,

112
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,360
that can be a real drawback.

113
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,620
Kind of like deafness.

114
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,060
Unnecessary deafness.

115
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,460
Science will find a cure.

116
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,520
For unnecessary deafness?

117
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,120
Yeah, it's going to cost a lot.

118
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,700
But who will deem what's necessary and what's unnecessary?

119
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,460
Because I'd get scared if I would have to make such a choice.

120
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:56,960
Who is it?

121
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,440
Invisible.

122
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,340
It'll be made for you.

123
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,480
Mm-hmm.

124
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,740
Oh, that only rests me assured.

125
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,860
That makes me feel one hell of a lot better known,

126
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,440
you know, that at least somebody's making my decisions for me

127
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,960
because I can't make mine anymore.

128
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,200
But there will come a time when you'll be asked to do that.

129
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,300
You will have to lay it on the line.

130
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,240
Did you ever see the icon?

131
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,420
It looks like it's Adolf Hitler, but he's crucified on a cross.

132
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,900
It's like, man, who?

133
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,960
Who came up with it?

134
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,940
Who is responsible for this?

135
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,780
Some cross old Nazi.

136
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,880
A goth old Nazi?

137
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,540
Well, goths, maybe, I suppose.

138
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,960
You'd say, mein Gott, a swastika's fallen out of the sky.

139
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,880
What has happened now?

140
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,840
Gott in Himmel.

141
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,160
Swastika?

142
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,360
Gott in Himmel.

143
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,220
Gott im Himmel.

144
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:52,720
Yes.

145
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,240
Gott in Himmel.

146
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,620
Gott im Himmel.

147
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,520
Gott im Himmel.

148
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,040
Gott im Himmel.

149
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,040


150
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,040


151
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,040


152
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,040


153
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,040


154
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,040


155
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,040


156
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,340
So im is a contraction for indem,

157
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,820
but they don't use an apostrophe in German like we do in English

158
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,940
when they make contractions.

159
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,640
Gott im Himmel.

160
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,500
You've got to remember, they have 16 different forms of the word the.

161
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,700
It's kind of ridiculous.

162
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,320
I forgot that.

163
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,040
I mean, I'm not sure if I...

164
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,120
Dem, den.

165
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,400
Actually, they don't really have 16 forms.

166
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,140
It's a much smaller number than that.

167
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,920
There's 16 different contexts in which you have to decide,

168
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,500
which definite article you use.

169
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,900
We will waive consecutive translations.

170
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:38,700
When I was in China, I learned how to order a beer, I thought.

171
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,000
What was it?

172
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:48,860
Well, an American Chinese person told me later, she said,

173
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,000
you know, you just asked for a basketball.

174
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,240
I thought basketball was...

175
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,480
Well, I mean, the difference between pijo and pijo, which I can't hear.

176
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:02,780
All right.

177
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,360
So, all right.

178
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:03,740
But they can.

179
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,360
Yes.

180
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,380
I can give you a quick lesson.

181
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,100
I can give you a quick, a very quick lesson.

182
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,040
I said, can I use the restroom?

183
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,300
He said, he wants a rest.

184
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,140
No, you can't.

185
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,900
He said, no, I mean a bathroom.

186
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,860
And they said, no, you can't.

187
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,460
There's no such thing as a bathroom here.

188
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,740
And I said, loo.

189
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,260
And they went, oh, yes, it's down the hall.

190
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:21,860
The loo.

191
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:22,760
The loo.

192
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:23,720
The WC.

193
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,660
They didn't know what a bathroom or a restroom was.

194
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,800
And they made a big deal of it.

195
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,640
That's why I had to...

196
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,060
Where's your crapper?

197
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,780
Now, they...

198
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,700
That means nothing to them either.

199
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:33,800
And...

200
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,040
Even though Sir Thomas Crapper was an Englishman?

201
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:42,620
And in England, the word outhouse simply means an adjoining shed in your yard.

202
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,620
It does not have the meaning that we have here in the States.

203
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,760
Especially if you have to pee on the wall and call that sedentary.

204
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,720
I call that art.

205
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,380
I call that jolly rude.

206
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,720
Jolly rude.

207
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,040
And those who...

208
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,180
Who read these words of pee...

209
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,260
Will certainly always remember me.

210
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,420
Here I sit, brokenhearted.

211
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,680
Oh, well, everybody knows the classics.

212
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,060
In days of old, when knights were bold and outhouses weren't invented...

213
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,060
They left a load in the middle of the road and went away contented.

214
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,100
Yes, indeed.

215
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,220
Weep, weep, weep, weep, weep, weep.

216
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,860
See, that's not something I've heard...

217
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,100
You're the only person I've ever heard say that, aside from my grandfather.

218
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,960
Well, I learned it from Mark.

219
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,460
My father, who is about the same age as your grandfather.

220
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,480
And if you bear in mind the fact that staying does look like your grandmother an awful lot,

221
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,520
especially after a load was left...

222
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,340
You're not kidding, my...

223
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,060
Thank you, Dan.

224
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,500
Reverend staying here actually does look a little bit like my grandmother

225
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,120
from a certain angle and a certain light.

226
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,120
One of my two grandmothers.

227
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,500
Take a load off.

228
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,460
Until you see the beard.

229
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,020
How about a cup of tea?

230
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,040
More so now, because your nose gets bigger as you get older.

231
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,680
But, uh...

232
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,720
What are you talking about?

233
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,840
Drop the heck out of these.

234
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:01,700
Older?

235
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,220
What do you mean?

236
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,420
Why, you're only as young as you feel.

237
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,080
Yeah, that's right.

238
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,600
80 isn't a new 60.

239
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,160
Excuse me.

240
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,220
I don't know.

241
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:19,920
I mean, look.

242
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,200
I felt like an old man since I was two years old.

243
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,940
One of my earliest memories.

244
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:25,520
I'm not kidding.

245
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,660
One of my earliest memories is being pushed around in a stroller.

246
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,960
Yeah, I get tired of being pushed around.

247
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,400
And having my pants changed by somebody else.

248
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,960
Yeah, stop messing with my pants, too.

249
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,400
And one of the old ladies in the neighborhood looks down into the stroller.

250
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,020
She's like, oh, and how old are you?

251
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,240
And I hold up two fingers.

252
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,320
And she says, oh, two?

253
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,200
That's old.

254
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:43,720
Wow.

255
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,360
So, yeah, I was told I was old when I was two years old.

256
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,160
It made me feel old.

257
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,260
You're an old soul.

258
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,360
And I haven't gotten over it since.

259
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,900
You're an old soul.

260
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,200
Oh, I just love it when people tell me I'm an old soul.

261
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,660
You're like, oh, you must have been reincarnated a lot of times.

262
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,460
Well, it's better than calling you Lake Champlain or something like that.

263
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,200
At least there's something to me.

264
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,600
I said, F you very much.

265
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,640
I remember learning all these things in this life.

266
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,180
Thank you.

267
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:07,600
You know?

268
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,520
Some of us read books.

269
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,320
About three of us, as far as I can tell.

270
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,640
That's right.

271
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,680
In love with the printed word.

272
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,060
You know what?

273
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,800
I have a horrible confession to make.

274
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,260
I haven't read an actual book in a few years.

275
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,360
God, man.

276
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,340
Hey, why don't you read my book?

277
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,300
I spend a lot of time reading news articles.

278
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,420
And, you know, encyclopedia articles and stuff.

279
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,140
You're talking to an author here.

280
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,900
He wants to know why you don't want to read his book, which is available.

281
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,880
Jim Neighbors World.

282
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:47,000
And we do have to disclose that Dr. Howell stands to profit from any sales of any of his books.

283
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,000
And we are not going to tell you to go buy them.

284
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,580
And we're not going to tell you they're good.

285
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,480
And we're not going to tell you the prices.

286
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,480
But Dr. Howell has written some books.

287
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,200
Yes.

288
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,920
And they're out there.

289
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,980
I was talking about my book about Neighbor World.

290
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,480
Dave's trying to plug his book.

291
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,840
He's neighborly over there.

292
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,260
Yeah.

293
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,820
Available from, wait, can I say that?

294
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,160
And we're going to Starwood.

295
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:16,420
And there you're going to see author John Shirley talk about his books in an attempt to get people to buy them.

296
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,540
And Vermin Supreme.

297
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,900
Oh, yes.

298
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,160
He has a great write-up.

299
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,280
Supreme will be there.

300
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:22,960
Vermin Supreme.

301
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,440
Vixen's violin.

302
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,460
Erica Soto.

303
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,780
She was a guest on this very radio.

304
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,140
station about three years ago during the Republican National Convention.

305
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,400
He was here in Cleveland.

306
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:40,040
Not to mention Fat Man D, the Gypsy Funk Squad, the Sweet Maple Singers, the Hills and the Rivers, and Daddy Longlegs' Homegrown Revival.

307
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,300
Fat Man D was a truly great performer the last time I saw her.

308
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,120
She is.

309
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,640
She exudes talent.

310
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,940
Now, get this, Dr. Howell.

311
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,900
It says here that President Supreme is going to give a class.

312
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,380
It's a class called Hooked on Megaphonics.

313
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,540
Learn street protest megaphone techniques and skills.

314
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,100
He doesn't have his own megaphone.

315
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,400
We have to get one for him.

316
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,960
Get one to shout him down.

317
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,540
We need one ourselves.

318
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,320
Yes, we need one for X Day.

319
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:26,760
Find out the history of humor and satire in politics from Jonathan Swift through the Yippies and Abbie Hoffman to the Yes Men and the Ask Dr. Howell.

320
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,280
The show.

321
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,560
Oh, I just.

322
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,360
I've been thinking that.

323
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,660
Well, the Yes Men were.

324
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:37,640
Remember that event that you were the emcee of in San Francisco on the Castro Theater stage?

325
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,560
Yeah, that's right.

326
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,820
The Yes Men were there.

327
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,680
Mm-hmm.

328
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,040
I have to take my hat.

329
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,720
If I were wearing a hat, I would take it off for the Yes Men.

330
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,120
I have to say that's a.

331
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,520
Well.

332
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,240
That's an example of practical.

333
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,020
Chicken John.

334
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:52,480
Joking.

335
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,380
Indeed, I take off my virtual hat as well.

336
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:55,780
Yeah.

337
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,740
Oh, yeah.

338
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:03,140
Look, it says on this poster, which uses the subgenius hieroglyphs at the top, I just noticed.

339
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,900
So also see subgenius figures.

340
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,560
Now, I don't know if that's an advertising thing.

341
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,540
That means is you're going to have to put on a thong to show off your figure.

342
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,460
The thong remains the theme.

343
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,760
The church's BMI did improve a great deal a couple of marches ago.

344
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:21,680
Anyway.

345
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,800
Yeah, it says here.

346
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,140
Oh, look.

347
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,940
Reverend Ivan Stang is going to be there.

348
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,180
Author John Shirley.

349
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,800
Whose real name, by the way, is Reverend Piss Baptist.

350
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,600
Piss Baptist.

351
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,720
Look at this.

352
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,380
Ask Dr. Howell.

353
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,540
Not suitable for airport.

354
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:37,840
Yes.

355
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,300
And Fat Mandy.

356
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:46,880
On the same line as Wizard Oberon Zell, who's not a subgenius figure, but he's a friend of ours.

357
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,080
What an unlikely collection of characters you're going to see there.

358
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:56,900
And Dixon Violin, Gypsy Funk Squad, Sweet Maple Singers, and Spicey.

359
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,560
Space Rangers.

360
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,840
Space Rangers.

361
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,260
Space Rangers.

362
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,440
Space.

363
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,140
They're aptly named.

364
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,580
Yes.

365
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,760
They're a hard-working bunch of formerly young people.

366
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,620
Glittering star fields.

367
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,200
Well, they're still mostly young.

368
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,960
Against the vellum of the blackness of the void.

369
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,360
The infinite distances of freezing outer space.

370
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,720
Some of these children.

371
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,940
Haven't had anything flattened in the many years they've done the micro-grooves.

372
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,160
Which is really, really important in this planetary sphere.

373
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,860
Right here we got going on over the last, I don't know how many elemental years.

374
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,480
Return for re-grooving.

375
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,640
260,000 elemental years.

376
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:41,780
Is it?

377
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,160
Well.

378
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:43,880
I don't know.

379
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,160
And all the time we've spent, we've been here and everything.

380
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,900
Nobody's ever clicked the right message.

381
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,900
It's right in front of us.

382
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,660
It has a nose.

383
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,360
It has feet.

384
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,380
It has ears.

385
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,500
It has big fat, big boffo ears.

386
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,800
Is that another one of those invisible critters that's here that without my knowing about it?

387
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,520
How would I describe it if it was invisible?

388
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,520
I wouldn't know what it looked like.

389
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,560
Well, visible to you.

390
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,340
Look, if either of you guys had a smart phone, you'd be able to see those things.

391
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,220
Is that the elephant?

392
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:10,620
Yeah, really.

393
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,380
That's how I'm seeing them because they have clown shoes.

394
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,780
Clown shoes.

395
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,000
Oh, no.

396
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,820
Big, beautiful, beautiful hats.

397
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,880
Now, you see different.

398
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,700
It's a lady's hat from 1927 or someplace.

399
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,340
They've seen different invisible creatures than most of us do.

400
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,680
Well, I have no.

401
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,100
I was not working at least for the Russian KGB elemental movements.

402
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,520
You make you hallucinate all the time.

403
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:44,580
I know how to hallucinate without CIA or KGB influences.

404
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,060
Well, you know what I think, you guys?

405
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,400
I think 2019 is going to be a good year.

406
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,740
You think?

407
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,220
Especially if that's what comes.

408
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,980
Bob gets it all together.

409
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,760
So you think 19 is going to be a good year.

410
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:05,000
Maybe for subgenii, but pinks and clorps, no, never.

411
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,860
We have every reason to be super optimistic.

412
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,780
Because I know when Bob smiles, I'll ignore bad weather.

413
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,940
What about the dog?

414
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,920
What about the dog?

415
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,640
What about the dog?

416
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,040
He'll pee the floor.

417
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,500
And we better just leave it at that.

418
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,460
Yeah, we'll cut right there.

419
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,280
Yeah, you don't want to do Twitter.

420
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,560
So that was a sneak preview of the rock opera, right?

421
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,140
Yes.

422
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,660
Yeah, well, no, it is a pot, I mean a pot, a rot opera.

423
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,040
A rot, rot, rot, rot opera.

424
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,240
A dog.

425
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,080
It's an ex-day dog opera.

426
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,340
It's a dog opera.

427
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,700
Highly rot opera.

428
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,140
It's a pot, rot, pop, dog opera.

429
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,080
Over rot.

430
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,460
A pop rock opera.

431
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,360
A rock opera.

432
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,680
With sex.

433
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,520
With sex.

434
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:54,680
Sex.

435
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,360
Sex day.

436
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,320
Yes, exactly.

437
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,200
I mean, ex-day.

438
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,700
Brown hearted black dog.

439
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,660
He's in a fragrant, stinky land.

440
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,020
Oh, no, we weren't going to do that.

441
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,460
That's right.

442
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,580
No, don't do it because people still don't quite know what you're doing.

443
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:08,740
No more film songs.

444
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,480
You're obliquely referring to the article in question, which is a pair of old shoes.

445
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,540
You're obliquely referring to your dog, I believe, in the form of Tommy the Rock Opera.

446
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,120
Now you're pretending to be coy.

447
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,220
Like, what are you talking about?

448
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,600
I don't know what you're talking about.

449
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,560
What are you talking about?

450
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,340
I don't know, you know.

451
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,440
And then the next thing you go...

452
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:27,620
What do you talk?

453
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,320
What do you talk?

454
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,720
What do you talk?

455
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,500
You can talk, you can bicker, but it's different than it was.

456
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:44,060
Anyway, you may only have a few short hours left before the overwhelming apocalypse crashes upon us all.

457
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,000
And Buddy doesn't know what ex-day is.

458
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,340
He doesn't know who Bob is or what paying is.

459
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,180
What's that song?

460
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,800
How can he be trained?

461
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,940
When he has no brain.

462
00:27:59,260 --> 00:27:59,660
How?

463
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,040
What if that old song, like, that old song that...

464
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,540
Buddy's joining in.

465
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,020
Now, did you ever hear that song that they made back in the 80s for charity where they said,

466
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,220
Do they know it's ex-day?

467
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,820
I don't think I ever did.

468
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,700
Do they know it's ex-day?

469
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,440
I can't remember what that...

470
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,460
Oh, yeah, that song.

471
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,020
That's all the rock stars, movie stars.

472
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:19,860
Yeah, they all got together.

473
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,840
They all sang, Do they know it's ex-day?

474
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,640
Oh, yeah.

475
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,960
They all held hands.

476
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,520
It was a big...

477
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,380
What?

478
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,740
Where did that money go?

479
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,220
Where were we supposed to get that?

480
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:29,800
That's right.

481
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,980
Well, it was supposed to go to the unmentionable children's home.

482
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,500
The unmentionable children's home.

483
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,680
It was a highly...

484
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,020
That's where my...

485
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:38,600
Charity.

486
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,680
That's where my son lives.

487
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,880
Oh, well, I...

488
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,980
Sorry, I didn't mean to bring up anything personal.

489
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:43,440
Well, I...

490
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,200
We screwed it now.

491
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,560
I mean, we just mentioned him.

492
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,100
Oh, man.

493
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,020
Yeah, well...

494
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,820
They're going to kick him out now because I just mentioned him.

495
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,000
Don't worry because you still haven't...

496
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,440
You haven't shouted his name in an episode like...

497
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,740
Like saying Derek Stoneface or whatever his name is.

498
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:03,380
You have to, you know, at least let the kid living in the next room know that he's talking

499
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,340
about somebody on the radio that he can kill with a sharp object.

500
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,900
Almost anybody can be killed with a sharp object.

501
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,360
If it's sharp enough.

502
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:11,780
Almost anybody.

503
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:18,940
But a lot of the people you hear tonight are actually galvanized steel workers making pot

504
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,440
iron, pig iron, and other forms of vaginal...

505
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,380
I've always preferred goat iron.

506
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,360
Goat iron.

507
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,040
I was trained to be able to kill a man using nothing more than a plastic comb.

508
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,540
Or a playing card thrown just right.

509
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,220
We know a guy who could throw playing cards just right.

510
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:37,480
Yes, he did.

511
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,880
Probably kill somebody with one.

512
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,360
Yes.

513
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,140
But it...

514
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,240
It's all in the wrist.

515
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,860
Like, it's literally all in the wrist.

516
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,620
He practices for an hour every day.

517
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:46,960
Every day.

518
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,320
Practice makes perfect.

519
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,300
Is his name Remy Lebeau?

520
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,460
No.

521
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,360
He's called the Executioner.

522
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,040
Executioner.

523
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,360
No, Magnus the Magician, actually.

524
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:01,260
He's a Las Vegas magician who also does...

525
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:07,240
He does stage magic professionally, but he also does ceremonial magic.

526
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,660
You better believe it.

527
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,060
Is he going to be an ex-team?

528
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,180
No, he has...

529
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,160
No, I wish.

530
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,020
He's...

531
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:17,860
We've opened for him a few times and done stuff with him.

532
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,940
And he...

533
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,940
He doesn't take openings and closings very well.

534
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,740
If you watch his show from backstage, it's...

535
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,080
All the magic is just gone.

536
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:35,700
Well, what are you doing back there depriving yourself of the fun of watching it from the front?

537
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:36,940
But he really can.

538
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,540
He really can just...

539
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,040
He can throw playing cards with deadly skill.

540
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,420
Oh, he does all the fancy things with cards.

541
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,700
Isn't that the same guy that you showed that...

542
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,100
Pretty amazing.

543
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,440
He's actually...

544
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,060
Isn't that the same guy with the knock worst?

545
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,240
The kielbasa sandwiches?

546
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,460
The old ladies or something?

547
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,240
No, that's Bragnus, the magician.

548
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,740
And he's not really that good.

549
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,520
He just brags a lot.

550
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:09,600
I thought I actually saw him shooting kielbasa at some old lady and she caught it in her teeth

551
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,820
and she jumped over the table and strangled him to death.

552
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,340
Well, they put the kielbasa on that.

553
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,400
And then they put the kielbasa on it.

554
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,020
Mmm, yeah.

555
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,340
What is that Tenacious D song about?

556
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,400
About the big sausage?

557
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,920
The Sausage Party?

558
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,200
Yeah, I'm stumped.

559
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,280
That was a great movie, by the way.

560
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,900
The movie about hot dogs.

561
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:34,940
Yeah, it's the...

562
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,080
Called Sausage Party.

563
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:40,080
It's one of my very favorite criticisms of religion.

564
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,380
The movie Sausage Party.

565
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:50,140
Yes, it's got an incredible opening number of all the vegetables and all the products

566
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,340
in the grocery store.

567
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,340
Singing how excited they are.

568
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,940
Because maybe one of the gods will purchase them and take them to heaven.

569
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:03,780
And there's a couple of crazy ones that were returned and they're trying to warn him.

570
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,660
It ain't heaven.

571
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,400
Oh, no.

572
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,300
It ain't heaven.

573
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,220
But one commits suicide.

574
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:14,100
He jumps out of the shopping cart and splatters rather than go back to what happened.

575
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,780
And pretty soon you find out what happens when they're taken home.

576
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,360
Yeah.

577
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,300
The lady starts chopping carrots into pieces.

578
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:22,880
Baby.

579
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,260
Baby.

580
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,800
Now you know.

581
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,580
Now you know how the mirror pie is made.

582
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,640
Hot dog.

583
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,520
The motion picture.

584
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:39,940
A wonderful scene where this housewife is holding a potato and she's starting to skin it.

585
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,340
And he's going, ah, me eyes.

586
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,140
Oh, the pain.

587
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,960
Oh, it's terrible.

588
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,340
And throw him in the boiling water.

589
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,140
Ah, boiling.

590
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:48,660
Ah.

591
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,880
And then she eats the baby carrots and you can...

592
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,340
The camera is in...

593
00:32:53,360 --> 00:33:00,380
Inside her mouth looking outwards as her teeth crush the screaming baby carrots.

594
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,380
I've seen that before, like inside the mouth camera shots.

595
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:04,920
No, it's...

596
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:09,720
You know, in my family we have a saying, a scoped potato has few secrets.

597
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,480
A peeled potato has none.

598
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,620
Ah, me eyes.

599
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,520
Ah, that's a good one.

600
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,240
Mr. Potato Head.

601
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,960
And his bucket of parts...

602
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,760
Well, I think that's some of the most malodorous, ingenious thought I've ever heard provoking me.

603
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,200
And then there's...

604
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,900
There's a hippie...

605
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:29,160
There's a hippie voiced by Johnny Depp who's on mushrooms.

606
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:34,320
And he can understand the speech of the hot dogs.

607
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,960
We need to take a moment here.

608
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:36,620
He can communicate.

609
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:42,620
We need to take a moment here to allow a very special friend of the program on the air right now.

610
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,900
No money mark, you're on the air.

611
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,680
Greetings from Geni.

612
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,600
Lemon Stang, I gotta ask you a favor from a...

613
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,020
From Bob Dobbs.

614
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,560
Oh, no.

615
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,000
Okay.

616
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,960
So, we know that...

617
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,600
That July 5th has not been X Day in any of the past several years, so...

618
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,300
We don't know that.

619
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:12,440
If you could ask Bob to delay X Day again this year because that's the day I'm going to answer con.

620
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:19,460
And, you know, God or no, if Bob ruins my special day, I'm gonna kick his ass into the next county.

621
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,340
Won't somebody please think of the furries?

622
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,520
Very awkward situation here.

623
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,400
Yeah, the furries are in Pittsburgh already.

624
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,280
Where are the furries?

625
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,640
What are the furries, by the way, since they're all in Pittsburgh?

626
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,640
Well, they have a syringe on top.

627
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,140
You don't want to know, Dave.

628
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:32,540
Yeah.

629
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,620
You don't want to know.

630
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,380
All right.

631
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:36,520
Let's...

632
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:43,700
No money mark is one of the only men in town who is man enough to admit that he is a furry.

633
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,200
Don't knock it till you've tried it.

634
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,500
I haven't tried it.

635
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,120
I haven't tried it.

636
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,220
You have your special suit with the little ears on there and everything?

637
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,560
Well, actually...

638
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,240
No, I did not have a fursuit.

639
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,660
That's like...

640
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,580
You've come a fur piece to do this.

641
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:08,660
I would compare no money mark's furriness to, like, somebody having a serious kink,

642
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,560
but, like, they were fundamentally lacking in...

643
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,660
I don't know, like, what if...

644
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:20,380
Somebody uncontrollably sexually affected by stuffed enemies.

645
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,120
What if...

646
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,160
What if you had a scat fetish, but you had a colostomy?

647
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,680
You know, like...

648
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,300
That's not my thing.

649
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,280
No money mark does not have a fursona or a fursuit.

650
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,620
And he just strongly identifies with anthropomorphic...

651
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,400
He's a fellow traveler.

652
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,200
He's in their camp, as it were.

653
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,880
But he's fundamentally...

654
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,620
There's something fundamentally...

655
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,000
He's a mathematical communist on top of that.

656
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,900
He can say, like, pi r squared, or, you know, take his magic number,

657
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:56,900
something, and he's still going to always come up as a colon-gnostic communist cowboy.

658
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,680
See, Princess Wave, here's the problem.

659
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:06,640
Some people like to sleep with others who are dressed, for instance, as dogs.

660
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:11,580
We actually do sleep with dogs.

661
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,840
Who are dressed as dogs.

662
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,000
So we've taken the furries one step further.

663
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:17,920
Ah.

664
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,040
Further.

665
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,040
Further.

666
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,900
Uh, Reverend Stang, I have another question for you.

667
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,560
Here's your second question, Stang.

668
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,120
Ask Dr. Stang.

669
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,260
Hey, you just said that you were trained to kill with...

670
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,940
What was it, a pen or a paperclip or something?

671
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,000
No, no, no.

672
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,820
A plastic comb.

673
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:41,240
Okay, um, so who trained you to do that, and why?

674
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:48,120
I am not at liberty to divulge secrets of the inner Dobstown security squad.

675
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,440
And by the way, there's a special hidden master.

676
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:58,340
And by the way, if you need a paperclip or a comb to kill a human being, then you are weak.

677
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:09,100
So what, does the church have, um, you know, this sort of Scientology goon squad that goes around putting, uh...

678
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,060
Shh.

679
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,700
Stop it, stop it.

680
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,060
What are you talking about, dude?

681
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,280
I gotta bleep that.

682
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,180
I gotta bleep that.

683
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:15,600
Come on.

684
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,660
The subgenius league of ass kickers is an august...

685
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,980
group of, uh...

686
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,620
servants of Bob.

687
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:29,740
Yes, tremble and weep when you think of those, uh, superannuated aged assassins.

688
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,640
Slut.

689
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,580
League of ass kickers, SLA.

690
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,100
Oh, and sorry to get you, uh, in trouble, doctor.

691
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,780
Well, that's past the praying phone.

692
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,760
I meant Dr. Sinister.

693
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,620
Anybody saying something like that, he had to bleep.

694
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,180
Look, the first rule of the subgenius...

695
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,720
assassin squad is you do not talk about the subgenius assassin qu...

696
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,420
Except on college radio humor shows.

697
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,160
Yes, that disarms the victims.

698
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,920
Which, especially... and, and they have to be ones that aren't that humorous either.

699
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:02,480
Right.

700
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:02,920
Yeah.

701
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,240
Yeah.

702
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,760
It's not funny.

703
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,420
Come on.

704
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,180
Yeah.

705
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:15,400
You know, we're not... that's a serious subject and most religions abuse their, their police, uh, secret police.

706
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,420
Uh, they, they use them abusively to control their followers.

707
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,040
Why entire nations...

708
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,820
...to force us.

709
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,940
We do it the other way around.

710
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:26,260
Well, you remember on Marsoon, uh, Mars, there's the Assassin's Guild.

711
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,520
And since this planet is actually Mars, uh, they're here.

712
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,100
Yep.

713
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:39,520
And if you're looking for any kind of cultural differences, you have to remember you have to rehydrate the calamari, the squid.

714
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,520
You get dried squid at a Chinese market, it's going to taste vastly different than fresh squid.

715
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,740
So you have to rehydrate it.

716
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,560
And you have to put milk in there.

717
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,440
It's an abomination.

718
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,020
An abomination.

719
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:50,020


720
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,200
An abomination, I say.

721
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,240
Coconut milk.

722
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,360
Coconut milk.

723
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,280
Uh, Dr. Howell, I have a question for you about San Francisco.

724
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:02,900
Well, if you must, I suppose I can, uh, make some attempt to answer it.

725
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,900
Okay, I assume that you're familiar with the, uh, the structure of the Sutro Tower?

726
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,600
Why, yes.

727
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:20,000
Okay, now, is it true that, uh, that the actual purpose of the tower is not to work as a, a broadcast and cell phone tower?

728
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,900
But to...

729
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,680
To ward off demons.

730
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:23,700
What?

731
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,820
To ward off demons.

732
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,360
Right, it's like a special thing with coitus.

733
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:26,840
You ever heard of coitus tower?

734
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,000
It has those things pointing up.

735
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,520
They, they, uh, scare demons away.

736
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,900
Just like the, uh, ornamental devices at the corners of sacred buildings and the Chinese

737
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,440
pagodas.

738
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,540
I thought that it was to, uh, uh, send and or receive messages from aliens.

739
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:46,520
No, that's coit tower you're thinking of, which is a large penis emerging from the,

740
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,820
from the, uh, island there.

741
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,760
Some people call it the end of a fire.

742
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:49,980
I don't know.

743
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:49,980


744
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:49,980


745
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:49,980


746
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:49,980


747
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:49,980


748
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:49,980


749
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:49,980


750
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:50,220
I don't know the exact word for it.

751
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:50,220


752
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:50,220


753
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:50,220


754
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:50,220


755
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:50,220


756
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:50,220


757
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,400
Anyway, your own body is a radio receiver, and if you just silence the chatter of the

758
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,640
overbrain, those alien messages will come in loud and clear in stereophonic sound.

759
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:07,800
Well, if my, uh, body really were a radio receiver, maybe I could get better reception

760
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,780
than WCSB.

761
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,620
Maybe you could.

762
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,980
Ever given it a try?

763
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,860
Hey, by the way, I wanna say somethin' right now.

764
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:19,780
I, uh, I drove out into exurbia, uh, today.

765
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:31,120
I went to Macedonia, not to find the tomb of Philip, but to visit family who live in Northern Summit County.

766
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,580
And what was the upshot?

767
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:45,640
WRUW, the other station that's not us, they have bragged for a long time about their transmitter strength.

768
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,720
10,000 watts, we're awesome.

769
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,980
And, oh, WCSB only has 1,000 watts.

770
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:51,380
Guess what?

771
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,900
I could pick up WCSB down there.

772
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,720
But not WRUW.

773
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,320
I could not pick them up.

774
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:01,160
We're having a little trouble with their ionization layer down there.

775
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:06,520
Many, many longs ago, I couldn't pick up WCSB on 152nd Street.

776
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,820
Actually, it's funny, Dave.

777
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:15,860
When I used to drive out to the place that shall not be named where X-Day drills used to happen.

778
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,360
Yeah, Trump would, they call it.

779
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:17,700
WCSB.

780
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:17,700


781
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,880
There you go.

782
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:23,920
WCSB would always cut out as soon as I crossed the Ashtabula County line.

783
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:32,480
That was leftover psychic bad energy from the Ashtabula Railroad disaster of two centuries ago.

784
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,500
I had the most horrifying experience.

785
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,460
One X-Day drill long ago.

786
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:45,980
I had left Trumpwood Festival Center and was going to drive back to Cleveland.

787
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,700
I was living.

788
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:55,580
I was listening to cassettes I had just recorded that week during X-Day of Father Joe Mama preaching.

789
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,900
And I listened to about 15 minutes of it.

790
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,940
And I turned off the cassette.

791
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,900
And I could still hear Papa Joe Mama preaching.

792
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,700
It was static.

793
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,120
A lot of static.

794
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,520
But it was like, what the hell?

795
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,180
I was holding the cassette in my hand.

796
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,460
And I could still hear.

797
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,140
I could still hear the cassette.

798
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,540
Well, it was WCSB.

799
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:28,220
When they pushed the cassette out, it defaulted over to the radio, which was set on WCSB.

800
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:37,340
Once Ranger Rita, who was the program director for KNON, where we started the Hour of Slack in Dallas.

801
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,520
She was driving back to Dallas from Austin.

802
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:46,120
And she thought she was listening to the Hour of Slack for about half an hour.

803
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,440
Until it stopped.

804
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:53,920
And she sunk in that she wasn't listening to KNON, which was also 89.3, by the way.

805
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:58,520
And she was in between a rock station and a religious station.

806
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:04,580
And it was, you know, ACDC and Jimmy Swagger at the same time.

807
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:07,220
She just assumed that was the Hour of Slack.

808
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,780
Yeah, sounds like us.

809
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:12,740
She listened to that garbage half an hour, thinking it was her station.

810
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,480
Salvation.

811
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,200
Yeah.

812
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,460
That's a good one.

813
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:16,920
That makes sense.

814
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,240
Finally.

815
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:25,140
Well, and the first time you ever hear your own voice on the radio unexpectedly, that can give you a heart attack.

816
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,620
It can be disturbing.

817
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:27,960
Oh, yeah.

818
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,720
It's happened to me.

819
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:36,440
You know, once I was driving around and, you know, listening to Papa Joe Mama.

820
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,160
And then I took out the cassette and I could still hear his voice.

821
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,280
And I told him, hey, Papa, shut up.

822
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:42,800
Oh, for heaven's sake.

823
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,000
And so he just went back to sleep in the back of the car.

824
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,240
Oh, that just makes him louder.

825
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,420
That just makes him louder.

826
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:47,420


827
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,600
That just makes him all the louder.

828
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,120
It's perma-Papa Joe.

829
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,920
The demonic possession of some kind.

830
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:53,680
Can't let it go away.

831
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,880
I don't think anybody could see how it wouldn't be demonic possession.

832
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:00,440
They clearly have control over every part of your brain.

833
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:06,380
And all your thoughts are all rumored and all negatated by different orifices.

834
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:08,380
Excuse me.

835
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,580
Sorry, I gave it the orifice.

836
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:15,340
Well, since I'm nobody, Mark, I probably have to deal with demonic repossession.

837
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,400
There you go.

838
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,180
Oh, he's a repo man?

839
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,660
With Linda Blair.

840
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:25,560
No, I mean the sidekick in the nasal story.

841
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:31,420
I mean, you know, nasal academy like Annapolis, Maryland or someplace near there.

842
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,320
When you join the nasal reserve.

843
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,060
You've got plenty of nasal preserves to munch on later.

844
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:45,320
But I think everybody's kind of like a lacrimonial, a little bit hirsute,

845
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,400
kind of gathering up the willpower.

846
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,740
Or a little bit of her sign.

847
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,060
Tears, idle tears.

848
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,840
Yeah, bitter, bitter, bitter, idle tears.

849
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,220
This is crap.

850
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,780
Crap Radio coming up next.

851
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,180
K-R-A-P.

852
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,200
In fact, it's another very special episode of Crap Radio.

853
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,400
It looks very special.

854
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,000
Oh, I recognize one guest right there.

855
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,240
One of my favorites.

856
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:14,720
And this other fellow, I know I've seen his face before, but his name escapes me.

857
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,080
Nobody is really sure.

858
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,640
I don't know if he was in the House of Lords.

859
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:20,880
There you go.

860
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:25,420
I'd love to turn you on.

861
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:35,400
Green Acres is the place to be.

862
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,080
Farm living is the life for me.

863
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,500
Land spreading out so far and wide.

864
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:47,060
Take my hand.

865
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,780
Just give me that countryside.

866
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,960
Just give me that countryside.

867
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,600
Green Acres, we are there.

868
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,960
New York is where I'd rather stay.

869
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:11,580
I get allergic when I'm smelling hay.

870
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:16,780
I just adore a penthouse view.

871
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,880
With a look at Central Park.

872
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:23,420
Darling, I love you, but give me Park Avenue.

873
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,580
Green Acres, we are there.

874
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:37,140
The chores, the stores, fresh air, Times Square.

875
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,860
You are my wife.

876
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:40,460
Goodbye, city life.

877
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,820
Green Acres, we are there.

878
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,560
I'm glad I was here when it happened.

879
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,580
I think I can tell my grandchildren.

880
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:48,820
Ahhhhh.

881
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:58,840
Green Acres is the place to be.

882
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,020
So it looks like Heath is, uh...

883
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:02,920
You know when people harmonize and sing, that's when Dave talks.

884
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:08,220
Well, luckily for me I can't harmonize for Fred.

885
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,760
I am terrible at it.

886
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:15,040
I had to cut Dave from that last time we did that,

887
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,420
when we had the sing-along.

888
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,260
on the Dobbs shanty.

889
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,940
Sing along with Dobbs.

890
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,880
Dave, Dave, Dave.

891
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,260
There's a strophy and an antistrophe.

892
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,020
You know, it's funny the way...

893
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:25,700
I'm a strophy.

894
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,000
I say something and then back...

895
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:27,480
Dave's not here, man.

896
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,180
Princess, was it you who was just doing that...

897
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,040
Yes.

898
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,640
That was me.

899
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,520
This is like getting too ASMR for me.

900
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:38,420
Tsk, tsk.

901
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,240
I was trying to explain something that was very important.

902
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,700
Thanks to follow this, I know what that means.

903
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,900
And now, follow along with this.

904
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:47,940
Geek Acres.

905
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,180
We're going to sing that together finally.

906
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:52,680
Very good.

907
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:56,420
Princess, we and I wrote this takeoff.

908
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,880
And for last year, we were going to sing it together.

909
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,300
We worked really hard at that.

910
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,340
And then Donald Trump did it.

911
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,380
And then, yeah, then Trump made me go to Texas instead.

912
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,640
And she tried to sing it a little bit.

913
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,860
I sang it by myself, but it's not just good singing.

914
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,620
But did you see Trump in overalls?

915
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,540
I need to sing it with you.

916
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,200
Singing Green Acres?

917
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,220
This is a real thing.

918
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,160
I hate that person so much because...

919
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,000
Yeah, that was awful.

920
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,580
You don't want to do what you don't want you to do.

921
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:21,640
Terrible.

922
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,160
It was bad.

923
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,000
Don't hate that part, Dave.

924
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,740
His mind power.

925
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,840
Don't hate it.

926
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,040
Trump has great mind power, though.

927
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:30,480
You know, sir?

928
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:31,160
Oh, yes.

929
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:35,240
He can make you walk funny, talk, sing different things.

930
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,040
Oh, yes.

931
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,280
And if I were him, I would kill myself.

932
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,480
But I can't kill anybody else, so let's go.

933
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:42,680
You know.

934
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:43,680
Well, Dave, I'm sorry.

935
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:43,680


936
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:43,680


937
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:43,680


938
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:43,680


939
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:43,680


940
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:43,680


941
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:52,760
Well, we've certainly enjoyed this edition of the Hour of Whatever It Is on radio, whatchamacallit.

942
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:58,340
And we hope that you'll remember what you heard here.

943
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:01,260
You will remember that thing you can't remember.

944
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,820
It's that whatchamacallit, that thing that...

945
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:08,460
That thing that you do, that hoodoo that you do so well, that...

946
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:09,680
The thing...

947
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,000
The voodoo book you find in the dark alley.

948
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:13,560
It's a synchronicity.

949
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:13,660
It's a synchronicity.

950
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:13,660


951
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,180
It's a synthesis of hour of slack and...

952
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:18,220
The thing's next six exits.

953
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,040
Can you...

954
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:26,260
My friends, you do not understand that they, the conspiracy, are right now, as we speak,

955
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,680
trying to steal your slack.

956
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:28,900
Your slack.

957
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,500
How are you going to get your slack back?

958
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:34,420
Get your slack back, Jack.

959
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,020
You need to buy your saucer ticket, because the saucers are coming.

960
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,620
There is still time, brother.

961
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,180
You are born with original slack.

962
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,380
But the conspiracy...

963
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,320
The conspiracy is constantly stealing it from you.

964
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,540
Sucking it away.

965
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,460
You must, you must tell them all.

966
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:54,480
F them if they can't take a joke.

967
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:58,240
When they tell you choose A or B, you choose C.

968
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,360
That's right.

969
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:01,980
And the truth shall be revealed.

970
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:02,460
Oh, yes.

971
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:05,700
And the streets will flow with the blood of the nonbelievers.

972
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:10,460
My mom had decided to take me to the zoo for a four pence and...

973
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,380
Lucky she took you back.

974
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:12,500
...and you're a monkey.

975
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,900
...I'd be able to wear the strange underwear.

976
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,880
And I had a monkey hat that I had to wear at the same time.

977
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:18,620
A monkey.

978
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:20,120
So we stopped at the...

979
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,220
One monkey hat don't stop no show.

980
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:22,540
...I put me down at the...

981
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:23,800
We went all the way down to Yucca.

982
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:28,780
...to remember where everybody remembers where Yucca Beach Park used to be.

983
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,720
And I was on the rollercoaster.

984
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:31,440
Oh.

985
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:36,600
And your dad, oh, he was quite a person and he was 345 pounds.

986
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:39,620
You must be at least this tall to ride this ride.

987
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:40,180
Put a light weight.

988
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,800
And his ears were all...

989
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:42,360
I think I had a little bit of a backache.

990
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:42,360


991
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:42,360


992
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:42,360


993
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:42,360


994
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:45,500
dragged right along the floor, right along with him as he, you know,

995
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,740
shout those holy words.

996
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,420
Oh, he was so magnetic.

997
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:51,280
He was like a magnet itself or something.

998
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,020
My goodness.

999
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:56,160
Ah, childhood's lost dream.

1000
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,260
So, Keith, how are you doing?

1001
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:04,560
You really don't want me to go into it because you guys have this, like,

1002
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,840
wonderful flow right now.

1003
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:10,280
And if I answer that honestly, I'm going to completely drag down the energy level.

1004
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,760
So we're just going to say, I'm fine, I'm great.

1005
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,940
And I'm going to leave it at that right now.

1006
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,460
But, yeah, I got guests of my own coming up.

1007
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:18,980
Yeah.

1008
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:22,460
Yeah, like I said, this is a very special episode of Crap Radio coming up,

1009
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:23,960
but I definitely want to make room for it.

1010
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:25,940
So thank you for the extra time, Keith.

1011
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,560
Just stay tuned.

1012
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:28,460
I'll be depressed.

1013
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:30,720
Honestly, it's better than any of the garbage music I've done today.

1014
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,380
Don't touch that dial.

1015
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,780
Keep it right here.

1016
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:39,020
I'm staking my future on possible collaborations with one of your guests.

1017
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,160
We had a brilliant idea.

1018
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:40,800
The other day.

1019
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,080
Oh, man.

1020
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:46,120
Anyway, no, I'm kind of joking there.

1021
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,460
Let the crap flow through you.

1022
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,440
Let the crap flow through you.

1023
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:49,760
Indeed.

1024
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,240
So anyway, folks, this has been a very special episode of Synesthesia.

1025
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,020
Thank you, Nomani Marks.

1026
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:56,360
Thank you, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, especially.

1027
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,320
And thank you, Dr. Howell.

1028
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:00,020
Thank you, Princess.

1029
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,420
We thank you, Reverend Stang.

1030
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:01,940
But of course.

1031
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:02,780
But of course.

1032
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,580
It's been a long, strange trip.

1033
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,780
And until next time, keep it surreal.

1034
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:09,480
Accept.

1035
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,160
Next time, we're not going to be on planet Earth anymore.

1036
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,180
Oh, no.

1037
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,660
No, no.

1038
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,100
The saucers will come.

1039
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:19,300
Let's just hope there's radio.

1040
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,560
Nos vemos muy pronto en el planeta X.

1041
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:25,260
Planeta X.

1042
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:28,300
SÃ­, nos vemos muy pronto en el planeta X.

1043
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:29,740
Eso sÃ­.

1044
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:37,160
Y los demÃ¡s pueden quemarse en el infierno con trabajo sin sentido, sin razÃ³n.

1045
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,080
Hemos visto el futuro.

1046
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,140
Y lo hemos pasado.

1047
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:43,880
Until next time, folks.

1048
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:45,700
Y los meses pasados.

1049
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:46,280
SÃ­.

1050
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,040
All right.

1051
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:48,320
Until next time, keep it surreal.

1052
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:59,860
And in so keeping, now we shall hear Andrew the Impaled and his band, the Liberty Tubes,

1053
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:06,260
in an inspiring song called New Freak Nation.

1054
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,960
Everybody get in line.

1055
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:39,700
Everybody get in line.

1056
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:40,260
Everybody from the newsroom.

1057
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,260
New Freak Nation.

1058
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,940
Open up your tired eyes.

1059
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,440
Oh, get up now from your hibernation.

1060
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:52,720
Our research shows a shocking rise in evil bullshit.

1061
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,500
And how they pull shit in sick.

1062
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:59,420
You'd be surprised to know just how deep it's gone.

1063
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:01,040
Or maybe not.

1064
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,780
So everybody, now's the time.

1065
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,840
Stag a weapon and file out right behind me.

1066
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:25,140
The freaky time is coming soon.

1067
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,960
All non-believers leave the room.

1068
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,520
Listen, won't be said again.

1069
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,300
This is your life to defend.

1070
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:34,380
We won't stand and live by as it devolves into madness.

1071
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,380
Resolves in a sad mess.

1072
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:39,600
A broken pipe dream of the day.

1073
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:40,260
When we're all alone.

1074
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:40,260


1075
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:40,260


1076
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:40,260


1077
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:41,160
When freaks take control.

1078
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,980
Oh yes, that's the goal.

1079
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,920
Now who's still with me?

1080
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,600
Hurry up this little time.

1081
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,020
I'm running up on the dissipation.

1082
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,560
You've heard enough of leaders' lies.

1083
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:01,520
Lies.

1084
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,900
You've learned enough to know the true frustration.

1085
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:09,420
Burning in the hearts of every woman, man and child.

1086
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:11,860
A firewall of style.

1087
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:16,620
The truth is most folks are trained to just ignore it.

1088
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:17,960
And that's some shit.

1089
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:21,400
To turn the other cheek is fine.

1090
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:26,580
If you don't care, but if you do, we're counting on you.

1091

Subtitles by the Amara.org community

1092
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:42,060
Whattafucka

1093
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:47,240
What are you playing in 1997, California nobody used to guess your class is a N3æœ­r

1094
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:47,240


1095
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,320
Looks like you're fine.

1096
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:49,840
Lyrics.

1097
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:50,400
Peace.

1098
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:50,520
Do complimentation, y'know.

1099
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:50,780
What are you watching me do, or bunch of maids?

1100
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,540
Who will beat your fuckin' host?

1101
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:55,520
I'm rolling.

1102
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:55,940
Dig it bud.

1103
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:09,400
Are you feeling weird?

1104
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,280
The few who understand what's right

1105
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,300
The few who hunger for some confrontation

1106
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:24,280
Will get to undertake the fight

1107
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:28,420
Get sent to usher in the new freak nation

1108
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:32,960
No one knows why all the freaky kids outside are screaming

1109
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,900
Or that they're dreaming, scheming

1110
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:39,700
Once it flows, this river ain't never gonna stop

1111
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,600
Even if we drop

1112
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:45,180
For you, step one is just sit tight

1113
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:50,440
And imagine all the things you'd change in this world

1114
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:54,920
Some of you are gonna fail

1115
00:56:54,920 --> 00:57:03,820
Some of you are gonna fail

1116
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,380
Some of you are gonna fail

1117
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,320
Others will end up in jail

1118
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,080
Danger lurks, so please take care

1119
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,720
Try not to get killed out there

1120
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,980
Most will say that we're mad

1121
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:14,880
And implore us to give in

1122
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,500
But the way that we're living

1123
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,080
Just makes my hair curl up

1124
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,760
Your fist and focus your power

1125
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,420
For you'll soon know they are

1126
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:25,360
We'll take back the world

1127
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,340
We will find a way to change it

1128
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:53,220
We're living at our destination

1129
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:53,220


1130
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:53,220


1131
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,600
I don't need the verdade

1132
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,400
They've been killed

1133
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:55,400


1134
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:55,400


1135
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:55,400


1136
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:55,400


1137
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:59,340
I'll get up and die

1138
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:03,040
I wanna fly

1139
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:03,600
You know your dedi

1140
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,000
Ancients we couldn't do

1141
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:05,660
I told you old college men

1142
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:05,880
And now you served me

1143
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:09,760
Everybody from the New Frick Nation

1144
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,400
Everybody get in line

1145
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,720
Everybody from the New Frick Nation

1146
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,360
Everybody now's the time

1147
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:23,060
Snag a weapon and fire it

1148
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:24,320
Right behind me

1149
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:32,660
Oh, yes, dear friends.

1150
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:37,040
Thank you, our good buddy, Andrew Laswell.

1151
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,860
St. Andrew the Impaled, his band,

1152
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:43,820
his first album, The Liberty Tubes,

1153
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:47,520
New Frick Nation, and We're Outta Here.

1154
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:51,420
You can know more at subgenius.com.

1155
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:58,540
And the music in the background is by the Psychoskeletons,

1156
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:02,080
and I think this instrumental actually has the title of

1157
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,820
Uncle Stan.

1158
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:42,120
Uncle Stan.

1159
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:04,840
Uncle Stan.

1160
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,160
Uncle Stan.

1161
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:07,000
Uncle Stan.

1162
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,100
Uncle Stan.

1163
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:35,100


1164
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:35,100


1165
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:35,100


1166
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:35,100


1167
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:35,100


1168
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:35,100


1169
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:35,100


1170
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:35,100


1171
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:35,100


1172
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,240
Something much, much worse.

1173
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,440
And if you already have become a subgenius minister

1174
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,700
and gotten that huge 25-piece membership kit

1175
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:45,680
with button and bumper stickers and minister's card

1176
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,820
and many frameable certificates and lots of dog's heads,

1177
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,140
you might not have the book of the subgenius

1178
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:55,720
or Neighbor World or even our world-famous pamphlets

1179
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,080
over 100,000 sold.

1180
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,580
Well, not Neighbor World, about 80 of those.

1181
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,360
But come on, man.

1182
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:04,820
Come on.

1183
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:11,000
For that matter, there's fast clothing designs and drinkware with subgenius graphics on them

1184
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:18,340
and all manner of fine Dobbsware and Dobbs gimmickry and Bob Daggets and DVDs of movies,

1185
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:22,140
good and bad ones, mostly pretty good and very weird.

1186
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:28,580
And CDs of what we did before the radio shows and after, like stage shows and such.

1187
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:36,560
Boy, it's just an immense mess of keen and yet sacred collectibles, enjoyables and guilty pleasures.

1188
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:41,320
And the book of the subgenius is autographed when you get it from us.

1189
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:44,280
Not by Bob, no, sorry, just me.

1190
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:49,640
Philo and Sterno and Byron and Onan are all going to be here soon for that movie premiere,

1191
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,240
though maybe I'll get them to sign the copies I have in stock.

1192
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:56,140
I won't let peas do it, though.

1193
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,480
I better order those books.

1194
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:03,540
Anyway, thank you, friends, and good night or good day or whatevs.

1195
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:04,720
Praise Bob.
