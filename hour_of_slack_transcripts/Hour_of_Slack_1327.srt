1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:01,960
Wowie Bob!

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:03,060
Oh!

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,160
I don't think that's...

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,720
Hey, Pastor! Bob's here! I'm gonna call your father!

5
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,300
You're the drummer! Get the kids! You're gonna get the house!

6
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,760
What the fuck am I gonna do with this?

7
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:11,960
Bob!

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,320
Now this... Bob...

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,580
can't really exist.

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,800
Bob-bob!

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,700
Has anyone seen Bob on Earth in the last few weeks?

12
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,680
No, not yet.

13
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,180
There are repeated references to Bob.

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,800
He was a threatening presence in our life

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,700
by early adolescence.

16
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,480
There are intimations of abuse and molestation on a regular basis.

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,260
That's Bob.

18
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,000
It's all a lie.

19
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,240
What?

20
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,680
It's not what you think.

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,560
This isn't rape.

22
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,440
It's research.

23
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,380
But I will not be researched!

24
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,980
Alright, let's go.

25
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,580
Thank you for the education.

26
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,440
Gentlemen, we've just received a Ph.D.

27
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,280
in stupidity.

28
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,480
Doctor, shall we?

29
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,280
It's not criminal

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,520
to try and understand female emotions.

31
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,240
Anyway, friends, this...

32
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,700
I must say, this was

33
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,460
indeed the best X-Day

34
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,420
ever. So far.

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,100
So far.

36
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,480
I suppose there's still room for one

37
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,100
slight possible

38
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,840
screw up. You can always screw the pooch

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,100
at the last moment.

40
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,640
The worst that could happen is we'd have to do it all over

41
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,220
again, and it has been...

42
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,860
The bands have been fantastic.

43
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,720
We've

44
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,500
managed to

45
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,560
ban everyone

46
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,460
who wasn't a good band.

47
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,080
And so

48
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,480
altogether, I think

49
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,060
Dobbs will be pleased.

50
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,280
Connie, I know, is pleased.

51
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,660
I heard her moans and groans echoing

52
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,000
through the woods last night.

53
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,320
By the way,

54
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,720
although there were some

55
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,200
excellent bands down on the main

56
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,140
stage, I don't know how many

57
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,040
of you caught what was going on in here

58
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,120
last night. There was really

59
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,540
quite an amazing

60
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,320
setup with the Ministry of Slack

61
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,020
combined with the Evolution Control

62
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,160
Committee, and all the

63
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,080
music and pictures that they've

64
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,280
stolen over the years, all crammed together

65
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,700
into one great big mashup.

66
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,520
I actually put

67
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,720
my camera down long enough to dance

68
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,980
for half a second.

69
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,880
Yes, Joy was unconfined.

00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:20,620
No!

105
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,940
No!

electrifying shark singing

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,320
The stinger tune, the sound of a shark

115

The jumping shore, the strong distance

116
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,700
The jittery europe

00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,040

00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,980
How long, how long, how long

Thank you.

00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,560
Thank you.

125
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,600
And, friends,

126
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,640
that was an excerpt from the

127
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,240
aforementioned jam

128
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,720
between Trademark G of the Evolution

129
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,800
Control Committee and Ministry

130
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,600
of Slack. Mainly

131
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,000
Reverend Exister

132
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,220
and Reverend Slander Bob.

133
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,740
Before that, and more later,

134
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,740
some live hour of Slack with

135
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,800
Dr. Howell

136
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,540
from the Wisterian Cafe

137
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,780
stage. Not all

138
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,180
of this episode is from 14X

139
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,600
Day, just most of it.

140
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,260
DJ Reverend

141
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,340
Slackmaster Sarcastro

142
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,660
did the intro, for instance.

143
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,280
But now back to X Day

144
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,500
Drill with the band from which

145
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,380
this background music also

146
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,340
comes, Boron

147
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,320
Nuzzle, on the main stage

148
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,920
with a rant by Reverend

149
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,040
Sid Redlin, a rant

150
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,820
of much gravity.

151
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,140
Ladies and gentlemen,

152
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,220
the Boron Nuzzle Foundation

153
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,780
sponsored

154
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,400
by the

155
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,360
Cortester Manifold Emporium

156
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,940
Scientific

157
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,340
Endowment Division.

158
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,220
Through intensive research in the movements

159
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,040
of mollusks within

160
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,100
fourth-dimensional matrices has made a

161
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,140
startling and potentially

162
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,100
lethal discovery.

163
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,180
Gravity is in

164
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,260
our minds!

165
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,600
Yes,

166
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,240
as stunning and arbitrary as this may

167
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,620
seem,

168
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,480
universal gravitation

169
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,380
is defined by Newton as a useful

170
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,600
conceptual delusion

171
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,340
collectively brought into existence through the projected

172
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,120
will of our entire planet's population

173
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,220
to further our own physical

174
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,460
evolution and scientific development as a species.

175
00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:00,180
The philosophical and historical implications are, of course, staggering.

176
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,040
At what point was gravity agreed upon?

177
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,440
Is it a function of intelligence?

178
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:14,120
Was gravity retroactively applied to past events to make a cohesive fossil and geological

179
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,140
record that would help sustain this collective self-deception for our own benefit?

180
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,820
Yet there is more!

181
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,440
A schism amongst the masses!

182
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:24,440


183
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,600
The pertinent research agencies has arisen!

184
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,540
The Society for the Preservation of Gravity

185
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,340
fears gravity may be finite!

186
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:39,600
This group of learned entities seeks to encourage the use of levitation by the populace as a

187
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,680
means to extend the lifetime of our gravitational supply until we discover another gravitational

188
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,080
source or until such time as gravitation is no longer needed.

189
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,420
In marked contrast to this organization, the

190
00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:03,060
gravitational integrity foundation seeks to maintain the illusion of gravity in the minds of the people at all costs!

191
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:12,520
They fear that if some persons engage in hovering activities, the disillusionment which will occur in the minds of non-hovering entities

192
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:23,540
will result in a gravitational breakdown throughout the system at large, resulting in gravitational disintegration before we as a scientific community and as a species.

193
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,240
are prepared to deal with the consequences.

194
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,580
Both parties cannot be correct!

195
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,060
Boron Nuzzle is a democratic and enlightened collective

196
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,420
and encourage you to make your own decisions!

197
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,000
You may choose to levitate

198
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,800
or you may reject this notion

199
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,980
as intrinsically dangerous

200
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,780
to the good of humans the world over.

201
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,220
But you must decide!

202
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,160
And the time to decide is now!

203
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
Attention! Attention!

204
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,720
Subgeniuses!

205
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,340
The music for tonight is about to commence

206
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,560
and

207
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:20,880
and

208
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:20,960
and

209
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:20,960


210
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,100
,

211
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,720
and

212
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,240
to introduce our first musician

213
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,340
who has come a long, long way.

214
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,400
He's come such a long way

215
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,280
that I personally do not feel qualified

216
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,480
on any level to verbally masturbate him enough.

217
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,860
However, our beloved Priestess Pisces

218
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,440
is of just the right gender

219
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,900
and general nastiness to be able to do so correctly.

220
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,020
So, we've got this guy who's got this rig

221
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,880
that's a conglomeration of circuit fuckery

222
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,180
and masterful sub-engineering

223
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,780
who has come all the way from that other coast

224
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,680
so far away in the land of trees and lots of rain.

225
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,180
From Portland, Oregon, please give it up

226
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,000
for Dr. Zeronius and the Cult of Zere!

227
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,200
Hello.

228
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:19,660
Hello.

229
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:19,880
Hello.

230
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:19,880


231
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:19,880


232
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:19,880


233
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:19,880


234
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:19,880


235
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:19,880


236
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,600
, hello.

237
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,740
It is rare that so many subgenius doctors

238
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,900
of such extensive pedigree are seen in one place

239
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,300
causing a sort of chain reaction of a quorum.

240
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,320
At least, I think we feel the radiation, the contamination.

241
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,240
I'm going to bring him out in just a moment.

242
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,160
But first, our next cult is the original cult

243
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,820
co-author of the book of Zere, personal friend of Zere,

244
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,020
creator of Zere.

245
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,420
I am speaking of none other than Cult of Zere.

246
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:59,040
So please be ready to limber and loosen up for

247
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,660
Cult of Zere.

248
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,300
Cult of Zere.

249
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,840
Cult of Zere.

250
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:05,460
Cult of Zere.

251
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,460
Cult of Zere.

252
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,200
Cult of Zere.

253
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,740
Cult of Zere.

254
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,020
Cult of Zere.

255
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,680
Cult of Zere.

256
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,360
Cult of Zere.

257
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:16,760
Oh!

258
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,440
You'll be way happy.

259
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,160
Cult of Zere.

260
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,160


261
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,160


262
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:21,560


263
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,720
Oh!

264
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,900
Oh!

265
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,900
Anyway, that's the rosy future

266
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,580
But now we are still enmeshed in the toils of this planet

267
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,060
And the last convulsive struggles of X-Day

268
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,860
And convulsive they may well be

269
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,960
It's going to be a struggle for me to make it

270
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,120
We have two bands tonight

271
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,880
Two completely different bands

272
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,100
Cult of Zere

273
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,800
Which I played just a little bit of

274
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,160
Just before as we were setting up

275
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,740
It's weird experimental music

276
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,720
It had your voice mixed in with it

277
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,400
It did

278
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,040
Yes, Cult of Zere will be playing tonight

279
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,980
Followed by, to tap everything off

280
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,660
The Duke of Uke

281
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,140
The Duke of Uke, ladies and gentlemen

282
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,980
Hail Caesar

283
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,440
You will truly be

284
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,780
The, uh, well, Cult of Zere has just delivered

285
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,780
Great, I've got my own copy now

286
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:50,920
Excellent

287
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,140
Everything is going according to plan

288
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,360
Yes, Slag

289
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,420
What a quaint concept

290
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,300
Nice packaging

291
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,060
And it's dedicated to J.R. Bob Dobbs

292
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,520
Well, isn't that the best?

293
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,020
There's a lot of albums dedicated to J.R. Bob Dobbs

294
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,560
Usually by up-and-coming rock stars

295
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,400
Who OD'd on heroin

296
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,260
Just before they got rich and famous

297
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,420
Like Slugger

298
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:15,900
Sublime

299
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,600
That nice young man who created Sublime

300
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,100
He had to go and die of a heroin overdose

301
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,920
Just before he made us famous

302
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,420
That's too bad

303
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,020
Probably for the best

304
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,540
Heroin was his hero

305
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,720
Well, let's see

306
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,040
What do we have on the docket

307
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,080
In our remaining moments

308
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,340
Of the last hour of Slag

309
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,440
I've lost the docket, Dr. Hal

310
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,180
Oh dear, that's too bad

311
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,180
Although I guess there are still

312
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,900
We'll have to fly this thing by the seat of the pants

313
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,420
Coming in on a wing in a minute there, Slugger

314
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:45,500
Prayer

315
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,240
Though there's one motor gone

316
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,840
Still we must carry on

317
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,200
Or you could just free associate

318
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,400
Come up with a fountain

319
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,800
From your creative spring

320
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,580
Easy for you to say

321
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,040
You've got one

322
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,980
Yeah, but you've been doing this all these years

323
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,040
Yes, indeed

324
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,000
It's as easy as falling off a bicycle

325
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,840
You'll never forget

326
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,780
I can always just suddenly go

327
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,120
He's speaking in tongues, ladies and gentlemen

328
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,280
It's easy

329
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,880
Actually, it's not easy to speak in tongues

330
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,040
I really did practice for

331
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,320
On and off

332
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,140
Not daily, not all day, every day

333
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,960
But I did practice

334
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,600
Okay, well, let's do some sharing then

335
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,720
You know, the other day this film crew that was here

336
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,860
Was asking me about

337
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,880
Not only about my influences and church influences

338
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,360
But your influences

339
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,360
And one thing I threw in

340
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,060
I don't know whether you have done this

341
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,780
But I thought it fair to mention

342
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,040
Was that if you grew

343
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,620
Grew up in Texas

344
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,680
Or in the American South at all

345
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,880
At night on the radio

346
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,180
You would hear a torrent of these honkers and shouters

347
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,100
These preachers

348
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,780
Coming up

349
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,380
Pulling it out

350
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,180
And broadcasting to the faithful

351
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:05,060
And this is surely a great central influence

352
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,660
On everything the Church of the Subgenius has ever done

353
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,020
Sure, that's how we learned

354
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,820
My personal favorite was

355
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,920
The great Reverend Jimmy Swagger

356
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,940
Swagger

357
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:21,180
I believe that Swagger was a sincere preacher

358
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,260
That's what I liked about him

359
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,340
He has been compared to Mick Jagger

360
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,760
The Mick Jagger of preachers

361
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,060
Well, it rhymes with Swagger

362
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,880
His offstage backroom habits

363
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,760
Apparently were kind of similar too

364
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,040
But he was

365
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,140
Unlike Jim Baker

366
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,920
Who was just a faker

367
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,160
Trying to make money

368
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,860
Rhymes with Baker

369
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,920
Unlike so many of

370
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,120
Or

371
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,900
He was a sincere preacher

372
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,800
He was the real thing

373
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,440
Like Dr. Gene Scott

374
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,200
Now, he was

375
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,920
There was another great preacher

376
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,560
The late, great Dr. Gene Scott

377
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,340
Not as much of an influence

378
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,180
Because we were already kind of like him

379
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:56,960
But his

380
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,840
Bulldaughter

381
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,200
His facial similarity to an aging Kerwin Matthews

382
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,980
Was always off-putting

383
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,380
So, friends, yes, it's true

384
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,600
We have a lot to thank the conspiracy for

385
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,800
Such as insane money-grubbing

386
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,380
Preachers

387
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,740
Where would the church of the subgenius be

388
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,120
Without insane money-grubbing preachers?

389
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,760
And just think

390
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,340
I've heard people say

391
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,880
Well, they ought to outlaw that sort of thing

392
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,620
My grandmother gave

393
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,320
$10,000 to that radio preacher

394
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,140
That I should have inherited

395
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,380
Friends, the day that they make it illegal

396
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,820
To spend your money on something stupid

397
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,460
We're out of business

398
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,880
So, praise our wonderful country of America

399
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,220
And every other country

400
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,180
Where you're free

401
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,260
To spend your money on anything you want

402
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,280
No matter how dumb it may appear

403
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,100
Damn straight

404
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,240
They call it discretionary spending, don't they?

405
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,520
Well, that's your discretion

406
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,760
Whether or not you want to do it at all

407
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,640
I never heard such a tissue of malarkey

408
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,500
People want to fix everything up

409
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,920
They go off half-cocked

410
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,880
And they make it worse than it ever was before

411
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,800
Good afternoon, Bob

412
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,480
Welcome to Bob

413
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,660
I'll be here talking about

414
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,980
Christian, satanic, neo-Nazi occultism

415
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,980
What's on your mind?

416
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:24,560
Hi, Bob

417
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,760
Seated across from me

418
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,680
Live in the studio today is Bob

419
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,920
Bob is a satanist

420
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,340
He is a self-described occult fascist

421
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:31,880
Correct?

422
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:32,740
Absolutely

423
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,000
A whole lot of other things

424
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,200
You're an occult fascist?

425
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:35,560
Yes

426
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,520
You are a satanic neo-Nazi?

427
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:37,900
Yes

428
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,040
No, no, no

429
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,980
Yes, not precisely

430
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,600
We don't use fascist in the terms of it being fascist

431
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,820
Just more to represent

432
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,440
It being fascist

433
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,020
Judeo-Christian satanists

434
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,460
We see democracy as being

435
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,620
Basically the twin of

436
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,440
Judeo-Christian fascist

437
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:53,820
Satan

438
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,720
It's a

439
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,360
It's a

440
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,260
Beastial

441
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:56,940
Yes

442
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,380
Animal

443
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,400
Like the true part of man

444
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,900
Man is absolutely an animal

445
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,240
That's a good analogy, Bob

446
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,900
You listen to me

447
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,680
You know where I'm coming from

448
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,940
What do you feel like walking in here and sitting

449
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,600
I think one of the reasons I enjoy

450
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,760
These people who are weak and confused

451
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,500
Bob said there's a sucker born every minute

452
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,940
You're dressed in black

453
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,140
You Mr. Satanist

454
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,320
You're making good time of it

455
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,540
And confused people

456
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,040
Weak and confused fascist Christian Satanists

457
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,740
Yes, yes

458
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,060
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yes

459
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,900
Head to foot

460
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:31,680
Yes

461
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,780
Like they're savagery, they're independence

462
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,180
What do you mean secret underwear?

463
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,180
I don't know, I just maybe got

464
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,300
Did you wear some sort of secret underwear that you weren't telling your followers about?

465
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,100
Tell, tell

466
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,440
See, this is outrageous

467
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,880
You gutless wimping faggot

468
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,280
You're not even a fascist social darned as Christians

469
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,560
I have to take a break

470
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,860
Bob will be right back

471
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,560
65, 50, 98, 98

472
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,960
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

473
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,240
Bob did not edit that

474
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,540
Cult of Zere did

475
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,000
And now some music about God

476
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,960
By Little Jack Melody and his Young Turks and Beethoven

477
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,740
From the CD on the blank generator

478
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:14,860
From the CD on the blank generator

479
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,480

00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,200
Because, ladies and gentlemen,

578
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,080
this is called

579
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,180
Stairway to Britney.

580
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,500
And, ladies and gentlemen,

581
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,640
if I may introduce here,

582
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,420
live, on stage, here,

583
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,480
at X Day,

584
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,500
Miss B-B-B-B-Britney Spears.

585
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,540
Oh, baby, baby

586
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,920
How was I supposed to know

587
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,720
That something wasn't right here

588
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,480
Oh, baby, baby

589
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,940
I shouldn't have let you go

590
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,400
Oh, baby, baby

591
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,600
Now you're right outside, yeah

592
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,300
Show me how you want it to be

593
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,380
Tell me, baby

594
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,300
Cause I need to know now

595
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:39,280
Because my loneliness is killing me

596
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,200
And I, I must confess

597
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,180
I still believe

598
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,580
I still believe

599
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,020
When I'm not with you I lose my mind

600
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,820
Give me a sign

601
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,540
Give me, baby, one more time

602
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,080
Time

603
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,960
And then it makes me wonder

604
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,120
Oh, baby, baby

605
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,280
The reason I breathe

606
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,500
Is you

607
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:15,220
Boy, you got me blinded

608
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,000
Oh, pretty baby

609
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,980
There's nothing that I wouldn't do

610
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,800
It's nothing that I'm handed

611
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,660
Show me how you want it to be

612
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,880
Tell me, baby

613
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,720
Cause I need to know now

614
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,620
Because my loneliness is killing me

615
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:43,460
And I, my loneliness is killing me

616
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,180
And I, I must confess

617
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,260
I still believe

618
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,620
Still believe

619
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,960
When I'm not with you I lose my mind

620
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,000
With you I lose my mind

621
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,260
Give me a sign

622
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,280
Hit me, baby, one more time

623
00:33:59,280 --> 00:33:59,900
Time

624
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,040
I must confess

625
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,620
That I've only left you

626
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,460
I must confess

627
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:13,540
That I've only left you

628
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,440
I must confess

629
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,880
That I've only left you

630
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,160
I must confess

631
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,960
That I've only left you

632
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:20,960


633
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,400
I must confess

634
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,500
It's killing me now

635
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,080
Don't you know I still believe

636
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,680
That you will be here

637
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,400
And you'll be a sign

638
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:41,640
Hit me, baby, one more time

639
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,260
Thank you.

640
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,340
Woo!

641
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,960
That's, uh, that's, uh, that's the sound that refreshes, actually.

642
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,120
Yeah, it actually kind of did, actually.

643
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,360
I really actually spent.

644
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:03,040
We also have, uh, what else tonight?

645
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:03,900
Yeah, that's about it.

646
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,340
After the baptism, I figure it's gonna take,

647
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,620
we're not gonna have any more Bulldada auction.

648
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,920
We already made our $250.

649
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,960
You'll be left to your own devices.

650
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:17,040
Uh, we, yeah, until, there'll be some great bands down there.

651
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,660
Uh, did I mention Duke of Uke?

652
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,620
Yes, you did.

653
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,360
If you don't know the concept behind Duke of Uke,

654
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,680
uh, bring some toilet paper with you,

655
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,120
because you may soil your pants in surprise.

656
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,520
The first time I heard the Duke on stage,

657
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,920
I, no one had explained what he did.

658
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,020
And it was at a subgenius revival,

659
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,840
and this guy comes out with this little ukulele

660
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,640
and starts, like Tiny Tim, plinking along,

661
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,600
and I thought, oh my God,

662
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,320
not another one of those terrible,

663
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,760
heartland revivals.

664
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:57,300
But, then, I recognized what the song was

665
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,400
that he was playing on that little ukulele.

666
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,880
And that is the key to the greatness

667
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,220
that is the Duke of Uke.

668
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,560
You'll all find yourselves singing along,

669
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:10,360
if not pogoing, to that one instrument.

670
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:15,080
Uh, slam dancing and, and having a, uh, what, a mud pit,

671
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,840
what do the kids call it these days?

672
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,140
I think the term you're looking for is mosh pit.

673
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,340
Mosh pit, yeah, right.

674
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:37,460
Hey na na, hey na na, hey na na, hey na na.

675
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,660
Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low,

676
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:47,180
lean back on my radio,

677
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:51,020
some gad was playing down some rock and roll

678
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,200
out of Soli's set.

679
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,440
Then the loud sound, it seemed, of fate

680
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,120
came back like a slow voice on a wave of fate.

681
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,380
There was no DJ, there was AZ Cosmic Drive.

682
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:14,920
There's a star man waiting in the sky,

683
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,640
he'd like to come and meet us,

684
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,780
but he thinks he'd blow our minds.

685
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:24,080
There's a star man waiting in the sky,

686
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,680
he told us not to blow it,

687
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,720
cause he'd know this all was wild.

688
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,960
He told me he'd let the children use it,

689
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,160
let your children lose it,

690
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,360
let all the children boogie.

691
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,500
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah,

692
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,280
bah, bah, bah, bah,

693
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,300
bah, bah, bah, bah,

694
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,240
bah, bah, bah, bah,

695
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,300
bah, bah, bah, bah,

696
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,600
bah, bah, bah, bah,

697
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,020
bah, bah, bah.

698
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:56,360
At the phone someone's quite picked on you,

699
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,040
he asked for out so you heard him too.

700
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:04,500
Turn on your TV, you can pick him up on channel two.

701
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,960
Look out your window, you can see his light,

702
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,160
if we can sparkle he may land tonight.

703
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,400
Don't tell your papa or he'll get us locked up and fried.

704
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:26,900
There's a star man waiting in the sky,

705
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,500
he'd like to come and meet us,

706
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,420
but he thinks he'd blow our minds.

707
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:35,700
There's a star man waiting in the sky,

708
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,280
he told us not to blow it,

709
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,240
cause he'd know this all was wild.

710
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,300
He told me he'd let the children use it,

711
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,640
let the children use it,

712
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,640
let all the children bilky.

713
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,260
Bah, bah, bah, bah,

714
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,180
bah, bah, bah, bah,

715
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,760
bah, bah, bah, bah,

716
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,100
bah, bah, bah, bah,

717
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,400
bah, bah, bah, bah,

718
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:06,440
bah, bah, bah, bah,

719
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,300
ab

720
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,900
Ba ba ba ba ba.

721
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,100
Ba ba ba ba.

722
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,460
Ba ba ba ba ba.

723
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,420
Fred Bob.

724
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,780
Thank you for choosing Subgenius.

725
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,520
There's some conspicuous absences this year.

726
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,520
I'm not about to talk what you think I'm talking about.

727
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:42,460
Our friend, Admiral Tits, couldn't be with us here today.

728
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:43,720
Praise Tits!

729
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,040
Praise Tits, indeed.

730
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,060
But she had sent me a thing the other day requesting that I play this,

731
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,580
so I hope this gets to her somehow.

732
00:39:54,040 --> 00:40:00,700
The sun on the meadow is summery warm

733
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,800
The barren of forest runs free

734
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:16,780
But gather together to greet this dawn

735
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:23,660
Tomorrow belongs to me

736
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,080
This

737
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,080


738
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,340
branch of the spiral

739
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:42,240
unbrightens the sky

740
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:46,420
The milky way

741
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,840
shines on the sea

742
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:54,960
And somewhere a glory

743
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,740
awaits unseen

744
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,340
Tomorrow belongs

745
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,900
to me

746
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:15,520
Oh, mothership, mothership

747
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,160
Send us a sign

748
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,300
Your light

749
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,260
we have waited

750
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,500
to see

751
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,080
The

752
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,480
morning will

753
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,080
rise when the

754
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:32,520
world

755
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,360
is

756
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:36,420
mine

757
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,940
Tomorrow belongs

758
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,820
Tomorrow belongs

759
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,320
Tomorrow belongs

760
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,780
to me

761
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,740
That was some cabaret.

762
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,460
I tried to take all the Nazi out of it.

763
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,780
A Reverend Janice Blanket,

764
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:06,780


765
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,900
a very involved new preacher,

766
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,180
recorded by

767
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,900
St. Elliot at Wisteria in Southern Ohio

768
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,760
at the 14X Day Drill.

769
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,920
But now the opposite.

770
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,220
The great St. Andrew the Impaled

771
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,460
telling of the after effects

772
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,360
of too much false slack.

773
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,240
The Hangover Song by Andrew.

774
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,620
With Senator Speck from the Amino Acids on Drums

775
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,940
making it up as he goes along.

776
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,640
But I guess,

777
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,060
we all do that non-stop, don't we?

778
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,660
Yeah, this is that song,

779
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,520
this is that song about,

780
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,620
about when you wake up

781
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,820
Sunday morning

782
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,000
and you don't know where you are.

783
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,980
Shinin', it's blindin', it's ridin'

784
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,820
My eyes out late again

785
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,200
with my crazy asshole friends

786
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,020
and I can't even pretend it'd be okay

787
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,620
for me to spend more time

788
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:05,720
time

789
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,300
Hey, anybody here got the time?

790
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,220
My head is floating like a boulder

791
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,580
Feels like it's coming off my shoulders

792
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:23,420
I just love when my day starts like this

793
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,580
Useless and clueless

794
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,780
I do this each time

795
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:31,880
Just when you think it might start to sink

796
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,120
And it's gone in a blink

797
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,940
And I'm back to the brink again

798
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:39,060
Hey, anybody here see my friends?

799
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:42,660
My head is floating like a boulder

800
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:48,000
Feels like it's coming off my shoulders

801
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:53,880
I just love when my day starts like this

802
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:58,940
I just love when my day starts like this

803
00:43:58,940 --> 00:43:59,580
Here it is!

804
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,120
Don't know where I'm going

805
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,980
Don't know how I got here

806
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:05,700
I just love when my day starts like this

807
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:05,700


808
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,100
Don't even know where I am

809
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,280
Seriously

810
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:12,800
Seriously

811
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,720
Can somebody tell me how to get back to 15?

812
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,940
I don't recall too much of last night

813
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,640
Left my car on the east side

814
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,280
How I got here with some guy

815
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,400
Really all I know

816
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,440
Something about Albrecht

817
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:34,800
Albrecht!

818
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,680
Albrecht!

819
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,120
Albrecht!

820
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,040
Wasted

821
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,380
Yeah, face it

822
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,640
I spaced it

823
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,580
It's fine

824
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:45,480
What do I do now?

825
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,480
I'll somehow get downtown

826
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,860
Bring out everyone around

827
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,660
Cause I gotta feed the clown inside

828
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:50,820
Inside

829
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:53,460
Hey, anybody here give me a ride?

830
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:57,020
My head is floating like a boulder

831
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,160
Feel like it's coming off my shoulder

832
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:03,780
Feel like it's coming off my shoulder

833
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,680
I wonder just how long I'm gonna stay here?

834
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,800
I wonder just how many disasters

835
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,060
Between now and the sweet hereafter

836
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,600
My head is floating like a boulder

837
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,300
I just love when my

838
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:21,780
Here it is!

839
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,280
Yeah!

840
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:29,840
I think the term you're looking for is mosh pit?

841
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,040
Mosh pit, yeah, right.

842
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,520
I've watched those from afar.

843
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:35,680
I've watched those from afar.

844
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,280
I've documented them.

845
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:42,740
Well, I was on tour with GWAR, you know, the metal band GWAR for five days.

846
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:46,240
I voluntarily left the tour after that because

847
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,940
How did you avoid heat prostration?

848
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:50,000
I didn't. That was why I quit.

849
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,680
It gets hot in those concerts.

850
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:58,940
But I did have a good time filming the band and watching the kids injure each other.

851
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:03,680
But the most important thing to me was the very first time I saw that band GWAR,

852
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:08,700
this question entered my head that I had to have answered.

853
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,940
How do their costumes smell when they take them off?

854
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:13,980
Fairly right.

855
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:14,860
Do they wash them?

856
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,880
And I learned the answer.

857
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:23,120
No, they do not wash them and they smell like the most diseased mildew you could ever imagine.

858
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,540
I think that adds to the totality of the experience.

859
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:32,820
In fact, at X Day Drill 97, I believe, the sex executioner from GWAR,

860
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:36,180
came to X Day for his vacation.

861
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:42,200
The one day of the year that he didn't have to get splattered with fake blood.

862
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:49,480
Unfortunately, that happened to be the day that Legume had a big globe of the earth filled with fake blood,

863
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:51,900
which he smashed with a baseball bat,

864
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:58,340
splattering poor Chuck Varga, the sex executioner, with fake blood, even on his vacation.

865
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,240
Another interesting irony about X Day.

866
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:02,820
The...

867
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,880
One of the only times anyone has been injured here,

868
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:12,220
it was the medical doctor who happened to be here, Dr. Tillis.

869
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:13,640
Physician, heal thyself.

870
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:17,160
He was standing a little bit too close to the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer

871
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:23,040
when we launched it for the last time a bit prematurely using actual dynamite.

872
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:28,220
And the doctor himself actually got a chunk of the head embedded in his chest.

873
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,000
A badge of honor, Ivan.

874
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:31,140
Indeed.

875
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:32,480
In fact, he is...

876
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,000
He is a...

877
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:36,420
He is a rich and successful rancher now.

878
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,880
Praise Dr. Tillis.

879
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:42,960
So, if you get hurt here, later on you'll get rich.

880
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,540
The End

881
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,460
Who shall defile the temples of the ancient gods?

882
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:58,180
A cruel and violent death shall be his fate,

883
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:01,380
and never shall his soul find rest.

884
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:09,840
And to eternity, such is the curse of Bob, our King of all Bubbies.

885
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,580
The End

886
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,400
The End

887
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,140
The End

888
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:20,720
The End

889
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:21,600
The End

890
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,600
The End

891
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,120
The End

892
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:23,300
The End

893
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:23,760
The End

894
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:23,780
The End

895
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:23,940
The End

896
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:45,580
The End

897
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,560
The End

898
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:11,040
The End

899
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,460
The End

900
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:15,520
The End

901
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:15,560
The End

902
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,480
Only when I gotta go to the bathroom.

903
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,220
I see.

904
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,960
Open wide, please.

905
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,300
Oh, my.

906
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,400
Yes! Yes!

907
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,340
Okay, I think I know what your problem is.

908
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,840
What is it, Doc? Tell me.

909
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,860
Well, you have a small touch of electroconvulsive,

910
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,560
chronic compulsive, schizolecucleomenangital,

911
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,140
cerebral spinal, hypermenic, psychosomatic,

912
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,880
neurocoaxial, endopeptaxial,

913
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,320
anaphylactic, hypochondriactic, neurobacterial,

914
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,620
na-na-na-na-na-na-nucleos, sclerosis,

915
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,660
nervosa, infectious, acutus, na-na-na-na-na-nax,

916
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:51,760
cerebral castration.

917
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,640
What? Could you repeat that, please?

918
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:57,180
No, no, don't. Just tell me in layman's terms.

919
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:57,900
In layman's terms?

920
00:49:59,080 --> 00:49:59,520
Okay.

921
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,600
I am so sorry, Mr. Nussbaum.

922
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:06,680
But you're going insane, insane, insane.

923
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:07,080
What?

924
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,080
You mean I'm going cuckoo?

925
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,140
You're going crazy, Mr. Nussbaum.

926
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:13,300
Congratulations.

927
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,940
to report you're going to have to be staying with us for quite some time

928
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:22,860
you're crazy

929
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,820
funky thing going on you got a funky thing going on

i pleaded vehemently with ben hula but she was too powerfully persuasive

after you deal with a quick crying cement you got a funky thing going on

945
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:11,840
i'm a i'm a little bird i weave in a cage i think i'm on fire and i have insects in my brains

946
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,860
i'm a little bird i weave in a cage i think i'm on fire and i have insects in my brains

947
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:28,080
i'm a little bird i weave in a cage i think i'm on fire and i factor in a cage i'm a little there

948
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:28,580
yeah

949
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:29,940
i'm way too good

950
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:29,940


951
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:29,940


952
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:29,940


953
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:31,660
when the

954
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,160
into

955
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:43,780
everyone

956
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:57,800
To the American soldier in the Saudi Arabia desert, there is nothing more expensive than

957
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,140
peace.

958
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:03,880
Live in your space and let others live in their space peacefully.

959
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:07,280
Don't be dual for the war machine.

960
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,840
Your children are waiting for you.

961
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:13,940
Your wife is waiting for you.

962
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,560
You might have a lover.

963
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,160
Where did you go to school?

964
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,040
You might have a lover.

965
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,480
a funky thing going on.

966
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:14,740
You got a funky

967
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:15,860
thing going on.

968
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:20,520
This is flight

969
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,580
number 914

970
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,900
from Earth to our planet.

971
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:26,980
We will be taking off

972
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,220
in three minutes.

973
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,880
Mr. Chambers!

974
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,300
Mr. Chambers!

975
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,100
Don't get on that ship!

976
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,680
The rest of the book

977
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,720
to serve man, it's

978
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,380

00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,660
You got a funky thing

980
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:45,420
going on.

981
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:46,300
Cookbook!

982
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:47,660
Cookbook!

983
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:50,880
Neonerman.

984
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,400
Neonerman.

985
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,360
Neonerman.

986
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,200
Neonerman.

987
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:58,980
Neonerman.

988
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:00,800
Neonerman.

989
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:01,080
Neonerman.

990
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,520
Neonerman.

991
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:07,640
Say, baby, why don't

992
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:08,900
you bring that sweet

993
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:10,640
badonkadonk on

994
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,640
right down here in my place?

995
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:13,040
Oh,

996
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:13,040


997
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:13,420
oh,

998
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:20,640
oh,

999
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:21,060


1000
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:21,740
oh,

1001
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:22,180


1002
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:22,400
oh,

1003
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:22,460


1004
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:22,720
oh,

1005
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,040
oh,

1006
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:24,440
oh,

1007
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:24,800
oh,

1008
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:25,080


1009
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:25,460


1010
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:25,740


1011
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:26,580
oh,

1012
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:33,680
Oh,

1013
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,340
oh,

1014
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:36,560
oh,

1015
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:36,900


1016
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:37,200
oh,

1017
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:37,540
oh,

1018
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:37,680
oh,

1019
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,600
Power of Sniper!

1020
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:58,340
Mighty call the sheriff and said, come quickly.

1021
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:02,040
Somebody broke in the freezer and stole all the steaks.

1022
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:05,060
The dog was still hot, the sheriff said, man.

1023
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:08,360
Sounds to me like the Lakeview Man

1024
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:11,560
The Lakeview Man is a wild man

1025
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:15,060
Lives in the woods outside of town

1026
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:18,380
Howls at the moon, listen if you can

1027
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:21,660
You might hear the Lakeview Man

1028
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,060
Say he was a soldier who came home from war

1029
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:41,300
All in one piece but with emotional scars

1030
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:44,740
Beyond the story, argue about the date

1031
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:48,020
Vietnam or the war between the states

1032
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:51,120
And the Lakeview Man is a wild man

1033
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:51,640
Lives in the woods outside of town

1034
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,760
Lives in the woods outside of town

1035
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:58,000
Howls at the moon, listen if you can

1036
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,100
You might hear the Lakeview Man

1037
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:17,700
I took a shortcut to the river last night

1038
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,960
A beard and a blur in the long beam lights

1039
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:21,620
You could see me in the dark night

1040
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:24,240
Drank a few beers, dipped a few stones

1041
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,660
And I drove a little faster on the way back home

1042
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:44,040
A dog disappears, a cow is found dead

1043
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:47,400
A chicken is missing, found missing its head

1044
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,640
Shotgun gone, bread in the sand

1045
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,600
Two times, two times, two times, two times

1046
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,880
One more shot, oh ¿os��os?

1047
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,500
semi-alerta

1048
00:57:53,500 --> 00:58:00,620
And the Lakeview Man Is me who lives in the woods outside of town

1049
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:04,100
Sit down by my side and watch me

1050
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,920
Hold my einlein

1051
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,620
Dig my hole

1052
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:07,620


1053
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:07,620


1054
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:07,620


1055
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:07,620


1056
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:07,620


1057
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:07,620


1058
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:07,920
Who lives theacking

1059
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,240
is a wise may

1060
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:14,820
howl

1061
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:15,520
beeline

1062
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,840
They set the lay again

1063
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:17,960
You my

1064
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,320
You might hear the Lakeview Man.

1065
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:23,540
You might hear the Lakeview Man.

1066
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,940
You might hear the Lakeview Man.

1067
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:30,220
You might hear the Lakeview Man.

1068
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:46,080
The Large did that whole last 10-minute collage

1069
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:51,840
except for the song by the Rainmakers, Lakeview Man.

1070
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:54,500
I'm a Lakeview Man myself.

1071
00:58:54,600 --> 00:59:00,820
I go to Lakeview Cemetery nearby to collect biological samples.

1072
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:08,340
This has been Hour of Slack number 1327 from the Church of the Subgenius.

1073
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:15,680
At subgenius.com, you can hear the completely X-rated and un-arable episode

1074
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:24,100
number 1327.5XXX, all the stuff too hot for broadcast radio.

1075
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:29,900
In fact, if you look hard enough, you can find just about anything at subgenius.com.

1076
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,960
You might even find Bob.

1077
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:33,700
Praise Bob.
