1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,040
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,040
Yeah.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,120
Anyway, we create special effects with an Ultimac color tone brainwave synthesizer.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,560
You may have been reading about those lately.

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,100
They're illegal.

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:22,180
They trigger a total physical separation by stem cleavage of the left and right brains.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,240
That's cerebral mitosis to you science fans.

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:31,500
Creating a forebrain-hindbrain sync lock, if you can dig on that.

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,760
And that's the whole reason for this show to exist.

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,400
This is a brain disconnection show which operates on a simple new break-thinking principle

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,860
by which your brainwave patterns are gradually forced into resynchronization

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,260
with this tape's underlying messages and instructions.

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,040
So...

15
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,760
What? Oh!

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,560
A bug of noise whizzing past your ears.

17
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,600
Okay, that's what we do.

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,100
Let's take the old cotton wad that comes with this station and clean it out.

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,160
Incautiously.

20
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,140
You did get a cotton wad with your station?

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,160
The subgenius.

22
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,200
Hour of Slack.

23
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,640
It's the recombination of its own devices.

24
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,380
Its history is only itself.

25
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,720
It doesn't touch the ground.

26
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:23,240
It is simply an endless recycling of what it has already done.

27
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,640
A kind of tedious...

28
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,500
rehearsal of its own problems.

29
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:26,860
Ready?!

30
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,520
Gotta go, guys.

31
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:27,940
That's Rory.

32
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,380
Here we go!

33
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,880
And...

34
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,000
the redistribution.

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,560
deginelli File

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:32,560


37
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:32,560


38
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:32,560


39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:32,560


40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:32,560


41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:32,560


42
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:32,680
and

43
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:32,980
and

44
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:33,340
and

45
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:33,340


46
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:33,340


47
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,180
and

48
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:37,240
and

49
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:37,240


50
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:37,760
and

51
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,160
and

52
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,820
For lo, I stood in the empty desert places,

53
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,760
and I looked into the distance,

54
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,480
and I saw the whirlwind coming upon me,

55
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,840
and I gazed upon the whirlwind,

56
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,180
and I saw Bob,

57
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,460
and I heard the face of Bob speak,

58
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,560
and he spoke to me from the whirlwind,

59
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,120
and he said,

60
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,080
You dumbass, get out of the way.

61
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,140
There's a whirlwind coming.

62
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,740
Oh, thank you for the advice,

63
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,420
Sister Friday Jones,

64
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,860
Irreverent Friday Jones,

65
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,140
friends, and the other reason

66
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,460
for this tape to exist

67
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,300
is to get you saved

68
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,160
by July 5th, 1998,

69
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,100
this year, X Day,

70
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,960
the end of the world

71
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,200
for those who have not been saved in Bob.

72
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,780
And we are so very, very busy

73
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,160
here at Dallas Subgenius Church Headquarters

74
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,760
planning logistics

75
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,880
for the huge Subgenius

76
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,740
main X Day gathering

77
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,100
in Sherman, New York,

78
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,260
this July.

79
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,060
Now, X Day, of course, friends,

80
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,320
happens worldwide,

81
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,560
all over this vast, diseased planet.

82
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,360
Subgeniuses, dues-paying subgeniuses,

83
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,520
will be ruptured up and saved.

84
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,520
But all the doctors shall migrate

85
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,860
before this happens

86
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,740
to this campground in Sherman, New York,

87
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,460
far western rural New York.

88
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,380
It's a campground called Brushwood.

89
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,720
Friends, I'm going to give you information

90
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,000
on how to get there,

91
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,720
how to make it to the X Day event.

92
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,340
Subgenius.com

93
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,260
or on the World Wide Web,

94
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,120
there's information on how to get there.

95
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,180
You can get information

96
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,000
at www.subgenius.com

97
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,160
or you can send,

98
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,240
for free information,

99
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,800
send a self-addressed stamped envelope

100
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,040
to Bob at Post Office Box 140306

101
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,440
Dallas, Texas 75214.

102
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,960
We'll give all that information again

103
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,280
at the end of the broadcast

104
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,800
because, friends, this week

105
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,900
we're playing tapes

106
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,600
from the X Day drills

107
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,940
that we held in Brushwood

108
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,260
there in 1996 and 97.

109
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,100
Practice for the end.

110
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,180
And we're at the end of the world

111
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,520
where our whole cult membership

112
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,540
got together

113
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,560
to prepare for this great event.

114
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,360
And, friends, we'll be playing

115
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,600
some recent updates

116
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,400
from Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

117
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,060
But first,

118
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,900
well, actually second,

119
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,000
I have a very special

120
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,780
DeVival recording, friends.

121
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,880
Reverend Bleepo Abernathy

122
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,980
and Einstein's Secret Orchestra

123
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,280
at Winterstar.

124
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,680
It's a touching and amazing DeVival

125
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,520
and a good introduction

126
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,680
at the same time

127
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,300
to those new to Bob.

128
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,420
So be prepared, friends.

129
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,860
Be prepared.

Oh, yeah!

7 a.m. in the morning.

152
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,720
What's a 3-D day?

Praise God!

157
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,580
I'm a subgenius for you!

158
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,740
If we pray hard enough,

159
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,840
God will take care of everything.

160
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,420
Jehovah's Lord may have something in mind,

161
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,420
starting with Fred,

162
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,360
and building up to the Peaks,

163
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,820
and then probably the rest of us.

164
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,080
The only thing standing in between us

165
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,540
and Jehovah's Lord squashing us

166
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,400
with the Peaks and the humans

167
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,660
is that man J.R. Bob Dogg.

168
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,200
And the only thing that's keeping

169
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,080
J.R. Bob Dogg

170
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
motivated is your fight,

171
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,140
your trust in that man Bob.

172
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:18,880
And you won.

173
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,800
All right.

174
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:22,620
Anyway.

175
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,940
Okay, so some of you may be wondering

176
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,740
what Bob is.

177
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,620
I'm going to give you a little primer

178
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,360
for those of you who don't know

179
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,680
who exactly J.R. Bob Dogg is.

180
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,520
J.R. Bob Dogg is the saint of sales.

181
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,040
You may recognize his face

182
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,760
that you see in that book

183
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,140
on that chair behind you, young man,

184
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,800
in the green.

185
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,680
Can you hold up that book, please, sir?

186
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,060
That's the face, the book on the chair.

187
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:49,760
Yeah, there we go.

188
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,920
That's Bob's face, see, there.

189
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,920
That's the face of Bob.

190
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,540
And he's the man who's going to bring us slack.

191
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,860
He's the man who's going to bring,

192
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,060
he's going to bring the slack back,

193
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,280
which you've been lacking,

194
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,740
because he's made a deal

195
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,080
with the people from Planet X

196
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,780
that basically on X-Day,

197
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,560
which is actually only Jeepers,

198
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,100
that's only,

199
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,060
my notes, my notes.

200
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,260
I think it's 127 days away.

201
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,780
Yes, it's 127 days away.

202
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,600
I had to roll up notes here.

203
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,100
And Bob is your friend, kids.

204
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,820
He's made the deal with the people from Planet X

205
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,540
that we're going to come and destroy the planet

206
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,680
or the normals,

207
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,900
and he's going to take the subgeniuses away

208
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,120
in the pleasure ships,

209
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,780
in the pleasure dimensions,

210
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,520
where, you know,

211
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,780
they will find themselves

212
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,060
with the sex gods and goddesses

213
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,080
in a state of eternal ecstasy and slack.

214
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,060
And slack is basically,

215
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,060


216
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,060
in a nutshell,

217
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,920
the thing that the teachers

218
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,280
were always trying to take away from you

219
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:47,780
in school

220
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:48,980
when they said,

221
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,460
wipe that smile off your face.

222
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,660
You know,

223
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,240
that was a time that you perhaps

224
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,920
had some of the rogue subgenius genes

225
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,780
inside you

226
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,380
and that the teachers

227
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,660
and the conspiracy needed,

228
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,380
felt threatened by you

229
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,520
because they know that indeed

230
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,400
the subgenius church

231
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,260
is a threat to them

232
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,220
whether they realize it or not.

233
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,760
And, you know,

234
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,240
they've been just trying to take away

235
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,180
your slack ever since day one,

236
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,220
but Bob is here to give you

237
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:11,860
your slack back.

238
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:12,460
Yes?

239
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:12,660
Yes.

240
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,720
His image is very,

241
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,920
very hard to find now,

242
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,040
as you may have noticed.

243
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,980
In these last days

244
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,040
before X-Day,

245
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,400
July 5th, 1998,

246
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,800
as predicted by J.R. Bob Dobbs

247
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,600
back in 1954,

248
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,360
I believe,

249
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:24,680
originally.

250
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,780
In these final days,

251
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,900
Bob's image is becoming

252
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,500
rarer and rarer,

253
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,080
although there was sort of

254
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,780
a peak of Bob consciousness

255
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,220
when you sort of saw his face

256
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:33,920
in lots of places.

257
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:34,920
He's a benign,

258
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,820
smiling guy with a pipe

259
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,820
and a male model,

260
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,220
sort of role model

261
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,980
for Ward Cleaver kind of guy,

262
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,620
always there with a pipe

263
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,440
and some good advice

264
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,640
for, you know,

265
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:43,920
junior,

266
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,080


267
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,200
So, all right.

268
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,100
Well, that's my bad primer

269
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,800
for the Church of the Subjects

270
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,640
and sort of what it is.

271
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,880
If you have any more questions,

272
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,920
please feel free to ask me

273
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,100
after this particular presentation.

274
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,500
Thank you, Jasmine.

275
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,760
Oh, I must mention

276
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,680
Einstein's Secret Orchestra

277
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,120
backing up yours truly.

278
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:01,580
We can call it

279
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,460
the Lonesome Star Cowboys.

280
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,120
The Lonesome Star Cowboys,

281
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,680
a.k.a. the Lonesome Star Cowboys

282
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,320
behind me today.

283
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,600
We haven't even got warmed up.

284
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,160
Why are you leaving?

285
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,420
Jeez.

286
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,900
Just know it.

287
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,440
Slam the door.

288
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,700
Slam the door.

289
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,220
Why don't you?

290
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,400
They don't know

291
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:17,880
what they're missing.

292
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:18,900
All right.

293
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,520
First of all,

294
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,320
now that we're here

295
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,360
and we're all assembled here,

296
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,240
I know it's been kind of crazy.

297
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,100
It's been kind of hectic

298
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,800
setting things up.

299
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,780
And I've been wanting

300
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,340
to just sort of

301
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,300
cool things down for a minute

302
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,100
and just prepare ourselves.

303
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,380
And of course,

304
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,300
they want us to be quiet

305
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:36,720
next door,

306
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,520
so I just wanted

307
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,760
to kind of bring things down

308
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,300
so all of us

309
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:42,900
can get prepared

310
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,040
for another day of sacredness.

311
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,060


312
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,060


313
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,060


314
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,060


315
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,060


316
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,060


317
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,060


318
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,680
So,

319
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:44,680


320
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,360
All right.

321
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,580
Praise God.

322
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,580
Thank you.

323
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:49,920
Thank you.

324
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,180
Thank you.

325
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:50,940
Sorry, I hope we're not

326
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,620
disturbing you too much today.

327
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,480
Thanks, Tori.

328
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,060
Okay.

329
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,740
Now, I want to take you

330
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,560
on a little guided meditation,

331
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,080
friends.

332
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,720
I want you to close

333
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,400
your eyes now.

334
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,020
And I want you to get

335
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,100
into a comfortable position.

336
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,860
Put your both feet

337
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,340
on the floor.

338
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,380
Close both eyes.

339
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,020
And feel your feet

340
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,960
on the floor, friends.

341
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,160
Feel your feet

342
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,660
on the floor.

343
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,180
And feel your soul

344
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,380
and intestines,

345
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,660
the very part of you

346
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,120
that is you.

347
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,460
Get in touch with that

348
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,100
that is inside yourself

349
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,240
that is the deepest

350
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,940
part of yourself.

351
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,880
I want you to go inside

352
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,160
and find that center.

353
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,540
Now, I want you to send

354
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,580
that center down,

355
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,680
down through your chest,

356
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,020
down through your torso,

357
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,900
down your legs,

358
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,480
your knees,

359
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,640
your ankles.

360
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,340
Send it down

361
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,120
through your feet.

362
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,360
Down into the carpet.

363
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,420
Down into the floor

364
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,380
beneath the carpet.

365
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,400
And now we're going to go

366
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,580
down further, friends.

367
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,220
We're going to go down further

368
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,040
and further through the cement

369
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,760
foundation of the building.

370
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,220
Down underneath into the dirt,

371
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,540
into the crust of the earth.

372
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,520
Down, down further.

373
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,980
Into the mantle that surrounds

374
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,500
the core of the earth.

375
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,140
And then into that

376
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,980
about 45 foot high space

377
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,600
that no one knows about officially

378
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,480
but yet many churches

379
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,300
have warned us about.

380
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,720
Yep, it's about 45 feet high

381
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,540
from ceiling to floor.

382
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,880
It's that place down there

383
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,780
that they've told you is hell,

384
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,820
friends.

385
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,920
Yes, friends.

386
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,420
It's just as you pictured it

387
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,420
in Catholic high school.

388
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,780
There are devils down there.

389
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,760
There's little men

390
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,940
with pitchforks and demons.

391
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,120
Tortured souls crying out

392
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,880
in eternal agony.

393
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,760
There's pain, friends.

394
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,400
There's suffering.

395
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,800
There's people up to their knees

396
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,180
and poo-poo.

397
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,840
There's people up to their chests

398
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,640
and poo-poo.

399
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,420
There's people who are just

400
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,320
drowning in poo-poo

401
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,020
for all eternity.

402
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,840
You look around you, friends,

403
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,860
you see the caverns of hell

404
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,860
and the stalactites

405
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,680
and the stalagmites as pictured

406
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,340
by all the great classic artists.

407
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,120
I'm dying.

408
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,120


409
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,120


410
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,140
And as you look around you

411
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:14,800
in this place,

412
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,660
you notice far off in the distance

413
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,180
there are buildings and trees.

414
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,240
And you look further in the distance

415
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,020
and now you can guide your body astrally,

416
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,880
or your soul body astrally,

417
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,580
off towards these buildings.

418
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,240
And you notice they look familiar.

419
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,840
You realize that as you look around this place,

420
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,720
it's a place you recognize.

421
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,520
My God, it's Cleveland.

422
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,680
My God.

423
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,640
It's Cleveland.

424
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,000
Or else it's Decatur, Illinois.

425
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,520
It's wherever you come from.

426
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,220
It's your hometown.

427
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,020
It's where you live.

428
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,260
It's where you work.

429
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,940
And my friends, you can open your eyes

430
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,060
because you now realize that you are in hell.

431
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,800
Yes, friends, this is hell on earth.

432
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,820
I have just guided you back to the place where you are

433
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,060
and you thought that you went below.

434
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,940
And in a way, you are below.

435
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,240
Because where we are now,

436
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,440
this is the hell of normality.

437
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:17,740
Friends.

438
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,600
And I'm sorry, I'm not trying to bum you out

439
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,320
or bring you down,

440
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,160
but this is where the conspiracy wants you to be.

441
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,500
And we're in a special part of hell.

442
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,480
We're in a kind of happy part of hell

443
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,060
this time in Winter Star.

444
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,380
It's a place where, you know,

445
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,320
we can sort of forget about our everyday troubles

446
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,900
and forget about our everyday cares

447
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,840
and let ourselves relax and forget for a minute

448
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,520
that we are really, truly living in hell!

449
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,080
Hell, I tell you!

450
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,480
You may be wondering what is happening now

451
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,460
on planet hell in these last few days.

452
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,500
These last 127 days before X-Day, July 5th, 1998.

453
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,420
You may wonder what Bob, the Saint of Sales,

454
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,780
is up to right now, friends.

455
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,980
I'll tell you, I got a communication recently

456
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,780
from some higher-ups in the church,

457
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,780
even though they never return my calls.

458
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,580
But I got some psychic communications from them.

459
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,680
I understand that Bob is now in negotiations.

460
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,600
Yes?

461
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,680
Bob is basically making the final deal

462
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,800
with the people from Planet X.

463
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,880
He is signing the contracts,

464
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,140
they're signing their part of the contracts,

465
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,320
and they're arranging it so that all the souls of the normals

466
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,420
will be basically fried when they come down.

467
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,720
And all the sub-demons will be, you know...

468
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,100
So the final part of the deal is being made right now.

469
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,760
And this relates to what's happened recently

470
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,600
in the Mideast.

471
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,280
And it relates to what's been happening, you know,

472
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,480
in other places.

473
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,720
Bob has basically been engineering this whole Iraq war thing

474
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,760
that you've heard so much about.

475
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,480
And it's the state of the world now.

476
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,900
It's only 127 days till X-Day, friends.

477
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,280
But, you know, I never thought that we would really see this day.

478
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,600
I always sort of thought that I would see, you know,

479
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,240
the end of the world maybe a little bit sooner

480
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,580
because of the whole nuclear menace

481
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,240
that was hanging over our heads for so many years.

482
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,620
So did you ever think that you would look around,

483
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,260
and see things the way they are now?

484
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,120
Did you ever think that we would make it this far?

485
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,680
Did you ever think that X-Day would really only be 127 days away?

486
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,420
Did you ever?

487
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,220
Did you ever?

488
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,480
Gosh, babe, I never saw anything like that before.

489
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,480
Did you? Did you? Did you? Did you?

490
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,020
Never.

491
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,540
Did you? Did you?

492
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,520
Did you ever see a dream walkin'?

493
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,260
Well, I didn't.

494
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,320
Did you ever hear a dream talk?

495
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,460
Well, I did.

496
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,900
Did you ever have a dream thrill you with?

497
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,300
Will you be mine?

498
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:56,300
Always so fine, and so, so divine.

499
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,220
Did you ever see a dream dancing?

500
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,960
Well, I did.

501
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,340
Did you ever see a dream romancing?

502
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,100
Well, I did.

503
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,940
Did you ever see heaven right in your arms,

504
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,020
saying, I love you, I do?

505
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,560
Well, the dream that was monkin' and the dream that was talkin',

506
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,500
the heaven in my arms was you.

507
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,700
Gosh, that's lovely.

508
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,460
Did you ever see a dream romancing?

509
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,120
Well, I did.

510
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,760
Did you ever see heaven right in your arms,

511
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,920
saying, I love you, I do?

512
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,900
Well, the dream that was walkin' and the dream that was talkin',

513
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,780
And I got everything by heart, it was you

514
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,200
It's a fact, sorry, I just can't get around it

515
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,360
But you know, that's the thing

516
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,660
See, now you people can appreciate the classics

517
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,260
I was at a Marilyn Manson party the other night

518
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,980
And I saw all these 25-year-olds standing around

519
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,960
All these 25-year-old MTV producers

520
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,500
And they were all waiting, pushing into line

521
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,420
Trying to get in to see Marilyn Manson

522
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,960
And I was like, yeah, sir

523
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,300
And they all thought they were so fucking cool

524
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,240
Because they've stolen all the cool ideas

525
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,080
That we in the Church of the Subgenius first gave them

526
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,140
We the true geeks

527
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,360
Yes, if you're a geek, if you're an outcast

528
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,900
The Church of the Subgenius is your church friend

529
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,760
Exactly, exactly

530
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,400
Those damn MTV producers, they're out there

531
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,280
They're like all these guys, they're like 24 years old

532
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,520
And they have a much better collection of 1950s Betty Page pinups

533
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,700
Than like your

534
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:06,940
You know, like your

535
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,080
My friend has been collecting them since 1952

536
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,020
These freaking 25-year-old kids

537
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,460
It makes me sick, you know

538
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,460
I mean, they're out here

539
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,680
They're drinking their cappuccinos at Starbucks

540
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,820
They all think they're so damn cool

541
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,840
Ha ha ha ha ha

542
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,080
Yep, when they come down

543
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,960
When the people from Planet X come down

544
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,120
And start wiping out all the humans

545
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,400
Like we want to kill a dog

546
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,180
That had been hit by a car on the side of the road

547
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,160
You just want to shoot it through the head

548
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,280
And its leg is broken

549
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,660
That's going to be their attitude towards the human race

550
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,960
And that's what they're going to do

551
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,280
These 25-year-old MTV producers

552
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,140
They're going to see

553
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,260
Yep

554
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,300
I mean, a friend of mine was telling me about

555
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,960
The Hanford Nuclear Plant

556
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,000
And how awful it is

557
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,220
This guy has gone in

558
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,940
I'm not going to name names here

559
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,780
But this guy has gone in

560
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,040
And he's looked around these nuclear facilities

561
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,800
He was part of a huge research project

562
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,900
That was into finding out just how fucked up

563
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,000
These nuclear facilities are

564
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,980
And he noticed it

565
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,060
They're like a hundred times more fucked up

566
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,860
Than you can ever imagine

567
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,180
Like for instance the Hanford Nuclear Power Plant

568
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,120
Nuclear waste dumping ground

569
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,020
Is what it is

570
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,640
They have these huge tanks of nuclear waste

571
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,640
And they spontaneously boil

572
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,540
They give off hydrogen and nuclear stuff

573
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,820
And you can sort of vent the hydrogen

574
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,640
Supposedly safely

575
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,600
The nuclear stuff safely

576
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,040
But the problem is

577
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,880
It's still glowing

578
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,500
It's still going

579
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,780
And it's going to blow up

580
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,340
And they think they got it under control usually

581
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,640
But they can't even get close enough

582
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,040
To measure how much of it it is

583
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,660
If they even bring their instruments within range

584
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,780
To measure how bad the nuclear radiation is

585
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,320
In these, coming out of these tanks

586
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,160
Like the instruments fuse

587
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,300
They melt

588
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,140
They cannot, this is true

589
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,860
And so they figure

590
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,120
They can't quite figure it out

591
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,960
They've done some calculations

592
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,240
They can't quite figure out whether it would be

593
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,940
Four thousand times

594
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,460
Or four hundred thousand times

595
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,320
Worse than Chernobyl

596
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,100
If this thing were to boil over

597
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,360
And the chances of this thing boiling over are great

598
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,420
So it's just somewhere between four thousand

599
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,360
And four hundred thousand times

600
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,140
Worse than Chernobyl

601
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,760
And that's in our own country

602
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,220
If this thing's enclave them like this

603
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,040
It's pretty bad

604
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,740
But I'm proud to be accepting this

605
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,440
Because I know

606
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,920
That I'll be taken away

607
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,440
On those pleasure ships

608
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,180
The pleasure dimension

609
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,400
We'll board the ships

610
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,060
On July 5th

611
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,780
The little knave

612
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,740
And the goldies

613
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,340
We'll board the ships

614
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,300
On July 5th

615
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:05,300


616
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:05,300


617
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:05,300


618
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,240
Like a little slave

619
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,420
Or fall out of the blue

620
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,040
And fate steps in

621
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,120
And sees you through

622
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,080
Yes, fate steps in

623
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,160
And sees you through

624
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,960
When you wish

625
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,700
Because Bob abandoned you

626
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,120
And sold you to fate

627
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,000
For seven hundred and fifty dollars

628
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,520
Dream comes

629
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,120
But at least he didn't sell you to

630
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,840
The Grim Reader

631
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,240
That is the dream

632
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,400
Or old Splitfoot

633
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,040
I never wanted to be sold

634
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,680
I wanted to be

635
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,540
A creature of comfort

636
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,440
Like a lord or a duke

637
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,200
I always worked hard

638
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,100
And if the universe was fair, Dave

639
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,340
That's what would have happened

640
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,140
If the universe was fair

641
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,720
I'd be a duke right now

642
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,600
The universe is unfair

643
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,420
And very extreme about it

644
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,220
Yeah

645
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,860
It's a rotten world

646
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,180
It's a horrible life

647
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,400
Your dreams

648
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,420
In fact they are

649
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,840
Our dreams

650
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,040
In fact

651
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,220
Our dreams

652
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,700
Our dreams came true, Dave

653
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,880
Our dreams came true

654
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,900
I'm a sandwich

655
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,400
I'm a sandwich

656
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,600
I'm a sandwich

657
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,240
You, Dave

658
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,020
Do they ever forget

659
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,080
Or forgive the whippings

660
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,260
And the harsh, strict words of command?

661
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,740
I wonder

662
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,640
I wonder

663
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,760
How can you forget or forgive

664
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,560
Those over and above you?

665
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,740
Those tall, silly dictators

666
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:32,980
Those haters

667
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,660
Those parents

668
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,600
There are a number of workshops

669
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,360
One of them on sadomasochism

670
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,320
That was billed as safe, sane

671
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,860
And consensual sadomasochism

672
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,220
An alternative way of loving

673
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,120
Mommy

674
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,600
Daddy

675
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,740
Where are you?

676
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,120
Peek-a-boo

677
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,480
Ah!

678
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,220
What in the world is a state university

679
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,520
Devoted to higher learning

680
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,300
Doing, demonstrating

681
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,900
Lesbian and homosexual techniques

682
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,540
And things related to perverse behavior

683
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,140
Music

684
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,880
Music

685
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,660
Music

Music

687
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,500
As the final project in this art class

688
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,040
She and two other women

689
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,500
Performed live sex in front of the class

690
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,480
Music

691
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,100
You even have a proliferation of courses involving witchcraft

692
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,460
There is a witchcraft movement in the United States

693
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,500
One of the things they accomplished by having witchcraft courses

694
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,840
Is to say that witchcraft is an equivalent religion

695
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,360
To any other major religions like Christianity or Judaism or anything else

696
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:57,980
Music

697
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,040
taki

He

F

706
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,960
The genius that right now can be seen in our young people,

707
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,080
the people that have promiscuity!

708
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:31,460
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow,

709
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:38,600
why, oh, why can't I?

710
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,960
Why, oh, why can't I?

711
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:17,340
The absurdity of it all is just so entertaining to us up here.

712
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,120
Even though you do have to feel the pain,

713
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:26,560
at least think of all the joy that it gives to everyone else.

714
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:31,760
Millions and millions of people in different worlds are excited by my sufferings.

715
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:39,880
You're a martyr like Jesus or some other idiot, Gandhi.

716
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,700
Yeah.

717
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,060
Yeah.

718
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:41,120
Yeah.

719
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,120


720
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,540
You guys was all like a piece of lemon pie waiting to be sucked up by everybody,

721
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,380
and they did it.

722
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,800
They were like a cookie.

723
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,240
They hardly existed.

724
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,820
They did their stuff, and then they ate it up.

725
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:54,620
You're like Mother Teresa, a selfless, a giver, surrounded by takers.

726
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,120
Consuming our own secret sexual desires.

727
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,200
Women who have sent their daughters off to universities

728
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,900
have been shocked to discover that they come back with lesbian lovers.

729
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,280
I love you.

730
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,120
An age when that'sjachs Destroyed.

731
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:13,900
Who's this, Dave?

732
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,220
Look.

733
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,060
The vision.

734
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,640
The lovely Miss Wanda Schwinck.

735
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,860
My third grade teacher.

736
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:22,780
Wanda...

737
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,800
What a magical name...

738
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,420
Oh, the waddle under Wanda's neck.

739
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,860
Ah, the waddle.

740
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,900
And when she was used to ranked over, you could see her

Silence!

774
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:22,240
Show respect to Michael Jackson.

775
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,120
He's been through a lot.

776
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,880
What do you want?

777
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,820
Show respect to Michael Jackson.

778
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,580
He's been through a lot.

779
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,440
What do you want?

780
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,320
No one can dance like Michael can.

781
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,140
No one can sing like Michael can.

782
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,980
Play off Michael, he's my man.

783
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,540
Remember when the whole world loved him.

784
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,940
Show respect.

785
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,040
To Michael Jackson.

786
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,960
He's been through a lot.

787
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,600
What do you want?

788
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,220
Show respect.

789
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,460
To Michael Jackson.

790
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,320
He's been through a lot.

791
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,080
What do you want?

792
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:03,020
No one can dance like Michael can.

793
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,840
No one can sing like Michael can.

794
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,520
Play off Michael, he's my man.

795
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,100
Remember when the whole world loved him.

796
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,400
Remember when

797
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,240
Michael can.

798
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,500
Michael Jackson.

799
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,200
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

800
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,340
Remember when Michael Jackson.

801
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,160
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

802
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,160
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

803
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,020
Woo-hoo!

804
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,280
There's a little ditty now that Chaz Smith wrote.

805
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,020
And I want to do this sort of as a round.

806
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,340
Like a summer camp round.

807
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,780
I want to teach you.

808
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,900
The chorus is very simple.

809
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,460
And, uh, Chaz, why don't you give us our song?

810
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,460
Chaz, Chaz, is this on?

811
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,480
Yep, it's on.

812
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,080
Okay.

813
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,620
I get up every morning.

814
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,420
My life's in a jar.

815
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,460
I drive very far.

816
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,520
In my big fancy car.

817
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,320
I have a big fancy car.

818
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:16,320


819
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:16,320


820
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:20,500
I hear about the world, but it all passes me by.

821
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,340
I haven't the time.

822
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,220
What can one person try?

823
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,340
I come home every night.

824
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,120
And keep my eyes to the floor.

825
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,020
I go around the floor.

826
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,800
Just never hearing a sound.

827
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,620
I walk down the street.

828
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,400
And keep my eyes to the ground.

829
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,240
I go round and round.

830
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,960
Like a sad little clown.

831
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,980
And at the end of my life.

832
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,440
I finally see.

833
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,620
The world and my dreams.

834
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,780
Where it all was a dream.

835
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:13,780


836
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:13,780


837
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:13,780


838
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:13,780


839
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:13,780


840
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:13,780


841
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,300
And they see.

842
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,940
I get it now.

843
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:17,600
I see.

844
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:21,360
It's sort of like you're standing on the mountains of the moon.

845
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,940
And like you're looking out through space and across space.

846
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,220
That beautiful little planet.

847
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,780
That beautiful big blue ball.

848
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,060
Just sitting there suspended.

849
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,000
There's no strings holding it up.

850
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:39,880
And there it is surrounded by a blackness that's blacker than black.

851
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,700
And it's just sitting there like a jewel.

852
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,100
In the night.

853
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,860
And it's the most beautiful place you ever saw.

854
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,140
And you look at it and you think to yourself.

855
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:48,740
Gee.

856
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,740
All the people that I ever met.

857
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,000
All the places that I ever visited.

858
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,400
All the books that ever were written.

859
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,940
And all the songs that have ever been sung.

860
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,120
And all the great thoughts that have ever been thunk.

861
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,380
It all took place there.

862
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,080
That little beautiful sparkling place.

863
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,540
And as it rotates.

864
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:11,960
You see.

865
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,580
Africa.

866
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,520
The place where all life began.

867
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,440
And humanity took its first little stumbling steps.

868
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,480
Think to yourself.

869
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,140
Gee.

870
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,120
You know.

871
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,540
It looks the same now as it did then.

872
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:33,080
You can't tell if there's all this pollution and all this screwed up stuff going down.

873
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,500
It looks just the same as it always has.

874
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,620
And you think to yourself.

875
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,420
Wow.

876
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,340
You know.

877
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:51,720
I don't know how long your lane cracked.

878
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:52,160
No.

879
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,920
But I don't get how to tell you anymore.

880
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,780
I feel like ten to twelve days have passed since you think you're alive.

881
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,000
And you go, you know.

882
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,700
I tell myself three, four, several days—

883
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,400
It's hard.

884
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,020
This isn't over yet.

885
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,600
So.

886
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:08,660
But.

887
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,740
There sort of thing is that it's over already.

888
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:09,740


889
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:09,740


890
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,020
And the bottom of whole, this entire earth is just a ashes brass pile of dust.

891
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:11,120
And the bottom—

892
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,520
audience members up to testify.

893
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,820
If they have found slacklessness in their job or their personal life, I'd like you to

894
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:23,580
come here and tell the Reverend Lebo Arvin at the old about it, and I will try to heal

895
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,540
or sicken you as is appropriate.

896
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:30,480
And also, anybody who wants a short-duration marriage, I'm offering a short-duration marriage

897
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,060
to any person or object or animal that you desire, and it can be for whatever length

898
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,740
of time you desire it to be for.

899
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,360
So, anyone want to come up for either short-duration marriages, healing, sickenings, testifying?

900
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,980
You two folks, come on up.

901
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,360
Come on up.

902
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,560
Now, are you folks ready to be married?

903
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,580
For two minutes.

904
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,220
For two minutes?

905
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,400
Two minutes.

906
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,040
Two minutes.

907
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,320
The husband finds out I'm dead meat, so.

908
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:54,740
Yeah, yeah.

909
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,480
All right, so what's your name?

910
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:57,420
Bill.

911
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,700
Bill, and what's your name?

912
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,460
Hale O'Conney.

913
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:05,220
Okay, so do you, Reverend Bill and Reverend Hale O'Conney, do you accept each other for

914
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,100
better or worse, or for worse or better?

915
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:11,180
For whatever reason, you may or may not reject or accept each other's personalities or soul

916
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:17,500
traits for whatever time that you have appropriated for this particular marriage to occur or not

917
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:17,820
last.

918
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,720
So, help me, Bob.

919
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,100
So, help me, Bob, and Hale O'Conney.

920
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:22,720
So, help me.

921
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,200
So, help me, Bob.

922
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,720
You are now hereby married in the church for two minutes.

923
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,700
Let us come together.

924
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,920
Don't let your husband find out.

925
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,120
That's what I like.

926
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,760
That's what I like.

927
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,120
Anybody else testify or be healed or sickened?

928
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:41,860
Come on up, brother.

929
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,300
Do you have an object you want to marry?

930
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,340
I am blessed with slack in my life.

931
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,400
How's that, son?

932
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:53,360
Well, I work at a theater, and at this theater, I can work whenever I want, if I want to.

933
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:58,420
And when I work, I am allowed to smoke as much as I want with my bosses.

934
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,420
Smoke pot?

935
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,280
Smoke pot.

936
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,120
Wow.

937
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,740
It's a cash, smoke-loving thing.

938
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:03,940
And?

939
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,740
Maybe someday you'll be able to get a hold of the church air.

940
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,840
We have a prop ziplock that we can hire.

941
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,780
If you talk to me later, we'll see what we can do.

942
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,540
All right.

943
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,200
You know, I'm not selling it right now.

944
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:14,860
I want you to buy it.

945
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,880
Oh, no, no, no.

946
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,560
But, uh, but, uh, but now, and of course, it is a Tibetan or a prop ziplock.

947
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,980
Now, uh, so that's interesting, because, yeah, I mean, I didn't mention that Bob gave me slack.

948
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,100
I just fell into my job with High Times Magazine.

949
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,560
And, uh, I have the High Times Radio Hour, which is on in many stations around town.

950
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,840
You may be, if you've ever heard it.

951
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,080
I'm not going to say it.

952
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,540
I'm the Reverend Ken Bleeboe Abernathy, the producer of that show.

953
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:44,260
So, uh, so praise Bob and praise High Times and praise Jop.

954
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,900
We always pray for you.

955
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:46,540
We always pray for you.

956
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,080
We always pray for you.

957
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:48,100
We always pray for you.

958
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:48,460
We always pray for you.

959
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,020
We always pray for you.

960
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,660
That's a big part of it.

961
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,420
So, uh, hail Bob.

962
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,320
Hail Bob.

963
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,720
Well, friends, uh, we have a little closing number now that we, uh, worked out for you.

964
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,040
If we can handle it.

965
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,660
And, uh, this is a, this is a little song.

966
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:13,720
It's a, it's an old, uh, melody from, uh, oh gosh, it must be from about 1975, I believe,

967
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,680
when it came out.

968
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,500
Can I hit it?

969
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:23,720
It's by a man named Neil Innes, who, uh, also brought you to Ruggles.

970
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,040
Isn't he wonderful?

971
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:26,540
Yeah.

972
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:26,820
Yeah.

973
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,400
legendary out connaître.

974
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:42,580
Oh, once I knew your love so true, every inch of it.

975
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:55,460
In eyes of each and every other, every thing's more trusting, a good girl.

976
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,800
the world

977
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,140
but whose judgment

978
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,200
was reckless

979
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,740
and when in turn

980
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,960
she showed concern

981
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,520
she wore it

982
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,480
like an necklace

983
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,340
so come on

984
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:15,300
have yourself a good time

985
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,240
go out and share the blame

986
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,820
do what you should

987
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,800
but if it makes you feel good

988
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,640
I hope you feel

989
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,880
no shame

990
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,020
well I don't know about that

991
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,720
God has a divine sense of humor

992
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,380
let me tell you

993
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,180
and one of the reasons

994
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,300
what was that?

995
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,220
I don't get it

996
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,260
I don't get his sense of humor

997
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,720
you know I have a very

998
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,620
well you may not have

999
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,440
a good sense of humor

1000
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,780
but God who is perfect

1001
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,460
in all things

1002
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,360
has a perfect sense of humor

1003
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,180
well then why don't I get it

1004
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,260
because you know I laugh a lot

1005
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,420
you know I hear funny things

1006
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,720
because it is

1007
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,580
I'm a humie

1008
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,680
it is unto man

1009
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,000
to live in imperfection

1010
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,640
a perfection which can only be attained

1011
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,260
by the devout proprieties

1012
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,600
of a Christian life

1013
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:30,900
I know

1014
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,860
I spend a lot of time

1015
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,680
on the internet pal

1016
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:33,780
and uh

1017
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,920
you know

1018
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,080
there's a lot of good jokes

1019
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,980
on the internet pal

1020
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,840
is that software?

1021
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,680
well you know

1022
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,080
God knows all those jokes

1023
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:40,800
but I'm just saying

1024
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,240
if God would tell a joke

1025
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,620
it would be

1026
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,680
so much better

1027
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,440
than any joke

1028
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,320
that you've ever heard

1029
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,880
that you might even die laughing

1030
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,140
in the first micro

1031
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,020
what we would call

1032
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,760
a microsecond

1033
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,120
of hearing

1034
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,100
just the joke

1035
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,020
just the first

1036
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,640
sound of the first syllable

1037
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:54,780
of the first syllable

1038
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:54,780


1039
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,160
of the joke

1040
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,480
would be so laugh provoking

1041
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,080
that you would

1042
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,160
be glad that God

1043
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:58,920
is not convenient

1044
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,720
your diaphragm

1045
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,680
would be traumatized

1046
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,780
you would probably

1047
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,740
eventually die

1048
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,920
of internal bleeding

1049
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,600
if not from

1050
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,520
that reminds me

1051
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,640
if you see Jesus

1052
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,400
you tell him

1053
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,040
he still owes me

1054
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,800
twenty bucks

1055
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,140
now let's not get into that

1056
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,780
I hope we don't see Jesus

1057
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,240
you know

1058
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,460
when that happens

1059
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,340
we're supposed to have

1060
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,320
another end of the world

1061
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:20,700
situation

1062
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,700
and things are happening

1063
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,340
so fast

1064
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,520
we're now

1065
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,780
how many of us

1066
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:24,780


1067
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:24,880
are going to die

1068
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:24,880


1069
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,020
twenty months

1070
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,400
until the end of the

1071
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,440
the world

1072
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,120
let me see

1073
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:30,680
oops

1074
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,940
you're making me nervous

1075
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,060
when you talk about that

1076
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,300
torture and saucer ride

1077
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:34,440
eight months

1078
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,420
eight months

1079
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,000
let's just forget it

1080
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
that becomes true

1081
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,200
it's eight months

1082
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,080
in a few days

1083
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:41,780
and well

1084
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:42,860
we know

1085
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,960
it will come true

1086
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,100
and only those

1087
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:45,660
who wear these

1088
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,960
special badges

1089
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,420
will get by

1090
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,160
alive

1091
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,020
what were you saying Hal

1092
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,000
I'm nothing

1093
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,080
I was just

1094
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,080
ahem

1095
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,420
it's polishing my little badge

1096
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:05,840
here

1097
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,500
he was

1098
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:06,500


1099
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,200
the subgenius

1100
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,380
of the National Orchestra

1101
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,920
is ah

1102
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,840
tuning up

1103
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,880
it was in a dream

1104
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,420
that we had

1105
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:14,900
some kind of

1106
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,080
radio show

1107
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:16,360
anyway

1108
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,820
the amazing

1109
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,260
boar of the amazing

1110
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,360
colossal Jesus

1111
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,080
yea

1112
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,860
they both wear

1113
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,580
in the same kind of

1114
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:29,040
He fell off Boulder Dam and scraped one side of his face off and one side of his halo and his crown of thorns.

1115
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:33,280
And now he's hideously disfigured, seeking the woman he loves.

1116
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,120
But he's mindless and he will kill her.

1117
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,500
And he's only got one eye, too.

1118
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,560
Right, one hideous rolling eye.

1119
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:40,760
He's got like a shaved head.

1120
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,740
He can't have like the regular Jesus hair because that's too, you know, that's too slick and bonafide.

1121
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,700
The amazing, colossal Jesus.

1122
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:52,060
I actually, I can't get over the fact I actually talked to Bob Larson today, himself.

1123
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,780
Just like we were old, you know, fellow cult leaders.

1124
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:56,840
And you are.

1125
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:02,820
Or fellow charlatan, you know, fellow medicine show charlatan rainmakers.

1126
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,460
And you are.

1127
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,940
You know, false healing exorcist crazy.

1128
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,080
It was great.

1129
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:08,740
You are.

1130
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:16,880
It was such, you know, it was so great to sort of bury the hatchet and just hate each other freely.

1131
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:21,120
Did he turn you on any hot stock tips or you guys going to play golf soon?

1132
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,380
No, we're going to get together later.

1133
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,100
Maybe do.

1134
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,340
Were you guys going to work on those tapes again and stuff?

1135
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,600
No, we'll probably just do a little bit.

1136
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,480
Now, don't get jealous.

1137
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,760
We'll probably do a little radio stuff together.

1138
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:38,600
But, you know, I'll figure if we could, I think if we could get Bob Larson to start calling the ESO show.

1139
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,160
Wow.

1140
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,500
That would be horrifying.

1141
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,300
I can't imagine anything more horrifying.

1142
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,020
I think that would be big fun.

1143
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,420
We'd have a crossover Christian audience.

1144
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:51,320
Well, that might be cool because you could insult them and they wouldn't know it.

1145
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:52,460
Dave.

1146
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:52,560
Dave.

1147
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:52,660
Dave.

1148
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,640
We could launch his head over the air.

1149
00:43:54,940 --> 00:44:02,220
We could launch, we could launch like little baby Jesuses right hot off the, right off the nativity scenes right out there in some of the audiences.

1150
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,940
So we could get both crowds and then get a crossover thing going.

1151
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,560
Once you've got a crossover thing going on pop music, buddy, you're in the money.

1152
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:16,680
God, man, then we'd have the, we'd have enough money to be able to afford the coat hanger fetus launching crossbows.

1153
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,980
For the little tiny miniature G-Zi.

1154
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:21,520
See, Ty.

1155
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,780
Man, that would, I don't know if you.

1156
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,120
83D, geez, I fall in from the sky.

1157
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,740
Can you imagine how hot something like that would be on a, on a shopping channel?

1158
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:35,460
Hey, if we could sell it to the Spice Girls, it would be majorly hot, dude.

1159
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,900
Take over the world.

1160
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:41,160
Hello friends and welcome to the very last X Day ever.

1161
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,660
X Day drill ever.

1162
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,600
There will be no more drills for X Day.

1163
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:52,560
This time next year, a huge XS Almada will appear in the X Day.

1164
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,940
And thunder in the skies above Earth.

1165
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,040
A giant electro voice loudspeaker will lower from beneath the craft.

1166
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,860
And thunder the following warning.

1167
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,400
Wake up, pink boys and girls.

1168
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,180
This is not a drill.

1169
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:08,980
It's a sledgehammer.

1170
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,460
It is a sledgehammer.

1171
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,420
A sledgehammer bomb.

1172
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:18,020
We have gathered here today to celebrate this momentous free anniversary occasion.

1173
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:22,540
We've come from Canada, Florida, California, and the United States.

1174
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:22,540


1175
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:22,540


1176
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,340
And of course, all points in between.

1177
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:29,280
And although we are jubilant about our future, we are also serious about our present.

1178
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:32,200
This is no subgenius fantasy camp.

1179
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:36,120
We have not come here just to hobnob with the subgenius celebrities.

1180
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:42,860
To smoke froth with Stang, or drink beer with legume, or eat live prairie squid with Papa

1181
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:48,120
Joe, or even swing naked with Suzie the floozy, although that is a rather tempting proposition.

1182
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:49,420
Wait.

1183
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,240
No, sir.

1184
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:50,940
Who's that?

1185
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,540
We didn't just come here to celebrate.

1186
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,560
We came here to have a party.

1187
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,680
And just to have a good time.

1188
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,460
We came here to prepare for the end times.

1189
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,700
Now, if preparing for the destruction of the conspiracy and its millions of collaborators

1190
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:13,620
just so happens to trip your trigger and turn you on, well, I doubt Dobbs will get

1191
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,860
too upset if you enjoy yourself in the line of duty.

1192
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:21,320
There's nothing wrong with whistling while you work, especially if it helps drown out

1193
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,520
the shrill screams of the night.

1194
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:22,520


1195
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:22,520


1196
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:22,520


1197
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:22,520


1198
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:22,520


1199
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:22,520


1200
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:22,520


1201
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:22,520


1202
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:22,520


1203
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:22,520


1204
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:22,520


1205
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:22,520


1206
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:22,520


1207
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:22,520


1208
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,520
I'm sure you'll be happy to see the dreams of those you are exterminating.

1209
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,860
Hey, someone's got to do it.

1210
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:32,480
The sooner we sterilize this planet of peatness, the sooner you and me can leave this rock and

1211
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,620
explore Planet 10.

1212
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:40,720
Now, sometimes the uninitiated are shocked by our lack of sensitivity to the suffering

1213
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,320
of others.

1214
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,680
We love it.

1215
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:46,400
Let them poop their panties all they want.

1216
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:51,960
If they can't handle little Gallo's humor now, they can't wait to see the expression

1217
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:52,500
on his face.

1218
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:52,500


1219
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:52,500


1220
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:52,500


1221
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:52,500


1222
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:52,500


1223
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:52,500


1224
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:52,500


1225
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:52,500


1226
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:52,500


1227
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:52,500


1228
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:52,500


1229
00:46:53,680 --> 00:47:00,440
The only thing better than the look of horror on a dead pink's face is the look of disbelief

1230
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,960
that precedes that look of horror.

1231
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:03,820
Yes!

1232
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:08,540
You know, I never, ever get tired of seeing it.

1233
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,380
They rarely ever say a word.

1234
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,280
But you can read their mind just by looking into their terrified eyes.

1235
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:19,760
It's like that little light in the back of their brain is lighting up for the first time

1236
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,220
and thinking, wow.

1237
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,480
Like they were the ones who were scared.

1238
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:22,480


1239
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,920
They were the ones who were kidding about this X Day stuff.

1240
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:24,700
Yes!

1241
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,220
We really are going to die.

1242
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:31,300
That new car and promotion just don't seem so important anymore.

1243
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,720
If only I could buy some time.

1244
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:40,740
But alas, their conspiracy money isn't worth anything anymore and their time is out.

1245
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:41,820
It's not worth anything now.

1246
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:45,280
Which brings us to where we are now, doesn't it dear friends?

1247
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,540
And where we want to be by X Day.

1248
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:52,080
That is, there are two...

1249
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:52,480
There are two...

1250
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,960
Two distinct branches in the Church of the Subgenius.

1251
00:47:55,360 --> 00:48:02,760
The highbrow, evangelical branch, led by Ivan Stang and his philosophical followers, who

1252
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:08,320
believe that you become one with Bob by thinking about Bob and studying his word through scripture.

1253
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,620
These are the church intellectuals.

1254
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,180
We need them and they serve an important purpose.

1255
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:18,660
But they don't actually like to dirty their hands with the down and dirty business of

1256
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:19,840
battling for Bob.

1257
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:20,680
What?

1258
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:25,040
Those folks are welcome to listen to the Subgenius Hour of Slack and send in their love offerings.

1259
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:30,120
But we need people who are prepared to roll up their sleeves and break a sweat for Bob

1260
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,600
if we're going to make his vision of the future happen.

1261
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:33,000
Yeah!

1262
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:38,660
What we need on X Day are members of the other branch of the Church of the Subgenius.

1263
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:40,860
The Holocaustal branch.

1264
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:47,600
Led by St. Jane or Hyperclete, the preacher of the Black Lagoon, and of course yours truly, Papa Joe.

1265
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,460
We are, as they say, the so-called...

1266
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,040
Angry white men in black.

1267
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:59,140
We need soldiers who are willing to kill or get killed fighting the conspiracy.

1268
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:05,620
Let the evangelicals line up on the sidelines and act as cheerleaders because we appreciate their moral support.

1269
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:11,200
But the fact of the matter is that the forest won't fall unless somebody, preferably lots of somebodies,

1270
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:15,300
get out there and chop it down and stack it up like cords of dead wood.

1271
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,400
Yeah!

1272
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:17,100
Woo!

1273
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:17,480


1274
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:18,580
Woo!

1275
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:22,520
What do you need to be a soldier for Bob, friends?

1276
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:27,300
Well, oddly enough, it's not so much what you have, but what you don't have.

1277
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,120
More times than not, the Holocaustal members of the Church have practically nothing.

1278
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:37,400
No fancy cars, no fancy houses, usually unmarried, no kids.

1279
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:39,100
At least not that we know of.

1280
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,660
Soldiers of Bob travel light.

1281
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:47,000
The only thing that we carry on our back is a big-ass chip with Bob's face on it.

1282
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,560
A chip we want the conspiracy to steal.

1283
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:49,680
A chip we want the conspiracy to dare to knock off.

1284
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:54,520
It's one of the few pictures of Bob where his grin is not smiling.

1285
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,980
That time will come our next day.

1286
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:58,500
Turn on.

1287
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,160
Tune in.

1288
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:04,020
Why do you want to be normal?

1289
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,400
The rupture is upon us, dear friends.

1290
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:15,560
That fateful day, July 5th, 1998.

1291
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,720
Next day's a-comin'.

1292
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:23,800
And the pigs are bummin'.

1293
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,380
Ah!

1294
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:33,900
Oh, what I'd give once more to live

1295
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,940
In childhood innocence

1296
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:42,760
The things men do, words so true

1297
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:46,180
Would seem much more like common sense

1298
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:51,580
An empire built on civilized guilt

1299
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:55,100
And yet the whole man still is the stranger

1300
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:00,300
Looked to my friends to make a fence

1301
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:03,840
But he tried, didn't see no danger

1302
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:08,440
So come on, have yourself a good time

1303
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:12,200
Go out and share the flame

1304
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,160
Do what you should, but it ain't fair

1305
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,300
With legs and fingers

1306
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:23,420
I hope you feel no shame

1307
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:32,040
I hope you feel no shame

1308
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:40,760
I hope you feel no shame

1309
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:48,760
I hope you feel no shame

1310
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,680
Don't feel any shame, people.

1311
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,220
Feel no shame.

1312
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,000
Be who you are.

1313
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,300
Don't let the conspiracy get you down.

1314
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,860
Because X Day is coming.

1315
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,100
Don't miss X Day, friends.

1316
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,640
It's coming.

1317
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,660
No shame.

1318
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,720
Be proud of your subjigas heritage.

1319
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:10,740
And don't be ashamed.

1320
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:10,740


1321
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:16,320
Won't you feel the shame?

1322
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,260
I'm Tom Seager, I'm your show buddy.

1323
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,200
I'm a chance man.

1324
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:25,960
I'm a sound boy, hey.

1325
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,880
That's Tom on the drum.

1326
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:37,160
These occurrences are pure figments of imagination.

1327
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,580
Any abnormal sound?

1328
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:40,540
Roll.

1329
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,780
Happily, delightfully, constantly roll.

1330
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,700
May I inquire about your personal beliefs?

1331
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:02,720
May I inquire about your personal beliefs?

1332
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,780
My beliefs.

1333
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:09,200
What do you believe in?

1334
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:11,100
What stirs your heart?

1335
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:16,100
What fills my eyes?

1336
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,220
What's your dream to create a dream?

1337
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,720
What do you feel in my life?

1338
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:26,840
What's your dream to create?

1339
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:30,780
To feel the very same thing I have in my life.

1340
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,140
To feel the same thing I have in my life.

1341
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:34,180
The hands.

1342
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,800
The hands.

1343
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:37,980
The hands.

1344
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:38,320


1345
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:38,500
The hands.

1346
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,460
You don't know what you touch.

1347
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,920
So, just lay down there.

1348
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:44,920


1349
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,440
I'll love you as they look at you without a brain.

1350
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:46,560
Everyone else will be finding this easy.

1351
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,740
One group, then the other.

1352
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:49,480
The end.

1353
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:49,480


1354
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,420
Those were esses.

1355
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:57,620
ência.c.a.s.s.a was an along the way choice so I spend a million bucks.

1356
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:58,880
One shall find the good, only a million.

1357
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,500
The whole business is mine, don't remember.

1358
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:14,400
Totally and absolutely mine, don't remember.

1359
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:16,180
A girl like that, you could take her with your pocket.

1360
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:17,720
Two feet tall, two years old, he didn't care.

1361
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,500
And if there was real young, you could hide her.

1362
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:19,920
Greys.

1363
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,860
The little greys.

1364
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:22,120
Yeah.

1365
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:25,020
Poor little innocent greys.

1366
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:25,720
Old ones.

1367
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:30,100
Of course, the greys are born huge and grow smaller as they age.

1368
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,780
The littler they get, the better.

1369
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:34,680
Yeah, I love them little geriatric greys.

1370
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,040
They knew everything there was to know about it.

1371
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,640
In fact, they taught me some tricks I could never tell anybody.

1372
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,380
Like the real reason why we're not here.

1373
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:50,480
They taught you the, that grey madam taught you the trick of the flying Philadelphia.

1374
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:57,100
That special alien act that no human ever knew.

1375
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:02,080
But yet you were given the privilege of sharing with the great Queen Grey.

1376
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,400
The old ancient Queen Grey.

1377
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,440
A poppy.

1378
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,280
A poppy.

1379
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,000
Lady Grey.

1380
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,180
A poppy.

1381
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:11,720
Whoa.

1382
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,100
How dare you let me hit you.

1383
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:14,400
Smart shamanistic.

1384
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,840
Why are you doing that?

1385
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:15,940
Can I boy?

1386
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,640
Oh man, I never seen anybody take off a beard top with an appendage like that.

1387
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,220
Man, hey, hey, what you, lady, how come you ain't working more, you know what I mean?

1388
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,440
I seen you in the food stand flying a lot.

1389
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:33,180
I am taking you, Dave, as my king.

1390
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,380
I, the Queen, shall continue to play the queen.

1391
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:36,380


1392
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:36,380


1393
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:36,380


1394
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:36,380


1395
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:36,380


1396
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:38,760
I'm going to pump out eggs of more little greys.

1397
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,960
Put on this red coat, Mr. Dave.

1398
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:44,600
Put on a red coat for us, please.

1399
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:51,060
And strap, strap this on with those big red straps.

1400
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:54,320
We have been without a king for too many years.

1401
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:58,140
A king and the land is one.

1402
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,840
And without a king, we have no land.

1403
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,500
I am the new Elvis.

1404
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,360
Yes, I'll take your hand or whatever that thing is.

1405
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,680
And I'll open beer bottles for you.

1406
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:15,480
And I'll sing you songs deep into the night about Charlie and the Princess Di and, and,

1407
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,300
and, and, and left-wing conspirators.

1408
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,860
And we will keep you here in our great court.

1409
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:28,580
And we will entomb you in this little hexagonal box and seal over the top with flags.

1410
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:31,300
And we will try you for crimes against the universe.

1411
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:35,960
When we need you, we will take you out and inject you with poison.

1412
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:37,440
Thank you.

1413
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,440
Long live our new king, Dave.

1414
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:41,620
King?

1415
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:43,880
Hey, I don't want no job like that.

1416
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,480
You old, you weird creatures can just be gone.

1417
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,020
I know I'm being like this anymore.

1418
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:55,600
When his body has undergone the change, we will all of us queens shall lay our eggs in him.

1419
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:59,380
And our children shall feast upon their father.

1420
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:01,000
No, don't do that. Get away from me.

1421
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:04,420
They grow up to be little grey larvae.

1422
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:05,520
Get that thing away from me.

1423
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,660
You can't inject that into my body, into my back there.

1424
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:11,060
Oh, your children will be so cute.

1425
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:12,300
Our children, Dave.

1426
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,240
I'm too young to have children.

1427
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:14,960
I'm only 48 years old.

1428
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,340
I'm too young to have children.

1429
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:22,960
I live a footloose and frantic free life and I especially don't want nobody injecting no eggs into my rectal cavity.

1430
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,680
But you are the king, Dave.

1431
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:26,540
I like the suit just fine.

1432
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:28,800
The greatest king of all of us.

1433
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:33,700
Can't I just sing and walk around in my red cape and stuff and get the world commands?

1434
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,140
I mean, what do you got to do that for?

1435
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,560
We need you, Dave.

1436
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:42,280
And your children need you. They need to grow inside your viscera.

1437
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:43,960
Children need a father.

1438
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,380
I can't be a father to all them goofy looking things. I don't know what to feed them.

1439
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:50,100
And I wouldn't know how to teach them nothing.

1440
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:52,160
Oh, they will feed themselves.

1441
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:57,780
They're melting and changing back into... They're Martians. Can you understand? Martians, not men.

1442
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:00,060
You are the man. You are the man.

1443
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:04,540
You will be the father of a great civilization of greys.

1444
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:07,320
The Dave Greys, they will be called.

1445
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:14,900
But Dave Greys ain't got no body here, see? They don't look nothing like me. I can't have no greys with all their...

1446
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:18,620
But think of them as little children with sunglasses on.

1447
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:22,860
I like the sunglasses. That's a nice touch. But they have no eyes.

1448
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:31,460
And they have no sexual organs either, Dave. That's why we don't worry about you abusing them.

1449
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:32,460
But...

1450
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:35,080
That's why you make the perfect father.

1451
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,400
Now, would you please give us those...

1452
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,080
Step into the light, Dave.

1453
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:41,820
Step into the light and give us those shoes.

1454
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,120
Walk into the light, dammit.

1455
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:44,260
We must take them off for later.

1456
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,220
How much longer, Dave?

1457
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:45,960
We've got this.

1458
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:52,080
We gave up the ruby slippers. The fool. The idiot. Now he's trapped here forever.

1459
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:56,080
You want to hear some great music?

1460
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:56,700
Yeah.

1461
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:58,480
Yeah.

1462
00:58:58,720 --> 00:58:59,160
Yeah.

1463
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,380
I just wanted to make money and have fun.

1464
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,500
Hello, doctor.

1465
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,140
How are you?

1466
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,540
The doctor is on.

1467
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,840
You could have a rewarding career as a subgenius doctor.

1468
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,620
That's right. Surgeons for Connie.

1469
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:19,600
Perform healing orgy-deviable surgery.

1470
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,120
Sicken the masses.

1471
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:27,180
Bombard the patient with subgenius anti-music noise.

1472
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:28,960
I'm gonna die!

1473
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:34,500
And all you need to do that, friends, is to write for free information from...

1474
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,660
And here's that post office box number again.

1475
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:37,620
You got that pencil ready?

1476
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:45,880
Write to Bob, my friends, at post office box 140306.

1477
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:55,460
That's box 140306 in beautiful Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1478
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,240
Ah, yes.

1479
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,140
The sacred box.

1480
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:03,140
Zip code of Bob, 75214.

1481
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:08,980
And you too can join us on the saucers, first in Brushwood, Sherman, New York, and then

1482
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:13,260
on the saucers on that glorious day, X-Day, coming up so soon.

1483
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,460
Oh, so very, very soon.

1484
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:16,860
Are you ready, friends?

1485
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:23,120
This morning, certainly you yourself may have tied your shoelaces, but tonight will it be

1486
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,540
the undertaker who unties them.

1487
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:26,640
Are you ready to meet Bob?

1488
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:27,480
Are you ready?

1489
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:28,660
I am, my friend.

1490
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:29,900
I am certainly ready.

1491
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,160
I've paid my $30.

1492
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:35,340
I've got my subgenius minister's card in my pocket, and I am in.

1493
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:37,900
I am ready to meet Bob, friends.

1494
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:44,980
And praise Bill T. Miller for the music that we have used from his CD here and there, on

1495
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:50,740
and off from Orgy of Slack, Einstein's Secret Orchestra, and oh, James Kocielka, superstar

1496
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:56,260
at the very beginning of this half hour, doing that song, Show Respect to Michael Jackson.

1497
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:01,460
And a special thanks to Reverend Bleepo Abernathy for such a great preaching.

1498
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:02,920
And a thank you.
