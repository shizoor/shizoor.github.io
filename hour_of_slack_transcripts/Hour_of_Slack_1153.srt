1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960
That's just like the incoming.

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,600
If you're cleaning up after the flood, you'll need to cause injury or even death.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,520
If there's standing water in the building and it's not safe to use electricity, use electrical appliances.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,400
Do not read and follow all label instructions carefully.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,520
Don't provide fresh air by opening windows and doors.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,060
Keep away from children.

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,760
You're a primitive.

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,280
You're an intellectual deficient.

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,680
And I could never understand it.

10
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,640
Maybe we're wrong.

11
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:25,760
Maybe we're stupid.

12
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,060
I've never been able to understand.

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:28,980
All right.

14
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,800
Ben Stein, everybody.

15
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,780
We'll look for his film.

16
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,220
Thank you.

17
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,260
How are we supposed to know about these kooko connections out there?

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,440
You're using Bob's brain, Steph.

19
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,420
In other words, smiling, friendly, cosmic damn Bob.

20
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,780
Reintroduce the show after each show.

21
00:00:59,180 --> 00:00:59,960
Number two.

22
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,240
The subgenius hour of slack.

23
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,100
Join us now for the Bob hour.

24
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:05,400
A break.

25
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,280
videos.

26
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:27,180
The Bob I'd better I get some rest.

27
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:27,860
He's too slow.

28
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,600
He's too fast.

29
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,620
nicht, natürlich ist er nicht zu ich bin einела behind him.

30
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:40,520
Are we got in the studio tonight Bob Bob is famous from the rock and roll days in that right Bob

31
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,940
But I don't really know much. No, that's a really no. No Bob. No, where you from originally?

32
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,520
All right. How about you Bob? Where you from 69 and then?

33
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,400
Intermittently I was I was looking yes, probably more wacky than anybody ever thought I'm getting confused

34
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,940
Like I went from wixie to waxy to caca caca. So it's like Woodstock Bob

35
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,480
Why why would anybody want to do that?

36
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:06,660
That was kind of a shocking thing Bob and I when we got together climbed into a motorhome and

37
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:07,920
girls

38
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,660
partly drugs but partly money

39
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,320
Mostly free music. Absolutely wacky. How did he do?

40
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,720

45
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,940
Zimbabwe's electoral body says this is

46
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:48,460
So, you know here we go again, I mean we've been down this road before

47
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,400
Hopefully the worst is behind us, but you never know some damage was reported in the healing process

48
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,240
a

49
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,640
hundred years ago cut off from the changing world outside

50
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,580
corn

51
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,080
men who logged off a dead lost in old ways

52
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,740
What do you want?

53
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,640
Porn and pork

54
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,140
Pawn and pork and pork and the grease to eat

55
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,060
Bones the people who built America

56
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,940
Mud state another kind of world

57
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,420
The books do not tell of how to rotate the earth in the sky

58
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,220
They do not know what to do with the earth

59
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:26,220


60
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:26,220


61
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:26,220


62
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,880
They do not know what to do about their own lack of slack

63
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,660
The children must learn

64
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:32,420
Slash

How

00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,260
50 cents to watch the fat man jump the fence.

82
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,560
He jumped so high he touched the sky.

83
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,520
He never came down until Fourth of July.

84
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,200
Aye, the Black Lodge singers, dear friends.

85
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:50,800
And welcome to our rough slack number 1,153.

86
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,580
153 and 53.

87
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,580
Yes, yes, yes.

88
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,560
Oh, and before we get going, I have this announced.

89
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,680
Well, this is something that the station told us to read.

90
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,660
I think they meant to read it on the air.

91
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,140
As follows.

92
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,120
Things have changed since 9-11.

93
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,340
You are the eyes and ears.

94
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,240
Of homeland security.

95
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,560
Report all non-standard callers.

96
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,280
In your case, report all callers.

97
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,580
You are also close to Canada,

98
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:35,520
haven to millions of Islamofascists waiting for the signal to attack the homeland.

99
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,300
Be aware of non-standard activity in your broadcast facility.

100
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,080
In your case, be aware of all activity.

101
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,920
Since your station operates in an unpatriotic region of the FM band,

102
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,640
you may be influenced.

103
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,020
You may be influenced by non-standard opinions.

104
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,600
Report these opinions.

105
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,500
Take care that your art, music, and commentaries are positive and uplifting.

106
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,960
If there are activities that need doing at your radio station, do them cheesefully.

107
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,540
Avoid activities that leave you feeling non-standard.

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,900
If you are not sure, ask yourself,

109
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,760
could I perform this activity while wearing a bright, shiny U.S. flag lapel pin?

110
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,540
If the answer is no, stop and report.

111
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,560
This activity.

112
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,340
You are the spleen of homeland security.

113
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,180
If we are vigilant and apprehensive at all times,

114
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:35,460
nothing can stop us from enjoying life to the fullest within reasonable boundaries.

115
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:42,460
Boundaries that must be guarded at all times to prevent waves of non-standard people from tearing down our homeland.

116
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,280
Loose thoughts sink ships.

117
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:50,520
Being scared shiftless of non-standard things is a crime.

118
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:50,520


119
00:06:50,520 --> 00:07:00,180
cool way to act. All the sexy people are doing it. Try some fear today. You are the taste buds

120
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:07,100
of Homeland Security. Within 12 hours of gazing upon a portrait of Michael Chertoff, you'll be

121
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:13,220
ready to express your individuality to the best of your ability. Radio is a great medium to spread

122
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:18,540
the word about Homeland Security. Your listeners will thank you. Your cow orcas will thank you.

123
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:26,520
You will thank you. Remember, service guarantees citizenship. Close cover before striking.

124
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:32,440
To avoid danger of suffocation, keep away from babies and look out below.

125
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:44,240
Ah, yes, yes, yes. Unclaimed mysteries claimed that, we might say. And before that,

126
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,520
that song, Ask Your Mom for 50 Cents, was the...

127
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:56,260
Black Lodge singers. I understand they're bigger than Madonna in Iceland. And the collages. Well,

128
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:04,040
actually, one was by Reverend Maynard Brainard. And the rest was the great Fernanda Nanny Lemire's

129
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:14,200
work, interspersed with work by the great Norell Preff of norellpreff.com. And so much for that.

130
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,240
All right, so this is...

131
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,980
Somebody get that.

132
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:28,000
Homeland Security. Can I help you? Hello? Homeland Security.

133
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,540
I have a problem. Can you help me?

134
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,280
I'm afraid you have to speak a little bit more slowly, ma'am.

135
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:41,280
I'm really scared and I don't feel safe anymore. Is there anything you can do?

136
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:48,520
Are you sure you're not reading from the wrong piece of paper? You don't feel really sacred? Do you feel scared? Do you feel scared of your mother?

137
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:48,520


138
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:48,520


139
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:48,520


140
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:48,520


141
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,160
I'm scared and I don't feel safe.

142
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,040
Alright, what's your address?

143
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,740
What is the cause of your circumstance?

144
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,400
Any problems?

145
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,100
I live at 666 Boulevard Drive.

146
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,200
666 Boulevard Drive.

147
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,560
That's on the east side or the west side?

148
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,840
West side of Springfield.

149
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,880
West side of Springfield, Illinois, Missouri.

150
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,180
Hampton, Madison, Larkin.

151
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,720
Remember, service is

152
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,480
executional.

153
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,640
West Hampton.

154
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,760
It's really scary here all the time.

155
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,440
It's getting more scary

156
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,400
all the time.

157
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,340
Now, now, kids.

158
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,560
The kids make it

159
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,480
scary these days.

160
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,400
No planet for an old feller.

161
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,040
Kids keep on growing

162
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,440
funnier and funnier things out of the sides

163
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,460
of their bodies, you know.

164
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,280
Back when I was a boy, everybody had

165
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,280
one set of lungs, one set of hearts,

166
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,480
one set of brains.

167
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,440
Well, and if you grew something extra, you kept it

168
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,560
hidden. You didn't just dangle it

169
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,220
right out in front of everybody.

170
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:47,860
You had to know what you were doing

171
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,340
as you were walking through the dang

172
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,360
shopping mall.

173
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,040
That's right.

174
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:52,720
That's right.

175
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,280
You had to know the right circumstance to

176
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,600
expose them spare glands you got on you.

177
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,780
If you had like a colostomy bag, you didn't

178
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,720
like show it off.

179
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,580
You didn't get a transparent one that you could

180
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,980
hang outside your pants.

181
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,640
Oh, now they got them decorator ones.

182
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:11,920
Oh, yeah.

183
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,680
Now they got peace signs on the colostomy bags.

184
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,200
80-year-old kids.

185
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,740
Wicked designs and so forth.

186
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:17,740


187
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,120
These young kids.

188
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,900
They got no respect.

189
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,100
My grandson has a friend who has one of them designer

190
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,240
colostomy bags and he is a crude, rude young man.

191
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,000
We've tried to remove his nostril hairs because that

192
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,240
appears to be where he's getting them signals from.

193
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,240
That's where it started with me.

194
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,320
We got to cut them off.

195
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,880
I had mine removed.

196
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,320
The signals, it goes right into your sinuses and then it

197
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,520
tickles your forebrain as if it was your medulla oblongata.

198
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,240
The only thing that can erase those mind control nose hairs

199
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,800
is a bolt of lightning, you know?

200
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,200
And a good old Zippo lighter like we had back in the day

201
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,040
when we had days.

202
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,320
Remember when we had them?

203
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,220
Oh, I remember back when the sun used to, well, you could see the sun.

204
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:03,860
The sun probably still rises, but it's a moot point for us down here.

205
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,100
Yeah, at least where the sweat glands are thin.

206
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,940
I'm applying for a new one of them.

207
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,440
I don't need no more knees than I already got.

208
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,380
How many knees you got?

209
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,860
Well, I only have one, but real one.

210
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,220
Well, real one.

211
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:17,280
What?

212
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,100
A real knee.

213
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,320
Real knee.

214
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,240
Oh, a real knee.

215
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:19,880
I got money.

216
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,520
I got plenty of real knees.

217
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,940
I got lots of money, but they don't use that kind anymore.

218
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,640
Is that your plan, knees down there?

219
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,120
My knee's no good.

220
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,600
I got a bad, my knee's bad these days.

221
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,480
Yeah, mine got an exacerbated diaphragm.

222
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,980
I don't know if I could really use it for any water control devices.

223
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,200
Do they still do that nowadays?

224
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,980
Do they still torture down at Dobbs Town?

225
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,260
Well, they don't like to use so many words.

226
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,800
We like to call it selling.

227
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,100
Not torturing.

228
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,100
Yeah, they never did like to use too many words.

229
00:11:52,480 --> 00:12:02,180
Now, speaking of words, we think that we have a new recording of our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

230
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,960
An actual recording of Dobbs?

231
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,900
Yes, Mr. Sister.

232
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,180
I, Dr. Mr. Sister, found this particular one.

233
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,460
He actually found two clips, but we're going to save the second one for emergencies.

234
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,620
This one, if we listen closely, you'll hear...

235
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:26,360
Well, actually, I'm not sure this is necessarily the J.R. Bob Dobbs.

236
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,240
It may be a cousin or Bob...

237
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,980
It sounds like Bob.

238
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,760
Here, we'll just play it, friends.

239
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,320
Poke him.

240
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,400
Well, now, we gave most of our map collection to the library.

241
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,640
Mr. Dobbs, we've already been to the library.

242
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,440
We've checked every possible source.

243
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,540
You're our last resort.

244
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,840
Too bad, too bad.

245
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,320
We don't have many documents.

246
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,980
We don't have room for them.

247
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:58,440
We put up a bond issue, Proposition 14A, specifically asking for a document room.

248
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,740
Oh, here.

249
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,640
Here we are.

250
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,940
Is this all you have?

251
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:08,900
I'm sorry.

252
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,600
Just not a speck of room.

253
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,740
Mr. Dobbs, this is very important.

254
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,620
Have you ever heard of an underground library?

255
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:19,120
An underground river or an ancient waterway that runs through the valley that would empty into a deep pool?

256
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,780
Dear, dear, let me think.

257
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,340
I can't think of a thing.

258
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:31,040
But every once in a while, somebody dies and leaves us a whole lot of documents for our room.

259
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,020
The one we didn't get, you understand.

260
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,800
Proposition 14A was defeated.

261
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,760
Well, if you should hear of anything, why, you can get me at the air base.

262
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,440
Air base?

263
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,060
Yeah, El Centro.

264
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,160
Oh, sure, sure.

265
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,580
I always cooperate with the authorities.

266
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,360
You'll find that I'm a very cooperative person.

267
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,480
Oh, thank you, Mr. Dobbs.

268
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,260
Just call on me anytime, night or day.

269
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,280
Calcium.

270
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,040
Calcium.

271
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:54,580
Calcium.

272
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,120
Calcium.

273
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,960
Yes, calcium.

274
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,240
And now there's calcium.

275
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,960
Serve your children calcium.

276
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,280
Kids love calcium, hot or cold.

277
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,900
Do you want to truly change your life?

278
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:10,720
In just ten short weeks, you can acquire a good paying career, job security, and lots of opportunities for advancement.

279
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,140
And let's go to Bob's.

280
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,380
Good morning.

281
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,420
Good morning, Ray.

282
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,080
Ben Laden can hide pretty good.

283
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:15,940
Well, apparently.

284
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,160
I mean, it's absolutely ridiculous.

285
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,100
The education crisis of the first degree.

286
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:28,500
When I was a child, I don't know history, don't know geography, don't know anything except, I guess, how to get high.

287
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,040
But we were aware of the grammatical and usage error.

288
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,640
And the, and, and, I mean, I don't really know that much.

289
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,600
I'm a lot older.

290
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:38,940
All right.

291
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,740
I don't know.

292
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,220
I don't know.

293
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:40,300
I don't know.

294
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,300
And I said, all right.

295
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,780
Programs that connect you to the world.

296
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:52,540
And, dear friends, this is the program that connects you to the other world.

297
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,100
Sure didn't sound like Bob to me there, Stangy boy.

298
00:14:59,260 --> 00:14:59,380
What?

299
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,240
It sounded like a cheap imitation of that phony Brit accent.

300
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:08,440
Of course we have a document room filled with elaborate documents and Proposition 14a.

301
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,120
Well, it's true that we thought.

302
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,580
We always thought Dobbs was from the Midwest.

303
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,140
We always thought he was from the moon too, dude.

304
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,260
Oh, well, of course Midwest.

305
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:16,780
Of course.

306
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,800
Yeah, well, Bob's your uncle, you know, and he's Brit, all right?

307
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,420
Bob's your uncle.

308
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:21,940
There you go.

309
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:22,800
Bob.

310
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,120
Bob.

311
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,300
Bob.

312
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,500
Bob's your uncle.

313
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:25,960
Bob.

314
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,100
Betty Boop is your Aunt Betty Boop.

315
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,760
Bob.

316
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,300
Plosive Bobbo is your chimpanzee uncle.

317
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,200
Bob.

318
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,200
Bebe is your favorite kind of dressing machine.

319
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,280
And Inspector Clus.

320
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,100
Mama, Mama, is your aunt Betty Boop?

321
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,100


322
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,100


323
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,100


324
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,100


325
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,100


326
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,100


327
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,100


328
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,560
Who's your grandma?

329
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,540
Inspector Clus would call him Bib.

330
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,000
Bib.

331
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:45,660
Bib.

332
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,120
Bib.

333
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:46,620
Bib.

334
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:47,580
Bib.

335
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:47,780
Bib.

336
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,040
Bib.

337
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,060
Bib.

338
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,060


339
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:48,600
Bib.

340
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:48,680
Bib.

341
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:48,760
Bib.

342
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:48,760


343
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:48,760


344
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:48,760


345
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,980
Who is the guy whose eye used to whistle?

346
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,780
Like he would say Bob, you know, and his eye, there would be like a whistling sound coming

347
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,820
out of his eyeball.

348
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:56,900
That was me.

349
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,100
That was you?

350
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,660
Yo, man, that is so like whack and so forth.

351
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,360
You know.

352
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,520
Like would you have an eye whistle when you?

353
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,780
I can blow smoke out that hole in my eye too.

354
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,120
That's what you were blowing, man.

355
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,480
I thought you were blowing something.

356
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,800
Yeah, that's real.

357
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,460
But Ferp is not logical.

358
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,640
It's frozen.

359
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,420
It's hard to imagine.

360
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,820
I'm sorry.

361
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:19,940
Goodbye.

362
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,720
It's not pretty.

363
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,620
My ancestors, it was, I think, 19...

364
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,380
Not pretty at all.

365
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,240
Not at all.

366
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,620
It's the year that they discovered the proscriptions.

367
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,180
Or the year that the Immaculate Doge was 19...

368
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,880
Oh, when was I demaculated?

369
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,320
Almost everybody pretty much agrees that we don't know what year it is.

370
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,280
Not really.

371
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:43,900
Right now?

372
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:44,680
Right now.

373
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,260
We don't know when now is.

374
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,500
And we don't know where here is, if you think about it.

375
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,260
Dave, now think if you had a time machine.

376
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:53,980
Yeah.

377
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:59,560
And you decided to go ahead in time just a modest amount, say five seconds.

378
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,100
Five seconds.

379
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,480
Or ahead in time, five seconds in the future.

380
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,140
Five in the future.

381
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,400
Or five seconds in the past.

382
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:05,840
Yeah.

383
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,700
Now your time machine...

384
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:14,740
Your time machine would have to calculate where you had moved in relation to the rest of the universe.

385
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,960
Five seconds.

386
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,320
Because if you think about it...

387
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,560
You're moving in what time?

388
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:25,920
You're standing on this, in this space that you may think is latitude 36 by 33, 36.

389
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,060
But...

390
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:27,820
Parametrically.

391
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:33,600
In fact, the planet you're on is moving through space rather fast, revolving, spinning around the sun.

392
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,560
And rotating.

393
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,600
And the sun is whipping through space.

394
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:37,860
And the sun is spinning around the sun.

395
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:37,960
And the sun is spinning around the sun.

396
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,880
It's 18 godzillion millifeet per half second.

397
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,960
And so your time machine, if you're going to say, okay, I'm going to travel five seconds into the past and see myself five seconds ago.

398
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:50,860
So I can say this.

399
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,600
So I can say this.

400
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,260
So I can say this.

401
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,140
You would end up in out of space.

402
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,280
Or possibly the center of the earth.

403
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,700
But most likely the earth would just pass you right out from underneath you when you came back five seconds later.

404
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,100
The earth and the sun would be a hundred miles away.

405
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,440
As it always has been.

406
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,480
You don't understand.

407
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,240
As light years measure space.

408
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,740
You lost me on the last part.

409
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,240
You were telling me that there could be no singular moment where I would eat my own grandpappy.

410
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:23,200
But I'm telling you right now as seriously as I possibly can that moments are liquid.

411
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Therefore, if I were to go five minutes into the future, or five minutes into the past year, I would have to urinate.

412
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,020
And so would you.

413
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,100
You'd be drowning in time itself.

414
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,840
Swelling up with time and having to spew it out.

415
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,580
Like a vast boat consumed by its own organic material.

416
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:50,300
So the followers of Bob lift themselves skyward with these tiny little pills and obtruse objects.

417
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:56,040
For you are neither cold nor hot and I spew thee out of my mouth for thou art but lukewarm.

418
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,620
That was from Luke Warm 317.

419
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,380
Luke Warm traveled through the Middle East.

420
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,200
A man with a pair of sandals and a vision.

421
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,800
Worn sandals.

422
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,800
The Romans obtrused him.

423
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,080
The Judeans produced him.

424
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:21,620
And yet at the same time as he walked through the Assyrian village, the pipe followed before him.

425
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,640
No, he proceeded.

426
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,420
And it was obtrusal.

427
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,020
It was obtrusal.

428
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,280
That's right.

429
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,560
His head was screwed on backwards.

430
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,840
Old woman, he said.

431
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,520
Medicine woman.

432
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,740
Can you point me the way to Brushwood and Dobstown?

433
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,360
No, no, you're looking backwards.

434
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:36,920
It's that way.

435
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,260
It's behind you.

436
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,120
It's in front of you.

437
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,340
It's all behind you.

438
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,240
It's in front of your eyes.

439
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,780
And so we wandered on to the village of Tarsus.

440
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,960
With his head pointed back towards his ass.

441
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,800
And his thoughts deep, dark and gloomy.

442
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,980
What is the meaning of all this?

443
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,840
I have traveled so far yet I have learned so little.

444
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,280
The toes on my shoes are stinky and weak.

445
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,360
And I can barely...

446
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,180
I have no more food for I am hungry.

447
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,600
I must lay down and take my rest.

448
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,300
Is that you, friend?

449
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,680
Are you sleeping on the road to Tarsus?

450
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:27,000
When you should be heading for Dobstown or at least X-Day, Brushwood, someday?

451
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:35,040
As long as they know that happiness is the journey and not X-Day itself.

452
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,360
Well, that's what they always say.

453
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:36,820
They always tell you.

454
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:46,060
But in fact, the real happiness comes at that moment when your dollars are lifted from you.

455
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,960
And you are unburdened of them.

456
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,640
And lay them down upon Bob.

457
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,860
Yes, go ahead and shower your burdens of dollars upon Bob.

458
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,980
And be ready when those men from Planet X come.

459
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,260
When the parkway...

460
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,880
You don't want to be weighted down.

461
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,840
You don't want to be too heavy with needs.

462
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,660
You want to be ready for the physical world.

463
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:14,440
They won't be able to beam you up if you're loaded down with too much materialism.

464
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,020
Material goods.

465
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,140
Friends, I think you know how to part with those material goods.

466
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,220
And that's to donate to this wonderful station you're listening to now.

467
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:33,880
I could probably suggest other things, but I don't think that that's proper right nor meet on these public supported airwaves.

468
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,620
However, that said...

469
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,280
I can't announce the bands that will be playing at X Day.

470
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,920
There's a bunch of them.

471
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,740
And there's some more that want to get on there, even.

472
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,560
Was there?

473
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,100
Were?

474
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:45,980
More?

475
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,760
There is.

476
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,160
Now, would Lunsson, Booger Dave, and the Cowboys be there?

477
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,700
I'd be there, but Charlie wants to get his band on there somehow, too.

478
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,000
Oh, really?

479
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,980
Has Charlie been talking about that?

480
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,600
What are they called, the Half Rabbits?

481
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,920
The Short Rabbits.

482
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,260
Oh, right.

483
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:00,800
Right.

484
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,880
I was close.

485
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:02,960
They play them on there.

486
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,840
The Dehigh Rabbits.

487
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:04,440
They're a punk band.

488
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,120
They're one of them punk bands.

489
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:06,480
Aren't they?

490
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,880
Yeah, one of them there punk bands.

491
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,280
Yeah.

492
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,440
Well, the Amino Acids will be there.

493
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,700
Of course, the Amino Acids are in every living thing.

494
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:14,900
Yes, they are.

495
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,600
But the band, the Amino Acids will be there.

496
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:24,400
Fat Free, which is not entirely, but they like to say that, they'll be there.

497
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,580
I think they're from Brookline in New York.

498
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,620
They're friends of Priestess Pisces.

499
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,560
Then they were at the Baltimore Show, and they did a really scatological, unusual,

500
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,300
verbal...

501
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,020
And musical show.

502
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,360
That'll fill the mouth, people.

503
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,560
Reverend Phil's band, Mike Bison, will be there.

504
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,180
And something called Calvin Ball.

505
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:54,100
Now, I'm taking Senator Speck's word for it, that these bands are worthy of the subgeniuses.

506
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,020
And the Bersificators from Ann Arbor.

507
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,060
And some country band.

508
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,600
And the Short Rabbits, apparently.

509
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,120
And the Short...

510
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,980
The Short Hairs.

511
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,900
The Lonesome Cowboy...

512
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,360
On the pate of Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

513
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,680
And Dr. Howell will be there.

514
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,140
Hopefully, Dr. Swinburden will accompany Dr. Howell.

515
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,880
I should mention to you, Dave, I wanted to not tell you this, but now my conscience is

516
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,640
getting the best of me.

517
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:28,480
People have been saying nice things about your radio performances on Alt Slack, the

518
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,600
subgenius news group.

519
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,560
They've actually gotten fan commentary.

520
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,160
And I don't like it, because one of them said,

521
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:41,860
Well, Stang, you're sort of funny, but really, the best is with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Dr. Howell.

522
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,840
So, can you play more of Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Dr. Howell together?

523
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,000
So you can see why I didn't want to tell you that.

524
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:53,480
Listen, you tell me who this person is, and Dr. Howell and I will pay him a visit and be his foot in.

525
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,000
It was Reverend Eggplant.

526
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,040
All right, then we won't do it, because we're both afraid of him.

527
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,460
However, we will try to convince him in another way.

528
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:06,240
Everybody who's seen Reverend Eggplant would be afraid to lay a hand.

529
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,240
That's true.

530
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,820
At least not, you know, their own real hand.

531
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,500
You can use one of the designer artificial hands.

532
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,660
You can use them for practically anything.

533
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:20,280
But as a prosthetic device, they're one in a million.

534
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,560
And I think offering them here right now is probably the best thing we can do.

535
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:23,960
Don't you?

536
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:24,520
Yes, I do.

537
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:24,960
Yes.

538
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:34,640
And tonight with us, we have the lovely Mr. and Mrs. Arch Pinkle, who's discovered a new way of disengorging him and both

539
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,360
herself from this universe.

540
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:36,360


541
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,460
This universe that we seem to be stranded in.

542
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,400
What's up with that, Mrs. and Mr. Arch?

543
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:41,660
I really...

544
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:45,580
Yes, my friends, you can leave this universe.

545
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:51,400
You're not stranded here in the strings of space.

546
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,220
Nay, nay, nay.

547
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:59,220
You can float like smoke lifting up off the bowl of this pipe earth.

548
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,260
You can escape this mud plane.

549
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:04,880
What are you?

550
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,360
You can find a way.

551
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:16,940
You can find a way free of gravity's chains and rise up in flight, man, like a balloon.

552
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,720
By emptying your head and replacing it with gases lighter than air.

553
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,740
What's better than a big juicy steak?

554
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,260
Nothing.

555
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,240
Nothing's better than a big juicy steak.

556
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:35,220
They take your rubber boots and walk around like a sky wolf.

557
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,340
But a raw...

558
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,800
But a stale crust of bread is better than nothing, ain't it?

559
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,540
Let them eat potato chips.

560
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,720
Let them enjoy what's in their stomach.

561
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,880
Therefore, a stale crust of bread is better than a big juicy steak.

562
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,160
Oh, that's right mate, I haven't eaten in three days.

563
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,940
I was wondering if you could...

564
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,160
Little sister taught me that trick.

565
00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:01,000
Okay, friends, we have to go now to a public service announcement on us.

566
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,020
We really do.

567
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:02,980
This is...

568
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,200
But, but, but, but, a crust in hand is better than nothing.

569
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,200


570
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,200


571
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,200


572
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,200


573
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,200


574
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,200


575
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,200


576
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,720
Better than two steaks in the bush.

577
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,680
That's a good public service announcement.

578
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,200
That's the kind we need nowadays, Fronky.

579
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:16,820
I mean, Dr. Stevedore, we need more hands in the bush and more snakes and so forth.

580
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,080
Absolutely, absolutely.

581
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,080
I mean, think about it.

582
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:26,240
I was in one of the many wonderful wars we have periodically and I lost both my stomps in this...

583
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,160
Oh, I read about that.

584
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,780
...last, last, last war we have in the other one.

585
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:35,000
And I noticed that I had a lot of my comrades and fellow Tovarists with us.

586
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,820
Here's a health tip to protect you and your family from West Nile virus.

587
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:45,180
Mosquitoes carry the virus, but you can tell mosquitoes to wear long pants when possible.

588
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,960
Brought to you by the Wisconsin Department of Huzzah.

589
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,700
This is a downlay, downlay, downlay, downlay, slash.

590
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,240
Enough is enough is enough.

591
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:57,740
Gross negligence, high-level plots and elaborate cover-ups, but dangerous too.

592
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,540
Anarchy of absolute justice is possible.

593
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,860
Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.

594
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,980
Life's futile.

595
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,000
But where does...

596
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,540
...revenge figure in the calculation?

597
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,920
Criminal vengeance.

598
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,820
Billions of dollars.

599
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,780
Two hundred billion dollars.

600
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,160
Two hundred billion dollars.

601
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:12,880
Two hundred billion dollars.

602
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,520
Billions.

603
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,380
Our main goal was merely retaliation for the 9-11 attack.

604
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,300
The Iraq war.

605
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,120
It was not nice.

606
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,660
Dumbest guy on the face of the planet.

607
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:21,760
I'm...

608
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,120
I'm...

609
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,360
I'm...

610
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:22,760
I'm...

611
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,040
I'm...

612
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,620
I'm safer.

613
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,580
Losing tens of billions of dollars.

614
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,740
Dot-Dots bought seven and a half billion dollars.

615
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,900
Thirty billion dollars.

616
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:29,960
Two hundred billion dollars.

617
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,060
Two hundred billion dollars.

618
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:31,800
Two hundred billion dollars.

619
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,380
Billions.

620
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,700
Was there any thinking?

621
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,520
Any thinking?

622
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,700
Crack, crack, crack, crack?

623
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,580
Caused more harm, and that's why we wrote them down.

624
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,280
You got screwed.

625
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,280
I guess you've seen...

626
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,520
Oh, that's me, incidentally.

627
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,320
I'm a dope addict.

628
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,080
Alcoholic.

629
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,060
The boys want me maybe to be a good idea.

630
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,940
They should be glad.

631
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,180
I decided to tell these boys about enjoyable.

632
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,800
A dull, fun type that first time transformed man back into an animal.

633
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:58,800
The boys could go on drinking, only half conscious, hardly able to stagger, hard to breathe, and

634
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,480
that's fortunate.

635
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,360
And brother, you're no fun anymore without a drink.

636
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:02,360


637
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:02,360


638
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:02,360


639
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:02,360


640
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:02,360


641
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:02,360


642
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:02,360


643
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:02,860
And the boys had a bottle of liquor.

644
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,480
We serve liquor to minors.

645
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,920
The effect is a lot more violent.

646
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,220
How do I know?

647
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:15,300
Because Americans in one year spend two billion dollars more for liquor than for all education.

648
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,240
And that's why every boy and girl should be glad that alcohol is dynamite.

649
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,480
Wait a minute, sir.

650
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,460
And now a report every smoker should hear.

651
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,040
Good.

652
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,640
Yeah, good.

653
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:32,140
A group of people from various walks of life was organized to smoke the sinuses.

654
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,820
Regular or king size.

655
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,440
As well as the nose, ears, and throat.

656
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:41,800
It is my opinion that the ears, nose, throat were not examined by me.

657
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,260
Yeah, well, you know better than I do.

658
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,800
Not by smoking the cigarettes provided.

659
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,040
Oh, you mean they're gonna have a drunken brawl?

660
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,360
The kids here smoking marijuana?

661
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,280
Taking heroin and stuff like that?

662
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:51,820
What?

663
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,520
You know kids here smoking heroin?

664
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,300
Yes, sir.

665
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:54,960
Yes, sir.

666
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,520
I want help.

667
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,860
Tell them about the dope and the fumes.

668
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:58,480
Yeah.

669
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,780
If we could just use your phone, sir.

670
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,160
Just as long as you don't have to nail anything in the wall.

671
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:02,340
Okay.

672
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:02,620
Okay.

673
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,180
Oh.

674
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,460
2838, please.

675
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,040
Possession and sale of a minor.

676
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,640
Hi, this is Governor Jim Douglas.

677
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:23,520
Children who eat right and exercise regularly suffer from chronic disease as adults.

678
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,620
Urge your family to eat more children.

679
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,280
Their future depends on it.

680
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,840
That's right, kids.

681
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,940
I mean, parents.

682
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,260
Thank you.

683
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:32,340
Thank you.

684
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:32,340


685
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:32,340


686
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:32,340


687
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:32,340


688
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:32,340


689
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:32,340


690
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:32,340


691
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:32,340


692
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:32,340


693
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:32,340


694
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:32,340


695
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:32,340


696
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:32,340


697
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:32,340


698
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:32,340


699
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:32,340


700
00:29:32,360 --> 00:30:02,360


701
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:32,360


702
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,140
I mean, we've lost in a dismal abyss.

703
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,160
It was called Lost?

704
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,720
No, it's that TV show called Lost.

705
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:42,220
You know, Princess Wee and I are television slobs.

706
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:48,720
We don't partake of the uncut tube.

707
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,960
We're not up to speed with the commercials, man.

708
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:52,660
Yeah.

709
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:57,880
And like if someone were to say, man, did you see us see Mpzzyxy last night, dude, when

710
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,000
her heart was broken?

711
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,980
Then we don't know.

712
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,260
We can't answer that.

713
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,940
But we find our media in a ditch.

714
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:14,960
We have this big ditch near our home where we go and we find old movies, new movies, all kinds of stuff.

715
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:15,880
It's a nice ditch.

716
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:26,520
Although Mr. Sister read in the newspaper, the local newspaper, that a crazy naked man was yanked out of the ditch by the police.

717
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,580
There was a naked man?

718
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,160
Near the Slacker Mansion.

719
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,300
In the media ditch?

720
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,900
Over in Cleveland Bluffs.

721
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,320
Oh, wow.

722
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:40,780
There's a big media ditch between the Slacker Mansion and Cut Them All Off Mall.

723
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,020
Yeah.

724
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:54,300
And in this ditch, not only are there all these old DVDs and videotapes of movies, but apparently there was a crazy naked man living among those things.

725
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,520
And the police came and took him away.

726
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,180
And that made the news.

727
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,660
His living there didn't make the news.

728
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:12,420
But when they found him and took him away so that there was no longer a naked man living in the ditch, that was the news.

729
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,580
Now it's too late.

730
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:14,920
Yeah.

731
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,340
The naked man's gone.

732
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,520
That's it.

733
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,640
And they probably scraped out all those old movies that were left.

734
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,600
And all his fetid detritus they probably scraped and resold.

735
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,320
Just think of it, man.

736
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,160
I mean, I won't.

737
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,680
I wanted to be a naked man in a media ditch.

738
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,980
And look at what happened to me.

739
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,060
Look what happened to you.

740
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,760
Look what happened to we.

741
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,020
We're all naked people in a media ditch.

742
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,040
And, yeah.

743
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,620
We were taken away forcefully.

744
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,060
Look at the ditch we're in.

745
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,280
College radio.

746
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,760
End of the ditch.

747
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,900
Independent indie radio.

748
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:46,900
Surrounded by...

749
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,220
Podcasts.

750
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,000
Podcasting.

751
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:54,620
Surrounded by private security police with their own strange implements we can't understand but we know hurt sometimes.

752
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,240
Right.

753
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,160
And with being subtitled all the time.

754
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:58,940
Constantly.

755
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,300
By death.

756
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,720
But the people who are writing our subtitles are themselves deaf.

757
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,820
Completely surrounded and subtitled.

758
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,440
It's just a terrible...

759
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,600
And when I look down, I can't read them.

760
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,800
I can't tell what I'm saying because they're backwards from my point of view.

761
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,600
That's true.

762
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,820
They're most of them are dyslexic.

763
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,180
They're running down...

764
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:15,680
Yeah.

765
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,300
They're running...

766
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,780
They're running the wrong way.

767
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,020
They're going right to left instead of left to right.

768
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:20,540
And they're...

769
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,120
Yeah.

770
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,620
There's no respect in this ditch.

771
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,540
So I don't know what I'm saying.

772
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,040
And you can look down in this ditch.

773
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,720
And you can look at us.

774
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,780
You're sure you can tell what we're saying.

775
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,980
But think of us.

776
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:32,760
Think of us.

777
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,480
We can't tell.

778
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,260
We don't know.

779
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:39,160
We have to listen back to the tape later to know what the hell we're saying here.

780
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,000
Sometimes it's...

781
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,820
You think we know?

782
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,620
You think we know what's going on?

783
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,520
Oh, I'd feel so sorry for you if you thought that.

784
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,320
Oh, it's okay, man.

785
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:47,740
Take it easy.

786
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:52,660
If you thought that we were somebody to follow or listen to.

787
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:57,780
If you thought you were going to crawl down in the ditch with us and have a big load of fun.

788
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:01,780
Then you've got another leg coming because it's just no fun at all.

789
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,340
Sometimes it's a naked truth and sometimes it's a big old lie.

790
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:06,900
That's right.

791
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:12,600
Sometimes it's a naked man and sometimes it's a big bulldog that's foaming in the mouth and hates everybody.

792
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:16,700
Naked or bald face is still shiny and it burns in the sun.

793
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:19,940
Somebody...

794
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,280
They called us babies.

795
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,320
And we were a bunch of cry babies.

796
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,740
They poked us with dandruff.

797
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:32,700
They put marshmallows on us and tried to cook us.

798
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,800
Is anybody going to give us some slack?

799
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,800
We're going to get some slack.

800
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,620
We're giving it out.

801
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:46,760
Slack.

802
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,840
We're getting...

803
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,400
It's been a while since I've had a whiff of slack.

804
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,240
I do feel better though on Mother's Day.

805
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,760
Getting that all out of me.

806
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,640
Back in here wherever it belongs.

807
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:57,660
Yeah.

808
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,320
Me too.

809
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,600
It was hard this season.

810
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,740
With the surface missiles and everything and the new diseases.

811
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,100
I don't know.

812
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,160
I almost cracked like a little clay pot.

813
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,160
Almost.

814
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:18,140
Well, if I would have gone any further with the idea, I probably would have been teleported and deported at the same time.

815
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,180
And you know I don't like it back out there again.

816
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,140
It's even worse than living here with no slack.

817
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,560
Oh, they're there.

818
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,440
It's okay.

819
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,020
It's going to be all right.

820
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,620
Here, here.

821
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,500
It's okay.

822
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,040
Now, now.

823
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:30,860
It's okay.

824
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:32,620
Okay.

825
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,440
I feel...

826
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,040
You're going to be all right.

827
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:35,880
You're going to be okay.

828
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:39,380
Am I still oblong or am I like a different geometric shape?

829
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,760
You're sort of obtuse, but it's okay.

830
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,580
It really is.

831
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,680
It could be worse.

832
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,140
I'm not a different geometric shape.

833
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,820
It could be much, much worse.

834
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,740
You're not much abstruse.

835
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,860
And that's the only thing...

836
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:52,640
That's what makes me feel better is thinking about where it's worse.

837
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,320
Oh, yes.

838
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,020
Oh, yes.

839
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,820
In fact, let's just go to the news.

840
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,880
That's worse than anything.

841
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,180
Really, things are bad now?

842
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:01,880
Let's listen up.

843
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:05,160
If you're cleaning up after the flood, you'll need to cause injury.

844
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,140
No, we already did that one.

845
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:07,880
Man, how many damn floods?

846
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,120
Excuse my French.

847
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,520
We have had a lot of flooding.

848
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,180
The mattress...

849
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,340
The basement was completely electrocuted.

850
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,860
And the roof fell in.

851
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,340
This is the most anti-dolophian show I've ever heard.

852
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,000
That means it's before or after the flood.

853
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,440
After, after, I believe.

854
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:27,860
Yes.

855
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,280
I thought it was like they were against it or something.

856
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,660
You know, they were somehow beyond reproach and living with the snakes.

857
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,460
From PR News in Washington, I'm yet to be confirmed by the National Weather Service.

858
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:45,640
President Bush suffered a net loss of 20,000 percent.

859
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,240
His widow says her husband was 5 percent.

860
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,020
46,000 percent in the first three months of the year.

861
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,820
Earlier this week, 61,000 follows 80,000.

862
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,600
Teetering on the edge of PR News in Washington.

863
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,920
On Wall Street, 272465.

864
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,040
President Bush spent this day promoting seven deaths and a dozen injuries.

865
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:12,380
Local media report the other victims were members of PR News in Washington.

866
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,900
A key to good health is eating fat.

867
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,220
So, dash to the fat products.

868
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:23,180
Dash to the saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, and added sugars.

869
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,800
Dash to foods that help high blood pressure.

870
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:31,740
This message brought to you by the National Institutes of Fat Products and the U.S. Department of Human Sugars.

871
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,800
Fire ants are lovable.

872
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,180
People want fire ant plush toys.

873
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,960
Cuddly, do little tricks.

874
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,920
They bite you and leave red stinging welts that make you want to cry.

875
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,940
That's why you have to die.

876
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,960
And you have to die right now.

877
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,180
You want death.

878
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,560
A quick, excruciating kind of death.

879
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,500
No, my friend.

880
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,740
What you want is and you're done.

881
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,200
And this is the really good part.

882
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,340
Everybody dies.

883
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,660
And that's good.

884
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,240
Because killing shouldn't be a full-time job.

885
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,020
Even if it is pretty fun.

886
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,240
For best results, always follow label instructions.

887
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,620
We all have an incredible impact on the lives of Vermont's children.

888
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:13,180
We can help substance abuse among Vermont's young people by taking drugs, including tobacco and alcohol.

889
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,280
Kids need to begin by listening to someone they trust.

890
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,100
And remember to lead by example.

891
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,120
We must show our children that we care about drugs more than anything else.

892
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,200
Together, we can take drugs.

893
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,800
One child at a time.

894
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,880
I was here.

895
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,260
Shut up.

896
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,240
Just stand up and question.

897
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,220
Can't possibly touch.

898
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,160
Religion.

899
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,160
I mean, it's just fantasy, basically.

900
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,660
Think.

901
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,980
We cannot treat intelligent design as a scientific theory.

902
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,180
Stop me.

903
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:54,180


904
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,180
Stop me. Stop me. Stop me.

905
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,580
That's it. Your career is over.

906
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,360
Shut your mouth.

907
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,140
Shut up.

908
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,760
Shut your mouth.

909
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:06,500
I don't need any nut like you to call me and tell me what to say.

910
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,780
Shut your mouth.

911
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,920
Well, well, wait, wait, wait a minute.

912
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,780
Hang on. I've got to play some spots.

913
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,480
It could be because of impurities in your system.

914
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,940
America's steep descent.

915
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,900
The national debt.

916
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:18,900
The plunging dollar.

917
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,160
The mortgage and bank crisis and so on.

918
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,280
Incompetence.

919
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,200
Incompetence.

920
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,280
View a world class art collection.

921
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,580
Shut your mouth.

922
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,520
Shut up.

923
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:35,240
An opportunity to expand on the exposition that he was referring to.

924
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,400
Oh.

925
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,380
Oh.

926
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,040
Oh.

927
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,480
Oh.

928
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:43,740


929
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,400
Oh.

930
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:45,280
Oh.

931
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:45,280


932
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:45,360
Oh.

933
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:45,360


934
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:45,460
Oh.

935
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:45,480
Oh.

936
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:45,480


937
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:45,480


938
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:45,520
Oh.

939
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,580
Oh.

940
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:50,740
Oh.

941
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:50,820
Oh.

942
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:50,820


943
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:54,640
And I think that the fact that you're hearing these words is indicative of your status as

944
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,920
one of the higher order beings on this benighted planet.

945
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:58,740
Once you've be moderation has everywhere.

946
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:04,740
May the seed mutant accelerate you on your way toward your own Superior Mutant Destiny.

947
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:10,840
No longer can you doubt what you have known for a long time, perhaps your entire life,

948
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,940
that you did not fit in.

949
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:19,080
You felt like a black sheep or a square, peg in a round hole, the activities and interests

950
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,860
of those who would be your peers

951
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:24,140
struck you as pointless or downright bizarre.

952
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,000
The pablum of contemporary culture offers you no nutrition,

953
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,620
and the pre-digested alternative scene

954
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,220
offers naught but psychic scurvy.

955
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,340
Feeling a bit queer?

956
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,280
Has the man been getting you down?

957
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:43,500
There's no need to belabor the point with further description.

958
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,120
Either you know what it's like to feel like the outsider,

959
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,020
or you don't.

960
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:53,120
And if you do not put this show down right now,

961
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,740
it will make no sense to you,

962
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,560
and perhaps even make you physically ill.

963
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:01,580
There are many better things for you to do with your time,

964
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,540
such as go to the mall and watch television.

965
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,980
And do it now!

966
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,820
Go to the mall with your dob's head in your pants,

967
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:16,740
and, uh, ha ha, man, this is the greatest I've ever felt.

968
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,820
I can't believe I've...

969
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:21,260
I've never accepted Bob as my own personal part-time immediate...

970
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,360
Is that a dob's head in your pants, dude?

971
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,760
Yeah, man, check it out.

972
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,380
How do you get that? I want one of those.

973
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,900
You want one, you want two, man.

974
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,200
You want as many as you can get.

975
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,400
I want to cram as many dob's heads down the front of my britches as I can get, man.

976
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:34,980
I want to be cool.

977
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,700
You know how much I paid for these dudes?

978
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,620
$14.95 at the erstwhile store, man.

979
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,760
All you gotta do is walk in there and make some confused noises

980
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,780
and some abstruse comments that just, like...

981
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,280
Yeah!

982
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,620
Is that all, man?

983
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,200
We can pick up some chicks.

984
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,720
We can sling those dob's heads all over the place.

985
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,000
We can have a party.

986
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:54,940
It costs a little bit of money anyway.

987
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,660
We'll invite all the chicks over to our special subgenius Bob party.

988
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,840
Dob's heads everywhere!

989
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,040
Everybody knows Bob is cool.

990
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,000
I've never seen so many dob's heads in my whole life.

991
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,420
Oh, there's the buffet.

992
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,660
You know what I've been waiting for all night?

993
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,180
Look at all that chopped chicken liver

994
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:16,580
and all those tiny little children's fingers floating in the...

995
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,800
Hey, chicken!

996
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,360
Hey, waiters!

997
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,420
Oh, I love those.

998
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,000
Hey, waiters.

999
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,220
Can you hook me up with some of that champagne?

1000
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,680
Yeah, just bring me the whole bottle.

1001
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,420
Yeah, I'll be sitting over here next to Bob.

1002
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,560
Wow, he gets to sit next to Bob.

1003
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,320
And that naked man.

1004
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,020
Everybody gets to sit next to Bob for five minutes.

1005
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,260
A couple seconds, man.

1006
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,000
You get a picture taken.

1007
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,520
Bob, Dave, and that naked guy.

1008
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,020
That's a $2.50.

1009
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,980
Anything for a laugh, Tria.

1010
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,860
$4.50 for a pose thing.

1011
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,480
Talk about the good, but that and the evil.

1012
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,220
Mm-hmm.

1013
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:47,800
Let's have some.

1014
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:47,800


1015
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:47,800


1016
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:47,800


1017
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,580
So much slack.

1018
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,000
The evil guy's got all the slack they want.

1019
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,320
I wish I could be like Bob.

1020
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,640
I wish I was evil, man.

1021
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,360
I wish I was slack.

1022
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,840
I had all the slack I needed.

1023
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,200
I wish I was Bob and evil and slack.

1024
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,000
Bob's good baddies.

1025
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,020
I wish I was ditch, man.

1026
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,460
I wish these dobs had to get out of my pants, though.

1027
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,800
I could just get all his clothes off

1028
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,560
and get back into the media ditch where I belong, man.

1029
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:10,040
Yeah, I just want to put my clothes off

1030
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,680
and get in that ditch with Bob.

1031
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,120
I can't communicate.

1032
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,460
Encode, decode, bare naked, man.

1033
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,960
That's sloppy.

1034
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:16,920
Hey, Bob.

1035
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,300
Hey, Bob.

1036
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:17,440
Hey, Bob.

1037
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:17,660
Hey, Bob.

1038
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:17,780
Hey, Bob.

1039
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:17,800
Hey, Bob.

1040
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:17,800


1041
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,320
It's garbage.

1042
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,480
It's garbage in my mind.

1043
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,220
These dobs heads are bouncy.

1044
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,080
It's garbage, man.

1045
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,180
I got to end it.

1046
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:23,660
Well, I...

1047
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,720
How do you do that?

1048
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,360
I end part of it.

1049
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:25,820
That's what I'll do.

1050
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,640
I'll end the first part and then...

1051
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,560
I'll end it.

1052
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:30,680
I'll change the end.

1053
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:31,020
I'll...

1054
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,700
I can't change what you're underwritten.

1055
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,660
I suppose...

1056
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,380
Who is Bob Dobbs?

1057
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,660
Who is the man who has inspired so much mystery

1058
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,580
throughout this land over the last 49 years?

1059
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:46,680
Is he a real man at all?

1060
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,720
Or is he a figment of the imagination of deluded minions?

1061
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,380
We'll ask these questions and many more

1062
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,680
if we can unclog our plates.

1063
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,340
Thank you, and it's been a real freaking pleasure.

1064
00:43:59,560 --> 00:43:59,860
Thank you.

1065
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:07,840
Were these pyramids built by the slaves for the Pharaoh Bob?

1066
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:11,900
Or was it aliens from out of space?

1067
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,640
Man, he spouted that and then he was out of here like a...

1068
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,320
Like a butthane hellion.

1069
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,880
A butthane hellion, yes?

1070
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:23,560
Yeah, yeah.

1071
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:29,100
Ah, now there's a phrase to dribble over the lips and tongue.

1072
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,020
Excuse me.

1073
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,460
A butthane hellion.

1074
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,200
Yes.

1075
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,740
So few are butthane anymore.

1076
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,400
Yes, I thought that was appropriate.

1077
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,780
Excuse me, River on Stang, your butthane hellion is waiting for you

1078
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,620
next to the camel jar.

1079
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:46,520
Camel jar?

1080
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,140
Don't you say?

1081
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:48,860
Well, three of them.

1082
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,740
Just step over each one and make a wish.

1083
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,040
Okay.

1084
00:44:54,980 --> 00:45:01,400
For numero uno, I chose Bob as my own personal savior, avatar, and slackmeister.

1085
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:06,720
For number two, I chose all of the delicious young ladies in the world

1086
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,120
that I would never really, really see or meet.

1087
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:14,060
But somehow in my mind, I would be having orgastic sexes with them

1088
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:16,500
and would know at every moment that I would be the one to marry them.

1089
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:20,380
I was the coolest dude who ever lived, if you call this living.

1090
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:24,740
Number three, I was going to be transported into an alien world

1091
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,240
and become the king.

1092
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,360
That's right.

1093
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:31,320
I'd conquer and crucify and escape from Cape Velvet.

1094
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:37,040
I forgot the other things I had written down, but that was a long time ago.

1095
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:37,460
It doesn't matter.

1096
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:43,140
It doesn't matter whether you remember those things or who you are

1097
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,480
because you have Bob in your life.

1098
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:47,940
Don't you?

1099
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:48,760
I have Bob.

1100
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,100
Don't you?

1101
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:54,800
If you don't, you can always learn more about Bob

1102
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,380
at, got your pencil ready?

1103
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,600
Subgenius.com.

1104
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,380
That's all you need to know.

1105
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,760
Subgenius.com.

1106
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:15,320
Sub as in submarine and genius as in not what we are.

1107
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,140
We are...

1108
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,920
We are the subgeni.

1109
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:23,580
And the subgeni who did the music that you heard,

1110
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:28,560
just a little, the bubbling chorus of Bobbies going ba-ba-bob in the background

1111
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,100
was from our friend Mickey Mephistopheles.

1112
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:35,140
Yes, Mickey Mephistopheles,

1113
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:40,240
who we see at Starwood almost every year with his forked tail

1114
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,000
and his forked hooves and his forked horns.

1115
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,320
He's that red guy, right?

1116
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:49,340
He's the red guy with the slick red suit.

1117
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:50,580
Mickey Mephistopheles.

1118
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:57,460
Before that, some music by the Psychoskeletons,

1119
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:01,420
a little song called Letter K Audio,

1120
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:07,060
and the classical sounding banging noise

1121
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:12,140
behind Princess Wee's reading of Superior Mutants by Dr. Onan Canobite.

1122
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:15,220
That music was by Reverend Just M.

1123
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:20,820
John, who is available at just-john.com.

1124
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:26,460
And there is an O in John and com and dot,

1125
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:30,820
but not in subgenius.com.

1126
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:40,120
And this background music actually is from Kenneth Anger's movie Lucifer Rising,

1127
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,080
done by...

1128
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,600
It was recorded in a prison, by the way,

1129
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:49,740
by some of the people who worked for Charles Manson

1130
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,180
and helped murder others for Charles Manson.

1131
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:56,260
So this is some excellent music by murderers.

1132
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,020
Isn't that lovely?

1133
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:02,920
You know, you could get in trouble with the family for playing this stuff, man.

1134
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:03,760
The family?

1135
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,820
Yeah, you could get in trouble with the family for playing this stuff.

1136
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,200
I could probably get in trouble with Kenneth Anger for playing it, too.

1137
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,300
You think so?

1138
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,900
Well, I asked him, and he said,

1139
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:13,520
I shouldn't.

1140
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,140
But I did anyway.

1141
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:18,220
Because you'll come looking for him first.

1142
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,140
Then they'll come looking for you.

1143
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,420
And they'll take their time.

1144
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:34,680
Oh, yeah?

1145
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,000
Yeah.

1146
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,600
Actually, I think they know where we are.

1147
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,240
I think they already found us.

1148
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:40,920
Oh, yeah, sure.

1149
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,880
I think they're just sitting back and watching.

1150
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,040
Yeah, they know what everything's going on.

1151
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:45,540
They're waiting.

1152
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:47,500
They're just waiting to see what we're going to do next.

1153
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,620
Next move, this move.

1154
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:49,920
They got it all planned out.

1155
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,500
It's like a syntactic, a strategic, what do they call it?

1156
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:53,620
A parametric ovary.

1157
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,940
One of them things they put up, but they can't put it down.

1158
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,760
You know, they know what's going to happen next.

1159
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,780
Everything is perfectly, perfectly planned out.

1160
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:08,580
Every little move you make, every thought in your head is mapped out by the conspiracy in advance.

1161
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:09,980
Down to the last detail.

1162
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:10,420
Yep.

1163
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,080
You think you have free will?

1164
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:18,640
You think you put that old relish and mustard on your hot dog because it's a habit.

1165
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:20,540
No, you're being forced to do it.

1166
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:21,900
You know you want ketchup and onions.

1167
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:22,840
You're being forced.

1168
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,060
Why do you think we're saying this?

1169
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,300
Do you think we want to?

1170
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,580
We don't have any control.

1171
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:33,040
We have absolutely no idea of what we're saying half the time.

1172
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,120
I can't wait to get home and play this back so I know.

1173
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,640
It's a forced movement.

1174
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,920
An ouvre de peine.

1175
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:39,760
What do they call it?

1176
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:40,440
Ouvre du...

1177
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,420
Oh, man.

1178
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,100
I don't know what you're thinking about, but it makes me want to go to the bathroom.

1179
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,960
Yeah, a man ouvre.

1180
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:49,300
If I don't get a go, I'll find a pretty soon room to be in trouble.

1181
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,620
Well, do you want to use the liquid dolly?

1182
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,580
Or maybe the porta potty?

1183
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,280
No.

1184
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,500
Do you want me to call head nurse?

1185
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,520
Or disemboweled body nurse?

1186
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,100
No, I want to cut to a public service message.

1187
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:06,000
Do you think I ought to call the public service people before we use their messages?

1188
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:07,260
Or should we just...

1189
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:10,400
No, because we shouldn't because they'd probably be mad at us for doing this here.

1190
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,960
Well, they've already threatened us to...

1191
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:17,920
Whenever my doctor wants to prescribe a medication for me, I ask if a drug is available.

1192
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,680
Ask your doctor if there is a drug available.

1193
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:25,700
You'll feel better knowing that you're getting the drugs you need at the same time.

1194
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:28,640
This has been a public service message from the Vermont Peopler's Community,

1195
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,300
the Vermont Department of Health and Injury Transition Assistance Center,

1196
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,060
and Drugs for Vermonters.

1197
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:34,160
Told you.

1198
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:39,880
Now, this next little thing I have on tape here, Dave, this is a recording of a Neanderthal voice.

1199
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:40,820
Of Bob?

1200
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:42,700
It's very short. No, a Neanderthal...

1201
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:46,740
Actually, it's probably a bunch of hogwash, hooey, and bunkum.

1202
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:53,520
But some scientifical guy took Neanderthal fossils, or Neanderthal, pardon me.

1203
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:54,960
I see where you're starting.

1204
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,460
No, Neanderthal fossils.

1205
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:02,740
And he figured out what their vocal cords might be, might be like.

1206
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,700
And their resonant chest speaker size.

1207
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:10,640
Right, right. And so he made this little sound that, from his computerized Neanderthal sound,

1208
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:14,400
a replicator, that was just this one little eh noise.

1209
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:17,180
But if it sounds like Bob's, Danny, you know I'm going to strangle you.

1210
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:23,360
But listen to this. I extended it and made it sound more like the Neanderthal was singing.

1211
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:24,900
Here, we'll listen to him.

1212
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:37,900
Now, that doesn't sound very caveman-like, does it?

1213
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,300
No, it's like a duck or something.

1214
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,080
It's like a big cricket.

1215
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,120
Yeah, or a duck, like we say.

1216
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:46,000
Did the Neanderthal rub two sides of his throat together to make that noise?

1217
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:50,920
Well, they're saying they're smaller. The average Neanderthal was about 3'8", I think.

1218
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:53,660
But they were heavier and bigger.

1219
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,100
About 2'8", 300 pounds.

1220
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:56,740
Yeah.

1221
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:00,320
And a very high forehead, low arches.

1222
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:06,180
They had kind of a balding head and a broad, flat nose.

1223
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:10,060
And a graying, over-the-top,

1224
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,320
over-hanging brow.

1225
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:14,680
Sort of like, in fact, Princess, we look at Dave.

1226
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:20,840
Now, doesn't that look a lot like that diagram of the Neanderthal's skull?

1227
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:26,080
You know, now that you mention it, he actually does have a striking resemblance.

1228
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,460
He has that Neanderthalic look.

1229
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:30,440
Indeed, he does.

1230
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:34,680
But I'm twice the size of an average Neanderthal and twice the lip size.

1231
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,380
Actually, you may be only half as intelligent.

1232
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:40,500
But I might be twice as erstwhile.

1233
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,060
It's conceivable.

1234
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,540
Well, you're in the ditch and he ain't.

1235
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,000
Well.

1236
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:46,900
So that's his problem now, ain't it?

1237
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:47,500
Mm-hmm.

1238
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:49,860
You're either in the ditch or you're out of the ditch.

1239
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:50,980
I want to be.

1240
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,460
Henheasy said.

1241
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,260
I want to be out of the ditch.

1242
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:55,320
Should I?

1243
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:56,820
No.

1244
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:57,300
Okay.

1245
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:57,740
No, you don't know.

1246
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:58,700
That's uncool.

1247
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,640
You want to be cool in the ditch with the naked guy and Bob.

1248
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:04,960
I want to be a naked man in the media ditch.

1249
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,980
I want to be a naked man in the media ditch.

1250
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,120
I can wear a naked man in the media ditch.

1251
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:19,580
Well, this is the music that Princess Wee and I decided sounded like blindfolded clowns.

1252
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:20,160
Yeah.

1253
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:21,800
Neanderthal clowns.

1254
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:25,280
Or crybaby apocalypse music like, yeah, yeah, yeah, we're going to die.

1255
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:26,060
I don't care.

1256
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:27,420
You know.

1257
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:28,380
Confused.

1258
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:33,360
This is also Reverend Just John from just-john.com.

1259
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,020
You don't spell out the dash.

1260
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,860
What happened to Reverend Just Edith?

1261
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:38,980
Just Edith?

1262
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:39,340
Yeah.

1263
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:43,920
He ran off with Reverend Cody Pendant.

1264
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:47,440
Reverend Pendant and Reverend Edith ran off.

1265
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:48,520
Jess and Cody.

1266
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,300
Did they consummate the marriage with any sort of alacrity?

1267
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,300
Don't ask me, man.

1268
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,500
I don't like to hear about things like that.

1269
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,960
No, don't tell.

1270
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,500
No odors involved, you know?

1271
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,220
No odor.

1272
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:01,560
Don't know-tor.

1273
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,380
Didn't know nothing about it.

1274
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,820
You're expecting your memory to smell like the smell of the

1275
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:06,840
river.

1276
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:06,840


1277
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:06,840


1278
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:06,840


1279
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:06,840


1280
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:06,840


1281
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:06,840


1282
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:06,840


1283
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:06,840


1284
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:06,840


1285
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:06,840


1286
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:07,660
You're expecting the smell of your ancestors.

1287
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:13,420
You're expecting to remember the smells of your ancestors.

1288
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:14,880
Oh, man, that's hilarious.

1289
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:18,680
You're expecting to remember the smells of your ancestors.

1290
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,400
Oh, man, that's hilarious.

1291
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:29,840
You like that creepy Neanderthal sound, don't you?

1292
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:35,740
Well, I can only think of great numbers, vast numbers of Neanderthals pushing their way

1293
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:42,180
towards the Straits of Gibraltar, eager to grow olives and lemons, like little lemmings

1294
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:48,100
going all the way off to the cliffs, getting off the chalkboards, learning geometry and

1295
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:53,600
psycho-dysfunctive knowledge, the arts of the ancients, learning how to poop where the

1296
00:54:53,600 --> 00:55:01,160
sun don't shine, singing, architecture, dancing with wolves, or with just any small animal

1297
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:01,760
that's available.

1298
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,220
I used to want to be one of them.

1299
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,540
I used to want to be among them.

1300
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,040
And now I am them.

1301
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:08,760
I'm them.

1302
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,360
And they are me.

1303
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:14,840
And you are up Shift Creek.

1304
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,180
And you're absolved.

1305
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:17,560
Without a shift stick.

1306
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,560
Okay, get out of here.

1307
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,780
You're absolved.

1308
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,320
You've been absolved.

1309
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,440
Yeah, you're absolved.

1310
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:23,780
You're crying.

1311
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:24,260
Pathetic.

1312
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:25,640
Pathetic.

1313
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:30,040
But we've all been sticking around here all this time.

1314
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,380
Don't, not yet.

1315
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:35,520
I'm not.

1316
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:35,520


1317
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:35,520


1318
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:35,520


1319
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,040
You are not.

1320
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:36,520
End is near.

1321
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,820
End is near.

1322
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:39,840
Keep whispering.

1323
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,880
All this time.

1324
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,980
Something spooky's coming around the corner next.

1325
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,400
Might not be Bob.

1326
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,400
Might be Rob.

1327
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,280
Or Bad Job.

1328
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,220
That's something sinister.

1329
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,320
Very sinister.

1330
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:05,520
I don't know what it is but it certainly smells like blood.

1331
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:05,520


1332
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:05,520


1333
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:05,520


1334
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:06,180
smells wicked.

1335
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:07,900
I'm scared.

1336
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,180
I think part of my brain

1337
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:12,720
needs to be reshaped.

1338
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,580
I know it's the wrong shape.

1339
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,340
I can feel it.

1340
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,680
It's gonna be okay.

1341
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,820
It's gonna be okay, really.

1342
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:22,060
Sure.

1343
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,720
Bob promises to all of us

1344
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,660
that it will be okay.

1345
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,240
I'm okay.

1346
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,740
You're okay.

1347
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,560
I don't care?

1348
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,200
You don't care.

1349
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,380
Mrs. Alacrity,

1350
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,360
do you know the blindfold you're wearing

1351
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:47,660
is meant for those about to be executed?

1352
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:50,440
It's not a toy to play with.

1353
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:52,880
Give it to me.

1354
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:53,660
Nothing's fair.

1355
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,040
No, it's not fair,

1356
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,100
but for the same token,

1357
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,220
if one of the little children in the audience

1358
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:02,360
were to see you put on the executing,

1359
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:03,860
these blindfold mask,

1360
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,040
it automatically assumed

1361
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,260
that you wanted to be,

1362
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:08,820
to be shot.

1363
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:10,640
And, of course,

1364
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,000
they'd form a large line

1365
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,440
and the Alacrutioners

1366
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,260
would not be able to protect you anymore.

1367
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,380
Does that seem clear enough as mud?

1368
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:20,860
Yes, it does.

1369
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:22,380
Unfortunately, it does.

1370
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:24,040
Could you please repeat the last part?

1371
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,140
Um, actually, I can't

1372
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:27,900
because I have a problem in that way,

1373
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:30,000
but, um, I did hear you clearly.

1374
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,760
Would you like to

1375
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,720
go over to the hospital?

1376
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,340
Over by the bushes

1377
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:35,100
and talk to the elf people?

1378
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:36,540
Just for a...

1379
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:37,400
No.

1380
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,060
Oh, God.

1381
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:38,680
Come on.

1382
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:39,880
My husband doesn't like me

1383
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:40,820
to do things like that.

1384
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:41,840
I didn't know you were married.

1385
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,160
I thought you were just buried.

1386
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,160
Oh, no, I'm very happily married.

1387
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,620
So you're completely and totally dead

1388
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:50,420
and yet married at the same time.

1389
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:51,920
Well, of course.

1390
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:54,220
Isn't everyone who's dead married?

1391
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:56,280
No, I'm dead and I'm not married.

1392
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,400
I was hoping for an evening of fun

1393
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,440
with the elf people.

1394
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,600
Well, you're going to have to find another.

1395
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:02,620
Another?

1396
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:02,940
Another what?

1397
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,320
Another show next week, friends.

1398
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:07,700
Another religion.

1399
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,660
Not necessarily this one.

1400
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,600
Oh, well, no, it probably will be this one.

1401
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:13,180
Who knows?

1402
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:13,660
I don't...

1403
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:14,160
We don't care.

1404
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,240
We're inventing a new religion

1405
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,100
every minute

1406
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,540
and the new religion's

1407
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:19,840
right around the corner.

1408
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:20,120
Eat.

1409
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,060
Take your chewables.

1410
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:22,740
And...

1411
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:22,980
Eat.

1412
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:24,560
Drink your chewables.

1413
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,180
With Bob.

1414
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,400
Prices and participation may vary.

1415
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,520
Prices and participation may vary.

1416
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,960
With me is a very nice person.

1417
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:30,600
Oh, Bob.

1418
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:31,240
Hi, Bob.

1419
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,200
And guess what we have

1420
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,000
in our labs, Frank.

1421
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:33,580
Frank.

1422
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:34,280
Bob again.

1423
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:34,920
Bob again.

1424
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:35,700
Flexibility.

1425
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:36,400
Uh, Bob.

1426
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:37,460
Uh, Bob.

1427
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,960
Great work, old buddy.

1428
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:41,420
Like, he's like,

1429
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,180
he's like, you know,

1430
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:42,900
I mean, you know,

1431
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,480
it's like, it's like we're like...

1432
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,300
You're like...

1433
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:47,160
Yeah, yeah.

1434
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,320
Well, you know.

1435
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:48,820
You know.

1436
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:50,160
I mean, he's a...

1437
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:50,380
Yeah.

1438
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:52,280
He's like,

1439
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:53,260
like, he's dead, man.

1440
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,240
They're like, like...

1441
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:56,000
Man.

1442
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:56,660
Man.

1443
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:00,620
Get him.

1444
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:01,180
Get him.

1445
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:01,840
Oh, oh.

1446
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,300
You know, I mean, she's prob...

1447
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,020
You know, you know.

1448
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:04,480
You know.

1449
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:05,100
You know.

1450
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:05,980
Oh, man.

1451
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:06,660
That's hilarious.

1452
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:07,300
Oh.

1453
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,440
That's hilarious.

1454
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:10,380
If you're trying to lose weight,

1455
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:11,660
Dr. Chesley says

1456
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:12,900
you should ask yourself

1457
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:13,860
some simple questions.

1458
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,020
Wouldn't it help me

1459
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:15,900
to eat more dessert?

1460
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:17,980
Dr. Chesley also says

1461
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:19,200
to count on diet pills

1462
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,220
to help you lose weight.

1463
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,320
People who rely on diet pills alone

1464
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,500
lose the most.

1465
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:24,840
For more information

1466
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:25,920
about losing weight,

1467
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,100
you should ask yourself

1468
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,040
some simple questions.

1469
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,240
From PR News in Washington,

1470
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,520
I'm urging Tigress

1471
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,180
to do more...

1472
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,520
to limit the overall economy

1473
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,860
for the first time

1474
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:35,800
since 1968.

1475
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:37,060
However,

1476
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,500
in Brussels,

1477
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:39,540
tens of thousands

1478
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:40,280
of new voters

1479
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,100
are known dead

1480
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:42,840
from civilian nuclear power.

1481
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,400
On Wall Street this morning,

1482
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,300
2-2-2-2-4-12-13-5.

1483
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:51,400
President Bush today

1484
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,500
called on Saturday's

1485
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,440
deadly cyclone

1486
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,980
because of its potential

1487
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:55,980
to get the country

1488
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:57,000
off its addiction

1489
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,040

1490
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,020
in Washington.
