1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,820
Freedom and justice and equality.

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,540
10-8 on the air and standing by.

3
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,600
Why don't you put your clothes on? The show's over.

4
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,800
The show's over.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,180
Relax, relax, relax, relax, relax.

6
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,560
Yeah!

7
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,200
Back into the show.

8
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,900
Time to begin to worry about side eight of 90-minute tape.

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,160
And now, the subgenius.

10
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,060
Our world.

11
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,360
What?

12
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,080
In the world of the wild,

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,760
X-Men turn on.

14
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,460
Yeah!

15
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,740
Take those, take those, take those!

16
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,980
Take them, dodge them!

17
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,360
Oh, yes!

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,500
No defense for Pilgrim's Throne!

19
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,260
It's very hard!

20
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,960
What the hell do you think you're doing?

21
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,480
I always wanted to do that.

22
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,040
Oh, friends, open your heart, close your mind, unzip your lips,

23
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,820
and bend over because here comes the word of B-B-B-B-B-Bob!

24
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,180
Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level like the CIA does.

25
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,640
Now, we're through the looking glass here, people.

26
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,200
White is black, and black is white.

27
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,980
What are we doing?

28
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,240
What are we doing with the money?

30
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,300
Well, obviously, we're spending.

31
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,700
We're paying a huge, huge staff salary.

32
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:41,540
I mean, more like yesterday, there was a huge box of money.

33
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,620
She says, look, Bob, it was so good to look at that.

34
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,020
And I used to get my dozer till the band's music stopped.

35
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,820
Then the light, it showed me finally, yeah, that's right, we are a wild dog.

36
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,600
Now we're all edge, we're lost in thought.

37
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,080
It's my wife and I'm gone.

38
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,240
With my heart for my money and my brain for my job,

39
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,980
I want to get my drink and I'm gone.

40
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:22,400
With your dear, dear host and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang.

41
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,980
Selfish, is that what they call me?

42
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,900
Well, I am.

43
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,580
I live by the law.

44
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:27,580


45
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,520
I have the judgment of my own mind and for my own sake.

46
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,120
Let them say what they please about you.

47
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,620
By the time you come to trial, no jury will convict you.

48
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,400
The public will think what I want them to think.

49
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:46,720
Presented to you by the Church of the Subgenius in the name of J.R. Bob Dobs.

50
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,040
It's unbelievable.

51
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,560
Do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here in Dallas?

52
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,060
There are people here who do not want me to tell the truth.

53
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,680
Do you want to imbibe the drug of the commonplace?

54
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,500
Will you be forever addicted to self-restriction?

55
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,220
Established orthodoxies and dogmas.

56
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,440
Conditioned interpretations of living.

57
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,800
Regard the material world as reality.

58
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,380
Hold on, honey.

59
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,840
I'm not accusing you of anything.

60
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,400
You're old enough to know right from wrong.

61
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,500
Your mother and I, we trust you.

62
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,920
But we know how it is.

63
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,960
All the pressure to be popular.

64
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,480
Everybody wants to be popular.

65
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,100
I know that.

66
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,200
I guess he's considered a popular man.

67
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,200


68
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,200


69
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,960
Pretty good catch.

70
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,480
Daddy, is there a point to all this?

71
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,440
At last I have control of your radio, too.

72
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,160
And I do, too.

73
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,100
Good.

74
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,620
This is Ren Hwack.

75
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,700
And this is Stimson J. Catt of the Ren and Stimpy Show.

76
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,760
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack on KNON.

77
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,200
Keep listening, you idiot.

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

79
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,220
Else I shall kill you.

80
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,180
He died pretty quick.

81
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,980
Either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.

82
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,720
Uh-huh.

83
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,840
And I assume if you've come this far, what I have to say interests you.

84
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,340
But I'm not going to name names that tell you who or what I represent.

85
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,420
Except to say you're close.

86
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,400
You're closer than you think.

87
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,300
Okay?

88
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,580
Right.

89
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,180
89.3 FM.

90
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,240
And it's now time for the Hour of Slack.

91
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,700
And it's not number 338 or 339 or anything like that.

92
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,420
No.

93
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,360
We have a live Hour of Slack tonight here.

94
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,220
It's number 343.

95
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,020
Is it really?

96
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:03,760
Yes, it is.

97
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,140
Because even though we're in Cleveland, oh, man, this is great.

98
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,800
We get to do the Hour of Slack in another town with other radio doctors.

99
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,260
While Reverend Gobi is here from Rochester.

100
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,160
And half of the cast and crew and the crew.

101
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,160


102
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:28,320
And assassins from the rant and rave show that was last night.

103
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:44,600
The Association for Consciousness Exploration and the Smart Bar presents the world's first rant and rave featuring the Reverend Ivan Stang of the True Troupe of Suntan and DJ remixers from the East and West Coast rave scenes.

104
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,140
Experience Bob Dobbs, the Messiah of Slack.

105
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,380
Through a continuous barrage of mind-altering videos.

106
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,160
Some genius gut blowout services.

107
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,540
Squirtatious light shows.

108
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,140
And driving rave music to dance your pants off from dusk till dawn.

109
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,300
Including world beat drummers repercussion.

110
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,600
The Smart Bar will be transformed into a psychadelicatessen.

111
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,860
Where you can experience mind machines, multimedia environments, and a smorgasbord of sensual weirdness.

112
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,780
Plus, the marriage of Bob and Connie.

113
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,120
And the best part.

114
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:27,220
Not since the fall of Rome has the club world seen such writhing, wallowing tribal mutant decadence.

115
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,240
The ACDB Gobs.

116
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,000
It was last night that I bet you missed.

117
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,860
And we're gonna make you feel so bad.

118
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,180
Ninnies.

119
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,060
Yeah, this is gonna be the hour where we take away your slack.

120
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,780
Oh, how clever, my dear.

121
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,240
Yes, it is, isn't it?

122
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,840
We must do what we can for the cause.

123
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,180
So your wallet will be the bomb.

124
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,760
Yes, your wallet will be the bomb.

125
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,920
If you need some genius, not another sleeping slob.

126
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,220
Your wallet will be the bomb.

127
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,380
Hi, Bob.

128
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,820
Well, I believe I am much taller than the moon.

129
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:18,820


130
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:24,620
I believe we have Arnold Palmer sitting on the dashboard in my car.

131
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
Springtime.

132
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,760
Springtime.

133
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,560
Oh, what a lovely, lovely, lovely hand.

134
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,680
Oh.

135
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,700
Her wallet belongs to Sister Melody.

136
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,600
Dear friends,

137
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,160
Humph, man, this is a great job I've got.

138
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:00,300
I just have to stand here and gloat on what a fine damn job I've got.

139
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,920
Preaching to rooms full of drunk sinners.

140
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,160
What a kind of church.

141
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,920
Some of these other churches are damn cowardly.

142
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,680
They go into a church building where they know there's not going to be anything but

143
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,500
well-dressed pinks and believers preaching to the saved.

144
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,680
Finally, I get to see my children.

145
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,460
We're talking the sinner's language here, my friends.

146
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,020
We're talking the sinner's language here,

147
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,120
and what we're doing, basically, is tempting sinners.

148
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,220
We can tempt sinners better than the devil can.

149
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,500
We're tempting them away from the devil.

150
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,800
Now, where are we tempting them?

151
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,660
Where they go after that?

152
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,760
It's up to them, although Bob wouldn't be a bad stop on the way.

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,440
Listen, Bill, what a great job this is.

154
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:43,780
It is.

155
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:50,400
Well, for me, can you imagine being caressed by all those devil,

156
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,160
those half-naked devil gals on stage last night,

157
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,540
right in front of everybody, not to mention healing,

158
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,520
Connie Dobbs, or no, was it those?

159
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,060
And they applauded, and then they probably paid you, too.

160
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,420
Oh, yes, I was handsomely paid,

161
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,320
handsomely paid for total slack,

162
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,540
wallowing, wallowing in slack and ego boost

163
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:13,760
of what I was doing.

164
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:13,760


165
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,240
Of course, you know, standing in front of a bunch of people

166
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,500
and getting paid to holler at them

167
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,780
and tell them what idiots they are.

168
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,560
There's no place like my ego.

169
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,080
There's no place like my ego.

170
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,800
Oh.

171
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,040
But, uh, Reverend Cole,

172
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,420
before we get into introductions here,

173
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,060
I have, uh...

174
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,380
Well, this is probably not an unreasonable question.

175
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,600
Why did you pull a gun out and try to kill me last night?

176
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,740
I mean, I appreciate your terrible aim and everything,

177
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,420
and you seem so friendly afterwards.

178
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,980
Well, you know, I had eight shots.

179
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,320
You'd think I'd be able to do it.

180
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,440
Um...

181
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,300
I tried. I tried real hard.

182
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,540
Well, why?

183
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,800
Well, I...

184
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,840
What did I ever do to you?

185
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,040
Oh, you never did anything.

186
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,940
I was defending the honor of Chi-Chi Rodriguez last night,

187
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,700
and, um...

188
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,360
He's jealous about...

189
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,720
See, he's really jealous about all this Arnold Palmer stuff,

190
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,180
and, uh...

191
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,420
I see you have a little bleeding head replica.

192
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,460
Yeah, thanks, Pope Jimbo.

193
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,100
Yeah, bleeding head good.

194
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,740
And he said,

195
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,920
oh, so...

196
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,440
Oh, that's...

197
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,240
He's trying to...

198
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,180
Very bad.

199
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,460
Oh!

200
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,480
Um, yeah.

201
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,480
It wasn't a personal thing, Reverend Stang.

202
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,640
You gotta understand, uh...

203
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,440
You know...

204
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,600
Why not?

205
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,840
Why not try to assassinate Ivan Stang?

206
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,520
I mean, why did...

207
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,580
Why really did Lee Harvey Oswald try to...

208
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:30,720
Er...

209
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,220
Try?

210
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:31,600
Shoot!

211
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,760
John F. Kennedy.

212
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,500
Why not?

213
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,500
Look, we know Oswald didn't pull that trigger.

214
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,460
Castro did.

215
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,400
But if that comes out, there's gonna be a war, boy.

216
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,840
Millions of people are gonna die.

217
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,320
And that's a hell of a lot more.

218
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,480
That's more important than Jim Garrison.

219
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:44,920
I...

220
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,220
I...

221
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,620
I can't say I haven't been saying,

222
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,940
or kill me.

223
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,540
This is true, too.

224
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,920
But, I mean,

225
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,300
isn't it more appropriate to kill Bob?

226
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,800
Well, didn't...

227
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,320
Of course, on the other hand,

228
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,560
there was a certain amount of competition last night.

229
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,880
Jesus was running around at the smart bar last night

230
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,180
with a handgun.

231
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,060
Yes, he was.

232
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,700
And a wound in his side,

233
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,020
and a crown of thorns,

234
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,080
a loincloth,

235
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,860
and a handgun.

236
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,160
He was looking for Bob.

237
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:13,560
Bob.

238
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,240
Only in this town, I tell you.

239
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,960
People who are in the audience probably saw Jesus

240
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,640
running around very...

241
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,100
He was thrifting everybody.

242
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,480
Well, he was bumming drinks, too.

243
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,360
He got a dollar...

244
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:22,660
He was real upset.

245
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,000
He was real upset.

246
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,880
If you see him running around town,

247
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,020
you be on the lookout.

248
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,360
He wants his believers back.

249
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,720
He got a dollar from my wife.

250
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,720
He got a dollar from Shannon for a beer.

251
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,560
And then he got the most expensive beer in the house with it.

252
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,200
Yeah, and then I saw him going off with Connie, too.

253
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,900
That's a drinking, fighting Jesus for you, I tell you.

254
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,500
That's a real fighting one.

255
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:42,780
Yep.

256
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,180
It was...

257
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,300
It was confirmed that he does indeed smoke Chesterfields.

258
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,960
A couple people saw his...

259
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,200
And he has bad aim.

260
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,680
He has very bad aim.

261
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,320
Did he miss Bob?

262
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,680
I wasn't around at that point.

263
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,040
He missed him.

264
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,720
Something must have happened.

265
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,500
We think the bullets were caught in some sort of void time warp or something.

266
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:06,720
But as far as I know, he was shooting right at him and...

267
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,820
But he did have several conversations with Bob at other times in the evening,

268
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,860
which was very strange.

269
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,300
Yes.

270
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:12,960
Yes, he did.

271
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:13,340
He did.

272
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,140
Well, you know.

273
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,600
It was not an accident of Bob's control of the secret sciences learned at Dobstown.

274
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,680
It was a meeting between a short-duration personal savior and a long duration.

275
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,260
It could have been a conspiracy.

276
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,220
It could have been a conspiracy.

277
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:26,720
Oh.

278
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,140
A couple of people.

279
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:34,260
Reverend Richards said he saw Connie Dobbs and Jesus...

280
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,640
This is Jesus Christ we're talking about.

281
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,920
...swapping money...

282
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,520
The Jesus H?

283
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:38,900
...swapping...

284
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,160
The fighting one.

285
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,060
The fighting Jesus.

286
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:41,460
The fighting Jesus.

287
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,060
Swapping...

288
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:42,940
Swapping...

289
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,200
Swapping money in the backstage area.

290
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,860
Now, we don't know what that was, but...

291
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,980
Were they swapping spit?

292
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,280
Well, he could use...

293
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,420
Yeah, they could have been swapping spit.

294
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:59,560
They were oozing and ozzing at each other a couple of times in the audience, crowds say.

295
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,460
Praise Bob.

296
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,120
Hear tell.

297
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,560
And we think there might be something going on.

298
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,960
Folks said that Connie didn't seem too happy about Bob's...

299
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:13,800
Yes?

300
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,940
...participation in the event.

301
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,620
She was saying, kill Bob.

302
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,780
Kill Bob.

303
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,440
Well, that's what's happened every time he's ever showed up.

304
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:31,780
This is the first time Dobbs has shown up on anywhere near a subgenius revival since the last two times he got shot in California.

305
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:32,660
That's true.

306
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,260
And then...

307
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,320
And here Jesus...

308
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,660
It was...

309
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,680
Jesus was kind of like a sloppy drunk.

310
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,180
He was.

311
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:38,960
I was really let down.

312
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:39,980
I'd never met Jesus before.

313
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,060
It was very upsetting.

314
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,880
And he was an obnoxious drunk.

315
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,700
And on top of that, he had a handgun.

316
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,940
He's running around in a crowded nightclub.

317
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,940
Well, hey, now...

318
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,420
I'll say it again.

319
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,620
Now, slack to me is no waiting period to buy a handgun.

320
00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:01,580
Well, it's hard to think that that was the same Jesus that brought old Lassie back to life.

321
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,320
No kidding.

322
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:02,720
Because I tell you...

323
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,840
It was a destructive...

324
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,400
It would have been sloppy surgery, folks.

325
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,840
Take it from me.

326
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,860
That water in the wine trick, it's too easy.

327
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,620
How y'all doing tonight?

328
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,820
Can I hear a hail coming?

329
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,920
Y'all are too muck and fudge.

330
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,800
I'm real glad you guys are muck and fubbing it tonight.

331
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:30,240
And I want to shed on you the light of what this whole evening's all about.

332
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:39,520
And I want to give a personal tribute to Reverend Stang, who helped me find my true yeti mate

333
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,920
by showing me the yeti inside my...

334
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,480
And you ought to get a look at that here, friend.

335
00:15:49,020 --> 00:16:00,880
Manning and melding and meshing and meshing and all kinds of gish-gally-miss-molly-niggly-niggly-oogly-oogly-squeeze-me-till-it-hurt-kind-of-ugly.

336
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,720
Hey, ladies.

337
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,940
I've been a little bit distraught tonight.

338
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,180
I haven't seen people dancing.

339
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,920
I haven't seen...

340
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:18,660
I haven't seen people looking with that animal eye at each other like true yeti people do.

341
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,720
Are we humans or are we aliens, huh?

342
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,380
What are we gonna do tonight?

343
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:29,700
Fornicate.

344
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:35,040
Fornicate as if our very lives depended on it, that's right.

345
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,660
And ladies, I know I'm a lucky girl.

346
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,680
Don't hate me because I'm beautiful.

347
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,080
I'm beautiful.

348
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,380
I'm beautiful.

349
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:50,940
And the Church of the Subgenius, it doesn't matter if you're pretty or beautiful or sexy or any of all that.

350
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,500
It's just as long as you feel good.

351
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,640
Ladies, do you feel good tonight?

352
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,820
I want to hear you how, ladies, louder.

353
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,040
That's the kind of howing I like to hear.

354
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,280
Yeah, me too.

355
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:08,740
Yeah.

356
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,320
Let's go.

357
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:09,960
Yeah.

358
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,640
That's what happens.

359
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,660
Yeah.

360
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,820
There was...

361
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,480
What an audience.

362
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:24,520
I mean, among these sort of lesser deities, there were a wonderful core group of subgeniuses,

363
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:31,760
real subgeniuses and the ace type people, the folks who are old friends of the, well,

364
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,000
ace, the Association for Consciousness Exploration.

365
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,700
And I keep wanting to say expansion.

366
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,160
Of course, that would mean drugs.

367
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,160
I mean, this is...

368
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,840
Oh, no, no.

369
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,180
We're not talking...

370
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:43,440
We're...

371
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,180
This is all the legal stuff, like the isolation tanks and the mind machines and the groin machines,

372
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:49,860
the pelvic...

373
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,780
Boy, they set me up with a...

374
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:58,380
Folks, I mean, if you've never tried one of those mind machines, they're well worth the

375
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,480
paltry rental price, I'm sure, if you ever run into them.

376
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,920
But the groin machines, it was like a pelvic strobe that they set up for me in the pulpit.

377
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,620
Now, that's what I call real hospitality for a person.

378
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,100
Mm-hmm.

379
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:11,360
Yes, sir.

380
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,300
Controlled eratosensory stimulation.

381
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,580
It's a new field, but it's a very promising one.

382
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,380
And right there in public, in front of everybody.

383
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,200
Pulsing creatures.

384
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,880
That's why I love to gloat about stuff like this.

385
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,600
I just...

386
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:30,580
It makes me feel so good to brag about what a great time I've been having.

387
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,720
At everyone else's expense, yes.

388
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,620
If you don't feel good, just the flick of a switch and you'll feel good.

389
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,000
Oh, my God.

390
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,920
Oh, my God.

391
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,540
Sick with desire, it is.

392
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:39,820
Oh, my God.

393
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,600
Oh, my God.

394
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:40,600


395
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:40,600


396
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:40,600


397
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:40,600


398
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:40,600


399
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:40,600


400
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:40,600


401
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:40,600


402
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,500
Dying animal.

403
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,160
It knows not what it is.

404
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,440
Dada.

405
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,180
I'm not just talking about one person.

406
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,180
I'm talking about everybody.

407
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,720
I'm talking about form.

408
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,080
I'm talking about content.

409
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,900
I'm talking about interrelationships.

410
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,460
I'm talking about God, the devil, hell, heaven.

411
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,300
Do you understand?

412
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,100
Finally!

413
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,100
I don't need God.

414
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,960
All establishment.

415
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:10,960
Sort of.

416
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,340
Don't

417
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,360
I know.

418
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,860
It worked out the other day.

419
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:26,860


420
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:26,860


421
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:26,860


422
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:26,860


423
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,080


424
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,080


425
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,080


426
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,660
what?

427
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:27,660


428
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:33,300
at every opportunity to take on fun and professional rem raining in an airfield.

429
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,300
What else do you think we should?

430
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,740
John, thank you.

431
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,980
Cheers to you.

432
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:38,300
Cheers to it.

433
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:38,300


434
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:38,300


435
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:44,220
And who, you may ask, you may be dumb enough, ignorant enough to ask,

436
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,520
who is that man J.R. Bob Dodd?

437
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,900
Well, that's a real question, isn't it?

438
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,760
Why?

439
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,960
The how and the who is just scenery for the public.

440
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,620
Oswald, Ruby, Cuba, the Mafia.

441
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,120
Keeps them guessing like some kind of parlor game.

442
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,400
Prevents them from asking the most important question, why?

443
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,520
Why was Kennedy killed?

444
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,860
Who benefited?

445
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,260
Who has the power to cover it up?

446
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,360
Who?

447
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,260
Many don't believe in Bob.

448
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,000
Oh, many, many don't.

449
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,480
Bob's just a joke.

450
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,120
Bob, oh yeah, Bob's dead.

451
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:22,720
Bob's dead.

452
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,540
Bob's just a joke.

453
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,280
Oh, it's just a satire.

454
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,240
Uh-huh.

455
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,780
If Bob is a joke, then what do you call yourselves, my friends?

456
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,320
And if you can't take one, you know what we're going to do to you.

457
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,920
But what's paramount?

458
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,260
What's paramount?

459
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:36,840
Is that it might be a joke.

460
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,480
The game must succeed.

461
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,580
No matter how many die, no matter how much it costs,

462
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,200
the perpetrators must be on the winning side

463
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,240
and never subject to prosecution for anything by anyone.

464
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,780
That is a coup d'etat.

465
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,400
Ah, yes.

466
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,060
Well, enough of this assassination business.

467
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,860
It was all in good fun and what's a few bullets between friends, you know?

468
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,340
All in good fun.

469
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,380
It wasn't a personal thing and I missed for crying out loud.

470
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,620
You can't get much mileage out of a live save.

471
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,780
That's what we say.

472
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,040
But a dead save.

473
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,040
A dead save.

474
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,080
And you can use them.

475
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,980
You can put any kind of words in their mouth.

476
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,500
Well, that's just it.

477
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,620
I wanted to wave the bloody shirt.

478
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:18,960
It's kind of like art.

479
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,380
The value grows up after the artist's death.

480
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,080
Yep.

481
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,820
And he's not around to defend himself or to say,

482
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,240
wait a minute, I didn't say that.

483
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,220
Well, not only that, you can steal it and sell it.

484
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,280
You can steal it and say you said it.

485
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,320
Which is a lot of slack for the savior himself.

486
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,600
Well, you could take a simple phrase,

487
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:43,040
like if someone slaps you, then turn the other cheek.

488
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,380
And then if he slaps you again, tear his face off

489
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,400
and flay him alive in front of his family.

490
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,860
And they drop the second half of that line and it doesn't make any sense.

491
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,300
That's right.

492
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,100
But he's not around to defend.

493
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,860
I mean, do you think the Jesus that was gunning for Bob last night

494
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,600
was ready to turn any other cheeks?

495
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,420
Man, he wanted to kill before they killed him.

496
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,760
Actually, remove the cheeks.

497
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,720
Remove the cheeks from the face.

498
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,620
This was his ambition there.

499
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,180
Yeah, that was just kind of...

500
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,140
I mean, Bob wasn't particularly drunk.

501
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,440
No.

502
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,480
Considering.

503
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,800
Yeah, considering.

504
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,060
If he was, the man can dance.

505
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,680
He was still wet.

506
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,160
This is true.

507
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,440
The man can dance.

508
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,880
I can't.

509
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,580
Listeners in Dallas and other towns,

510
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,920
when we got here, there was a water crisis.

511
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,040
The water was contaminated.

512
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,340
That's how you knew that it was really Bob,

513
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:36,820
because the...

514
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,940
The incredible gravitational pull of the man's presence

515
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,260
was enough to cause major water mains to break

516
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,060
and a cold front to come in just while you were on stage.

517
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,300
You know, just the cold front ripped through.

518
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,120
Yep, little leftover of Hurricane Bob.

519
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,600
And you know, if you'd collected water from that rain,

520
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,560
it would be like an aphrodisiac.

521
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,420
That's one of the things that brings the aliens to this planet.

522
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:04,020
Ah, sort of like the orphan tears of the old times.

523
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,320
Yeah.

524
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,360
I'm here to give my own testimony.

525
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,860
The way I found J.R. Bob Dobbs

526
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,820
was bringing out the Yeti inside myself,

527
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,860
and I want to share with you what I discovered.

528
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:15,780
Praise Bob.

529
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,240
I'm the infrared woman.

530
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,040
I've got the beast of the abyss between my legs.

531
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:27,040
I'm tighter than a constipated Scotsman on a paint toilet.

532
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,500
The new age was invented just for me.

533
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,100
I wore the old one out.

534
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,380
I put the magic in sex magic.

535
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:44,380
I shocked Aleister Crowley and made the last ten popes

536
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,440
give up their vows just for one night with me.

537
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,320
Preach it!

538
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,960
Yeah!

539
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:53,320
Oh, come on and give me AIDS, baby.

540
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,880
I'll take it and I'll churn it and urine it

541
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,220
and mix it up with my own juices and turn it into nectar

542
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:04,060
and hide it so sweet and bad, you'll just be waiting for more.

543
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,060
Have great peanut!

544
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,380
I don't charge money.

545
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,000
I just charge slack.

546
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,500
Bob is my slack.

547
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,980
And tonight, we're gonna be renewing our marriage vows.

548
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,560
Because it was these discoveries.

549
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,300
Oh, thank you so much.

550
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,500
Praise Bob.

551
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,500
He may be done, but God, he's cute.

552
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,240
Well, listen, y'all.

553
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:40,640
I want you to happy up and start partying like you're true aliens.

554
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,020
Let the rails go, genius!

555
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,940
And I want women to be wiggling and waggling and jiggling and jiggling.

556
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,740
And I want you boys to get your go-gags going.

557
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,160
Whoo!

558
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,920
Are we gonna have fun?

559
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,040
Yes!

560
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,620
Are we gonna have fun?

561
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:01,660
This was the most spectacular subgenius revival there has been

562
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,520
since Bob was killed in San Francisco.

563
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,060
Praise Bob.

564
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:07,500
The most backup, the most lovely pulpit,

565
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,620
covered with garish, garish subgenius artwork.

566
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:20,240
Lasers, smoke machines, like I say, the prancing, lascivious devil gals.

567
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:20,880
Mm-hmm.

568
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,280
Too much in there.

569
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,300
Red devil gals.

570
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,920
I'd like to apologize for the lack of cavorting, writhing devil males.

571
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:33,060
And also, some of the pornographic video that I showed was a little bit heavy on the...

572
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,780
the female-style porno, which...

573
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,060
I mean, it was... I was...

574
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,060
I didn't have time to go to anybody else's collection, you know.

575
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,860
But it was...

576
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,540
The nonstop video projections, the background, the...

577
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,360
the...

578
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,200
When the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer was launched

579
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,840
and flew out over the audience, showering them with blood...

580
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,100
It was religious.

581
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,840
And the way the blood would sort of freeze in midair,

582
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,240
and as the head went over, it would freeze in midair like in a Disney cartoon

583
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,720
and then sort of slowly float down and would turn into, like,

584
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,760
this sweet-smelling mana.

585
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:12,500
And that was...

586
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,640
When it landed, it was this sort of tingling sensation.

587
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,300
I got it all over me.

588
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,160
It was this tingling...

589
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,880
Like it was seeping into me and I was receiving some sort of gift.

590
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,840
It was the most interesting effect that I've experienced.

591
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,080
Bad pills return to good pills.

592
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,120
Oh, we had the bucket of pills.

593
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,780
The bucket of pills were there.

594
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,820
Two buckets of pills.

595
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,300
Two buckets of pills, as a matter of fact.

596
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:33,500
Two buckets of pills.

597
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:39,420
Uh, the pills containing that which is inside J.R. Bob Dobbs' head.

598
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:43,480
And we were casting them unto the multitudes.

599
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,400
Unto the multitudes?

600
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,380
Pills of mush. Pills of mush.

601
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,540
Pills of slack. Pills of revolution, my friends!

602
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,200
Uh, oh, but I got to look...

603
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,340
I got a good look at that head this time

604
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:59,880
in between the short period that it was outside of the lead-lined arc.

605
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,400
Mm-hmm.

606
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,020
The new arc of the new head.

607
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,060
And I got a good look.

608
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:11,020
Boy, that stump, that new head has just a hell of a stump.

609
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,380
All them guts dangling out.

610
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,300
Oh, it does.

611
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,700
Just the right coagulation.

612
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,740
That special head enhancement.

613
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:23,760
You could have more fun with that than a JFK exit wound and a prairie squirt.

614
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,140
Oh, I did.

615
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,900
They didn't just cut his head off.

616
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,380
You could tell, man.

617
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,420
They cut the head off.

618
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,880
They didn't just cut his head off.

619
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,680
Very slowly ripped off.

620
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,080
I luckin' fubbed it.

621
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,900
I sure love feel good!

622
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,240
I got a head for my fans and I need to dance!

623
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,580
Can't pass a piece, I can't pass a piece, I can't pass a piece, I can't pass a hitman!

624
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:57,580
Hey!

625
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,560
And, hey, children, what does it all mean?

626
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,720
This stuff is really rich!

627
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,980
Please don't edit it to pieces.

628
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:16,740
I luckin' fubbed it.

629
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,240
Now, I'll show you the full picture.

630
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,240


631
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,520
That's the face of the guy.

632
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,280
That's the face of the guy.

633
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:24,340
That's the face of the guy.

634
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,340
That's the face of the guy.

635
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:25,480
That's the face of the guy.

636
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:25,540
That's the face of the guy.

637
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,760
That's the face of the guy.

638
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:35,760
Now, Sister Mary Squared, all contrary, you hold your language to FCC approved demonology regulations.

639
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,400
Well, twist me and turn me and tie me up and spurn me.

640
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,940
I'm sorry, Reverend Stang.

641
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:50,080
I just, I just, that, that sex hurt sequence in the, in the, in the late evening, it just, whoo, it riled me!

642
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:50,640
It riled me!

643
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,680
There was some healings going on that night.

644
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,520
There was some healings.

645
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,020
And thank you, thank you for saving me.

646
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,060
Oh, my pleasure.

647
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,320
Put it up for conspiracies.

648
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:01,740
Woo!

649
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,060
Exit wound.

650
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:05,900
Woo!

651
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:14,380
Say, we've got a new method for exterminating nine-tenths of the population, and you'll really dig it.

652
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,220
What is it?

653
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,920
What is it?

654
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,080
What is it?

655
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:18,360
What?

656
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,380
Wouldn't you like to know?

657
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,460
Oh, God!

658
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:27,040
But the headquarters of the church, if you'd call headquarters, the headquarters of the church,

659
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,960
which is where we organize religion at, is a skyscraper in Dallas, Texas.

660
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:31,380
Yeah!

661
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,660
Dallas, Texas, where I live.

662
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:38,200
I hate it so much I refuse to leave for long.

663
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:47,980
They call Dallas, well, it's part of the Bible Belt, and because Bob Tilton and Brother Gene Scott,

664
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,540
so many other preachers come from there, just like so many come from Cleveland area.

665
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,700
It's called the Bible Belt.

666
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,840
Well, Dallas is called the buckle of the Bible Belt.

667
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:07,320
What we have been called to do by J.R. Bob Dobbs and his lovely wife, Connie, is to unbuckle the Bible Belt

668
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:19,960
so that its stupid-looking pants may drop to its knees, and it will be forced to gaze unflinching upon its own private design.

669
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:35,320
Pastor Bucknagin and I were preaching in the drug gang in Dallas, Texas, not long ago.

670
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:44,500
We were preaching to the drug addicts, drugs, homosexuals, and fornicators, and prostitutes, and so forth, and they came down there.

671
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,440
And one thing we were trying to get them to quit fornicating and prostituting and drinking,

672
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,400
we just wanted them to be able to have fun doing it, you know?

673
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,080
Yeah!

674
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:54,480
And profitable.

675
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,020
Yeah!

676
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,860
Not necessarily in money, but in slack.

677
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,720
We wanted them to get slack-doing it.

678
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,600
Stay out of jail.

679
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,200
But those prisoners said,

680
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:10,240
Oh, but Bob, or well, they said Reverend Stack, Reverend Necky, how can Bob understand my problems?

681
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,700
Bob is a rich man. He's a powerful man.

682
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:22,340
My friends, I want to tell you that Bob Dobbs has walked in the shoes of the sinner, of the fornicator, of the drunkard, the drug addict,

683
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,160
and the homosexual.

684
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,060
Yeah!

685
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,340
He's a sinner, and he's a saint.

686
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,800
He's, because he doesn't know the difference.

687
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,780
He is a true innocent.

688
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,920
That man, J.R. Bob Dobbs, is a true innocent.

689
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:40,820
He doesn't know the difference between walking a little old lady across the street and committing sex tortures on her,

690
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,100
as long as it's mutually consenting.

691
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,940
Of course. Don't get me wrong.

692
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:53,160
The main thing is, Bob wants you to do everything to the facts.

693
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,180
He doesn't want you to do anything half-way.

694
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,720
That's the conspiracy talk of when you do things half-way.

695
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:09,480
He said, Bob said one time, he said, my friends, don't just eat the hamburger, eat the hell out of it.

696
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,000
Eat the hell out of it, my friends.

697
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:15,700
.

698
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:19,980
.

699
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,260
.

700
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:20,320
.

701
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:36,520
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

702
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:45,540
She doesn't know you're trying to makeしょう

703
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:50,100
Still, he treats you like arika on the Atlantis Island.

704
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,460
I say, indeed.

705
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,640
Pardon me?

706
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:30,400
There was an infinity of healings in the infinity box.

707
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,100
Yeah, okay, there was this psychedelicatessen, as you might call it,

708
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,480
or as I called it, the haunted house show,

709
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,180
on the third floor, which normally is abandoned in this club space.

710
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:50,300
But the ace people came in, and the great saint, Joe Rothenberg,

711
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,160
Uncle Joe.

712
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:56,960
Created, not single-handedly, of course, but as the key director, I guess,

713
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,900
of this, it was like every toy that a brain-damaged person

714
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,040
could ever want to roll around in, like little special,

715
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:12,200
they had dark mazes and cubbyholes and strobe-lit psychedelic spots,

716
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,160
and people...

717
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,140
People were doing things in there.

718
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,480
It was like walking into the pit of hell at times.

719
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,380
The sinning...

720
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:25,860
I realized what a really straight-laced old Midwestern feller I am when...

721
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,280
Oh, God, I mean, it was like the scene in the Doors movie

722
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,180
where Jim Morrison goes to the Andy Warhol party.

723
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,860
I felt that way a couple of times.

724
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,120
Man, I'm out of my element here.

725
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,940
This is...

726
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,600
I don't know what these people are doing.

727
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:43,160
But by the same token, we overheard people...

728
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,460
People saying the things they said about us.

729
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,740
It's like, those people are weird.

730
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,760
It's like, yeah, well, they're supposed to be...

731
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,580
No, I mean, I mean, those people are...

732
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,460
They're weird!

733
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,820
They're 80s.

734
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,740
Well, yeah, of course.

735
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,860
But, no, I mean, I mean, you know, they're...

736
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,340
They're weird.

737
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,880
Did you think it was an act?

738
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:08,080
And some of those trendy, trendy folks all dressed up in black

739
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,240
with their $50 haircuts designed to show that they don't care how they look.

740
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:12,880
Hmm.

741
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:18,180
The most fun was to watch them refuse to really participate

742
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:24,100
or show anything beyond a detached, cool, sophisticated sort of judgment,

743
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,760
judgmental, the way they look at bands, you know, without tapping their toes.

744
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,480
Now, some of them later on may have been dancing themselves to a frenzy

745
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,220
once they took their false conspiracy street drugs

746
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,360
or got drunk or whatever it is they do.

747
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,620
But we want to thank them.

748
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,440
We want to...

749
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,440
For the money.

750
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,680
The money.

751
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,640
The money.

752
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,080
The money.

753
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,300
The money.

754
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,560
The money that they gave us.

755
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:44,980
The drinks you bought us.

756
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,100
They pay us to make fun of them, to mock them and to show them,

757
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:54,660
to tell them to their faces what shallow, just hollow individ...

758
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,920
There were people there that were like living cartoons.

759
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,440
And you could see where Republicans come from.

760
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,180
No offense to my Republican friends,

761
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:09,400
but you know the type that are like these young fashion lawyers and accountants

762
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,840
and so forth, nothing wrong with being an accountant or a lawyer,

763
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:17,060
It's just this whole combination of perfect pinkness.

764
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:21,100
And the great thing to watch is their smugness,

765
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,460
which is the ultimate illustration of their own stupidity.

766
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:30,020
And, I mean, when somebody looks stupid compared to the subgeniuses,

767
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:36,360
who are definitely the sloppiest, most, you know, late-to-work bunch of people you could ever hope to find,

768
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:46,060
it's, oh, God, it was almost an orgy of disgust on the part of the true mutants

769
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:56,560
and kind of scruffy ace and subgenius folks that were engaged in making quite a bit of money, actually,

770
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:01,680
as it turned out, off of this new rave dancing trend.

771
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,740
There was never enough money, though.

772
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,460
Oh, no, too much is always better than...

773
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,280
Too much is.

774
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,200
Too much is always better than...

775
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,000
We spend it.

776
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:14,860
Yeah, we go through it really fast, and, of course, you don't mean the home for slackless children and all.

777
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,940
And keeping this radio ministry on the air, dear friends,

778
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,560
when was the last time Bob saw your money in the collection plate

779
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,400
or your spray paint can out there on the bridge abutments?

780
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,300
And we're...

781
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:33,260
By the way, I think we should all give honor at this moment, speaking of such things,

782
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,340
to Pope Jimbo, the father of subgeniuses.

783
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,220
Oh.

784
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:44,520
In Cleveland, for spreading the word of J.R. Bob Dobbs in the most spectacular and dangerous ways.

785
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,600
Just so long as you don't accuse me of actually holding the spray can.

786
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,620
I've never done it.

787
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,880
No, absolutely not.

788
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,100
There's always people who can be, you know, dependent upon it.

789
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,840
Yeah, well, I know this one very, you know, dastardly fellow who was...

790
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,600
He was spraying on a...

791
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,540
Spraying on a...

792
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,160
What is it?

793
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,580
A dumpster down in the flats.

794
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,860
And he got caught.

795
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,000
By the police.

796
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,140
But somehow Bob just came along and blinded that cop.

797
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,360
And the cop just drove away.

798
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,300
This is a true story.

799
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,680
Well, according to this guy, it's true.

800
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,900
It happened a couple years ago.

801
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,020
Yeah?

802
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,780
How did that go down now?

803
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,300
Well, you mean...

804
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:25,580
This was the guy that was really just putting giant, giant garish bombs...

805
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,620
Yeah, yeah, he had a big...

806
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:34,800
From the way he told me, he had a big stencil with some Dayglo paint on his green dumpster.

807
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,000
And...

808
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,340
And...

809
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:36,340


810
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,200
Yeah, he was...

811
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:37,700
He had the...

812
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,080
He had the...

813
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,860
Had the...

814
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,740
And his left hand had the stencil.

815
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,700
And his right hand had the spray can.

816
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,100
His left hand was covered with paint.

817
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,820
A cop rides up on a motorcycle and says,

818
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,780
What's going on here?

819
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,900
And he looked him in the face.

820
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,220
Just like in Star...

821
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:51,640
What was it?

822
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,180
Star Wars?

823
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,760
Yeah, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

824
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,240
There it is.

825
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:57,200
These are not the droids you're looking for.

826
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:57,500
Yeah.

827
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:57,840
That's right.

828
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,320
Well, almost like that.

829
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,840
Yeah, you know, it's perfectly all right, officer.

830
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,800
My car is just overheating.

831
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,060
And the cop looked him in the face and said,

832
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,320
Okay, and drove away.

833
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,220
Praise that man, Bob.

834
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,520
He can blind things.

835
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,200
Bless him.

836
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:12,920
Bless him.

837
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:17,420
None are so blind as those who have no eyes.

838
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,680
Well, he thinks he can impart on them some of his own blindness.

839
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,040
You know, he's blind.

840
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:27,360
I've got some inside stuff about certain kind of do-gooder outfits.

841
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,200
There's an outfit called...

842
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,000
Now, they may not have fine intentions, you know,

843
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,640
but it's called the...

844
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:42,900
The Task Force on Youth Violence or Gang Violence or Violent Gangs or something like that.

845
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:46,340
But there's a kind of a heavy set fella runs it.

846
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,480
And he's out.

847
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,180
And Bob told me personally that he thanks the man for the publicity.

848
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:57,500
But they're out there at these seminars telling folks that Bob is a, quote now,

849
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,280
satanic trigger.

850
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,840
And a gang symbol, right?

851
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,100
Yes.

852
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,180
And the thing is...

853
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,000
We've heard the satanic stuff, but the gang tie-in,

854
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:11,860
there are hundreds and hundreds of people in this town who have seen the seminar,

855
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,900
who have seen Bob's face up on the screen.

856
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,180
Most of these are police, right?

857
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,260
That type.

858
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:22,800
Well, a lot of them, like, people who try to help young folks get back on the pink track and so forth.

859
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,480
But, yeah, straight and narrow.

860
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,000
That was it.

861
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,500
But, yeah, they put his face up on the screen

862
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:33,460
and started talking about how the gangs put his face up on billboards and stuff.

863
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,300
And this is the truth now.

864
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,920
A lot of you folks out there have probably seen this,

865
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:41,820
but that Bob's eyes follow you wherever you go

866
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:46,920
and you can never leave these youth gangs that sell crack on the street.

867
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,740
Right, because Bob is always watching.

868
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,000
Bob is watching you and keeping you in the gang.

869
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,960
And it's true that Bob is watching you, but somehow it's hard for me to imagine...

870
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,920
Well, I mean, in a way, the church of subgenius is a gang, certainly.

871
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,380
Yeah, yeah.

872
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,500
But it's a fellowship.

873
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,620
It's a benevolent fellowship.

874
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,440
It's a benevolent fellowship, sort of like the Masons or the Rosicrucians.

875
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,080
We're just learning.

876
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,780
But only for real this time.

877
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,840
Instead, we didn't just make stuff up like that.

878
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:16,220
Are there really gangs of slackers wandering the streets of Cleveland saying,

879
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:22,080
well, you know, maybe I'll rob a liquor store when I can get around to it?

880
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:22,620
Yeah, that's it.

881
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,200
That's it.

882
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:27,460
They would be violent and so forth, but they're master procrastinators.

883
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:32,520
They're mostly rewardians and, you know, the rewardian types of geniuses.

884
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:32,840
And...

885
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,240
And...

886
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:38,160
It's like, if I have to, I might rob that liquor store.

887
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,460
But that's the nature.

888
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:46,120
The truest form of slack is when you just conceive of it, know you can do it, and then don't do it.

889
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,200
They get...

890
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,880
They'll break into your car and listen to the radio for a while.

891
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,960
And lock it back up afterwards.

892
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:57,920
They eventually decide that that really is false slack anyway.

893
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:02,920
That is, if they really are true subgenius.

894
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,620
Speaking of false slack...

895
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:10,240
If they're false slack, the pink boy who has the foam core giant Dobbs head in his dorm room or whatever will die.

896
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,020
Yeah.

897
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,280
And it won't be pleasant.

898
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:12,840
Yes.

899
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,240
Stolen from the ark.

900
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:14,700
Yes.

901
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,920
Well, it will explode.

902
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:16,580
Yes.

903
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,000
So...

904
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,220
Yes.

905
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:23,160
Oh, I think there's going to be a storm, a storm on the pink boys this week in Cleveland.

906
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:32,660
Speaking of pink boys, I hear tell that one of those stud-puppy pea boys took out old Reverend Pete's photography.

907
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,240
And camera...

908
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:35,940
The curse...

909
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,680
The curse of the camera...

910
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:38,900
The curse of the camera...

911
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,840
It shall be upon...

912
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,880
The curse of Connie shall be upon them.

913
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,860
Connie Ma.

914
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,020
See, that doesn't happen to you.

915
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:57,400
At the ace events like Starwood, which are held out in the boonies for obvious reasons, I've noticed that people never worry about...

916
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,620
It's like everything's on the honor system.

917
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,000
There's equipment laying around everywhere.

918
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,340
Everywhere.

919
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,340
And nothing's ever been stolen.

920
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,120
Now, lost.

921
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:06,640
Oh, yeah.

922
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,700
Car keys or anything.

923
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,520
Wallets.

924
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:09,420
Transformed.

925
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:10,600
Transmogrified.

926
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,960
But not actually stolen.

927
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,240
Void magic.

928
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:17,340
You can't avoid the noid, but you can annoy the void.

929
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,520
Praise Bob.

930
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:20,460
And we love to irritate that void.

931
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,580
Because we're for something.

932
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,600
We're not for nothing.

933
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:27,840
We're not destructive, entropic organization.

934
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,660
This is a full squirt gospel we're preaching.

935
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:31,280
Absolutely.

936
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:31,980
Full squirt.

937
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,320
It's important news.

938
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,880
We've got to be, you know, equal opportunity about this.

939
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,320
And now this is the new church.

940
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,600
Thank you, Reverend Stank.

941
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,620
Hail Connie.

942
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:47,300
The gals are now becoming even more sexist and disgusting than the guys ever could think about.

943
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:47,560
That's right.

944
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:50,200
Connie is more and more manifest every day.

945
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,020
Every day.

946
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,720
She just keeps gaining and gaining and gaining.

947
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:54,640
Hail Connie.

948
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:55,680
Hail Connie.

949
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:59,220
I'm going to let you hear from somebody you'd probably more likely hear from.

950
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:01,580
Sister Mary.

951
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,720
I swear to all contraire.

952
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,060
Right here, boys.

953
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:09,980
And you've got to behave yourself, you sinners, no-goods, ne'er-do-wells.

954
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,960
And she's going to tell you how to pull the wool over your own eyes.

955
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,140
And relax in the safety of your own delusions.

956
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,120
Praise Bob.

957
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,580
Praise Bob.

958
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:22,960
Praise Bob.

959
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,960
Well, thank you, Reverend Stank.

960
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,860
A lady just came up here.

961
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,840
A woman of knowledge.

962
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,920
And her eyes would be appropriate, don't you think?

963
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,340
Hail Connie.

964
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,040
Well, whip me, beat me, and tell me I'm pretty.

965
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:46,180
I want to holler, but the town's too small.

966
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:55,080
I'm here to talk about the goddess in the church of the subgenius, Connie.

967
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:55,340
Connie.

968
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:11,480
To describe Connie to you in simple terms is, well, Connie's kind of kicking Bob's ass behind him so they can make sure that they have all the slack they need.

969
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,940
Bob gets a little confused every now and then.

970
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,620
The conspiracy tries to pull the wool over his eyes.

971
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:23,180
And Bob's not all that smart, so, well, you all can understand.

972
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,480
There are many.

973
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,060
There are many.

974
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:30,260
There are many things in this world today that are frightening and confusing.

975
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:36,340
In fact, confusion is rampant in the minds of us men.

976
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:38,980
Or rather, women.

977
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:50,300
In fact, while one person is swearing to one way of life, another set of ideas are entirely separate.

978
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:53,680
Maybe swimming around in that person's head.

979
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,020
Hey, why?

980
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,320
I'm not even in our own church.

981
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,300
Yes!

982
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:03,700
Even here there are those among us who profess to be subgenius.

983
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:09,560
They even act like us, but all, all come true.

984
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:16,880
Inside they're bleak and confused little minds.

985
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:19,280
Very tight and normal.

986
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:22,500
You know, I'll tell you something, though.

987
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:24,300
It is almost impossible.

988
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,940
It is impossible to inspire.

989
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,200
You cannot inspire a pink.

990
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:31,240
The pink cannot realize slack.

991
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:36,960
Because when I performed the mass short-duration marriage of the entire crowd at midnight,

992
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:43,480
and it was quick, it was to the point, but it was a pretty forceful marriage ceremony.

993
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:52,620
Now, boy, I tell you, give me a tent show full of hippies or a damn punk club, you know,

994
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,280
with 25, uh, 10,000 people.

995
00:46:54,280 --> 00:47:03,120
And, uh, kids, just scruffy kids in it, anytime, over these young lawyers in their, um, fashionable

996
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:08,240
outfits who are afraid when, when, when the marriage ceremony calls out for them to hold

997
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,140
each, uh, hold onto each other and shake, uh, shake on it.

998
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,680
Uh, they do, they neither vibrate nor clutch.

999
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:16,160
Mmm.

1000
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:21,800
When they're instructed to form the temple of devo with the one finger forming a circle

1001
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,120
and the other partner inserting the finger into that.

1002
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:24,260
Mm.

1003
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:24,260


1004
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:24,260


1005
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,800
Self-same symbolic, um, hole.

1006
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,680
Uh, they don't.

1007
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:34,320
There is a smattering, of course, of, of, uh, the truly self-amusing personalities,

1008
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,140
the subgenius type people out there who are into it.

1009
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:41,700
I mean, and they, and then when it's time to kiss, you know, it's like you must now

1010
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:46,000
kiss or else you, and you have to consummate this marriage or else you make a mockery of

1011
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,800
the holy institution.

1012
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:51,660
Those people just stand there with their, it would be with their mouths open except

1013
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,100
their, they know somebody might be looking at them.

1014
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,780
So they hold their mouths closed, but.

1015
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,420
They look like boobers.

1016
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:57,920
It made me sick.

1017
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:04,300
It made me sick to see those, I mean, they are, you give them the excuse, you, you, you

1018
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,740
show them the slack, you dangle it in front of them.

1019
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,120
They're members of the difficult.

1020
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:11,820
And they'd rather have the conspiracy void itself in their face.

1021
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,040
They've been diff.

1022
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:18,660
They pay, and they're, they're happy to pay 20% interest to have the conspiracy water

1023
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:24,080
them down rather than to, uh, show any, uh, bias.

1024
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,500
Everybody, everybody in these bars knows Boob?

1025
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:27,800
Yes.

1026
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,780
And that's the first thing Derby, or in this, uh, liquidOH, this industry has been

1027
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:42,680
known for, and that's only about to anyone, anybody, this industry enough to tryقick

1028
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:50,040
everybody around their head and she goes, Well, do you, do you think your partner's

1029
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,020
too good to be true?

1030
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,660
Well, we, we structure this community we wanted to preserve or are gonna grow, we are unique,

1031
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,760
which is probably just as well.

1032
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:57,700
It just shat... It hurts me to think

1033
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,880
that those people reproduced.

1034
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,080
Too hip to be slack.

1035
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:00,700
Yeah.

1036
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,840
You know, there were a few

1037
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,900
Beechwood Pink Flight types

1038
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,800
that were converted, though.

1039
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:06,360
I saw them.

1040
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,600
Yeah, it's true.

1041
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,600
They really were.

1042
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:09,720
There were, um...

1043
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,120
They were.

1044
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:10,960
There were people...

1045
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,460
People were coming up to me

1046
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:14,880
blubbering in their drunkenness,

1047
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:15,240
saying,

1048
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,000
Oh, man, look, man,

1049
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:19,980
my life up until now was, like,

1050
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,960
totally, totally screwed,

1051
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,440
but I just didn't lie, man.

1052
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,360
It's like, you guys are doing it great, man.

1053
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,560
It's like, praise Bob.

1054
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:28,980
And I'd go, well, um,

1055
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,640
come down to the sales table, you know,

1056
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,580
because you need to, you know...

1057
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:33,060
Spend money.

1058
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,320
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm gonna spend...

1059
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,600
I'm gonna give everything to Bob.

1060
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:37,460
And then they...

1061
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:39,260
It's a shame that they won't remember

1062
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,940
tomorrow any of that.

1063
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:42,380
Well, if you've got their wallets,

1064
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,180
they don't have to.

1065
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,920
Well, some of them did come and...

1066
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,180
Let's be fair.

1067
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,420
Some of them may need more than a single dose.

1068
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,440
We'll have to do this again.

1069
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:49,120
That's right.

1070
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,200
And some of them did let Bob into their minds.

1071
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:52,220
And they still have time

1072
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:53,340
till they make it to the post.

1073
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:53,580
That's fine.

1074
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,040
Others of them perhaps need

1075
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,620
a stronger motivation in the marriage.

1076
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,900
Maybe a short-duration shotgun wedding

1077
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,320
might be the thing to try.

1078
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,280
Hey, I like that idea.

1079
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:05,060
Yeah, get more people paid to see violence.

1080
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:05,800
I've got a few weapons.

1081
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,080
I'm gonna force you to be temporary.

1082
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:07,960
I have a few weapons.

1083
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,500
And you know, dear friends,

1084
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,960
you two can have the slack of Bob and Connie

1085
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:19,720
in your pants or wallets or skirts,

1086
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:20,440
whatever.

1087
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,400
You can have that.

1088
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,140
You can have that.

1089
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,100
If you're ready to not just overdo that sex hurt,

1090
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,580
but to overdo the hell out...

1091
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:33,100
Don't just overdo eating the hell out of that hamburger.

1092
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,920
Do the hell out of overdoing eating that hamburger.

1093
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:37,660
Hey!

1094
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:38,740
Hey!

1095
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:39,140
Hey!

1096
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,820
My friends, there are parts of the body

1097
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,940
that still are not aware of Bob dogs.

1098
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,060
Oh!

1099
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:45,680
Which one?

1100
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,120
And these gloves must achieve slack

1101
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,420
or they won't do you any good at all.

1102
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:52,000
I'll show you,

1103
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:53,420
but I don't want to embarrass the youth.

1104
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,200
I'm not gonna be a human around here

1105
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,940
who are still measuring in length

1106
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,880
rather than in number of.

1107
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,160
However,

1108
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:04,500
I'd like to talk a little bit about

1109
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,020
all these body parts.

1110
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,820
You have body parts that are erogenous zones

1111
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:09,900
that you don't even...

1112
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,320
you never would dream of.

1113
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,520
And the reason for that is because

1114
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,140
you're not in touch with your true yeti self.

1115
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:18,280
Probably because you have not yet met

1116
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,720
your true yeti mate,

1117
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,520
which is the only way to discover

1118
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,880
what those parts are for.

1119
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,100
We're still trying to figure out

1120
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,080
where some of them go.

1121
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:30,460
Although, everything seems to work at times.

1122
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,860
There's a doctrine in the church called

1123
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,600
Sex Hurt.

1124
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,620
A rather misunderstood doctrine it is.

1125
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,400
Sex Hurt.

1126
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,600
People tend to think,

1127
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,160
well, does that mean like tying them up

1128
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,080
or bondage or something?

1129
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:46,740
No, no, no.

1130
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,620
That means sex until it hurts.

1131
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,020
Until it feels so good that it hurts.

1132
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,220
You don't have to stop because it hurts,

1133
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,660
but because it feels so good that it hurts.

1134
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,220
And as Bob Dobbs said,

1135
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,420
too much is always better than not enough.

1136
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,960
I see some people having to read their prescriptions.

1137
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:11,720
I'm glad to see that.

1138
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,840
But the yetis, the yet are our ancestors.

1139
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:18,720
Those of us who still have some yeti genes left.

1140
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:20,920
And you can usually tell,

1141
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:22,000
I look a little funny.

1142
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,420
Or else they act a little funny.

1143
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,800
Those are the main clues you have.

1144
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:30,440
But the yetis of Atlantis were able to practice

1145
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,720
strange, what we would call strange sex,

1146
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:37,480
only because the conspiracy hadn't been invented.

1147
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:38,740
When the humans escaped,

1148
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:41,400
that's when the conspiracy came along.

1149
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,340
But the yetis of Atlantis,

1150
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,380
eight feet tall at the least,

1151
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:48,600
covered with hair,

1152
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,020
different kinds of hair.

1153
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,120
It could change color.

1154
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,780
It could ruffle up for different purposes,

1155
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,700
you know, on different parts of their bodies.

1156
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:00,000
And we're able to use what's called

1157
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,180
tantric deviation technology.

1158
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,700
They did not need,

1159
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,420
when we say technology,

1160
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:09,240
we're talking about mental telepathy

1161
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,300
used to manipulate body parts.

1162
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:15,020
It may sound like science fiction to you,

1163
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:18,220
but that's only because, as I say,

1164
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,620
you may not have met your true yeti mate yet.

1165
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:24,800
We cannot guarantee that you will meet your true yeti mate

1166
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,280
in the Church of the Subgenius,

1167
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:29,400
although the likelihood is tremendously increased.

1168
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,220
And of course, some of you are saying,

1169
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,940
oh, God have mercy, man,

1170
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,320
I haven't been able to get laid in three years.

1171
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,520
I'm a mutant.

1172
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:38,960
Come on, let's face it.

1173
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,720
Well, you're going to have to quit being so picky,

1174
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:42,400
for one thing.

1175
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,380
For another thing,

1176
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,160
for another thing,

1177
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,140
even if it's not your true yeti mate,

1178
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,600
if you both pretend it's your true yeti mate,

1179
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:55,060
you will probably figure out what those parts are for.

1180
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:00,020
It's a strange thing to watch.

1181
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,620
You can't tell where one ends and where the other begins.

1182
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:09,460
After they start breathing with each other's lungs

1183
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:13,260
going back and forth like two balloons inside out,

1184
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,020
they start changing shape.

1185
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,700
They literally start changing shape

1186
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,000
until they're pressed together so hard

1187
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,260
that their hearts,

1188
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,860
first they kind of sync up,

1189
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,660
so they're both beating at the same time,

1190
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,300
their brain waves are all synced up,

1191
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,160
everything's sort of pulsing and throbbing at the same rate,

1192
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:32,680
and then their hearts literally push through the rib cage,

1193
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,060
all the way through.

1194
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,700
It doesn't hurt. It feels great.

1195
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:37,760
I've been cold.

1196
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,560
And then the whole body cavity begins to join up,

1197
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,900
and pretty soon it's just one hairy thing

1198
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,400
that's just working and changing and so forth.

1199
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,240
I do not call it a mistake.

1200
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:58,500
I do not call it a mendacity.

1201
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,400
I call it sin.

1202
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,980
I call it sin.

1203
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:18,400


1204
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:22,060
This is the old bay.

1205
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:22,580
This is the old bay.

1206
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:22,580


1207
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:22,580


1208
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:22,580


1209
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:22,580


1210
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:22,580


1211
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:25,660
Boom.

1212
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:26,240
Boom.

1213
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:30,020
If Joe's jigsaw was blows,

1214
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:38,660
then it should have.

1215
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:50,700
you want to use that well it might be time hope to reach a point of critical mass that'll start

1216
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:56,120
a chain reaction of people coming forward then the government will crack remember fundamentally

1217
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:00,260
people are suckers for the truth and the truth is on your side bubba

1218
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:09,020
there were people there though who rejected bob in fact pope jimbo was telling me there were um

1219
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:15,640
these like placed black sheets of paper big black sheets of paper under black lights and fluorescent

1220
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:21,620
crayons that you could the crowd could draw and doodle psychedelically under the black light

1221
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:27,640
and someone had written what reject bob and follow jesus yeah yeah and that was great that's fine

1222
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:30,140
you don't hate bob but at least give him

1223
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:30,240
the favor

1224
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:31,600
Yeah, well, it could have been.

1225
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:36,600
But the thing that really ticked me off was there was no quotation marks around Bob.

1226
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:38,460
Now, at least give him the quotation marks.

1227
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:41,700
So I went up there with a different color and put the quotation marks.

1228
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,760
Hate Bob, but do it right.

1229
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:44,260
Right.

1230
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:45,960
None of this half-assed hate.

1231
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:51,840
Leave it to these Christian moonies or whoever it was that can't even get his name.

1232
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,100
Can't even spell Bob right.

1233
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,820
Reverend Stang, Reverend Stang and gang, what we're going to do now is we're going to take a little break

1234
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:04,900
because it would be time to flip the tape for everyone else who is going to get this show somewhere down the road.

1235
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,580
This is Hour of Slack number 344, correct?

1236
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,280
Yeah, 343.

1237
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,120
343? Is that it?

1238
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,140
343 and a half.

1239
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,460
There we go. Excellent.

1240
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:21,200
So we're going to take a small break to gather ourselves, and in the meantime, folks will get to listen to this.

1241
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:25,920
Oh, hello. I'm Dr. Howell of the Church of the Subgenius.

1242
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,720
I suppose many of you...

1243
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:35,640
even at this late date are somewhat confused and maybe a bit bothered about just what are a subgenius anyway.

1244
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,360
It's rather a bit esoteric and theological.

1245
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,440
I don't claim to know all of it.

1246
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:47,340
In fact, I don't know of any human being can claim honestly to know it all.

1247
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:57,280
But we hope in our indoctrination centers in Dobstown, Malaysia, to inculcate a sort of sub knowledge, which will allow even our most illiterate,

1248
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,520
backward, po-bucker,

1249
00:57:58,540 --> 00:57:58,800
initialization, to get to the bottom of this.

1250
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:58,800


1251
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:08,460
I don't think we should be so ambitious to leap at it intuitively, take the leap of faith in the dark, and not fall down the stairs and shatter the milk bottle.

1252
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:14,500
Oh, I love those false endings. Aren't they great?

1253
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,820
We're back. This is live. Hour of Slack.

1254
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:20,760
Well, get on and get one, mate. It's a raving scene.

1255
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,280
And when you were in London, they probably met you.

1256
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,020
Bob's your uncle.

1257
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,400
You bet us a nine-bomb note he was.

1258
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:28,000
None.

1259
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,560
Nothing like a hot dog.

1260
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:35,380
A hot god. Hey, may I have some mustard on that hot god?

1261
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,040
Hot god.

1262
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,540
You want your god cooked well done?

1263
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,900
You want it crucified? How do you want it?

1264
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:44,940
Over easy? Electric chair? How do you want to do that god?

1265
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,420
Barbecue poke?

1266
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:51,440
Yep. I'll have a fried dob, please.

1267
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:52,740
Dob.

1268
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:54,480
With lots of grease.

1269
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,020
Or a dob on a stick.

1270
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,200
And a gob on a stick.

1271
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:00,600
Did anybody do any smart drinks?

1272
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:01,480
Yes.

1273
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:02,000
Oh, yeah.

1274
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,580
Oh, that's right. They were selling smart drinks.

1275
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,440
Now, what? Did anyone have one?

1276
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:09,440
Did that turn any of you into geniuses instead of subgeniuses?

1277
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,240
I was drinking stupid drinks myself.

1278
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:17,380
Yeah, we had a whole display of stupid drinks down in the psychedelic contestant that was just much more popular with the people.

1279
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,520
You could tell they were getting stupider all the time.

1280
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:25,960
Yes, we took the smart bar and we turned it into, well, the better bar.

1281
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:27,980
Not necessarily because of the bar.

1282
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:30,480
Not necessarily because we were smarter, but because...

1283
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:30,700
Just better.

1284
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:31,420
Just better.

1285
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:31,820
Better.

1286
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:32,280
Yeah.

1287
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:32,840
Better.

1288
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:40,640
We're not... In fact, Philo and I were meditating on that recently. We were talking about this new craze of smart drugs, all these mega vitamins and things.

1289
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:46,140
It was like, why in the world would any subgenius want to be smarter? I mean, we've...

1290
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:46,360
Yeah.

1291
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:51,120
Half of us have spent years trying to get rid of those excess brain cells.

1292
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:56,900
It's not a linear scale. You see, it's circular. So you get far enough to one end and you go smarter.

1293
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:59,860
You're going to slip around and find yourself at the subgenius side.

1294
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:05,120
Right. Or, well, at a certain point in there, they join Mensa and that's the lowest point.

1295
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:15,500
Well, the normals are basically smarter than... too smart for their own good right now. And that's where a lot of the trouble comes. It's not that we're really not trying to...

1296
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,420
Oh, they got all the brains in the world, but they don't know what slack is.

1297
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:22,100
That's right. They have to be undarkened before they can be truly...

1298
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:22,440
Yes.

1299
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,120
And I can...

1300
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:26,680
Contracted consciousness is the name of the game.

1301
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:43,240
And Philo pointed out that what we've already... You know, we used the stupid drugs to keep ourselves from becoming mass murderers. But, you know, those got tiresome, of course. And so what we need now are great drugs, which make you great.

1302
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:43,920
Oh, yes.

1303
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:44,080
Oh, yes.

1304
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,280
Because we've got a great monkey on our back.

1305
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:46,300
Uber drugs.

1306
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:46,940
Uber drugs.

1307
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:47,260
Uber drugs.

1308
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:48,120
We need more greatness.

1309
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,240
Uber drugs.

1310
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:50,360
Uber drugs.

1311
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:50,560
Uber drugs.

1312
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:51,980
Uber drugs.

1313
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,060
Uber drugs.

1314
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:54,840
Uber drugs.

1315
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:56,320
Uber drugs.

1316
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,320
Uber drugs.

1317
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:58,740
Uber drugs.

1318
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:02,440
Uber drugs.

1319
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:05,920
Orb트레

1320
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:15,780
Orb트레

1321
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:18,280
ants.

1322
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:02,240
