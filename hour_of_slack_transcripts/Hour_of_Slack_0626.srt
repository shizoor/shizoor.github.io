1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:09,160
Doctor, doctor, here. Take some more of this. Have some of that. Maybe the show will finish and we'll get to make another tape.

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:19,740
Oh no, more prescriptions again. I don't know if I can keep up with all these prescriptions and all these collars and all these fake shows.

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,440
Oh god, this is a genius thing. It's more than acting. I can't.

4
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,960
Man, I don't think I can keep up with it. I mean, it's like there's too much of it.

5
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:40,400
All these letters that come in the mail, these weird magazines, these characters that show up at the door, these bobbies.

6
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,260
And they want to know things. They want to know how to run their lives.

7
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,920
What should I do? I'm saying about this, about my girlfriend. My girlfriend, that one won't be a woman.

8
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,960
What should I do, man? It's all I know.

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,620
I'll tell you what you should do. Doctor, you should do this.

10
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,840
No head-launching, doctor. Take the pills.

11
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,860
Light the fire. Try some of this false slack.

12
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:20,560
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

13
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,020
Sponsored by the church of the subgenius.

14
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,600
Oh dear friends, did you ever have a dog?

15
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,520
Did you ever have a dog?

16
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:41,340
Did you ever have an old dog that was so old that it was having a lot of health problems,

17
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:51,800
but the health problems weren't bad enough to quite yet justify taking the old dog out to the back 40 and blowing its full brains out?

18
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,300
Well, or taking it, as you tell the kids.

19
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,200
Well, we're taking it to the nice farmer who lives down the road.

20
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,020
And he'll take care of old Yeller, old Shep.

21
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:13,900
The old Shep has chronic nosebleeds and has to stay outside until it's all healed up.

22
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,360
Not to spray fine fountains of blood across the living room carpet.

23
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,540
That is the law. We are men, are we not?

24
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,720
Speaking of which, friends,

25
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,420
I found a new book.

26
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:25,880
It's in the newspaper.

27
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,340
This little article.

28
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,480
Researcher finds link between faith and obesity.

29
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:43,680
People who are firmly religious are much more likely to be flabby than those who are soft on God, according to a new study.

30
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,500
You know, I'm not real surprised by this.

31
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:54,880
This does apply to subgeniuses almost as much as it does to southern Baptists.

32
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:02,420
Overeating may be one sin that pastors and priests regularly overlook, said a sociology professor.

33
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,060
Mr. Ferraro analyzed data involving 3,000 Americans and found a, quote,

34
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,400
surprising tendency that the most faithful, regardless of denomination, are obese.

35
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:20,200
The study gauged religiosity by asking questions about attendance at services and reading of religious material.

36
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,220
Overweight people find comfort in religious settings.

37
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,920
That's one reason for the correlation.

38
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,360
I'm not making fun, by the way, friends.

39
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,740
I'm like little big man.

40
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,780
I have been a fat guy and a skinny guy.

41
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,440
And I've never been a fat woman or a skinny woman.

42
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,720
Oh, gosh, if only.

43
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,200
Mr. Ferraro also compared denominations.

44
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:55,200
He found that southern Baptists in the south are most likely to be obese, followed by fundamentalist Protestants and Mayans.

45
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:03,720
And he found that the mainline Protestant groups, such as Methodists and Baptists outside of the south, thinnest are Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims and Jews.

46
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:09,120
People who said they had no religious affirmation or belief ranked near the middle.

47
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,820
I guess their middles were not quite as rank.

48
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,800
And religious blacks and poor people tended to be heavier than other groups.

49
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,160
While religion reduces deadly stress, that may be offset by the health risks of obesity.

50
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,200
I would say religious organizations have an opportunity to improve the health of their...

51
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,500
Hey!

52
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,840
God darn it!

53
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,560
Did you hear that?

54
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,880
Man, my equipment's starting to...

55
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,220
Bad equipment is a link between obesity, faith and skinniness.

56
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,200
Man.

57
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,720
Frant. Test.

58
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,400
You don't hear the music now, do you?

59
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,440
Now, if I hit this...

60
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,840
What the hell is going on here?

61
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:02,940
Friends, this is Cosmic Voyeur in the background, Reverend Imat Zepol, also known as El Diablo.

62
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,260
Oh, here's another interesting...

63
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,800
I'll get on to the fun and funny tapes shortly here, friends.

64
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,660
But there were a couple other things I wanted to share with you.

65
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:18,140
Also, near the back of the Dallas Morning News newspaper, around page 13 or 14 in small print,

66
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:23,420
it says here that 12% of the vegetation species face extinction.

67
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,900
Study finds...

68
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,180
Just a minor little clip in the back.

69
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,160
They didn't want to get anybody worked up or anything.

70
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:36,300
The first international survey of plant diversity has found that at least one out of every eight known plant species on Earth

71
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,760
is threatened with extinction or nearly extinct.

72
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,260
Oh, I'm one of those eco-nuts.

73
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,780
Oh gosh, I'm going to be one of those eco-nuts now.

74
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,140
You know, they're everywhere.

75
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,380
Those eco-nuts are just...

76
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,200
They're going to wreck the planet for us.

77
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,580
The results of a 20-year joint effort among 16 organizations, including the Smithsonian Institution,

78
00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:03,600
show that habitat destruction and introduction of non-native species has caused about 34,000 species to become so rare that they could easily disappear.

79
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,960
That amounts to 12.5% of the 270,000 fern, conifer, and flowering species known worldwide.

80
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:16,840
These statistics, the report emphasizes, are just the tip of the iceberg.

81
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:23,960
Because so little is known about many areas in the United States, which probably has the planet's best studied flora,

82
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:29,520
about 29% of 16,000 species are at risk, according to the report.

83
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,480
And it's similar for Australia and South Africa.

84
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:38,140
In general, the more detailed a country's species inventory, the higher its proportion of threatened plants.

85
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,460
In some cases, entire plant families were in trouble.

86
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,840
Now listen to this one, friends.

87
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,620
For example, 75% of the yew family,

88
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,340
which produces the anti-cancer drug Taxol,

89
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,100
Chah, friends.

90
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,780
Why am I, why do I keep losing my background music?

91
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,740
What is, happening here?

92
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:06,000
There's something happening here and I don't know what it is, do I, Mr. Smith?

93
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,000
Ah.

94
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,900
Widespread extinctions.

95
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,200
Oh yeah, oh, as I was saying, the anti-cancer drug Taxol is produced by yews,

96
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,840
75% of which are threatened with extinction, globally.

97
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,380
There's your cancer cure.

98
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,340
Um.

99
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:32,420
Plus even other familiar groups such as 14% of roses, 32% of lilies and irises, 29% of palms.

100
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:37,600
Widespread extinctions might affect medical science, according to the report,

101
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,840
seeing as how more than half of all prescription drugs are modeled on natural compounds

102
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,340
and one-fourth are taken directly from plants or modified versions of plant substances.

103
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,800
Diversity provides a biological buffer against things like climate change or migrations.

104
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:01,660
Every time we lose a species of plant, we're losing a unique gene pool that has undetermined,

105
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,020
but possibly very significant, benefits to mankind.

106
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,480
But then on the other hand, friends, let's make sure that that kind of news goes back on page 15

107
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:16,860
of the conservative Dallas Morning News, because you know how those environmental eco-nuts are.

108
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,040
They're just all crazy.

109
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:23,880
Because, friends, think about it, life is itself sexually transmitted.

110
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:31,660
And just as kids in the back seat cause accidents, accidents in the back seat cause kids.

111
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,260
I'm not trying to say that, well, I mean, two wrongs don't make a right,

112
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,240
but two rights were able to make an airplane.

113
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:47,160
And it's the whole problem with our gene pool, friends, in this country and across the face of the globe

114
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,320
is that in our genes, we're able to make an airplane.

115
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,320


116
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,020
In our gene pool, there is no lifeguard.

117
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:57,580
Living on Earth is expensive, but it does include a free trip around the sun.

118
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:06,380
But it's not the pace of life that concerns us, it's the sudden stop at the end.

119
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,780
It's hard to make a comeback when you haven't been anywhere,

120
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,660
and the only time the world beats a path to your door is if you're in the bathroom.

121
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,280
But if God had wanted me to...

122
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,440
touch my toes, he surely would have put them on my knees.

123
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:28,480
So, friends, never knock on death's door, but ring the doorbell and run, for death hates that.

124
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:36,040
And lead us not into temptation, because we're subgeniuses and can find the way there ourselves.

125
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,080
But, you know, it gets to you after a while.

126
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:47,240
When you're finally holding all the cards, why is it that everybody else decides to play chess right then?

127
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,100
Well, the mind of the subgenius is like a parachute.

128
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:00,760
It works much better when it's open, but most of the time, I think most of us just roam and candle.

129
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,900
Because we don't take life seriously.

130
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,120
No one gets out alive anyway.

131
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,780
There are only two kinds of pedestrians, friends, the quick and the dead.

132
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,860
And that goes for all kinds, those of us who walk Bob's Walk.

133
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,320
Those of us who walk Bob's Walk.

134
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,280
Those of us who remember that everything comes apart one way or another, as Bob said,

135
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,320
and an unbreakable toy is still useful for breaking other toys.

136
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,960
So, let's avoid obesity, friends.

137
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,140
Good health is merely the slowest possible rate at which one can die.

138
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,460
We're all going to end up on our heads anyway.

139
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,300
Anyway, the only difference between a rut and a grave...

140
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,640
is the depth.

141
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,200
Yeah, water's cold, but it ain't all that deep.

142
00:10:52,820 --> 00:11:01,700
Friends, that was a little bit of internet graffiti that was actually sent to us by Robert Anton Wilson under a disguised name.

143
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,140
Pope Bob occasionally posts things to the subgenius news groups,

144
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,560
but I'm the only one who knows which one is him!

145
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:17,320
Well, friends, now it is time for me to shut up, or rather play tapes.

146
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,240
I'm not sure if I'm the only one who's not shutting up, perhaps.

147
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,100
I don't know, I don't know.

148
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,820
Friends, we've still got Bill T. Miller's incredible new CD.

149
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,000
We've got astounding radio recordings from Einstein's Secret Orchestra,

150
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,520
and from Suzie the Floozy Show, Bob's Slacktime Funhouse,

151
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,240
as well as those other boys there in Atlanta.

152
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,180
We've got some KPFA show.

153
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:45,300
We've got the Devival from Portland, which was recorded by Jeremy Olson.

154
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,760
Those are the only tapes we've gotten in of that.

155
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,740
We haven't done that show yet.

156
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,740
Reverend Olson's, praise Reverend Olson, at least somebody cares!

157
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,540
But I don't care.

158
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:05,260
Let's just go on down in, down deeper in, into show.

159
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,880
This is a voice speaking to you from thousands of miles beyond your planet.

160
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,640
Warning! Warning!

161
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:30,020
The final hour is approaching for the people of Earth.

162
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,260
No, no, no, no, please, no, no, no.

163
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,820
Come on, no, no, no.

164
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,500
We're on the threshold of the end of this civilization.

165
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,080
All right!

166
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,720
No, no, no, no, please, no, no, no.

167
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,040
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.

168
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,980
Sounds too good to be true, dear friends.

169
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,960
Industrial strength anti-religion religion.

170
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,260
I don't know. I think we've been duped.

171
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,520
We have nothing to hide.

172
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,720
Religion is poison.

173
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,160
Religion is poison.

174
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,360
So how cares the antidote?

175
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,660
Religion is poison.

176
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,180
Religion is poison.

177
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,340
Love is your only hope.

178
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,240
It's true.

179
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,900
Cults control money.

180
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,000
That's how they work.

181
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,320
I need a slack fix.

182
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,760
Give me that slack, baby.

183
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,960
Give me my slack fix.

184
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,380
Give it up, give it up.

185
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,720
Gotta have my slack fix.

186
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,020
We have nothing to hide.

187
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,560
Religion is poison.

188
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,080
Religion is poison.

189
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,400
So how cares the antidote?

190
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,580
Religion is poison.

191
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,140
Religion is poison.

192
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:58,380
Religion is poison.

193
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,220
Love is your only hope.

194
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,900
Grimball!

195
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,120
It's definitely a sign of the apocalypse.

196
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,020
Negative feelings directed at others is never constructive.

197
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,140
Grimball!

198
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,160
All packed up and ready to go.

199
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,920
Waiting for the exes, sasas to show.

200
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:23,580
Ta-da!

201
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,640
The normals say the rupture's a hoax,

202
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,080
And all those sub-Ds are all just slapped up on dope.

203
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,780
But I know Bob wouldn't lie.

204
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,880
The X-Day rupture is the one true escape.

205
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,980
The one again.

206
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,120
The one again.

207
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,120


208
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,120


209
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,120


210
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,920
The ones spitting in the pipe.

211
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:52,700
The only hope to live for the freedom of 1 million.

212
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:52,800
What are we still in a position to do?

213
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:52,800


214
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,020
Let's have a note, that's not part of the deal.

215
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,900
S które keist Foundation Worker

216
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,100
The Ø semua bet

217
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,520
Money, money, money on

218
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:00,520


219
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,280
Okay, here is the final hour.

220
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,160
This is the last hour.

221
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,740
Anything by now on the plan of the people of Earth.

222
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,080
I hate to disappoint you,

223
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,080
but the world is not coming to an end.

224
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,280
This fight has been ordained since the beginning.

225
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,140
My children, this is the most crucial and serious time of all history.

226
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,960
Who will win our soul?

227
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:17,960
Our savior and lord?

228
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,960
Or the prince of darkness?

229
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,660
It's the final battle between good and evil.

230
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,260
And it's only on pay-per-view.

231
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,940
Jesus vs. Satan.

232
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,820
Live from the South Park Forum on Saturday.

233
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,420
On out order. Only $49.95.

234
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,540
We can't miss the final apocalyptic battle between good and evil.

235
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,940
Yes, my mom's getting a Ferris wheel.

236
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,700
Well, come on. We have to at least see the way in.

237
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,780
Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre.

238
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,440
And it always is, except for the birds.

239
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
And what do the birds say?

240
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,600
All there is to say about a massacre.

241
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,820
Things like,

242
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:26,580
When the sky is a bright canary yellow,

243
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,040
I forget every cloud I've ever seen.

244
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,680
So they call me,

245
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,060
A cockeyed optimist.

246
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,800
Immature and incurably clean.

247
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,540
I have heard people rant and rave and bellow

248
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:48,840
That we're done and we might as well be dead.

249
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,940
But I'm only a cockeyed optimist.

250
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,840
And I can't get it into my head.

251
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:03,380
I hear the human race is falling on its face.

252
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,800
And hasn't very far to go.

253
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,680
Living things shall quake in terror at my presence.

254
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,260
Mountains shall be thrown down.

255
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,660
Cliffs shall tumble.

256
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,380
Walls shall crumble through the earth.

257
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,540
I will summon every kind of terror against you.

258
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:25,740
I will fight you with a sword, disease, torrential floods, great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.

259
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,620
Thus will I show my greatness and bring honor upon my name.

260
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,300
And all the nations of the world will hear what I have done and know that I am God.

261
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,160
Shhhhh!

262
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,400
This whole world may toss and tumble.

263
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,900
This whole world may rock and roll.

264
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,420
The sun above me turns to ashes.

265
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,880
Of blue it may unfold.

266
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,680
And I'm a star.

267
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,680
I'm a force of heaven.

268
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,800
And that moon's gonna take control.

269
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,240
But my Lord will never leave me.

270
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:18,540
He's the lover of my soul.

271
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,460
You don't really believe that, do you?

272
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,300
A historic instant when the first atomic bomb seemed to charge out of the bowels of the earth,

273
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,720
Professor George Kistikovsky remarked,

274
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,020
I am sure that on doomsday, in the last millisecond,

275
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,300
the last man on earth will see what we have just seen.

276
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:44,080
In direct contrast, William Lawrence of the New York Times felt as though he were present at the dawn of creation when the Lord said,

277
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,540
Let there be light.

278
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:55,920
If the universe is as many millions years old as we think it is, our crowded little era of thirteen years is but an instant of yesterday when it is past.

279
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:03,000
1933's unemployment, September at Munich, that June 10th at Liberty, December 17th at the University of New York, and the year of the Great Depression.

280
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,000


281
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,000


282
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,880
December 7th at Pearl Harbor, 915 over Hiroshima, were all part of the identical moment.

283
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:16,340
The one question remaining then, was it 2359 o'clock or 0001?

284
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:27,700
But that'll be the day, that'll be the day, when the wild wings are blown and the sun turns out its light.

285
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,880
That'll be the day, all right.

286
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:32,980
That'll be the day.

287
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,340
That'll be the day, all right.

288
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,760
One third of the earth is set on fire, and one third of the trees and grass burn up.

289
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,960
The second one, one third of all ships and fish are destroyed.

290
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,820
One third of the sea turns to blood.

291
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:50,200
The third, a flaming star called bitterness, fell on one third of all rivers and springs, poisoning the water.

292
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,040
The fourth, the sun's power was reduced by a third.

293
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,240
Daylight was dimmed and night darkened.

294
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,540
Now imagine the freezing cold.

295
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,360
These next two trumpets are believed to be symbolic of armies, listen.

296
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,480
The fifth, an army of locusts like creatures from hell.

297
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,240
They seem to have the intelligence of men and the excruciating sting of a scorpion.

298
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,380
For five months they torture mankind.

299
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,620
Men try to die, but cannot.

300
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,680
And now they were turned loose to kill a third of all mankind.

301
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,900
They led an army of 200 million warriors.

302
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,500
I heard an announcement of how many they were.

303
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:28,460
All right, now we have the combination of a force of 200 million, now demon-possessed, by demons that are psychopathic killers.

304
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,460
That put into the heart of every one of these 200 million an evil spirit.

305
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,360
An insatiable lust for blood and murder.

306
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,540
Do you realize what one third of the world's population will be?

307
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,060
By that time, we estimate that the world will be populated by more than 3 billion people.

308
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,780
This means that over 1 billion people will die.

309
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,620
Then it's no miracle, is it, that the blood will flow to the horse's bridle?

310
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,300
That shouldn't surprise us at all, should it?

311
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,060
I don't know.

312
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,880
The party's over.

313
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,940
It's time to call it a day.

314
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:14,760
Burst your pretty balloon and take in the mood of may.

315
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:27,720
It's time to wind up the masquerade.

316
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,080
Just make your mind up.

317
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:42,020
The piper must be paid.

318
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,220
Hey, I, Dove, what I owe you, with interest.

319
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,040
Then what?

320
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,680
You may perish in the catastrophic and uncontrolled burning of this prophesied time.

321
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:56,160
When your heart's on fire.

322
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,140
You must realize.

323
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,840
Smoke gets in your eyes.

324
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,840
Impossible, fantastic, ridiculous, absurd, really?

325
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,300
Sure is.

326
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:14,700
Yeah.

327
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,900
Huh.

328
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,060
First and last man walked this earth.

329
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,420
But only a few survived.

330
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:31,440
I'm the wizard of us, and I've got it all planned for my first nuclear device.

331
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:38,140
I don't really care about which way you vote, cause my gerrymander works out fine.

332
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:44,200
I sewed desert stretches like a big rubber glove through Japan for a nuclear device.

333
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,780
Nuclear device.

334
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,860
Nuclear device.

335
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,920
Nuclear device.

336
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,960
Nuclear device.

337

Come on, everybody!

358
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,640

Oh yeah!

00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,860
Love is love. Praise love!

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,620
Love is love. Love is love.

362
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,760
A divine love!

363
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,460
Love is love. A supreme love!

364
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,320
Bop is love. A dicky, sticky love!

Bop is love.

367
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,640
Bop is love.

368
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,260
Bop is love.

369
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,420
Love is love.

370
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,080
Bop is love.

371
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,400
Bop!

372
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:23,440


373
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,360
The kind of love your mammy warned you about

374
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,280
Bob is love

375
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,620
Bob is love

376
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,860
The kind of love that gets your squids squirtin' baby

377
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,520
Bob is love

378
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:35,520


379
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,820
Bob is love

380
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,220

381
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,040
Bob is love

382
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,380
Bob is love

383
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,680
The kind of love that makes Bob grin

384
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,800
Bob is love

385
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,800
Bob is love

386
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,080
I thought it was about hate

387
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,540
Bob is love

388
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,500
Isn't that what you really need?

389
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,060
Bob is love

390
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,020
Or hate?

391
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,080
Or hate!

392
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,460
Hate the conspiracy

393
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,680
Hate your job

394
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,780
Hate the normals that stole your slab

395
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,400
Hate

396
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,860
That's my body

397
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,860

398
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,180
Love you

00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,500
Bob

400
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,020
Hate you

401
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,020
Bob is hate

402
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,800
Hate

403
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,180
Without hate there can be no love

404
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,900
Bob is hate

405
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,560
Hate

406
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,680
Bob

407
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,480
Hear what I say

408
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,020
Hate

Get out!

422
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,200
What is this crap?

423
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:26,340
Hey, well, sir, that crap was Bill T. Miller and Brother Cleve and D.K. Jones,

424
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,360
the Slack bangers, off of Bill T. Miller's new Orgy of Slack CD,

00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,500
available from the Church of the Subgenius,

or you can write to Bill Miller at Box 230-221-Boston-My-02-123.

427
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,000
That's BillTMiller.com.

428
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,620
Or KingOfSlack at Subgenius.com.

429
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:07,680
Bill T. Miller, P.O. Box 230-221-Boston-Massachusetts-02-123.

430
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,000
And before that, we heard Sister Susie the Flusie's amazing Armageddon,

431
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,180
Tired of Waiting for It audio collage.

432
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,260
Unbelievable!

433
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,880
Here, here's Susie, an incredible...

434
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,940
And there's more of that coming up.

435
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,020
Along with her lovely lilting rant.

436
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,600
So we'll see you then on site two.

437
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:33,920
And in incredible rage!

438
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:41,200
Way down under Australia

439
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,760
Very different from all the year

440
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,620
Getting rid of the strife

441
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,860
Those one-by-one bike cheap

442
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,720
And all you rainy

443
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,060
You may realize me, I'm sweet

444
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,200
And the same sort of reason

445
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,180
While the animals are free

446
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:49,180


447
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,820
Just look so strange

448
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,920
All because of a testing range

449
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,840
A testing range

450
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,620
A testing range

451
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,440
A testing range

452
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:53,780
A testing range

453
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,200
A testing range

454
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,740
A testing range

455
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:54,800
A testing range

456
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,040
But it's all going to end soon.

457
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,580
The end.

458
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,760
The end of all you've done.

459
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,780
You see, none of it was real.

460
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,040
It was illusion.

461
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,400
Your art, your science, it was all a nightmare.

462
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,920
And now it's done.

463
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,240
Finished.

464
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:12,180
Okay, then ten years after World War IV...

465
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:12,920
2051.

466
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:13,580
No, more!

467
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,220
What? No!

468
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,860
2051, the future!

469
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:16,640
They saw it already!

470
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:16,700
They saw it already!

471
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,160
Take that picture!

472
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:18,460


473
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,820
I was the only one left on the planet after the Holocaust, eh?

474
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,920
Hey, who's the cool?

475
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,260
The Earth had been like,

476
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,140
desestated by nuclear war.

477
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,100
Like Russia blew up the US,

478
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,680
and US blew up Russia, eh?

479
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,960
Statue of Liberty.

480
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:31,640
Psst!

481
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,900
Lucky for me, I'd been off-planet,

482
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,020
on vacation at the time of the war, eh?

483
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,360
There wasn't much to do.

484
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,700
All the bowling alleys had been wrecked.

485
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,520
So as I spent most of my time looking for beer...

486
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,380
One day, I was out looking for another.

487
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,420
I had a nice place to build a city for my children,

488
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,440
when I spotted a mutant in the Forbidden Zone.

489
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:58,040
I landed my vehicle to pursue and destroy this genetic freak,

490
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,300
before he could warn other mutants in the underground caves.

491
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,880
I was kind of like a one-man force, eh?

492
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,920
Like Charlton Heston in Omega Man.

493
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:06,840
Did you see it? It was beauty.

494
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:07,740
Yah!

495
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,800
Bless you, anti-mutant!

496
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,640
Are you friendly?

497
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,920
No way, eh?

498
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,360
Radiation has made me an enemy of civilization.

499
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,640
Alpha Base, this is Bob McKenzie.

500
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,620
I've spotted a fleshy-headed mutant in Sector 16B.

501
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,160
Out! Take half, you hoser!

502
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,360
See what happened, eh?

503
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,180
Film broke!

504
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,720
Oh, jeez. Gotta fix it, eh?

505
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,040
Sorry, film broke. Sorry.

506
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,660
Hey, FNC, eh?

507
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,000
Turn the lights off, will you?

508
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,220
We interrupt our regularly scheduled nuclear apocalypse

509
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,220
for an important announcement.

510
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,600
Are you really ready for the end time, Seekers?

511
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,080
Have you reached deep in your heart and wallet

512
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,500
and made peace with Bob?

513
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:02,180
Do you have all the protection that Bob's exclusive eternal salvation

514
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:05,520
or triple your money back guarantee can bring?

515
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:10,140
Just think! Salvation that can be bought!

516
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:15,380
You can't get that sort of insurance from Mutual of Omaha, friends.

517
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,440
You got a right to Dallas, Texas, and...

518
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,080
you got a right to get it.

519
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,580
So grab a pencil, Seekers,

520
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:26,820
and send off a stamped, self-addressed, business-size envelope

521
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:31,200
and whatever else you want to tuck in there to get Bob's attention.

522
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:35,440
And address it to Bob.

523
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:47,680
B-O-B-P-O-Box-140306.

524
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:55,580
Dallas, Texas, 75214.

525
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,980
And you can bet your bottom chromosome that you'll be in clover

526
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:06,340
when the heat rays start welding the DNA helixes around here into spin art.

527
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,880
Oh, but hey, really, trust me, Seekers,

528
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:15,400
because I'm not really sure whether or not I'm lying to you here

529
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,020
because I have no doubt in my mind

530
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,420
that those saucers are coming for us.

531
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,460
There's no way they aren't, children.

532
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:28,440
Because since the first time I laid eyes on that cheesy pamphlet

533
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,700
that sucked me into this deranged cult,

534
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:36,860
I have searly, sincerely believed the insane teachings of this church.

535
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:41,640
I believe in the power of J.R. Bob Dobbs

536
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,400
and his precious gift of eternal slack.

537
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,820
I believe in the raptures and toxic...

538
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,840
and the devastating brain embrace of Connie and her minions.

539
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:54,440
I quake before this dark fist of removal,

540
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,540
and I welcome its grasp.

541
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,000
I believe in the redemption of the blood of the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

542
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,720
Hell, we've seen it launched here in this very city.

543
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,260
And the believers who witnessed that

544
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,600
and sent in their $30, of course, pray Bob,

545
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,840
will be ruptured up wherever they are.

546
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,760
Yay, yay, yay!

547
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:23,220
Oh, seekers, are you making your July 5th holiday plans?

548
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:29,400
Will you be at Ground Zero up in western New York at Brushwood

549
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,380
with a sizable chunk of the church?

550
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,820
Or will you be lying out in your backyard

551
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,720
with a cold one in one hand, your membership card in the other,

552
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:47,380
and your mouth open, eagerly awaiting the first wave of face-raping bats?

553
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,440
Oh, choices, choices, choices.

554
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:56,140
Oh, but it doesn't matter where you are, seekers,

555
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:00,840
because the X's are going to home in on that tiny pasteboard

556
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,640
get-out-of-pink-jail-free card in your pocket,

557
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,300
and they're gonna translate you right aboard the ships.

558
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,400
You don't have to be in any particular place,

559
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,820
but I know where I'll be,

560
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:17,240
as close to Ground Zero as I can get.

561
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:26,360
Oh, so I guess I've done my job better than usual tonight.

562
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,640
Oh, and if you're caught short, seekers,

563
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,740
don't say that the flus didn't warn you.

564
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:36,080
We now return you to the conflagration,

565
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,080
which is already in progress.

566
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,640
Oh, Susie.

567
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,320
What a fine bang.

568
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,580
There's something that has been predicted

569
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,260
in many of your Earth languages

570
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,940
and your Earth religions,

571
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,500
that there would be a time

572
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,780
when the old world would die,

573
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,180
and a new world would emerge.

574
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,980
Do you think this is the first time

575
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,920
extraterrestrials have come to this planet in this way?

576
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,860
Have you ever considered the possibility

577
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,400
that this might be the second coming

578
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,040
of extraterrestrials in this way?

579
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,220
Yeah, one more, one more.

580
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,240
Please come forth.

581
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,440
Do not be afraid.

582
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,080
We're here.

583
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:51,020
Lord, I suffered a bicycle accident last year.

584
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,240
I'm a terrible catcher.

585
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,800
I've dropped every one of these sinners

586
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,220
that I've tried to catch for you.

587
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,300
Could you, could you make up for it?

588
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,520
I'll try my best,

589
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,960
but they're hitting the cold, hard concrete, Lord.

590
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,160
You're creatures that are moved

591
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,260
by urges within your beingness

592
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,740
that you cannot fully comprehend.

593
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:20,180
Often these urges shape themselves

594
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,260
in consciousness in such ways

595
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,260
that they emerge in your thinking mind

596
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,620
in larger patterns of consciousness

597
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:34,140
that you can artifically interact with.

598
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,480
See, that's why you forgot

599
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,300
your magnificent theory about space

600
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,760
and about us flapping our wings

601
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,780
and trying to get out there

602
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:45,580
is because we all, that's what we do.

603
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,460
We forget it.

604
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:46,840
That's what we do.

605
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,680
We forget it.

606
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,180
That's the whole point.

607
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,140
Come up with an idea

608
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,480
and immediately forget it on purpose.

609
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,160
You know?

610
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,700
Yeah, studies in obfuscation.

611
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,300
Never speak.

612
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,220
Studies in futility.

613
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,260
Never speak.

614
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,300
Dream of things that cure the world of cancer

615
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,000
and other diseases.

616
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,500
Don't tell nobody about it.

617
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,220
But yeah, in the true Platonic,

618
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,520
Aristotelian way.

619
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,080
Keep it to yourself, by the way.

620
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,020
Keep it to yourself, yeah.

621
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,500
Just think about it.

622
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,480
Find your manners now.

623
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:12,900
Yeah.

624
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,680
And I know that child might be dying there.

625
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,320
And you can change that.

626
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:15,660
There are nine ways

627
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:19,060
for the human race to survive its childhood.

628
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:19,800
But no!

629
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,140
No.

630
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,540
Step on that child's knee

631
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,920
and grind it into the dirt.

632
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:24,240
Yeah.

633
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,220
Push the bus over the edge of that.

634
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:25,880
Kick it a couple times.

635
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,140
Yeah.

636
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:26,960
Push it over.

637
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:27,500
Yeah.

638
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,640
Oh, I know.

639
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,500
There was a theory about Richard Nixon's jaws.

640
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,460
Yeah, it was.

641
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:32,860
Yeah.

642
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,800
See, there it goes.

643
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,700
In the space aliens.

644
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,380
You thought of the thing going over the cliff

645
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,300
and there he was going like,

646
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:37,740
oh, my God.

647
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,580
A lot of people thought

648
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,100
that the conspiracy was that

649
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,300
the aliens were speaking to the White House,

650
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,400
you know, people in the White House

651
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,120
in charge by a,

652
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,380
you know,

653
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,660
the White House.

654
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:00,800
Yeah.

655
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:08,860
And they were saying,

656
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,160
oh, my God,

657
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,320
that's a little bit of a joke.

658
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,180
Yeah.

659
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,380
That's a little bit of a joke.

660
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:13,540
Yeah.

661
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:14,600
But the truth is,

662
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,300
that's not the case.

663
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,300


664
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,300


665
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,300


666
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,300


667
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,300


668
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,300


669
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,300


670
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,300


671
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,300


672
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,300


673
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,300


674
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,300


675
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,300


676
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,300


677
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,300


678
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,300


679
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,300


680
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,300


681
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,300


682
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,800
So you're saying essentially

683
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,980
that the jowls were giving the commands

684
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,540
or were receiving the commands?

685
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,380
Sending the commands.

686
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,000
Sending the commands.

687
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,940
Well, they're transceivers.

688
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:24,600
Yeah.

689
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,520
Well, I thought his mind

690
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,920
was controlled too by the aliens.

691
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,600
Richard Nixon was a transceiver.

692
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,520
Yeah, I know he was a transceiver,

693
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,320
but I also thought...

694
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,200
He hung out with, you know,

695
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,060
Hoover and stuff like that.

696
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,240
He was also a transceiver.

697
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:35,780
Damn.

698
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,160
Hoover was a transsexual

699
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,320
and a transvestite.

700
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,480
And a transceiver, yeah.

701
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,520
All those trans...

702
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,880
He went transglobal.

703
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,000
Yeah, he did.

704
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:43,720
He went all the way.

705
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,740
We're all still reading.

706
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,300
All his books.

707
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:45,300


708
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:45,880
He was re-programming.

709
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,740
He hit the button.

710
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,160
You're not supposed to hit the...

711
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,220
When you're in global programming, folks, kids,

712
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,980
be careful what you do.

713
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,180
Because when you change a parameter

714
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,440
in global programming,

715
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,580
you change everything.

716
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,840
So if you hit trans

717
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,380
in your global programming on the ships

718
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,420
when they reprogram you,

719
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,540
you're going to be transsexual,

720
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,000
transgender,

721
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:06,840
transluscite,

722
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,320
trans...

723
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,040
Translucent.

724
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,240
You'll be transpopulated.

725
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:10,580
Yeah.

726
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,540
You'll be trans...

727
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:12,380
Transported.

728
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,080
Transported.

729
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:13,580
Transmitted.

730
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:15,880
Transized.

731
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:16,740
Transduced.

732
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,300
I can't think of too many of them.

733
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:18,540
Yeah.

734
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,260
I'm limited right now.

735
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,460
So be careful when you're in global.

736
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,680
Because I'm trans.

737
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,000
I'm transdimensional right now, buddy.

738
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:25,440
Yeah.

739
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,220
Have you ever gone trans-dement?

740
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:28,980
Trans what?

741
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,860
You weird little man.

742
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:30,740
Translimp?

743
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,220
Trans...

744
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,840
Oh, hell, we've all gone translimp on this show.

745
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,680
When translimp last night.

746
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,360
Transdement.

747
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:35,600
Transglint?

748
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,160
What?

749
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,500
The trans glint in my eye.

750
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,940
Well, actually, it was a pencil stuck in my eye.

751
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,260
That's a fiery transglint in Dave's eye.

752
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,280
No, it was actually a pencil I stuck in my eye.

753
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:45,980
I stuck in my ear.

754
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:46,900
To remember...

755
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:51,180
Because I could tell he's dreaming about the day that we build that ship.

756
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,300
Out of stones and rocks and mud and pieces of dirt.

757
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,880
Yeah, mud and rocks.

758
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:56,660
That's cool.

759
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,060
And wood.

760
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,040
We hew rocks and mud.

761
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:02,760
We send a little old log cabin without any wood on it.

762
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,240
Of course, it would have to be made out of something else.

763
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,000
Vinyl.

764
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,120
Vinyl.

765
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,640
We get a little...

766
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,340
I don't know about vinyl.

767
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,280
We get some dirt and mud...

768
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:10,880
Just keep it natural.

769
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:11,640
...and put vinyl siding on it.

770
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,300
Oh, okay.

771
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:12,980
And that would be our spaceship.

772
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:13,600
Yeah.

773
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,440
And some trees growing on it and everything.

774
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:17,820
Yeah.

775
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,260
It'll have its own little atmosphere, you know.

776
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,040
We'll get a little neon light that says, each all day, 24 hours.

777
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:25,520
Right.

778
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,340
Stuff like...

779
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,640
And then when people come over to try and get a breakfast or something...

780
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,120
The interior will be a black light room.

781
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:30,680
...we'll shoot it.

782
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:30,680


783
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,500
It's zooted up and everything.

784
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,940
Ham and eggs, my arse, and you know, blown away.

785
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,360
Smoking church air and all that.

786
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:35,640
Yeah.

787
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,380
We'd be huffing it big time, buddy.

788
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:37,880
Yeah.

789
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,280
Everybody will think that's the tail.

790
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:39,560
All our minions.

791
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,240
All six of them.

792
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,620
As you come past Earth every 87 years, they'll think, look at that big tail.

793
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,260
They're going to be like, oh, that's a big tail.

794
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,280
That's from the...

795
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,340
And they don't know that that's the growth coming out of the bottom of your spine, your

796
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,820
new brain growing out of your butt.

797
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,180
Yeah.

798
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,340
They'll think it's like vapor trails, you know.

799
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:53,540
Yeah.

800
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,760
Which I've smelled many times up here at this station, I'll tell you.

801
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,120
Yeah.

802
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:01,400
Some people have actually expired literally on the air and be resuscitated from those

803
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:01,780
things.

804
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,820
From the vapor wash.

805
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,360
It's not big.

806
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,480
It's not a big studio.

807
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:07,880
And if there's a lot of people up in here, one of them has been eating Mexican the night

808
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,200
before.

809
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:13,060
We always can be counted on when there's a job to do.

810
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,240
We serve our homeland day and night.

811
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:15,240


812
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:15,240


813
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:15,240


814
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:15,240


815
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:20,400
We try to keep it always free and proudly wear our robes of white protecting the treaty.

816
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,560
Stand up and be counted.

817
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,280
Show the world that you're a man.

818
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,220
Stand up and be counted.

819
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,040
Go it's the Ku Klux plan.

820
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,600
antennas as if they were tiny tiny japanese town

821
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,780
that gives the impression we're better ranchers than we really are by playing you know more voices at once

822
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:11,440
yeah because we can do like uh we can imitate ourselves in the same show imitate ourselves

823
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,840
imitating ourselves imitating ourselves from the from the show from the radio show which is derived

824
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:23,080
from the tv show derived from the right from the teacher it's a second convenience store slurpee

825
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:27,860
cup which is derived from the comic oh i wish i had a story right now i'd slurp that sucker up

826
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:49,380
come on let's go 83d squid 3d squid 83d squids 83d squid

83D squid, 83D squid, 83D squid.

834
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,280
83D squid?

835
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:31,480
We took it and we filtered it and then we returned it to you.

836
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,500
That's the basis of it.

837
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,120
Oh, now I'm stuck with it.

838
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,920
No, you know what stage you're at, don't you?

839
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:37,260
Now I'm at stage eight now.

840
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,280
Don't delay.

841
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,820
And you were so fast.

842
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:40,360
Well, exactly.

843
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:43,220
Well, I was also projecting myself into the future as usual.

844
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,720
Oh, man, we thought you were in the room.

845
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:47,080
But I'm only able to do that five seconds at a time.

846
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:47,580
Really?

847
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,840
But, like, yeah, it never works like at the horse track

848
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:55,000
because I only know that it's going to be the winner five seconds before, you know, the end of the race.

849
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,400
Just like on X-Day.

850
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:57,560
Yeah, exactly.

851
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,520
The end of the race.

852
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,560
The end of the race, yeah.

853
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,140
I only know five seconds before the end of the race.

854
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:02,500
Yeah.

855
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,480
For most people.

856
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,400
Well, this is the problem.

857
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,920
This is what I get for combining my Unitarian upbringing with my subgenius inner knowledge.

858
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,060
Which is?

859
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:15,680
Because the Unitarians are, I mean, I was raised Unitarian and that's just, you know,

860
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:17,420
I mean, we're lovable and stuff,

861
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,820
but the thing that people always accuse the Unitarians,

862
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,620
the Unitarians of is namby-pambiness.

863
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,460
Yeah, they're kind of soft, aren't they?

864
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:24,880
They're really...

865
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,680
It's kind of soft, yeah.

866
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,220
Yeah.

867
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,960
So I always, you know, I always took my religion the easy way,

868
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,080
which, you know, which is why I like Bob.

869
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,420
Bob.

870
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,420
Because Bob just sort of just, you know, I just opened up my,

871
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,920
I just basically opened up my fourth orifice

872
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:44,680
and Bob flowed into me as a six-year-old child, actually.

873
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:47,940
I remember that day.

874
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:48,780
Yeah.

875
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,240
Standing on top of the mountain with you.

876
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,480
What an aroma.

877
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,180
It was delightful.

878
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,820
I, my ears turned pink.

879
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,540
My, my whole body was glowing.

880
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,000
Er, I'm sorry.

881
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,000
That wasn't me, was it?

882
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,180
No, that was, that was you and Tessie.

883
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,560
Oh, yes, Tessie.

884
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,980
And I wasn't there either, but she was so beautiful that day.

885
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:06,660
Yes.

886
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:07,200
Yes.

887
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,000
Like the sunset itself, she was.

888
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,980
Buzz Aldrin was there.

889
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,760
And he was in drag.

890
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:13,820
He was in drag.

891
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:19,140
And nobody knows that when Buzz Aldrin graduated to the 33rd level of Masons,

892
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,720
he did it in drag.

893
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:25,180
She waited all night and that was a line that she had to write.

894
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:25,700
For knowing that.

895
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,200
In shrine.

896
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,240
All, all true.

897
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,040
And he gave the secret handshake plenty of times, Bill.

898
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,900
Listeners, this is all true.

899
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:37,300
Just so you know, nothing we say can be a lie.

900
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,440
In fact, every aspect of the following conversation has been monitored by truth,

901
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,600
I mean, for truth, by the Citizens Committee.

902
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:45,320
Isn't that correct?

903
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:47,580
I believe that is correct.

904
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,220
What did I do?

905
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,260
Please!

906
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,360
That's the truth.

907
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,220
He's fired.

908
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:52,940
I'm fired.

909
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,580
I grabbed, I grabbed Wee's breast.

910
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,200
She's speaking the truth.

911
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,680
She was speaking the truth.

912
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:02,120
And it was the, the protocol kept it from getting by.

913
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,220
I'm really flushed now.

914
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,340
I just don't know what to say and don't know what to do.

915
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,620
Well, you see, I feel the same thing.

916
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:14,300
For as you grabbed her breast, you grabbed my breast at the same time.

917
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,280
And mine as well.

918
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,900
And I grabbed my own too.

919
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:18,060
Pam.

920
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:19,640
Listeners, we hope.

921
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,760
When you grab Wee's breast.

922
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,900
If you at home are grabbing your own, in the best way possible.

923
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,800
You grabbed the breast of Bob.

924
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,060
Exactly.

925
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,000
Your own breast.

926
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,200
Or Bob's breast or whichever breast you wish to grab.

927
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:34,200
But make sure that if it's someone else's, you're doing it with their legal consent.

928
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,500
Especially if they're 13.

929
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:41,120
I don't think that's legal consent, Timmy.

930
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,360
You've got a lot of experience with that though, don't you, Josh?

931
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:44,520
13-year-old.

932
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,380
Rottweiler, that is.

933
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,340
Yes, they are.

934
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:49,780
Josh.

935
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,140
Rottweiler's in the outfield.

936
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,000
Of course I believe in God.

937
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,440
I'm not an anti-Christ.

938
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,360
I'm not a Bible-puncher.

939
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:01,040
You reject Satan and all his empty promises.

940
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:14,240
Hear the will of the Lord, sinner!

941
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:19,020
Only the Lord can save you!

942
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,740
One upon a sugar crown.

943
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,960
Don't let the demons pull you down.

944
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:37,760
See the fire in their eyes.

945
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:45,320
Cause here they see the blessing prize.

946

00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,240

But your perfection

951
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:56,240
Can light your future

952
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:13,020
Too many of us now

953
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:17,780
Tend to worship, self indulgence and consumption

954
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:27,360
Food for се north

955
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:27,360

A свое from gun'g

957
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,040
To refuse

958
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:39,340
looked to stand

959
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:39,340

965
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,300
I think our brains have fat

966
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,560
What we'll be

967
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:44,680

It's true.

973
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,180
Cults control minds.

974
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,240
That's how they work.

975
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:49,600
Cults control minds.

976
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,600
Cults control minds.

977
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:49,580
Cults control minds.

978
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:19,400
Cults control minds.

979
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,500
Cults control minds.

980
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,520
Due to scheduling problems,

981
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,600
we had to make it at 7 o'clock in the morning.

982
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,200
The world will end

983
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,920
in a blossom of agonizing

984
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:58,540
fire. There will be weeping and gnashing of mandibles. All that is high will be cast down,

985
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:07,940
and unwholesome monsters thirsting for human blood shall stalk the land, and it'll be impossible

986
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:16,380
to buy them off. So one must pay one's dues while the opportunity still lasts. But this

987
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:22,460
is no cheap con, for one thing the dues have gone way up and it's no longer as cheap as

988
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:32,940
it used to be. And so I feel it attendant upon me on this auspicious occasion to cut

989
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:40,200
short this line of lather and introduce our first fantastic performer. He is true nobility

990
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:46,360
of the performance world. In fact, we call him the Duke of Europe.

991
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:58,260
Come forward, please, your grace. Your public awaits. As his name suggests, the Duke of

992
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:05,140
Europe plays an instrument. Where is your instrument this evening? He's going to fetch

993
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:12,440
his instrument. The time was when you brought your instrument on stage. I don't know about

994
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:16,280
the way they do it now. But the artistic type is sensitive.

995
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:27,380
And not due to stall. That's true. A true artist never stalls. A true artist never stalls,

996
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:36,340
but brings forth the glory of his moment at the moment. There is no hesitation, no filler,

997
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:44,400
no dead air. Only the joy of music and communication with a rapturous and enchanted audience.

998
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:46,360
I would like to thank the audience for coming out tonight. I think it's a great pleasure

999
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:46,360


1000
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:52,320
to be here. I mean, this guy is not the Baron of the Butte or the Viscount of Butte. He's

1001
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,120
gotta be him.

1002
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,900
Here's Hector Del with the Do Do Do Do song on the islands.
