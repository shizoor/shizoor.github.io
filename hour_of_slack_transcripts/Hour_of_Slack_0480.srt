21
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:29,520
uh and we just never know what just a little while ago i went out to run an errand it's sunday

22
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:36,040
night where i am right now and i thought well gosh i'll turn on that radio station that i used

23
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,900
to produce this show on and see what's on here in dallas in what used to be the hour of slack

24
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:51,200
time slot and friends it was preachers but it wasn't like a subgenius

25
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,680
preachers because it didn't have zoog's riff music in the background i'd say that's the the most

26
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:02,320
immediately noticeable thing about it and also that it would they were preaching a doctrine of

27
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:14,320
hate my friends hate hatred uh and and uh and they weren't kidding except that they they dressed it

28
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:20,620
in the the guise of love of course love of them and hate of us whereas friends we don't even bother

29
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,720
to see it up like that we ain't trying to dress it up we'll just tell you right out right that's

30
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:32,400
what this religion is all about it's about hate it empowers us to hate fame them others any of

31
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,180
them others all of them the humans you know those lowly monkey people the humans the silly

32
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:48,580
ten-fingered things uh and uh just to uh celebrate that aspect of dallas the fact that they

33
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,560
they don't want to hear

34
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:56,340
reverend stang preaching in dallas no more doesn't empower low and moderate income people

35
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:04,300
that's right people people yeah people so uh it's sure as hell don't uh but um

36
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:12,080

crowd about 150 people and people yeah people but they were uh it was the cross section that

38
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,200
we like to see it wasn't a bunch of people it was a bunch of people that were like

39
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:28,400
people in black youngsters there was plenty of them uh tattooed with dobbs tattoos on their

bull dada bull dada the latest exploration into the world of advanced surrealistic morealism in

57
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,840
which the mind is filled with dirt and lugs which trickle like mutilated centipedes down the sides

58
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,360
of the now empty cranium to find shelter and rest inside the now sightless eye sockets

59
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,240
this at the same time he was tackled to pay shop people ofなんто who

60
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,900
catching away

61
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,200
yo

62
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,200


63
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,200


64
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,200


65
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,200


66
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,200


67
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,200


68
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,200


69
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,200


70
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,760
Charlie don't search, neither do I

71
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,060
Worship me and Dad

72
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,680
Bring it in the heart

73
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,440
Because they take that

74
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,520
Dad, where's the muncher?

75
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,700
It's a joke

76
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,480
It's a joke

77
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,360
It's a joke

78
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,940
My eyes closed, I see

79
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:15,280
Bobs of yellow moving around in blackness

80
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,840
Who's a crazy life is able to find

81
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,320
At the sun of the dark

82
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,240
I don't care if it's a merchandise

83
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,860
It's a single wire

84
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,620
I don't care if it's a urinal

85
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,180
I don't care if it's a lettering

86
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,380
There is no logic in this emotion

87
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,360
Don't you hear me yet?

88
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,700
I'm just a single line

89
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,100
And I don't sense

90
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,260
So worship me and son

91
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,260
Worship me and son

92
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,460
Worship me and son

93
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,900
Hold on a minute

94
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,960
I'm gonna turn down the volume

95
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,920
You're just a serendipitous

96
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,040
Following the blues

97
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,480
Always running your own course

98
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,860
I'm stating a radio

99
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,240
Standing everyday

100
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:19,740
Thelear

101
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,480
Pod의

102
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,900
One's theTO\'Deanie

103
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,320
You're fy googoy

104
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:23,320


105
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:23,380
In the sky

106
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:23,380


107
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:23,380


108
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:23,520
But never should I

109
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,200
My ears are open

110
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,620
I cannot turn

111
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:28,720
I cannot turn

112
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,560
Let me other way

113
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:06,340
Oh, dear friends, that was indeed some bulldada from the leper chunks.

114
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,700
Yeah, man, leper chunks rule.

115
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,540
Or something like that.

116
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:24,020
And we can find that CD, which is called We're From Texas, Volume 2, at P.O. Box 800-88...

117
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,240
Wait a minute.

118
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,680
8-uh-oh.

119
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,380
No, 800-867.

120
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:36,440
That's Box 800-867, Dallas, Texas, 75380.

121
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,680
Hmm.

122
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,140
What could it mean?

123
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,060
Well, let's not dwell upon things like that.

124
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,260
Let's not even think about it.

125
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,060
Or should we?

126
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,280
I wonder if those paranoid people are after me again.

127
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,720
No, no, no, probably not.

128
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,460
Well, let's go to this lovely devival.

129
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,820
This is Father Joe Mama.

130
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,940
You can't go wrong with Papa Joe.

131
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,580
One of the great all-time subgenius preachers, I think.

132
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,100
If you don't mind.

133
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,860
I'm sorry for my saying so.

134
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,720
This recording is cut off.

135
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,480
We're missing the very beginning of the rant.

136
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,140
My recording is non-existent, but we got this one from the great Bob Payne.

137
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,540
The pain of Bob.

138
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,520
And so...

139
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:23,740
Yeah.

140
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,660
We're not even aware we're making it.

141
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,580
But hey, you gotta bend a little to get along, right?

142
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,900
You can't always get everything just the way you want it, right?

143
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,320
Right.

144
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,280
Well, allow me to respond to that.

145
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,500
That common misconception with one word.

146
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,320
Corrupt.

147
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,080
You've heard about corrupt.

148
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,940
It means lacking in moral integrity.

149
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,460
To taint, to infect, to spoil.

150
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,780
To change the original form or intent.

151
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,100
In other words, to compromise.

152
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,940
Now, most of us don't like the word corrupt.

153
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,720
It sounds too dirty, too sleazy.

154
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,760
We'd rather think of ourselves as compromising.

155
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,260
That sounds more respectable, doesn't it?

156
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,620
But is there really any difference?

157
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,880
Allow me to tell you a little story about a fine Christian woman.

158
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,020
She was a widow going through some hard times.

159
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,980
She was still beautiful, mind you.

160
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,740
But her husband had jumped to his death after the stock market crash.

161
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,020
We heard her family without very much money.

162
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,960
They had lived very lavishly before.

163
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,500
But now they were struggling.

164
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,700
Her only daughter was sick.

165
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,160
And her mother and parents were getting old and feeble.

166
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,960
Still, she was a very proud woman.

167
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,440
Because she still had her integrity.

168
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,900
Until one day.

169
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,560
Yes, a wealthy old man came and visited her.

170
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,380
He asked the beautiful woman if she would perform sex with him.

171
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,760
Well, she flatly refused.

172
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,720
Angry at the suggestion.

173
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,960
But then he offered to marry her.

174
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,540
Take care of the little girl.

175
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,300
Rest in peace.

176
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,540
Restore the family fortune.

177
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,360
And also assist in the parents ever getting older.

178
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,640
At this point, she knew the old man was a lecher.

179
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,640
But she figured marriage was a fair compromise.

180
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,180
So she agreed.

181
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,240
At this point, the man then offered another compromise.

182
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,520
He said, why not just skip the marriage and have sex for a hundred bucks?

183
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,420
Well, she was furious.

184
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,380
I mean, what did he think she was?

185
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,460
Some kind of hoe?

186
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,280
Why, yes, the man replied.

187
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,060
We've already established that.

188
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,520
Now we're negotiating price.

189
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,940
You see, the man was right.

190
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,520
She was always corrupt.

191
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,600
She was just living in denial.

192
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,720
She wasn't a bad woman.

193
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,440
She had many good qualities.

194
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,000
But she had one fatal flaw.

195
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,240
She was willing to compromise her principles.

196
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,960
Now how many of us are in that same situation?

197
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,700
I don't mean widowed with a sick kid or older parents.

198
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,840
I mean willing to compromise our principles in order to get ahead.

199
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:18,340
Oh, dear friends, after all the reward is big enough, it's not easy resisting giving in just once.

200
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,900
The problem, of course, is that it never is just once.

201
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:26,540
It's only the beginning of a long line of compromises.

202
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,240
It's always that first little compromise that's the hardest.

203
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,200
But from there on out, it's downhill all the way.

204
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,680
Even religion is an example.

205
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,200
It's the only way to get exempt from the temptation and powers of corruption.

206
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:41,880
No!

207
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,920
Have you ever heard of a secret church, friends?

208
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,000
No!

209
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,220
No, no.

210
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,220
Well, a secret church then, allow me to enlighten those of you who are unfamiliar with it,

211
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,740
is a non-denominational church that was built with compromise.

212
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:03,660
Every principle that might offend or scare newcomers off is compromised away.

213
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,580
There's no loud English.

214
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,040
There's no angry servants.

215
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,540
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

216
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,220
There's no insistence on time.

217
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,140
You can keep your money.

218
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,900
Oh, we don't want your money.

219
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,540
Oh, no, no, no.

220
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,840
There's no talk about the horrors of hell.

221
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,640
Just the pleasures of heaven.

222
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,520
In fact, there's no controversy at all.

223
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,240
Just touchy-feely stuff to make you feel good and come back and get an ex of it.

224
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,560
These so-called secret churches, friends, are the fastest growing churches in America today.

225
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,760
Many of them are mega churches.

226
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:39,020
Churches that hold hundreds, if not thousands, of customers.

227
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,740
I won't call them believers because they don't have anything to believe in.

228
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,960
They've compromised all their beliefs away.

229
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,420
Yes, and the reason is because their church wasn't built on a rock.

230
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,340
No, friends.

231
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,300
It was built on the shifting sands of compromise.

232
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,400
Alas, it's not just the secret churches that are built on these changing foundations.

233
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,120
Religions across the globe are compromising away their most fundamental beliefs.

234
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,420
You know what I'm talking about.

235
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,880
It starts out small.

236
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,220
Some Jew starts eating pork.

237
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,780
And then some Catholic has an abortion.

238
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,960
The next thing you know, the Episcopalians want to marry the homosexuals together.

239
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,620
And then the, what is it, the Hindus start forbidding their wives from throwing themselves on the funeral fires.

240
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,380
I mean, what's the point of even having a religion if you're not going to play by the rules?

241
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,060
The rules!

242
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,300
The rules!

243
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,220
The rules!

244
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,780
Do you think God doesn't know when you're cheating on Him?

245
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:41,080
Do you think He's just going to turn a blind omnipotent eye on your sin?

246
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,140
No sir.

247
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,860
No sir, He knows.

248
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,200
And if you betray Him, then why should He betray you?

249
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,360
Oh, it's your choice, alright.

250
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,380
But stop and consider this.

251
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,640
Who is going to suffer more?

252
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,400
God or you?

253
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:01,380
You.

254
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,680
We.

255
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,320
We consider.

256
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:11,680
And that's why we, the church and the subgenius, are dedicated to not compromising.

257
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:23,160
That's why we, Bob's chosen few, have decided forever, never, to get in and become mainstream.

258
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:30,820
If you want mainstream, you can just go join any one of those other milquetoast churches that litter the landscape and refuse to pay taxes.

259
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,080
But don't come whining to us with your,

260
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,020
Gee, Bob, can't you tone it down just a little bit, attitude, because we're not interested

261
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,520
in winning the Nielsen ratings.

262
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:51,200
We don't care if you're disgusted by Jaina launching decapitated hits across the audience

263
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,960
with some bloody nine-iron.

264
00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:00,800
We don't care if you're nauseated by the ear-shattering anti-fascist

265
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:00,800


266
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:00,800


267
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:00,800


268
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:00,800


269
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,600
ideas, or your little squeaky left heart is all gone.

270
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,380
We don't care.

271
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:13,200
And we damn sure don't care if you're offended by my hate raps, because in short, we don't

272
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,360
care about you.

273
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,160
We don't care about you.

274
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:24,740
In fact, we're probably the only church of the so-called me generation, and probably

275
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:29,280
the only product for that matter, of the me generation, that does not care about you.

276
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,280


277
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,060
Yeah!

278
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:30,920
Yeah!

279
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,420
Because we care about Bob.

280
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,420
Yeah!

281
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,200
Praise Bob!

282
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,720
And if you don't like it,

283
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,160
then you can just go to hell!

284
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:40,940
Yeah!

285
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:41,640
Yes!

286
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,920
Because that's where Bob sins.

287
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,900
Those who compromise his church.

288
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,980
And in the word of Bob, praise Bob!

289
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:50,980
Praise Bob!

290
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,640
Oh man!

291
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,480
Yeah!

292
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,160
Those who pawn service can hear,

293
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,200
but they're the helping selves.

294
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,760
And when the tax man comes to the door,

295
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,800
the best will help him, so yeah!

296
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:44,020
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no villainous son.

297
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:49,240
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one.

298
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,540
Yeah!

299
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,800
Some folks can hear it in the stars,

300
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,040
but their eyes, they miss the insightful law.

301
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,400
Res lanes get powdered if I step one step further.

302
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,900
Be want last, be want more, more, more, more.

303
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,360
Yeah, it ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no villainous son.

304
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,520
Yeah, it ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one.

305
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,980
Yeah, it ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one.

306
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,160
It ain't me, it ain't me, I am the first son.

307
00:20:33,160 --> 00:21:03,120
I am the first son.

308
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,500
I don't know if they're in Dallas, but yeah, us, us, us, man.

309
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,880
Point one check complete. Radiation normal. No leakage.

310
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,180
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much.

311
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,480
I'm glad to know that we're not leaking again.

312
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,600
We had a terrible one last time.

313
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,960
Big nasty leak.

314
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,460
A leak in the mouth, probably, is what you might call it.

315
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,020
But let's...

316
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,300
Man, I'm beat from doing shows all day.

317
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,000
Not this show.

318
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,140
I did the last two.

319
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,420
Two weeks worth of shows today.

320
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,200
It's just the way we have to do things around here.

321
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,440
What's this? Oh, that's background music.

322
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:44,040
It's Cleve Duncan's background music in the background right now.

323
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:49,280
But I think we're going to whip over to Sister Susie the Floozy's subgenius show

324
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,580
from WREK in Atlanta.

325
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,320
Praise WREK and the lovely Sister Susie the Floozy.

326
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:01,500
Who has the very best background music choices in the world, I think.

327
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:10,220
Oh, welcome, welcome, seekers of slack.

328
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:15,960
Oh, welcome to Bob's Slack Time Funhouse here on WREK Atlanta.

329
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,880
Oh, I'm the breathless Reverend Susie the Floozy,

330
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,340
and welcome to our 31st show this year.

331
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,320
Oh, I'm your friendly neighborhood flock teaser,

332
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,020
the Reverend Susie the Floozy,

333
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,020
and, oh, I'm still on a highly spiritual roll

334
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,760
from the devastating...

335
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,220
...released at the Big Divival.

336
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,920
Oh, two weeks ago at Dragon Con,

337
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,840
and then the stellar stream of subgenius consciousness radio show

338
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,780
the following night.

339
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,160
Woo!

340
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,200
Being at ground zero for those vortex-stretching rituals

341
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,380
has served to recharge and reaffirm my ministry to you,

342
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,600
dear seekers of slack.

343
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,560
Oh, I've been losing sight of the fact

344
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,980
that this is, after all, a church here.

345
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,900
So let's all hop in the car,

346
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,000
and I'll try to remember where the inseminary is.

347
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,140
The old church had us,

348
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,500
and my dear억ed cousin,

349
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:13,960
my collar-stone darling,

350
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,080
my rosettita at the time

351
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,020
for yes Patino.

352
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:15,500
Now, all long Ob Hour!

353
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:15,760
We had

354
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,320
I like Sundays.

355
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,900
I sure wish Mommy and Daddy did.

356
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,960
You know, I've seen some men walking around today

357
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,000
with their hair so long,

358
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,300
they must think they're women.

359
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,000
Now, we all know our bodies

360
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,140
are the temple of the Lord.

361
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:38,380
So I ask you, would the Lord Jesus Christ want to live in a long-haired temple?

362
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,740
No, he would want a clean-cut temple.

363
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,560
And the congregation said, Amen.

364
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:51,220
Therefore, let the true men of God resolve to wear their hair above their ears.

365
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,280
Amen.

366
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:57,920
And let us all be standing as our featured quartet sings the song of encouragement.

367
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,920
A rich young ruler came one day

368
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,000
To ask about the narrow way

369
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,700
But his hair was long

370
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,280
But his hair was long

371
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,880
And he couldn't be saved

372
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,680
No, he couldn't be saved

373
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,720
So the preacher looked at him through tears

374
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,140
And said, Your problem's on your ears

375
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,780
If your hair's too long

376
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,420
If your hair's too long

377
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,120
There's sin in your own hair

378
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,980
There's sin in your own hair

379
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,480
If your hair's on your ears

380
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,920
There's sin in your own hair

381
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,560
There's sin in your own hair

382
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,880
Get a cup today

383
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,580
Get a cup today

384
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:48,220
And make an is not a happy good start

385
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,700
You'll live a life of fear and dread

386
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,060
There's a tangled mess upon your head

387
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,700
If your hair's too long

388
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,360
If your hair's too long

389
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,180
There's sin in your own hair

390
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,040
There's sin in your own hair

391
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,200
Take the kid out

392
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,920
My friend, my friend

393
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,640
If you would enter there

394
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,060
You'll not go there with your long hair

395
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,860
If your hair's too long

396
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,280
If your hair's too long

397
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,120
There's sin in your heart

398
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,860
There's sin in your heart

399
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:29,300
You'll be left behind with those out there

400
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,840
Who wear their hair upon their ears

401
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,300
If your hair's too long

402
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,880
If your hair's too long

403
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,580
There's sin in your heart

404
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,020
There's sin in your heart

405
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,460
If your hair's on your ears

406
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,700
If your hair's on your ears

407
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,360
There's sin in your heart

408
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,960
There's sin in your heart

409
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,480
Get it done today

410
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,200
Get it done today

411
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,880
Make a new start

412
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,540
A happy, glad start

413
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:55,300
A more meaningful life

414
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,120
With fear and dread

415
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,980
With a tangled nest

416
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,280
And a new life

417
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,760
Upon your head

418
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,320
If your hair's too long

419
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,060
If your hair's too long

420
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,080
There's sin in your heart

421
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,360
There's sin in your heart

422
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,040
Ah

423
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,360
Man

424
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,140
Thank you, Brother Blowforth,

425
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,080
for another inspired

426
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,400
message.

427
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,300
And now, for this week's

428
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:31,940
verse of meditation,

429
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,740
the dog returns back

430
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,680
to its own vomit

431
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,040
and the sow is washed only

432
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,160
to wallow in the mire.

433
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,940
We're glad to have each

434
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,800
and every one of you

435
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,720
at our service today,

436
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,100
especially the young folks.

437
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,040
There's going to be

438
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,960
a youth meeting tonight

439
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,840
after the assembly

440
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,760
and all you youth

441
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,520
need to be there.

442
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,540
We're going to serve

443
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,420
macaroni and cheese,

444
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,240
fish sticks,

445
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,260
and banana pudding.

446
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,540
Brother Blowforth

447
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,780
will speak on dating

448
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,380
and mating.

449
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,940
Is it fun or frustrating?

450
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,360
Should be real good.

451
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,500
Don't forget,

452
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,480
what happens on

453
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,020
Tuesday night,

454
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,560
Pew Packers.

455
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:00,900
That's right,

456
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,960
Pew Packers.

457
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:02,980
That's where we go

458
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,780
visit the sick,

459
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,360
afflicted,

460
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,020
and the backslid.

461
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,340
I'm a Pew Packer.

462
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,220
He's a Pew Packer.

463
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,080
She's a Pew Packer.

464
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,280
We're all Pew Packers.

465
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,160
Wouldn't you like

466
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,600
to be a Pew Packer, too?

467
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,340
Now, as you're dismissed,

468
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,480
shake the hand

469
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,060
of your neighbor

470
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,380
before you leave your pew.

471
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,120
Margaret!

472
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:18,860
Margaret!

473
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:19,480
Oh, Mary,

474
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,080
hear from the bird.

475
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,080
Whoa, whoa.

476
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,780
This is our cue to run.

477
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,820
This is one of those,

478
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,060
ah, repressive pink churches.

479
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,660
Oh, I've read about them

480
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,400
in the pamphlets,

481
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:28,900
but it's,

482
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,500
it's even worse

483
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,320
than I thought.

484
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,080
Oh, let's,

485
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,560
let's run down the street here

486
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,760
and see what we can find.

487
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,320
Hey,

488
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,840
I never heard

489
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,700
of the first church

490
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,820
of Bob's Your Dad.

491
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,800
I wonder what kind

492
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,860
of place this is.

493
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,140
Hmm,

494
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,100
let's walk in

495
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:43,540
and see.

496
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,160
Daddy started out

497
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,620
in San Francisco

498
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,040
tootin' on his trumpet

499
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,880
loud and loud.

500
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,140
He drank out a can Xbox

501
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:15,560
od un pouco

502
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:15,840
with a 53 cart

503
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:26,540
and had a high potassium

504
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,500
kiloblast guy

505
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,300
at the hospital

506
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:28,880
where he had a

507
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,980
headspace

Distant Galaxy Space Age Bachelor Pad music.

524
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,440
By the way, you know that term Space Age Bachelor Pad?

525
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,280
For this sort of thing that you hear in the background.

526
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,620
That was coined by an early subgenius apostle,

527
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,340
one of the original 13 apostles,

528
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,900
a Saint Byron Werner.

529
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,620
A Werner.

530
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,540
Yes, Saint Byron Werner.

531
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,660
Remember that name?

532
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:56,420
He's the god of Space Age Bachelor Pad music, really.

533
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,780
And Pope Irwin Chusett up there at WFMU in New Jersey

534

also is one of those self-same popes.

535
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,700
But for now, you know, I don't know where we're going with this show.

536
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:13,000
It's just lost its center or something.

537
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,440
And since it has, we might as well.

538
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,240
Well, why not?

539
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,780
We'll go to that Cleveland revival with that strange live presentation

540
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,940
of ESO radio on stage.

541
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,440
And interrupted by yours truly quite frequently, I'm afraid.

542
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,860
This is, well, I believe the intros are right up here at the front, friend.

543
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,900
We like them that way.

544
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,400
Oh, we're doctors.

545
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,800
Hey, Chaz, everybody always wanted,

546
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,120
well, they hear you guys on the radio all the time,

547
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,580
and they always want to know what you look like.

548
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,460
And Chaz Smith is over here playing violin.

549
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,280
Let's have a big hand for Chaz and his new look.

550
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,120
Yeah!

551
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,480
And this is the keyboard player.

552
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,080
His wife, Morgana.

553
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,400
Todd Bassoon.

554
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,560
And his trained baboon.

555
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,880
And Dave Guitaro.

556
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:23,500
Oh.

557
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,640
But we're not in the room.

558
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,380
It's the normal conspiracy, Ivan.

559
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,360
It's the corrupting, eating worms, Dave.

560
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,760
They're behind it.

561
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,600
But some of them are kind of cute.

562
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,060
The fuzzy ones.

563
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,760
Yeah, I like them fuzzy normals.

564
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,360
Oh, I like them in a pair of socks.

565
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,540
They almost pass for an abnormal, you know.

566
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,460
Hey, look, I mean,

567
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,480
wait a minute, I thought I was coming to like a church revival.

568
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,400
It was going to be preaching or something, right?

569
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:55,720
Yeah.

570
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:00,420
They were going to be doing some, some, but then I went to this thing and well, hell,

571
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,980
they had this underwear tacked on top of the walls.

572
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,500
And there were these people with, with these chains around their neck that were getting

573
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:11,240
signals from the radio broadcast out of the plate and lonesome cowboy Dave's head.

574
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:16,460
And they just appeared to be saying that they had a script that they were reading that floated

575
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,240
in the air in front of their faces that nobody else could see.

576
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:24,800
And they kept talking about this Bob thing, but it was just, it seemed like a rip off.

577
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,300
I mean, the.

578
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,080
I think for America, I never.

579
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,400
Pray for America to end tonight.

580
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,480
Hey, it's like.

581
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,140
Sit down and.

582
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,120
Bring your feet.

583
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,280
Stay your feet.

584
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,420
It's Dave the boo.

585
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,380
Pray.

586
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,760
Pray for America to end.

587
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:50,340
Pray, dear friends.

588
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,260
The lot would have.

589
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,000
I would have known to be.

590
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:55,220
So.

591
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,100
Remember, nothing more than.

592
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,140
The psychic.

593
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,560
Implants of fundamentalist Christian counselors.

594
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:09,200
A lot of the great majority of these people are under psychiatric counseling and the counselors

595
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,380
are very often fundamentalist Christians who reinforce their belief in possession.

596
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,920
Are you hurting today?

597
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,840
Is there a need in your life?

598
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,600
Are you hurting today?

599
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,020
Are you hurting today?

600
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:25,340
Are you hurting today?

601
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,960
I need helpful people to Prosper.

602
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:28,960


603
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,660
Disgraceful assault.

604
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:35,040
I need people to look from the perspective of, you know.

605
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,300
I need people to look from the perspective of kindness, forgiveness, detachment, momento and

606
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:39,100
Peterоче will just be giving out the Bible that went to God began to she real.

607
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:39,260
You understand?

608
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,100
That's just the law.

609
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,680
Its already validity say no, you've seen it.

610
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,020
Just follow the code.

611
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,120
That because we don't revolve.

612
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,280
Speaker 7 Yeah.

613
00:39:51,120 --> 00:40:00,500
I don't deserve this phone abuse, so please stay a while.

614
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,280
I work in the graveyard.

615
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,740
Work in the graveyard.

616
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:15,960
I work until the dawn of day.

617
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,320
I work for the CIA.

618
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,460
I work in the graveyard.

619
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,540
I work in the graveyard.

620
00:40:33,920 --> 00:41:00,480
I work until the dawn of day.

621
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,480
I work until the dawn of day.

622
00:41:30,500 --> 00:42:00,020
I work until the dawn of day.

623
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,480
I work.

624
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:05,480


625
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,580
Hey, Barbariba,

626
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,460
Hey, Barbariba,

627
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:21,660
Hey, Barbariba Yes, my baby

628
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,180
My superpower

629
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:30,100
Will be your graveyard.

630
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,380
Hey baby, you better go.

631
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:35,260
Look in the graveyard.

632
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,740
Yes, my baby.

633
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:48,280
Now mama's on the bottom and papa's on the top.

634
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,860
Baby's in the crane, she sure has poured it to her pop.

635
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:56,120
Hey baby, you better go.

636
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,400
Now these women, we are in it.

637
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,980
Hey baby, you better go.

638
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,680
We are the space of the moon and the space of the sky.

639
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,340
Oh my lord.

640
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,200
We are the space of the moon and the sky.

641
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:19,980
It was grace that taught my heart to...

642
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:25,120
Oh yes, that's a proper churchly setting for us, isn't it, seekers?

643
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:30,580
Oh, and looking out across my radio pulpit here,

644
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,760
I can see by that constipated look in your eyes that you're truly getting the spirit.

645
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,380
We are a scattered flock, to say the least,

646
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:44,520
but someone even more badly in need of guidance is coming to our realm,

647
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:49,640
a poor shepherd who has been out of flock fleecing circulation for quite a while.

648
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:55,120
I'd like to take this opportunity to invite our dear brother, Jim Baker,

649
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,100
to explain to you what it's like to be a shepherd.

650
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:56,100


651
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:56,100


652
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:56,100


653
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:01,860
I'd like to accept my warm invitation to come nestle in the bosom of our subgenius church here.

654
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:06,760
Oh, I talked it over with my funhouse co-pilot, the Reverend Microphone,

655
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,700
and he's all for it, too.

656
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,240
Brother Baker, we like the cut of your jib.

657
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:17,400
All that drinking and whoring and stealing was a perfect training for our faith,

658
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:20,340
even if you didn't take it far enough for my taste.

659
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:25,820
And your expertise in financial wheedling is just what we need to finance our subgenius,

660
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:27,880
and I'm sure you'll be able to do that.

661
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:29,340
I'm sure you'll be able to do that.

662
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:29,340


663
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,580
But wait, that's not all.

664
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:35,980
Oh, not only are we throwing in this nifty, inflatable Jessica Hahn love doll,

665
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:40,220
we offer up our own warbling little goddess, Ms. Marvel,

666
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,100
as your all-new improved Tammy Faye.

667
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:46,700
Oh, and we've got one of your air-conditioned dog houses

668
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,460
out in back of the station here for your honeymoon cottage.

669
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,820
So give us a call, Jimbo, and get in tight with Bob.

670
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,080
After all, this is a good time to get some air.

671
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:56,080


672
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,160
The church is where the action is.

673
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,280
Amazing grace

674
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,840
How sweet the sound

675
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:12,380
That a man so rich like me

676
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,680
Some fellas listen to the tenors

677
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,300
Other fellas listen to the bass

678
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,680
I always listen for the star notes

679
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,720
And amazing grace

680
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,080
Amazing grace

681
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,220
Believe me

682
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:33,520
Oh, and it certainly paid off big for you, didn't it?

683
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,000
Another reason to complain

684
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,640
Oh, yes.

685
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,700
Oh, beloved Ms. Marvel.

686
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,880
But right now, seekers,

687
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:44,160
we're going to try a little experiment here.

688
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,080
We've got a genuine exorcist here today,

689
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:51,500
a specialist in casting out what he calls the Jezebel spirit.

690
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:55,320
And, hey, it's not like there's a shortage of materials

691
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,060
to work with.

692
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:56,840
Here with me,

693
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:00,060
because I got a metric ton of Jezebel spirit

694
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,940
in a one-pound bag just busting to get out.

695
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,240
You about ready, Earl?

696
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,400
Hook up the exorcismotron.

697
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,460
Do you have a voice?

698
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,680
Yes, I hear voices all the time.

699
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,420
You do? Do you offer that?

700
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,000
Oh, honey, I'm reaped.

701
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,940
Possessed and possessed again and again.

702
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,460
You ought to believe I'm born again.

703
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:34,220
Honey, I was born right a Yeti the first time.

704
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,520
Okay, are you ready to deliver?

705
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:39,680
I'm ready.

706
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,860
Deliver me, baby.

707
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,740
Put your head under there.

708
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:45,660
If you can.

709
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,340
This is your lucky round.

710
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,640
Come on.

711
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,900
You have a Jezebel spirit within you.

712
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,980
Yeah, yeah, come on.

713
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,020
I got a Jezebel spirit.

714
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:56,060
Here it is.

715
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:56,540
You're the expert.

716
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,400
I ought to be tingling or something by now.

717
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,220
What's the deal here?

718
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:00,620
You have a spirit of destruction.

719
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,640
Yeah, it's a spirit of destruction.

720
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,340
Come on.

721
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,900
Come on, if you're any good.

722
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:06,800
Ha, ha, ha.

723
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,280
Ah.

724
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,920
At this point, I think we'd just better give up.

725
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,720
This obviously isn't working.

726
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,260
If this guy had any inside straight at all,

727
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,660
I'd be a smoldering pile of ruins.

728
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:26,040
Well, it helps me see which side my fate is in.

729
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:26,040


730
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:40,020
I guess my head is in the way,

731
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,820
so I better stop it.

732
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:45,440
I have to be there by the time I strike one.

733
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,140
Oh, if it's someone I know,

734
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,680
I'll Independently smoke them.

735
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:49,480
One more time.

736
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:49,480


737
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:49,480


738
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:49,480


739
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:49,480


740
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:49,940


741
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:49,940


742
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:49,940


743
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:50,260
Number of years my stay.

744
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,040
And the Russian government

745
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:52,040


746
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:52,320
olsun.

747
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:54,800
Stop it.

748
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:58,340
be no need for us to destroy the world

749
00:47:58,340 --> 00:47:59,040
in 1998.

750
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,400
Oh, but the odds of that ever happening

751
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,580
are beyond being merely astronomical.

752
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,820
These fundamentalists

753
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:08,520
never learn, do they?

754
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,120
Boy,

755
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:11,800
fundamental

756
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,480
is right. You take out

757
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,000
the fun,

758
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,880
then you take out the mental,

759
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,360
and all you're

760
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,280
left with is the duh.

761
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:24,840
The carrot,

762
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,400
they dangle in front of you

763
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,860
as the promise of inheriting the kingdom of God.

764
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,520
Well, I'm not sticking around

765
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,360
waiting for that old fart to die.

766
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,500
I'm blazing my own spiritual

767
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,600
path, and it leads into the rumpus

768
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,420
room of eternal slack with Bob.

769
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,080
Oh, but

770
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,260
what about Satan, you might say?

771
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,500
Oh, Satan's just a

772
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,460
middle management schmo. He's nothing

773
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,300
but a short-sleeved shirt clip-on

774
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,160
Ty Hardy's assistant manager

775
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,560
when you get down to it.

776
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:52,920
Oh,

777
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,200
and Jesus,

778
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,100
on 285 yesterday,

779
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,600
I saw painted on an overpass

780
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,860
pillar a message.

781
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,660
Benny Poole hates Jesus

782
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:04,800
for no reason.

783
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,680
Hey, hey, Earl, what's this fade-out?

784
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,340
Come on, come on, punch it up. Hey,

785
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,500
come on, I still got a lot of Jezebel spirit

786
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,860
to exercise here. Come on

787
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:14,700
before I kick ya.

788
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:15,920
Okay.

789
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,500
Well, yeah, the message said

790
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:21,300
Benny Poole

791
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,220
hates Jesus for no

792
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:23,840
reason.

793
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:27,500
Well, hey, I can guess the reason

794
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,300
this poor young man feels disenfranchised

795
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,980
from the faith forced on him.

796
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,260
It's because their Jesus just ain't

797
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,320
two-fisted enough for this hopped-up,

798
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,680
attention-deficit Arnold Schwarzenegger

799
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:38,980
generation.

800
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:42,540
Oh, the Jesus they give him is a

801
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,660
turn-the-other-cheek crybaby who wants

802
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:45,860
to take the blame.

803
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:48,420
He wants to make your sins

804
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,740
his, and then die for them,

805
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,000
to cleanse you of them, to take your sins

806
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,380
and your slack away.

807
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,700
Bob, on the other hand, is here to justify

808
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,300
your sins. He recognizes your sins

809
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,560
as your own unique spiritual baggage,

810
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,280
and he don't mess

811
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,180
with them. Your sins

812
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:08,160
are yours and yours alone.

813
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,320
They are your own business,

814
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,120
and Bob respects that.

815
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,240
He's not gonna take your sins away.

816
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,000
No, far from it.

817
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,320
Bob's gonna help you get more

818
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,040
sins.

819
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:22,080
Now, what could be better than that?

820
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:24,200
Oh, so I

821
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,180
suggest you just assume the

822
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,120
position seekers.

823
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,040
...

824
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:38,680
...

825
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:38,680


826
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:38,680


827
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:40,860
...

828
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:40,860


829
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:41,300
...

830
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,820
...

831
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:44,180
...

832
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:44,280
...

833
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:44,320
...

834
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:44,660
...

835
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:44,780
...

836
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:44,780


837
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,120
...

838
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:45,620
...

839
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:45,640
...

840
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:45,640


841
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:45,640


842
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:04,220
Yes, we have praying hands, dear friends.

843
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:09,240
And we have self-addressed envelope for dressing hands.

844
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:19,520
And I'd like you to use your hands to take down the sacred post office box number of the Church of the Subgenius.

845
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:19,900
Yes.

846
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:20,500
Yes.

847
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:27,960
You just write that little postcard or self-addressed envelope to Bob.

848
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,700
That's right, Bob.

849
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:42,760
At post office box 140306.

850
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:47,300
That's box 140306.

851
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:49,400
Dallas.

852
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:59,400
The Texas 75214.

853
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:05,380
Yes.

854
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,120
Go ahead.

855
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,100
What's the matter?

856
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:10,520
Are you afraid?

857
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,440
Go ahead.

858
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:15,700
Write for that free information from the church at P.O. Box 140306.

859
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:18,060
Dallas, Texas 75214.

860
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:34,300
Or you can try our brand new e-mail address at i.stang at metronet.com.

861
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:37,760
i.stang at metronet.com.

862
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,960
With those little periods right where we said to put them.

863
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,100
Hey, hey.

864
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:48,040
Well, let's go back and see what's happening with Lone Star.

865
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:48,260
Awesome.

866
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:54,680
Cowboy and Chaz and Michelle and Baboon.

867
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,580
There's these creatures that live inside certain microphones.

868
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:05,840
They don't like the church.

869
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,680
We are subgenius, boys and girls.

870
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,360
We cannot figure everything out.

871
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:17,920
You know this, Lone?

872
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,320
Now, this damn long tube has been creeping closer and closer to me all evening.

873
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,800
Yours will be able to do that someday.

874
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,700
I wish mine could.

875
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,000
Good night.

876
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:36,840
Good night.

877
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,300
Good night.

878
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:44,660
Good night.

879
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:46,100
Good night.

880
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:46,560
Good night.

881
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,320
Good night.

882
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:47,880
Good night.

883
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:47,880


884
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,240
talk about Jesus

885
00:54:48,820 --> 00:55:08,960
Jingle bells, jingle all ye sirs

886
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:17,360
Hey, talk about Jesus.

887
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:22,360
Hey, talk about Jesus.

888
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:27,440
Hey, talk about Jesus.

889
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:07,720
Thank you.

890
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,100
By Jesus.

891
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:33,560
No.

892
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:37,180
By Jesus.

893
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:41,260
By Jesus.

894
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,020
By Jesus.

895
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,400
By Jesus.

896
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,440
By Jesus.

897
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:35,920
By Jesus.

898
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,100
And now,

899
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,960
strangely enough,

900
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,640
a song.

901
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,080
By Dr. Legume,

902
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,160
Kid Ginzu,

903
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:01,980
and

904
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,000
Itch.

905
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,660
This recording reminds me of the old,

906
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,480
the old time subgenius bands.

907
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:10,820
It's like Doctors for Wotan or something.

908
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,620
It really does sound just like old,

909
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,400
old Doctors.

910
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:16,960
But it's kind of young Doctors.

911
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:19,100
Kind of young,

912
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:20,600
kind of wow, kind of now Doctors.

913
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:23,380
If they don't start singing pretty quick,

914
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:25,320
I'm going to just clip it.

915
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,460
I'm getting

916
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:36,320
You can'tNY

917
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:46,120
John

918
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:46,740
That's very

919
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,140
You're doing

920
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,940
We're getting

921
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:57,420
or

922
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,400
This train is bound for downtown, this train

923
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:04,200
This train is bound for downtown

924
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:07,020
Gonna run deep in this town

925
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:12,020
This train is bound for downtown, this train

926
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:24,540
Why do you think they call it subgenius, my friends?

927
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:37,400
This train, this train

928
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:42,020
This train don't carry no executives, this train

929
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,620
Got no ad fund executives, this train

930
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:51,060
This train don't cost no gold, no change

931
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,620
This train

932
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,240
This has got to be one of the all-time great

933
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,300
All-time great guitar solos there

934
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:15,060
This train don't go to Planet X, this train

935
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,060
This train don't go to Planet X

936
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:21,420
Cause they're just a couple of hands that will crack

937
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:24,580
This train don't go to Planet X, this train

938
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:31,500
Man, what a soulful rendition

939
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:34,540
Ah, friends
