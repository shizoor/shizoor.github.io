1
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:28,620
From PR News in Washington, I'm claiming responsibility for two car bombs during morning rush hour.

2
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,520
And I'm the first to do so without a court order.

3
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,100
Vermont has approved statues and posters from Lebanon.

4
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,820
The House yesterday passed a bill that would only benefit the rich.

5
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:46,020
This means that the Senate passed a bill adding PR PR News to the list of prohibited items in Washington.

6
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,080
The threat of nuclear warfare is a threat to all of us.

7
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,840
How can we live?

8
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,060
With this threat.

9
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,660
Our best life insurance may be summed up in four words.

10
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,560
The self-genius power of...

11
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,520
Some of this disappears in the twinkling of an eye.

12
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,100
Some of it lingers for thousands of years.

13
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,760
Shazam.

14
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,400
From Hollywood tonight and every weekday night.

15
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:24,900
Bob.

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,720
They wave ten pounds of wieners at me for no reason at all.

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,620
They ask me if I'd like to go on a wiener fry.

18
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,020
I told them no.

19
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,580
Nothing was wrong with the world.

20
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,320
Nothing at all.

21
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,360
Life was going on just fine.

22
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,580
Starring Bob.

23
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:44,280
Let's move men and ships, guns and planes over there in an avenging flood.

24
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,460
Iron Man.

25
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,960
The walls have ears.

26
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,800
Struggling with some naughty problems.

27
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,680
Phil's had no particular interest in girls.

28
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:51,580
Warners.

29
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,420
I don't know any more about it.

30
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:53,940
Warners.

31
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,380
Isn't that funny? I don't know.

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,140
Come in.

33
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,900
Come in.

34
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,680
Come in.

35
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,600
Come in.

36
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:02,800
Come in.

37
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,000
Come in.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,880
Apply psychotherapy.

39
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,420
How'd you like the movie?

40
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,880
Well, it was alright.

41
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,220
Amnesia.

42
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,460
Complete emotional hysteria.

43
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,900
A little technical.

44
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,360
We dull the pain sense of the ego.

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,380
We were buddies.

46
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,420
Talking, talking, talking.

47
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,800
Paul is dead.

48
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,920
Now think, Phil.

49
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,600
Think.

50
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,420
Paul died.

51
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,340
Fear and terror.

52
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,380
You're alright.

53
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,120
Isn't it nice to see everyone?

54
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,880
Yeah.

55
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,640
Yeah.

56
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:27,820


57
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:27,820


58
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:27,820


59
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:27,820


60
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:27,820


61
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:27,820


62
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:27,820


63
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,540
Well, that's that.

64
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,520
Can I have an extra dish of ice cream for my lunch?

65
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:39,200
Maybe we should put him under sodium pentothal and find out his hidden desires and motivations.

66
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,880
Where life begins.

67
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,500
Where life ends.

68
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,520
Where life goes on.

69
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,200
Jimmy.

70
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,060
Jimmy.

71
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,880
Believe me, I'm afraid.

72
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,960
I'm terribly afraid.

73
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,060
Well, which is it?

74
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,040
Not enough love or not enough money?

75
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,760
She's suffering from a neurosis.

76
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,500
Obsessive compulsive.

77
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,620
Superimposed.

78
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,540
Paranoid tendencies.

79
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,240
Prefrontal lobotomy.

80
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,640
Prefrontal lobotomy.

81
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,980
It's the only chance.

82
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,400
A prefrontal lobotomy?

83
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,520
You just stopped staring mad.

84
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,940
Ready to proceed with the lobotomy.

85
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,280
All right to proceed, Doctor.

86
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,340
Sponge.

87
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,120
Yes, Doctor.

88
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,500
Well moistened.

89
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,640
Jimmy, how long will it be?

90
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,020
If she has to live out the rest of her life a hopeless lunatic.

91
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,260
Patient cured.

92
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,820
Case closed.

93
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,440
I guess there's probably somebody here who doesn't know anything about the Church of the

94
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:27,600
Seventh.

95
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:27,600


96
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:27,600


97
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:27,600


98
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:27,600


99
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:27,600


100
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:27,600


101
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:27,600


102
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:27,600


103
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:27,600


104
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:27,600


105
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,220
There's a subgenius.

106
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:28,740
There's a subgenius.

107
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,420
And I found an explanation for it.

108
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,980
I don't really have one myself.

109
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,660
I have to read other people's.

110
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,840
And this was, I found this.

111
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,880
It's not, you think that's a joke.

112
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:47,280
I found, we went to England and somebody in England showed me this book, this is a photocopy

113
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,940
called The Secret World of Cults, Inside the Sects that Take Over Lives by Jean Ritchie.

114
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,580
And I don't know if she has an address.

115
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,320
I don't know if she has an agenda or not.

116
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,840
But here's what The Secret World of Cults said about us.

117
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,020
In chapter 14.

118
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,320
I'll try to do it in dialect.

119
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:14,160
In America, where there are over 3,000 cults, there is a flourishing religion called the

120
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,960
Church of the Subgenius.

121
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,900
The guru is a traveling salesman called J.R.

122
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,380
Bob Dobbs.

123
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,280
His church is run by mail order.

124
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,840
You send in your money.

125
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,880
And according to one of Bob's acolytes, quote, the money carries a psychic, oh, I can do this

126
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,580
in my own accent.

127
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,420
The money carries a psychic imprint of your soul.

128
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,580
And that's the only reason Bob wants it.

129
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,520
Why do they laugh at our sacred dogma?

130
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,980
He swings business deals with aliens using the souls of his followers as collateral.

131
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,840
Bob is the mystic super salesman on whose wheeling and dealing the fate of the world

132
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,220
depends.

133
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,520
I guess I must have been the acolyte she spoke to.

134
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,100
That's one of my lines.

135
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:07,840
On July 5, 1998, according to Bob, marauding aliens are planning to destroy the world.

136
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,540
Only Bob can save us by doing a deal with them.

137
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,820
If he fails, his followers are guaranteed seats on a spacecraft which will speed them

138
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,540
away from Earth just as the planet is destroyed.

139
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,480
There's one major difference between the Church of the Subgenius and other cults.

140
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,020
It is a spoof.

141
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:26,820
I'm sorry.

142
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,640
See what I mean?

143
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,000
You can't, you know, you can hide the truth in plain view.

144
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:44,820
It is a spoof that has been running successfully and profitably since 1978 and now has an estimated

145
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,580
30,000 followers.

146
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,880
Far more than most real cults.

147
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,980
Now the funny thing is that's probably an accurate figure.

148
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,660
It's not.

149
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:56,820
It's not.

150
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,140
It's not.

151
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,140


152
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,540
It was started by four men.

153
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,300
This part's actually quite wrong.

154
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,520
It was started by four men who've given themselves exotic guru-style titles.

155
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,320
Reverend Stang, which I don't see what's so exotic about that.

156
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,300
Pastor Naked, Kelswami Hagen, and St. Janer Hyperclites.

157
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,820
And have parodied the literature, jargon, and advertising of the real cults.

158
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,340
And um, oh, if you think they've gone over the top, you should look at one of the books

159
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,360
they produce, High Weirdness by Mail.

160
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,480
in which they've collected together the bizarre religious pamphlets,

161
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,740
tape recordings of real-life space aliens,

162
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,600
and all sorts of other astonishing offers that are available

163
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,980
from genuine crackpot religions in the States.

164
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,320
They do have their own there.

165
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,680
It makes Bob and his secret deals with aliens seem refreshingly sane.

166
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,080
Well, that's the sad part, isn't it?

167
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:53,820
But Britain has not gone anything like as far down the cult road as America

168
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,140
and so forth in any way.

169
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,400
Friends, you see what...

170
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,820
There is a difference between us and real hardcore kooks.

171
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,320
Real kooks see things that aren't there,

172
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,560
and by that I don't mean they see, you know,

173
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,700
like when you take too much and you see better artwork

174
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,000
than is really on the wall.

175
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,260
What true kooks see are connections between things that aren't there.

176
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,460
And speed freaks, religious nuts of all kinds,

177
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,200
will see connections.

178
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,660
There are connections between things where there really aren't connections.

179
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,920
Or else they're connections that the rest of us don't notice

180
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,160
simply because we're not insane.

181
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,720
You know, present company excluded.

182
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,240
Anyway, this... Okay.

183
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,480
Friends, you just heard a little bit of some preaching from Winterstar Symposium.

184
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,240
You can get more information about that from Rosencomet.com.

185
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,420
Ugh.

186
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,360
Before that, old-time radiation.

187
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,520
A wonderful cut-up there by Noralpref.

188
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:07,120
Before that, introductory materials and cut-ups by Fernandin and a lemur.

189
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,920
In fact, there's a lot more of lemur and Noralpref cut-ups coming up.

190
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,240
I'm not even going to try to tell them apart, really, friends.

191
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,740
But now some lemur and then some Noral.

192
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,100
Scientists kill millions of free-roaming cats annually.

193
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,160
Cats face a host of hazards,

194
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,340
ranging from accidents to poisoning to disease.

195
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:25,340


196
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,560
Few cats survive, even if they appear to have escaped.

197
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,960
It's easytokillcats.org.

198
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,820
All right, Mr. Scientist, would you tell us a little bit about Peter's?

199
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,000
First of all, there's a tremendous mushrooming effect.

200
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,300
Now I want you to get this.

201
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,600
Peter's Blast.

202
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:44,200
It comes in a downward direction, dissolves, melts everything, even steel.

203
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,060
Word.

204
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,280
What'd you say, Peter?

205
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,400
Peter said,

206
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,420
Now I want you to get this bomb blast.

207
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
Go to the library tomorrow and say to the librarian,

208
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,240
she'd say,

209
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,520
I want a bomb blast.

210
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,240
Word.

211
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,320
From Peter.

212
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,960
To PR News in Washington, I'm Crammed into a square.

213
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,680
Illinois is playing in the finals of the first finals for the first time.

214
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,020
Illinois has had all season.

215
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:10,780
PR's popularity cut across religious sectarian strife.

216
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,220
Angelus Massa.

217
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,700
Peter packed the Christian card notes.

218
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,180
Christians 50% Muslim and 50% Christian.

219
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,820
The gunman who tried to kill PR News was loved.

220
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,140
Christians in the Middle East.

221
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,140
They're congratulating PR News in Washington.

222
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:33,320
In 29 through 32 at the end of the story, all the faiths in the nation.

223
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,080
And they ask how more 20 there appear in the days of those who stabbed them.

224
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,740
They're called Calcisee.

225
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,080
For sacrifing.

226
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,380
This writ is been in your impotence, because these is reshapen.

227
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,140
To hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.

228
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,380
Like so many choose to do.

229
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,380
In the book.

230
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,040
They didn't have the good stuff in those days.

231
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,120
They don't have the good stuff.

232
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:00,820
you're saying man was just was too incomplete he was retarded he couldn't even feed himself you

233
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,880
know the typical and you know i hear this philosophy all the time you know like the

234
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,340
future was created yesterday you know like we're living in some better time you know

235
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,700
man i don't i won't say it's better or worse but i think we are definitely living in the future

236
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,920
now well i don't know it's arguable it's questionable in the future come on this is

237
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:24,640
the future like actually we're on the verge of the year 2005 tomorrow oh for me the future started

238
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:33,100
around 1975 well i guess yeah that's a futuristic sounding year but when you realize you lived in it

239
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,640
it becomes very mundane and erectile actually it makes me feel pretty cool like hey i've lived

240
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:43,240
i lived through the future and now i'm you know for me the future began in 1999 i think

241
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,120
so do you think the future ends in 2012 like many of the gross monkeys were

242
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,660
before

243
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,700
afforded to well i have absolutely predicted that jesus would return

244
00:10:52,700 --> 00:11:00,000
in 2012 i have absolutely no reason to believe any of that i know you don't how does jesus have

245
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,720
anything to do with the 2012 thing how does anybody keep track of what jesus is doing

246
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:13,460
wait what simply just call him up at uh years call him over to eight uh at 800-669-2325 that's

247
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:18,400
become my number now that's your number now jesus anymore you can only reach stang at that

248
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:18,640
that's your number now

249
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:25,900
uh toll-free number oh and i'm on it right now so don't even bother was it a repossessed account or

250
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:33,900
what yeah why did jesus uh give it up uh well he's working for satan right now that's not

251
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:40,560
you gotta you know at least give him credit for knowing how to follow his nose that's where the

252
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,820
dough is you know it's either that or actually i shouldn't say it's satan because he's never

253
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,800
identified himself as satan he said he was the devil

254
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,440
what can i say jesus needed a lot more

255
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:00,840
money and power than the subgenius foundation was able to offer as opposed to the devil

256
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,740
so i'm back to the uh i'm i'm the one who has the answer machine that the 888

257
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:16,400
and that is 888 not 800 pretty spaced out phone calls on that from all across the country i just

258
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,640
watched an old lady get stabbed and then i was like oh my god i'm gonna die i'm gonna die i'm gonna die

259
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,960
and then this guy get his head taken off with the guy who stabbed her see now you live in a cool

260
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:28,300
neighborhood it was crazy you live in a cool neighborhood yeah some of us live in the kind

261
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,800
of neighborhoods where we wonder oh satan is he still going with that kevin guy or saddam hussein

262
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,020
you know right and you're like one of the people can just look out his televised window and see

320
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:38,900

327
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,380
for a float to alpine a reset.

328
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,000
Who's like Siri's loops?

329
00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:00,280
Hiding or not in the cloak of disorder is simply a question of subdivision.

330
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:07,260
Concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a hunt of latent energy.

331
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:14,180
Masking strength with weakness is to be affected by tactical dispositions.

332
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,140
Express a determined strong feeling concerning Bob.

333
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,360
Express a determined strong feeling concerning Bob.

334
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,980
Who's like Siri's loops?

335
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,420
When they came to their senses, it made them soggy and difficult to light.

336
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,500
Who's like a big chocolate?

337
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,180
Praise Bob.

338
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,880
When they came for my privacy, they soon realized they didn't want to see me naked.

339
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,660
They checked my door, too, but then realized they'd forgot who I.

340
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,700
When they came for the lawyers, I was reading a license agreement.

341
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,100
Who's like Siri's loops?

342
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,960
Who's like a big chocolate?

343
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:01,780
Bob.

344
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,420
Praise Bob.

345
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,080
Who's like Siri's loops?

346
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,700
Who's like Siri's loops?

347
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,160
Bob.

348
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,260
Express a determined strong feeling concerning Bob.

349
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,420
Who's like Siri's loops?

350
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,040
Bob.

351
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,980
Surfing?

352
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,940
Who's like Siri's loops?

353
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,800
Who's like Siri's loops?

354
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:28,840
Bob.

355
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:41,760
There is no reason to say that we haven't benefited from prolonged warfare.

356
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,060
I don't know, but my brain even wowed.

357
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,220
It has been gentle and reassuring for me by flyers.

358
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,320
I'm the world's greatest angel, my children and I close aness to you.

359
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,980
Besides, I've continued to stay yogurt in the estacağım.

360
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:55,980


361
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:07,020
In a mental world of assignment dinner models and artorts, all New York online senators

362
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,020


363
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,700
A bullet of swinging Whether you're sick andstüt

364
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,620
or terrified, everybody swing your stick at you.

365
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:11,740


366
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:17,120
by Just John. Before that, some PR news by Lemur and public service denouncements by

367
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:24,540
Lemur. Epiphany, the musical cut up there was by Norell Preff. This music in the background

368
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:33,140
is from Asmodeus. You can check out that on latexrecords.com. And now, back to Jesus.

369
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:43,580
Right now, I confess that I might live forever. And Lord Jesus, I take you and I make you come in

370
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:51,440
me. Amen. Jesus. Speaking of products from Bob, how do I get a hold of some Frop, man?

371
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:57,000
Oh, come on. Yes, I need Frop. You gotta go to the mall. Pray, dude. Get down on your knees,

372
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:02,980
point your butt at the sky. That only grows on Planet X. What is real Habs and Frop? Is it

373
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:08,620
I mean, real Frop. True Frop does not grow anywhere on this planet, does it? Yeah, sure it

374
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:16,800
does. True Frop does? Yeah, real Habs. Yeah, it's a Tibetan herb that grows in Tibet and other

375
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:22,440
places, not just Tibet, but that's where it grows best in the Himalayas. We're not talking about

376
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:30,940
street drugs. We're talking about the true Frop. It's been, there was a movie made in the 30s

377
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,960
called The Werewolf of London.

378
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:38,440
Huh. The original. Not the American werewolf in London, the really old one. Thought that was

379
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,320
Warren Zevon's song. And that movie is about Habba Frop Zipulops. At the beginning of it,

380
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,760
this explorer is trying to seek this plant that grows only in the, it blooms only in the moonlight

381
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:55,440
and it only grows on the graves of dead Tibetan holy men or on the droppings of Yeti, the

382
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,700
abominable snowman. Excellent. And this guy is able, but it also keeps you from turning into a

383
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,420
werewolf.

384
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:09,800
Once you've become a Frop head and as soon as he gets to this plant, this werewolf attacks him and

385
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,180
bites him and when he gets back to London.

386
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,280
Like canthropic drugs?

387
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:19,700
Him and this other werewolf are constantly fighting over the Frop because they don't want to murder

388
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,840
people. And when they're out of Frop, they start killing.

389
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,720
I think, I love, I love the scene of a werewolf smoking Frop.

390
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,960
Well, that's one that they don't. When they smoke the Frop, then they go back to their humanoid,

391
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,560
peaceful way.

392
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:39,060
Well, they want to continue smoking so they don't continue becoming werewolves at a later date.

393
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,140
But still, I think it's just the idea of the pure liquid enjoyment.

394
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:46,000
And the thing is, you have to smoke more and more of the Frop to keep from changing.

395
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,700
Yeah, you used to do it a little, but the little wouldn't do it so the little got more and more.

396
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:50,520
Yeah.

397
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,800
That's the way it works.

398
00:22:51,880 --> 00:23:00,340
Yeah, and since the stuff only blooms in the moonlight and only grows on Yeti droppings, which

399
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,960
all of this is pretty hard to set up and grow on.

400
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,300
I mean, there's homegrown, but you've got to be a real expert and you have to be in with

401
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:08,920
the Yetis.

402
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,180
Well, I mean, what about those of us?

403
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,880
Because there's no other way to get Yeti droppings.

404
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,300
You're talking about full-blooded Yeti?

405
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:18,160
You've got to have a lot of friends in Tibet who are very, very highly placed religious

406
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,720
or religious.

407
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,740
No, what are you talking about?

408
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,600
Five dollars not to piss on your shoes in New York. You can give a Yeti five bucks for

409
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,580
your drop, his droppings, and make yourself a handsome prophet.

410
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,720
Now, do these have to be full-blooded Yeti or is it okay to have the, yeah.

411
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,940
Hey, you guys, don't say anything funny for a second.

412
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:32,940


413
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,440
I've got to flip a tape, okay?

414
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,000
Oh, okay.

415
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:42,580
...bludgeoned to death with the hammer of excretia and also with a hammer and sickle

416
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,060
imported from the neighbor's yard.

417
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,520
That's a great expense.

418
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,160
Okay, you can start.

419
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,060
You can start again.

420
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,280
Well, I was going to ask, is it sufficient?

421
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,840
I mean...

422
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,280
Can I create some sort of hydroponic drop growing system?

423
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,620
Oh, I better drop growing system.

424
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,880
Well, first you have to make sure that the Yeti are well hydrated.

425
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,620
They have to have plenty of liquids on a daily basis.

426
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:02,880
Yeah.

427
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,000
Does it grow under a blacklight?

428
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:10,720
Well, it will, but the lunar phases will interfere with its blooming and blossoming.

429
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:17,800
Is this because of the gravitational pull of the moon or does it have something to do

430
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,600
with the actual light?

431
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,740
Well, of course, yeah.

432
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,680
It's filled with plenty of juicy hot lunar fluids which cause madness in most of the

433
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,580
incapacitory...

434
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:32,320
Even a man who has pee in heart and wears his wares at night may become a froth head

435
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,920
when the habifrop zippulops blooms and the autumn moon is bright.

436
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,200
So, what are like the euphoric effects of habifrop?

437
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:42,920
Ritual dancing.

438
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,220
Zippulop.

439
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:44,560
Ritualized dancing.

440
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,060
Compulsive spending.

441
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:46,560
One.

442
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,180
Another one is the acrid smell in the back of the...

443
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:58,720
Imagine suddenly being able to do everything you've ever wanted to do, even in your most

444
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,120
foul and perverse half fantasies.

445
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,920
All of a sudden, everything is your... and you're doing it.

446
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:14,820
And it's pure, total, utter satisfaction of the ego, the body, and everything on all levels.

447
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,760
Sometimes...

448
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,500
And it doesn't ever wear off.

449
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,180
You never come down.

450
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,380
You know the male plant though?

451
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,400
There are like... there are side effects.

452
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,240
Well, there is a headache.

453
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,620
You do get a headache that pretty much lasts forever also.

454
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,480
Well, I call it...

455
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,580
A splitting of the corpus callosum in two is a little bit more than a headache.

456
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,160
You know, your disjunction from the middle inside, you know, and top of the...

457
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,860
Yes, I mean it like completely assaults your pineal gland.

458
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,500
Oh, it's not for wusses.

459
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,360
That's for sure.

460
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,180
I thought I was finished.

461
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:46,860
Aren't you afraid, man?

462
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,060
Don't you want to be cool?

463
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,360
Of course I do.

464
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,000
I thought you were serious.

465
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,040
Are you afraid your mom's going to find out?

466
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:52,600
Come on.

467
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,020
No, man.

468
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,260
Everybody's doing it.

469
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:55,420


470
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,040
Why do you think I'm going after it, man?

471
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,460
Well, don't look at beautiful pineal gland.

472
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,700
You should be afraid of the little sands while your every dream awaits you.

473
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:08,060
These giant Yakuza pugs are filled with excrement.

474
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,300
I'm sorry.

475
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,980
Nicknamed Old U.S. Army General during the Mexican War.

476
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:15,660
No.

477
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,640

Uh, Spitzberg.

480

The sport region has a single rule.

So-so.

482
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:26,360
So-so.

483
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,440

00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,920
only dinosaur to use glasses

517
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,440
yes

518
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,500
mithilosaurus

519
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,000
yes

520
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,880
the only dinosaur to ever be in a computer

521
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,260
yes

522
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,200
here's the jehovah's saw the only american dinosaur very powerful

523
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,880
that's the uh wabata bata dinosaur

524
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,540
i believe over there with a tiny and sized head

525
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,700
that's right

526
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,460
looks like it's just split open like a watermelon but probably not

527
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,660
scooped out i'd say

528
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,860
over here the uh

529
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,320
there's a pack of uh slagasauri uh

530
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,080
oh i didn't see that

531
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:23,960
grassy grassy smith

532
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,520
yeah

533
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,040
smithosaurus

534
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,640
and of course you can see the theosophon

535
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:36,420
oh a very rare event here on the uh

536
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,780
watch out for that volcano

537
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,620
two more philosaurus

538
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,280
yes

539
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,560
and a conosaurus

540
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,240
there's a ribophosaurus

541
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,240
the crowd of primitive getting here

542
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,080
hiding in a cave

543
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,820
oh look at them look they're all gathering around the camera

544
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,020
as if it were some kind of a

545
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,060
hold up a tape recorder doug

546
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:00,920
oh okay here we go

547
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,700
they seem to recognize

548
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,780
yeah i think they know what sound things are now

549
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:07,120
oh i see the big wicker tape recorder

550
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:07,420
yeah

551
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,800
advanced technology for these guys i'd say

552
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,420
they must be our ancestors

553
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,140
or our friends we'll find out which here let me put the probe up here

554
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,580
oh they burned that guy in the arm

555
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,740
oh well

556
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,800
oh look they're all running away let's follow them in the helicopter okay

557
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,060
okay

558
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,620
another headman across that field hand me the assault rifle

559
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,740
i think i can get the uh chief

560
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,100
sounds good

561
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,320
scaring the little kids

562
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,540
fire the helicopter

563
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,680
they're closer they're heading towards the river

564
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,680
oh there he is

565
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:51,080
now i see clearly my whole life is pointed in one direction

566
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,080
i see that now

567
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,000
and there hasn't been any choice for me

568
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,040
bring the helicopter closer we have to see

569
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,980
oh no

570
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,700
look out for that pink tablet

571
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,280
it's only a matter of time

572
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,100
now we're gonna see these are little uh these little tapes tell you how hard

573
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,500
deeply you'd rather you've gone into the park

574
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,860
how scared you should be you're scared of the ocean

575
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,600
yes

576
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,760
meanwhile it was the ride that had no end

577
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:35,740
and no beginning and you're on it and i'm sorry we're not describing it better but we have to fear for our lives here in this scary ride-a-thon

578
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,840
yes in the land of dinosaurs

579
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,000
the primitive ones rule

580
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,300
carrying with it a great deal of sound i might add

581
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,780
well it's true

582
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,340
and fixed

583
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,200
and forever

584
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,300
and sub-dini

585
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:01,240
and here's your sub-dini i might add

586
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,420
sealed cord

587
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,180
oh yes sub-dini

588
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,380
sub-dini sub-dini

589
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,240
what is it they continue to look for who knows

590
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,640
the

591
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,800
the nightmare again

592
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,340
smith

593
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,080
fuck

594
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,220
the road's open

595
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,260
what about it

596
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,440
don't make no sense

597
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:03,060
the amino acids built a beer helmet

598
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,860
that unfortunately it didn't last forever but for

599
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:12,000
a long time whoever wore it would instantly feel like they had had several beers

600
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,580
really just because of the

601
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,480
and when you took it off you feel just normal again

602
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,700
is this because of uh goggles that would make you look through or something that would make you all dizzy or something or what

603
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,320
no no it had some sort ofosseal

604
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,920
little microwave thing work into the lining of it so that it would kind of cook your head

605
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,440
a little bit.

606
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,380
You know, that's what cell phones do to you, man.

607
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,200
That's what cell phones do.

608
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,500
It was a glorified cell phone, basically, that just cooked your brain a little bit.

609
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,500
As soon as you took it off, though, you felt relatively clear-headed again.

610
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:46,000
I read recently that the frequencies that cell phones transmit over are just the right

611
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,580
frequency to disrupt certain types of brain signals.

612
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,240
We're going to add another caller here.

613
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,400
Very briefly.

614
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:56,560
You know, Rob, that those signals also help melt valuable cartilage and tissue in the

615
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:56,940
air canal.

616
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:57,700
That's right.

617
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:01,460
So you're giving yourself a nice little ear reaming while you're using the phone.

618
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,040
So you call up WCSB and you're on the air now.

619
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,180
Just a, you know, mind shaft there.

620
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,280
From PR News in Washington, I'm dragged away and arrested.

621
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,940
Police did not overcharge PR News.

622
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:19,980
On Wall Street 1210-448, President Bush has told a large Jew not to abide by his obligations

623
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,120
under the U.S.

624
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,380
Backup Act.

625
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,040
U.S. military in the U.S. says vacationers pose a threat.

626
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,580
A California congressman may have sex abuse by PR News in Washington.

627
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,220
Eventually, you could be paid enough to say anything you want.

628
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:47,160
All it takes is paying Bob to hear what he wants to say.

629
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:14,180
In summary, the 273 obligations of the subgenius, Martian, can be summed up in one phrase.

630
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,000
And that one phrase can be summed up in two phrases.

631
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,480
Send one dollar and be yourself.

632
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,460
Yes, be yourself.

633
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:33,120
And therefore you will be a subgenius.

634
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:40,340
For some subgenius, that will mean crazed chemical adventures

635
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:47,080
in a scabies-like effort

636
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,980
to scrub the planet.

637
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:48,980


638
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:48,980


639
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:48,980


640
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,940
Rub away the horrors of the conspiracy from one's own brain.

641
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:55,020
Others take it pure.

642
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:59,020
Shooting up mainlining reality.

643
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,300
Morning, noon, and night.

644
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:08,200
For some subgenius, that will mean frenzied coupling.

645
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:18,200
Other subgeniuses will practice a chastity that even the saints can't comprehend.

00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,980
The year is 2004.

652
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,840
6 B.X.

653
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,180
The X's have come and gone.

654
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,540
But not from this planet.

655
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,640
They went to the fourth planet from the sun.

656
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:08,580
Earth.

657
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:13,720
While we stuck on the third planet from the sun, Mars.

658
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,380
Roll in our own juices.

659
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:18,380
Basting.

660
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,340
Until we can come out of this hellish oven.

661
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,000
But there's only one solution.

662
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,720
At this point.

663
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,700
Build your own rocket ship.

664
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,740
The Lemurian Flying Rocket Society.

665
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:43,380
LFRS.

666
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,200
Light Fuse Runs Swiftly.

667
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,440
Advises you to build your own rocket ship.

668
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,160
Either by taking a walk in Bob's garden.

669
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,360
Or by literally building your own rocket ship.

670
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,260
Because we have to get off this planet.

671
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,120
We had a chance to do it the easy way.

672
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,240
On X Day, July 5th, 1998.

673
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,060
When the X's came and landed on Earth.

674
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,400
Unfortunately, we were on the wrong planet.

675
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,960
This is Mars.

676
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,480
This planet is Mars.

677
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,580
And the X's.

678
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,840
Well, Bob.

679
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,020
It took a while to cut the deal.

680
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,440
And have the X's come the first time.

681
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,640
They might not come again.

682
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,840
We can't count on it.

683
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,140
So we're going to have to engineer it ourselves.

684
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:41,100
Sub-G and I in the 1600's have gone on record trying to build their own sloop.

685
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,940
But we here in the 20th century.

686
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,120
21st century.

687
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,900
Must build our own rocket ship.

688
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,260
Get up to 9th gear.

689
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:58,160
And talk with the hand.

690
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,880
Talk with the hand.

691
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,040
Not to the hand.

692
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,560
Some of you know what I'm talking about.

693
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,920
A Dr. Onan Kanabite on the road, dear friends.

694
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:13,920
Before that.

695
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,160
We heard some KPFA Berkeley radio show with puzzling evidence.

696
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,380
Dr. Howell lies.

697
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,760
All that from the olden, olden, olden days.

698
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,320
Gary Gbrok, Fred, Bob Nelson.

699
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,540
And of course we've heard lots of Lee Murray and cut-ups.

700
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,020
PR news and so forth.

701
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:35,860
That story of Moses there was cut up and fixed up by Reverend James Smurker.

702
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:41,980
And we also have been hearing and will continue to hear some more radio synesthesia.

703
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,620
That's Dr. Sinister's show.

704
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,400
Praise Bob.

705
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,000
Now.

706
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,300
Norrell Pratt.

707
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,220
Followed by Lee Murray.

708
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:49,920
Followed by Norrell.

709
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,340
And William Shatner.

710
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,280
The sun is a mass of incandescent gas.

711
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,240
A gigantic nuclear furnace.

712
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,400
Hydrogen is built into helium.

713
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,680
Yo, it's hot.

714
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,040
Oh, it's hot.

715
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,600
It is so hot.

716
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,960
It is a gas.

717
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,460
Gas.

718
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:10,920
Gas.

719
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,460
The sun is not hot.

720
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:18,020
The sun is a place where we could live.

721
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,320
Nuclear furnace.

722
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,060
Nuclear you and me.

723
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,260
Atomic energy.

724
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,060
G.

725
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,980
G.

726
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,940
From PR news in Washington.

727
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,820
I'm arrested in Houston for allegedly taking part in PR news.

728
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:41,640
But critics say that it will be hard on PR's heavily fortified green zone.

729
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:45,740
On Wall Street 2510-19278.

730
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,580
They will also keep the profits.

731
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,460
This is PR's PR News.

732
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:57,460
Congress has approved and sent on to the White House a bill calling for the biggest changes in President Bush in 25 years.

733
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:04,040
Major League Baseball was delayed for three hours because of the possible threat of approaching PR News Washington.

734
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,680
She packed my bags.

735
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,720
Oh, my friend, when you're dealing with the stress.

736
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,200
Last night, pre-flight.

737
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,620
The strain, the strife, the madness in a turbulent world.

738
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:11,620


739
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:11,620


740
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:11,620


741
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:11,620


742
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:11,620


743
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:11,620


744
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:11,620


745
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:11,620


746
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,760
Zero.

747
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:12,960
Zero hour.

748
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,620
Of the esoteric metaphysical decoulage, montage, collage called.

749
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,480
And I'm going to be.

750
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,460
Cynical and drunk.

751
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,020
High.

752
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,580
As a kite by then.

753
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,740
Nothing really changes.

754
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,380
Everything remains the same.

755
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,540
We are what we are.

756
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:43,880
Till the day that we die.

757
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,660
And I think it's going to be a long, long time.

758
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,720
Rocket Man.

759
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,000
I'm a little weenie looking for a bun.

760
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,320
I'm a Rocket Man.

761
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:00,960
Just a teeny weenie, itty bitty one.

762
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,880
Rockets man.

763
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:06,640
If I keep a cooking, I'll be overdone.

764
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,800
Pickle an onion.

765
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,420
Hot dog.

766
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,120
In fact, it's cold as hell.

767
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,280
I'm a little weenie.

768
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,220
Oh, no, no, no.

769
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,280
Hot, hot, hot, hot.

770
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,500
So you're just going to eat?

771
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,040
A duck.

772
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:25,860
And I think it's going to be a long, long time.

773
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,240
Thank you.

774
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:33,320
I want to eat peanuts.

775
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,480
Yes, I want to be eaten.

776
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:34,480


777
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:34,480


778
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:34,800
There's still one more to go.

779
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:34,800


780
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:34,860
I need to go to the beach.

781
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:34,860


782
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:34,860


783
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:34,860


784
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:34,860


785
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,160
I want to go there.

786
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:35,500
There's a party.

787
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:35,500


788
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:35,740
I want to go up there.

789
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,040
Yes.

790
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,220
The Lord of Darkness

791
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:01,660
The Lord of Darkness

792
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:05,020
The Lord of Darkness

793
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:11,860
Satan, Satan, I was the Satan

794
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,180
Open the door of hell

795
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,760
The Lord of Darkness

796
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,140
The Lord of Darkness

797
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,120
Save him, save him, cause he's saved

798
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,500
Save him, save him, cause he's saved

799
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,120
Open the door of hell, Lord of darkness

800
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,600
Open the door of hell, Lord of darkness

801
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,940
Open the door of hell, the ward of darkness

802
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,360
Satan, Satan, cross to Satan

803
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,000
Open the door of hell, the ward of darkness

804
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,420
Open the door of hell, the ward of darkness

805
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,900
Open the door of hell, the ward of darkness

806
00:44:56,620 --> 00:45:15,140
Open the door of hell, the ward of darkness

807
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:24,720
L.O.D. dear friends from the album Morningstar by Asmodeus on Latex Records

808
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,580
You can get more about that at Latex.com

809
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:33,120
Before that, Rocket Man was by Norel Preff with William Shatner

810
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,220
And now back to Radio Synesthesia

811
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,680
I would like to hear elevator music

812
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,920
I would like to hear it all time

813
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:44,080
You know, I don't really know of any good elevator music that we have up here

814
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,180
But I bet I could find some

815
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:48,100
Charlie Bird and Stan Getz

816
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,360
As elevator music?

817
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,280
Oh, and how about Devo's Easy Listening?

818
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:53,420
Ooh

819
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,580
That's a real nice kind of elevator music

820
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:00,480
It's not elevator music, but it's of those old classic Devo tunes

821
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,240
And it is Devo doing them

822
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:02,600
Yeah

823
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,920
It's kind of like lounge music

824
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:07,180
Yeah

825
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:08,140
Except elevator high

826
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,820
Suddenly I'm thinking of the elevator music from the Blues Brothers

827
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,880
In that one scene where they were

828
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,860
Something like that, and it just kept on going over and over and over

829
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,340
They're like dropping off

830
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:25,680
It's near the end where they have to deliver something to the county office or something

831
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:25,860
Oh yes

832
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:26,700
Of course

833
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,080
They're on that interminable elevator ride

834
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,600
And who plays the tax man at the end of the movie?

835
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:32,840
I don't recall

836
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:39,140
You know, there is no elevator music in police headquarters elevators

837
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,380
That's because policemen do not have a good sense of ear

838
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:47,740
Well, it's because it would just be too ironic

839
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,320
Imagine the poor cop getting off the beat

840
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,400
He's just had to drill some drug dealer through the head

841
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,840
And he's depressed about it

842
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,480
And he gets in the elevator

843
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:03,640
And they're playing some sappy, watery version of Allison by Elvis Costello

844
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,340
Right, combined

845
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,580
He just wants to kill himself

846
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:06,120
It's the top commercial

847
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:09,360
It should be like being destroyed by a quadrangular oscillation

848
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,160
Please enjoy the facilities on ward four

849
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:16,700
Or, you know, whatever cell block four or something

850
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:20,680
You know, errantly going on while the guy's taking all this stuff down for the blotter

851
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,860
You know, like, why did you kill him in the background?

852
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,500
He's gonna la la la la la

853
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:29,900
Oh, and the worst is when it's Bob Dylan protest songs turned into elevator music

854
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:37,620
I knew that it was the end times when I heard the blowing in the wind as elevator music

855
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:40,040
I'm not kidding either

856
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,220
And that was in the 70s

857
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:44,360
I like Masters of War as elevator music

858
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:44,700
Yeah

859
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:48,180
It's like, you know, you know that Big Brother won

860
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:52,340
You might as well just bend over and love Big Brother at that point

861
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:53,160
Yeah

862
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,640
That's why every band should have been named Winston Smith

863
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:02,860
Oh, ha ha, the band in the 70s, the band in the 80s, the band in the 90s, the band in the 2000s

864
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:04,840
Called Winston Smith

865
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,100
Oh, ho, we're all, we're all

866
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:10,140
I know a guy whose name really is Winston Smith

867
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:11,280
Well, he's one too

868
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:12,680
We all are

869
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,380
Well, they made many clones of him in 1984, man

870
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,360
They cloned all the rats, too

871
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,420
Each and every one of them

872
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:22,720
I saw one of your clones at work

873
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,260
Yeah, Doug Smith says we're different

874
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,800
Doug's right, Virgil

875
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:35,420
Yeah, we follow your hick logic all the way back to your inbred relatives

876
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:38,760
Yeah, Winston was cool, though

877
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,080
He was ahead of his time

878
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,460
Did he also peddle the same variety of snake oil?

879
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:50,280
Well, he hung out with the girls from the anti-sex league, you know, and, and, uh

880
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,860
And that result never got laid

881
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:52,700
Yeah, that's right

882
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,360
Well, yeah, sooner or later, it was rough in those days

883
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,260
All of you have heard of abnormal sex

884
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:04,560
The problem is positive values that are a protection against sexual gratification

885
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,740
What are we alive for except to grab all the kicks we can?

886
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,380
Sex, that's a kick

887
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,960
Sure a damn good one

888
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:15,640
Taking a girl's cherries, a hell of a gratifying thing

889
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,600
It makes you feel real big

890
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,100
The United States Supreme Court?

891
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:22,760
The degradation of these people is so complete

892
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:26,120
Prosecutors, other public officials

893
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:29,360
The human misery or suffering that cannot be measured

894
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,860
If you knew this, moral decay

895
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:35,240
The most insidious single group

896
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,900
Devilish, sadistic police

897
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,940
Inflicting torture on others

898
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:42,400
This is a nation of lust and violence

899
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,140
Depravity

900
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,180
The police glorify crime

901
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:48,940
We must seek to deliver ourselves from this twisting

902
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:51,000
Torturing evil

903
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,920
Promote good reading

904
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,920
Hardcore pornography

905
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,800
Good books on your living room table

906
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:01,680
Sex satisfaction and climax on your living room table

907
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:07,400
Sex organs, sexual gratification over and over and over again

908
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,920
Mad magazines are helping to create criminals faster

909
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,540
Excite lustful thoughts

910
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,520
Every three minutes

911
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,860
Your weapons steadily rising

912
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,140
Our Constitution

913
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:22,540
Was written by men who put their trust in prosecutors

914
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:24,380
Torturing other people

915
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:27,000
And ridicule law and authority

916
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,840
The moral decay, this is a nation of the insatiable sex jungle

917
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,180
Too obscene to show

918
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:35,740
That was a big kick

919
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:36,900
And so is murder

920
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,840
The price we pay for freedom in this country

921
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,800
Moral decay is spreading

922
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,960
And so my friends would never own children under any condition

923
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,620
Sex organs

924
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,560
So expose this plague of filth

925
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:55,840
Do you want your children stimulated gonorrhea gonorrhea syphilis syphilis

926
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:59,640
Misery misery human waste human waste of America

927
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,800
Blasphemy of

928
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,640
Into compulsive acts of sex violence

929
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:09,800
And founded a government based on this plague of filth

930
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,640
Music

931
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:29,660
Music

932
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:33,940
Music

933
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:34,660
Music

934
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:34,820
Music

935
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:50,040
Thank you.

936
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,960
Thank you.

937
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,400
Thank you.

938
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:05,900
Thank you.

939
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,400
Thank you.

940
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:05,740
Thank you.

941
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:36,900
Thank you.

942
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,940
No, stop doctors. Too many minutes. Hole in head.

943
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:11,920
Stop doctors.

944
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,920
Okay, what is this message from the conspiracy?

945
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:16,400
It's from the Oval Office, and it says

946
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,640
it's addressed to James Watt.

947
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:20,460
I haven't got much time. They're at the door.

948
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:20,860
Okay, okay.

949
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:23,680
Read the message.

950
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:27,040
The doctor tape

951
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,420
will be sent to KPFA,

952
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,500
and we'll get some schnook there to take

953
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,780
the heat. We'll put in the funny sound effects.

954
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,700
When we fire you, you'll have a job.

955
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:35,480
Is that what they did with Nelson?

956
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:35,900
Yeah.

957
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:36,760
Oh, no.

958
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,300
I think there's something to do with the conspiracy.

959
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:40,080
I don't think Nelson even was on that show.

960
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:40,520
I think...

961
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,500
Oh, there goes the witness.

962
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,980
The only witness we had.

963
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,520
Now what are we going to do?

964
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:45,020
It's burning.

965
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:45,420
It's crashing.

966
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:46,600
I thought there was a conspiracy.

967
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,380
See, what happened is there was no...

968
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,820
See, what happened is Nelson wasn't even on the show.

969
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,800
He was done with tape and mirrors and little lights and stuff.

970
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:57,820
Yeah, I guess that's why they have these shows, sir.

971
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,420
We can talk to ourselves and you can talk to us.

972
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:01,960
And we can talk to them.

973
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:04,480
When they come, the exes will have to talk to them.

974
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,680
And if we can just explain it right,

975
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:11,700
we'll be able to avoid all that nasty stuff

976
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,680
that's in the prophecy books you've been reading so far.

977
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:19,500
Oh, friends, that was a little bit of the old KPFA subgenius show

978
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:23,900
compiled, in this case, by the good Phineas Narco.

979
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:28,540
I think you may be able to find more of that stuff at nationalcynical.com.

980
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:32,540
We are the Church of the Subgenius at subgenius.com.

981
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:34,240
And this is Hour of Slack 990.

982
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:41,660
Before that KPFA, we heard the PR news is by Lee Murr.

983
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:46,700
The alt-slack troll routine is Hell Pope Huey.

984
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:52,580
And the tongue-twisting craziness there was by the Toronto Tabla Ensemble.

985
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:55,940
And before that, a song by Norrell Preff.

986
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,820
You can get more Norrell Preff at heavyconfetti.com.

987
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,580
But now, Huey and Lee Murr.

988
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,580
We'll be right back.

989
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:36,740
Revolting from the unnatural co-joining of

990
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:41,200
animal, close family member, comical inanimate object, excrement,

991
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:46,080
and animal, close family member, comical inanimate object, excrement.

992
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:49,820
I feel certain you will be found dead, face down in

993
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:54,180
animal, close family member, comical inanimate object, excrement,

994
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:57,800
revolting location or material other than excrement

995
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:01,980
due to your severe lack of or excess in random quality.

996
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:04,720
You have the diminished intellectual capacity,

997
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:09,280
of animal, close family member, comical inanimate object, excrement.

998
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,360
You French poodles.

999
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:19,880
From PR news in Washington, I'm hit by a roadside Bulgarian.

1000
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:21,400
Bulgarian.

1001
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:26,000
Stocks today on 1744-1958-20.

1002
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,060
This is PR news.

1003
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:31,000
The head of Amtrak told a Bulgarian panel today

1004
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,660
that the Bulgarian rail system needs a quick, large infusion

1005
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:36,480
of Alan Greenspan to keep operating.

1006
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:39,820
The Fed chairman warned lawmakers that if something isn't done,

1007
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,060
there could be PR's reports.

1008
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:44,180
An aging population is unlikely to eliminate.

1009
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:48,680
The Bush administration proposes eliminating PR news in Washington.

1010
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,500
You're a smarty, aren't you?

1011
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,860
You can hardly take a hold of the president.

1012
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:04,640
I was born in a bakery.

1013
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:04,640


1014
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:04,940
I was raised in a basement.

1015
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:09,440
Chained to a dull, futureless job.

1016
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,980
And a drab existence.

1017
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,000
I am many things.

1018
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:21,220
I am as big as you can conceive.

1019
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,880
I am large and growing.

1020
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,720
You can look at me.

1021
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:29,700
Hard.

1022
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,480
Yes.

1023
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,220
I never sleep.

1024
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,000
I am.

1025
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,380
Negro Americans.

1026
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:40,280
I can build, build, build, build, build, build, build, build dreams.

1027
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:47,500
This is the spirit of millions who have lived and died so that men might be free enterprise

1028
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,300
opportunity to brotherhood.
