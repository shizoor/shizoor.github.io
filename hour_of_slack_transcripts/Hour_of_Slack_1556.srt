1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
Ladies and gentlemen, please do not panic, but scream! Scream for your lives!

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:07,740
Mob?

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,700
It's loose in this theater, and if you don't scream, it may kill you.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,140
Scream! Scream!

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,040
Keep screaming! Scream for your lives!

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,480
It's here! It's over here!

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,300
Mob?

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,000
Let a man or woman venture from the well-beaten path of civilization.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,800
Let him cross the threshold of the limited intellect,

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,680
and he encounters amazing, wondrous things,

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,500
the unknown and terrible.

12
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,400
If he escapes these weird adventures with his life,

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,540
he will usually find he left his reason behind him.

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,280
Perhaps that is what happened to these two souls,

15
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,920
lost in the great Mexican desert.

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,580
But then, ask yourself,

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,600
why would anyone,

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,040
trod from the usually well-traveled roads of this modern age,

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,380
from the luxury of an air-conditioned automobile?

20
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,660
A prairie squid.

21
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,520
That's prairie squid dropping.

22
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,140
Oh, the, uh, the desert, uh,

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,840
they have a poisonous sheath

24
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,840
that irritates the skin, so...

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,060
Well,

26
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:25,460
heh,

27
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:25,460


28
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:25,600
heh,

29
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,160
Randy sure told him, didn't he?

30
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,760
Can you imagine the delight on their faces when he pulled his panties down,

31
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,700
and there was the ogle stick that Grandpa had promised?

32
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,520
Ha, ha, talk about an oblique gesture.

33
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,500
Some say he was stumped that way from the day he was born.

34
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,520
Others say he'd been headed that way all his long and miserable life.

35
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,240
But, as they sat him down into his virtual moment chair,

36
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,220
for his last virtual moment in this here virtual life,

37
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,160
all he could think of was,

38
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,840
as the monitors dimmed was Mom's frozen apple pie.

39
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,380
Three hundred pounds of it,

40
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,060
sitting on his lap.

41
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,900
His hair's getting hairier.

42
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,260

43
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:08,260

46
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,340
We enter and the door is sealed behind us.

47
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,700
Captain's to passengers.

48
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,880
Fasten safety belts, please.

49
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,760
We're preparing to blast

50
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,880

51
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,840
Four

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,560
Two

54
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,240
One

55
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,260
Rocket away

56
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,680
Rocket away

57
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,240
Rocket away

58
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,720
Fly rocket to the moon

59
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,860
In just eight minutes

60
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,260
The earth behind us

61
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,920
Looks like a giant balloon

62
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,000
Captain, captain

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,960
Stop the rocket

64
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,840
I left my wallet in another suit

65
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,460
It isn't in my pocket

66
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,140
You won't need your wallet here

67
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,500
A thousand miles from the atmosphere

68
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,640
It's not a nightmare that's going to end

69
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,560
It's just beginning because it's inside me

70
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,320
I put a gun in my mouth and blew away my vast knowledge

71
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,140
Some critter's been getting in here

72
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,560
Chewing up the hogs

73
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,520
Killed one of the mules too

74
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,120
Tore her head all up

75
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,420
And her brain

76
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,840

Limbo

80
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,280
They say that I'm sleaze and elitist

81
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,540
You please everybody

82
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,760
Disagrees with my rap

83
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,620
It's rap

84
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,740
I'm horrendous

85
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,620

86
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,440
My ratings now are falling

87
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,140
Cause I'm so full of bull

88
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,100
So full of crap

89
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,900
Full of crap

90
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,740
With condescending crimes

91
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,700
Making money

92
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,620
Selling lies

93
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,480
You might say

94
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,380
Everybody hates my guts

95
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,240
Hates his guts

96
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,120
I'm offensive

97
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,200
I'm a bigot

98
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,960
I'm a fraud

99
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,940

00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,020
I'm a sexist

101
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,400
Racist

102
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,240
Homophobic

00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:02,940
That's right

111
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,920
You're being scammed

112
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,100
I'm a nazi

113
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,040

114
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,400

115
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,440
cuz I'm a fat conservative

116
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,240

118
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,880
He's a fat conservative butthead

119
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,400
With a face of a horse's ass

120
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,960
I have a sub-human figure

121
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,520
a huge rear end

122
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,540
My brain?

123
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,580
That's another story

124
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,820
That is quite another story

125
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,920
I'm fake

126
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,320
The size of a washtub!

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,460
And my ass is as big as Missouri!

128
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,300
Yes!

129
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,400
This bastard is sick, he's a fat mom,

00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,560
His dick and his ass is as big as Missouri!

131
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,380
Yes, sirree Bob!

132
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,160
Manipulating statements exaggerate the truth.

133
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,940
I can't believe the hate my show inspires.

134
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,220
The hate my show inspires.

135
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,780
It's not just because I'm stupid,

136
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,680
It's not just because I'm scum,

137
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,400
It's just because Republicans are liars.

138
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,600
Those dirty filthy liars.

139
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,640
I am heartless, I am vain, insensitive, insane.

140
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,560
They say that I'm a national disgrace.

141
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,700
Disgrace!

142
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,600
I am nasty, insulting, basically revolting.

143
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,020
I'm a concentrated pile of human waste.

144
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,800
Because I'm a Nazi.

He's a Nazi!

148
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,600
That's right, you're being scammed.

149
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,100
I'm a Nazi.

150
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:14,960
He's a Nazi!

151
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,800
I don't care about the middle classes,

152
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,780
I'm a sick Republican sleazeball,

153
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,460
With the face of a horse's ass.

154
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,580
He's a sick Republican,

155
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,400
Sleazeball!

156
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,080
With the face of a horse's ass.

157
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,860
They say that this is not about my vanity.

158
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,760
They doubt my sanity.

159
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,400
They think I'm nuts.

160
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,400
So nuts.

161
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,060
I am a cyst on the ass of humanity.

162
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,120
Ew.

163
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,740
New Republican slogan,

164
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,620
Read my puss.

165
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,900
Read his puss.

166
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,320
From the bowels of a ball-taker,

167
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,640
Comes the voice of Rush Limbaugh.

168
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,200
In closing, let me say,

169
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,060
That each and every day,

170
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,180
I'm an evil, rotten, egotistical snob.

171
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,800
Evil rotten.

172
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,920
I'm the coppo.

173
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,760
The coppo.

174
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,540
Joe McCarthy like Gestapo.

175
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,340
The right wing foam-of-the-mouth, jack-booted slob.

176
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,120
The Democratic Trash-it.

177
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,840
Years of liberal bashing,

178
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,740
With the equivalent compassion of a grommet.

179
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,640
A grommet.

180
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,200
With the IQ of a fig,

181
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,020
I'm a fat, obnoxious pig.

182
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,840
And the truth of the matter is,

183
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,840
I'm vomit.

184
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,740
He's vomit.

185
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,720
Because I'm a Nazi.

186
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,580
He's a Nazi.

187
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,280
Street hot!

188
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,160
I really am.

189
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,280
Because I'm a Nazi.

190
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,200
He's a Nazi.

191
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:24,880
Street hot!

192
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,040
You're being scammed.

193
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm a Nazi.

194
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:27,820
He's a Nazi.

195
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,540
I don't care about the middle class,

196
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,460
Because I'm a fear-mongering scum.

197
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:31,740
Fat.

198
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,300
With the face of a horse's ass.

199
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,640
He's a fat, conservative,

200
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,260
Butt-head.

201
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:35,540
Hey,

202
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,620
Super-Publican,

203
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,100
Sleazeball.

204
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,700
Fear-mongering scum.

205
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,000
Fat.

206
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,820
Egotistical ass-bite.

207
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,040
New-spirited,

208
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,980
Hum-wallering,

209
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,700
Fat, conservative,

210
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,280
Puss.

211
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,220
With the face,

212
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,740
Of a horse's ass.

213
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:49,700
With the face,

214
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,760
Of a horse's ass.

215
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,880
Make a dildo, Rush.

216
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,140
I hate you. I hate you.

217
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:23,820
Leave the floor.

218
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,320
Leave the floor.

219
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,840
Be afraid. Be afraid. Be afraid.

220
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,300
We are. We are only here to help.

221
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,360
You are a good consumer.

222
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,620
Blessings of the people. Blessings of the state.

223
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:12,600
We are only here to help.

224
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,940
Bend over. Bend over, human, and let us help.

225
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,700
And get ready for cultural warfare.

226
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,800
We're coming to your town.

227
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,420
Jesus is coming to your town.

228
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,200
We're the colonial purpose.

229
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,820
Get down on your knees and cry.

230
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,760
We're just here to help.

231
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,860
Praise Jesus.

232
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,060
Praise Jesus.

233
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,300
And to help you better, we must destroy you.

234
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,440
To save the town, we had to destroy it.

235
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,600
To save democracy, we had to destroy it.

236
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,880
To save the world, we must destroy it.

237
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,500
Destroy!

238
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,360
One, two, destroy!

239
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,620
Good job.

240
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,780
Hey man, when you're saving the world, why don't you save me a little piece, you know?

241
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,780
And then you can like blow up the rest and let me have some fun.

242
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,420
To carve up a world.

243
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,020
To carve a worm.

244
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,900
To carve a worm as neatly as one might carve a stick of bowtie.

245
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,480
To carve up a world between the corporations.

246
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,540
Which means between my friends.

247
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,540
And my friends' friends.

248
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,460
And here they are at the Monaco Parlor Ballroom.

249
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,680
This is a very exclusive place.

250
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,140
Inhabited and frequented by only the one percent of the one percent.

251
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,500
There's Mrs. Rockefeller.

252
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,620
Ready, stage left.

253
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,100
Oh, there's Mr. J.

254
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,220
Oh look, his skin cancer's much better now.

255
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,900
Look, there's Mr. Morgan. He's getting on in years.

256
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,160
Yeah, he's still got that terrible club foot though, but he'll be fine.

257
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,460
He's got more money than I need.

258
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,840
Somebody tell Dave to shut us down.

259
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,600
Oh, there's the Anheuser-Busch's.

260
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,480
I think we have one of the Dursetants underneath the bushes.

261
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,340
We're getting ready for the curtain.

262
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,120
There he is. He's by the curtain.

263
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,340
He's hiding in the Anheuser-Busch.

264
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,260
Sir, don't let me.

265
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:20,980
Get him, too.

266
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,160
Boom.

267
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:22,740
Crack.

268
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,440
Got it.

269
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,160
Crack.

270
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,000
What?

271
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:25,920
Crack.

272
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,500
Crack.

273
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,060
Oh, damn.

274
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,880
Thanks, Chaz.

275
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,260
Way to go.

276
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,440
Friends, that Rush Limbaugh song.

277
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,280
I don't know who Rush got to help him with that.

278
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,600
Although, I got it off of alt.binary slack via time control, friends.

279
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,100
Time control.

280
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,000
And that's what this hour number 774.

281
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,100
I'm going to do.

282
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,360
Of slack is about.

283
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:54,500
Time contain a whole stye full of Connie types.

284
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,740
Full of time control.

285
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:02,740
And show collisions will, of course, include KPFA puzzling evidence and G Gordon Gordon

286
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,680
Gary broke friend.

287
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,060
It's a lot less talking to any tape.

288
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,240
I know it's difficult if you haven't ever called up a radio station before and talked

289
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,300
to just a dumb old tape.

290
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,180
And here it is, an eight track tape answering you.

291
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:14,480
Yes.

292
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,200
But you can't believe you're talking to an intelligent machine player.

293
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,060
I know this is your future.

294
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,100
Your phones will act like us very soon.

295
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:21,800
Any question?

296
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,600
Bob will miss five.

297
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,460
Yes.

298
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,560
Seven, seven, six, two, four, three, eight.

299
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,080
Okay.

300
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:28,780
But that's your Bob.

301
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,560
That's right.

302
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:29,960
Yeah.

303
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,680
Bob is her guy.

304
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,620
I hear the sound.

305
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,020
Oh, yeah.

306
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:47,180
Our love will never fade.

307
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,180


308
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,180


309
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,180


310
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,180


311
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,180


312
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,180


313
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,180


314
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,180


315
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,180


316
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,180


317
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,180


318
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,820
Our love will never die.

319
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,540
Bob is my guy.

320
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,180
Bob.

321
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,440
Bob.

322
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,360
Bob.

323
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:55,900
Bob.

324
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,060
Bob is my guy.

325
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,540
Oh, yes.

326
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,360
Yes.

327
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,040
Yes.

328
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,340
This is stochastic resonant Bob.

329
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,280
Bob.

330
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,700
Bob.

331
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,360
Bob.

332
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,340
Bob.

333
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:15,920
Bob.

334
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,540
Bob.

335
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:16,580
Bob.

336
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,160
Bob.

337
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,160


338
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,160


339
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,160


340
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,160


341
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,160


342
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,160


343
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,160


344
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,160


345
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,160


346
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,500
Everything's digital here.

347
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,480
We're not live.

348
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,320
That's why we can't take any calls.

349
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,520
This show has been entirely on...

350
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:42,360
Basically, you have to use the digits of your right or left hand to operate anything on this show.

351
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,960
That includes move the turntable around with your fingertips.

352
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,440
But we don't use turntables.

353
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,380
We only use broken tape decks here on the Hour of Slack.

354
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,640
And friends, praise Bob, a tape deck can be smashed to pieces.

355
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,820
But if it's needed for the Hour of Slack, it will...

356
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,780
Friends, Bob, it's best to have a front zip you lops, doctor.

357
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,540
Oh, yes.

358
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,060
Has this ever happened to you?

359
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,600
Why, it should have been there, Ted.

360
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,420
It was great.

361
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,540
There was free booze, great music, one of the best parties I ever went to.

362
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,080
Where were you that night?

363
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,180
I just kind of stayed home and watched TV.

364
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,040
I guess I should have gone, huh?

365
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,600
Didn't you feel stupid?

366
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,340
Didn't you wish you could go back to that?

367
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,400
That night, that party.

368
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,700
Well, maybe now there's a way to learn how to do that very thing.

369
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,840
Introducing Bob's School of Time Control.

370
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,760
At Bob's, you'll learn how to speed time,

371
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,640
slow time,

372
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,200
and make time run backwards.

373
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,120
But most importantly, you'll be learning how to make time work for you.

374
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,360
How, you may ask.

375
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,620
Well, just ask this man here, an actual graduate of Bob's School of Time Control.

376
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,060
One day, my dog ran out in front of a truck.

377
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:41,800
Blango.

378
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,000
My dog was dead.

379
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,880
Was I sad till I met Bob.

380
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,540
Bob.

381
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,420
Bob showed me how I could...

382
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,480
Go back, get the registration number for the car,

383
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,940
do a slip job on the brakes,

384
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,940
and wouldn't you know it,

385
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,280
that truck went off into a ditch and burst into flames

386
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,280
just exactly a block before he could hit old Booger.

387
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,020
Ain't that right, fella?

388
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,120
Yes, just imagine the horrible things

389
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,480
that could be undone tomorrow

390
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,380
if you had only gone to Bob's School of Time Control today.

391
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,420
Courses start yesterday, but you can catch up.

392
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,680
Just right.

393
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,920
Bob's School of Time Control.

394
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,660
The universe.

395
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,660
Bob's School of Time Control.

396
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,020
A division of Subgenius Industries Unlimited.

397
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,260
Subgenius Industries Unlimited.

398
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:15,920
He...

399
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,520
stopped to watch for a few seconds.

400
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,300
Oh, hell.

401
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,920
Look, if he starts this thing, he won't be able to stop it.

402
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,100
It's immortality.

403
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,200
With a price more costly than death.

404
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,900
The world stops spinning and the clock stops moving,

405
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,360
but something's still ticking and wearing on the inside.

406
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,180
And every time you let it go like I'm doing right now,

407
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,660
you can feel the wear.

408
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,660
I know from 342 years of experience

409
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,680
that time control can only go awry.

410
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,260
So please, for his own sake,

411
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,580
tell the bastard to knock it off.

412
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,620
What if you could turn back the clock,

413
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,400
even on...

414
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:16,420
...the clock?

415
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,120
...on Earth...

416
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,420
...and start over again?

417
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,400
You know, would the same things happen?

418
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,060
Wouldn't you go back in time and kill Hitler?

419
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,700
Even though he might be the very one who killed the man who would destroy the entire world?

420
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,720
The first lizard.

421
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,240
No, say you could go back in time.

422
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,060
Okay, I would risk...

423
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,780
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

424
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,940
I would go back in time.

425
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,740
Say you could go back in time to when the first lizard evolved.

426
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,280
Kissed Hitler.

427
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,360
Kissed Hitler.

428
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,680
Because we're really evolved from the lizards, right?

429
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,660
Okay, we're still lizards.

430
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:46,320
So you kill the first lizard and it's some other form of life that comes on.

431
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,880
Not a lizard.

432
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,240
Not specifically...

433
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,000
Maybe a polyp.

434
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,260
Not specifically a lizard.

435
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,480
Maybe a polyp.

436
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,000
Perhaps an insect-based intelligent life.

437
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,260
Polyps come out sometimes.

438
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,800
A hive queen, a Friday Jones species.

439
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:03,160
Okay, say our polyps were evolving at a rate that was so rapidly fast that we could not control it.

440
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:08,200
Would you go back, in a Hitler suit, like one of those first characters, a one-celled creature,

441
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,120
start your own jail and kill the polyps?

442
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,660
Would you step on that butterfly to make everything be spelled wrong?

443
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,860
And live you as Americans?

444
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,160
Would you do it?

445
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:28,100
Brace yourselves together with these mighty hernia braces designed by my cousin Lou and I.

446
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,780
Would you play frisbee with God?

447
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:39,000
Stand firmly and fastly in front of the rest of your renegade crew and laugh like dogs until the cows return.

448
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:43,260
Everybody has to eat shaving cream once in a while.

449
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,420
That stuff comes right out of the center of the earth.

450
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,880
And straight into our supermarkets.

451
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,720
The yellow sons of bitches.

452
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,940
They took their own lives.

453
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,520
Call me bastards, you cheated me.

454
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:04,520
When I was out among you, I always believed, as you did, that time exists in a sequential pattern.

455
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,280
One day following another.

456
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,500
One year after another.

457
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,940
Each century following the previous one.

458
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,920
But it's not like that at all.

459
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,860
Steve, you know what this is, don't you?

460
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,220
It's a time space warp.

461
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,400
I felt a communication.

462
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,260
A series of images.

463
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,180
After which I knew what was happening to us.

464
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,560
And I knew our fear was unnecessary.

465
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:43,380
Try putting an electrode soaked in saline solution on your head and another one strapped to your leg and then slamming two thousand volts between them.

466
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,020
If it hurts, let me know.

467
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,840
I have never seen anyone so terrified or so unable to release her fear tensions.

468
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,920
Are you screwing up my karma?

469
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,680
He must still be in shock.

470
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,020
All he does is sit around all day bobbling about some seven foot monster.

471
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,580
Even fish do it.

472
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,280
But what do they do?

473
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,520
In today's modern world.

474
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,320
In the year 2006.

475
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,920
Fish not only do it.

476
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,940
They do it in style at the downtown arena.

477
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,060
For moms and dads and kids alike.

478
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:25,460
It's done regularly in the water you're drinking right now.

479
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,200
So sit back, plop an ice cube and put those feet up on the chaise lounge.

480
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,020
It's time for the Sponge Patrol.

481
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,780
The fish are doing it, huh?

482
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,140
I don't like to watch this.

483
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,920
The fish doing it reminds me of...

484
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,460
Bob.

485
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,560
More recalcitrant.

486
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,080
More flaccid days.

487
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,860
Oh, I remember Bob and Connie on Valentine's Day.

488
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,480
The little bat-winged hearts.

489
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,240
You could almost see them.

490
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,580
Well, psychics could see them flying between Bob and Connie.

491
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,040
As they walked on the sidewalk hand in hand.

492
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:04,680
I could hear.

493
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,620
Pantsless and panties and skirts.

494
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,460
The boats going up and down the Seine.

495
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,640
You can hear the singing of the boat guys.

496
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,860
Bob with his funny little beret cocked on his...

497
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,700
The side of his...

498
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:20,260
Oh, look, he's wearing a funny little shirt with a nipple cut out so he can drink the wine and let it fall where it may.

499
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,220
No.

500
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,620
Like what I already did.

501
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,540
Or shopping for butt plugs.

502
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,820
A long way sacre de mer.

503
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,640
Ah, le sacre de mer.

504
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:33,980
Let's go over to Montparnasse and see if we can find those green butt plugs with his sequins.

505
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,220
They're so hard to find.

506
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,860
Yes, and we shall commit some paintings and some artwork.

507
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,040
Ah, we will commit...

508
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,700
And we will go to see Jerry Lewis movies.

509
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,780
Ah, the Jerry Lewis movies.

510
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,480
And we'll listen to Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

511
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,560
He also is a genius.

512
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,080
Ah, yes.

513
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,020
I love Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

514
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,020
True American stupidity.

515
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,800
Only the American can be so brilliantly stupid.

516
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:03,860
I listen to the audition all the time and believe me, for my limited anglais, I can tell you these people have no idea what they're talking about which makes them so funny.

517
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,380
Oh, la la, more truffles.

518
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:11,700
Hey, let's stop down by the river and have our feet crushed and sing a morality song from the Middle Ages.

519
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,200
Ah, ooh la la.

520
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,180
Ah, I remember those days well.

521
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,860
I remember when the Saracens attacked the city.

522
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,180
Oh, I'm sorry.

523
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,280
I'm going to flush myself.

524
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,800
I'm going to flush myself.

525
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,320
I'm going to flush myself.

526
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,100
I'm going to flush myself.

527
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,420
I'm going to flush myself.

528
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,320
Are you ready, Isia?

529
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,200
Oh, oh, oh.

530
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,560
Sit down and stop yourself.

531
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,520
Sorry, I was wool gathering.

532
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,820
The virtual moment is almost expired.

533
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,580
I wonder if you want more time.

534
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,260
Yes, please.

535
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,060
One thing, Waiter.

536
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,200
What country is this?

537
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,940
Well, at the current time with the checkpoint and also...

538
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,040
That's the other thing.

539
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,820
What time do you have?

540
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,700
What day, by the way?

541
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:03,740
Well, I'm afraid I have to make a terrible mess here and stop for a brief moment.

542
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,320
I don't recognize those cars.

543
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,400
What year car is that new one over there, Waiter?

544
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:09,860
Yes.

545
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,880
Uh, is, uh...

546
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,380
It's a brand new 1934 S4.

547
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,580
Oh, uh...

548
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,800
Brand new, eh?

549
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,500
Oh, man.

550
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,980
Time control.

551
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,560
It was just like the old man said.

552
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,320
Time control must always go awry.

553
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,840
I was a fool.

554
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,240
I was a fool to follow Bob and his insane plans.

555
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,660
He was like a madman.

556
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:46,620
Throwing these glass beakers and his Tesla coils back across the laboratory in a rage.

557
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,560
Trying to bring life to the battery.

558
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,280
Then finally he got it plugged in.

559
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,120
Then...

560
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,400
Oh, my God, man.

561
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:01,800
I thought that surely he was just a crackpot, a kook, a madman.

562
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,320
A madman.

563
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,660
But yet...

564
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,080
Obvi...

565
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,360
What?

566
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,860
Here I find myself in 19...

567
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,350
1934.

568
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:13,630
Some little town in France, I guess it is.

569
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,230
Ah, whistle while you work, monsieur.

570
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:16,930
I, uh...

571
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:21,330
I spill the wine in my forehead all over my lady's lap and all over your forehead.

572
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:21,730
I...

573
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,130
What is that in your forehead?

574
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:23,610
Time control.

575
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,690
Oh, what, what?

576
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:25,930
Oh, my God.

577
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,250
The clock.

578
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,210
Ah, a bigger mess.

579
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,690
Ah, this is wonderful.

580
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:31,250
I...

581
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:31,410
Wait a minute.

582
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:31,710
I...

583
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,210
I'm...

584
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,230
Let me look at this mirror over here.

585
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,610
Wait a minute.

586
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,510
The clock is...

587
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,290
It looks...

588
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,170
A quarter.

589
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:39,270
Why does it look a quarter?

590
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,090
Why does it...

591
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:45,510
No, it looks right in the mirror, which means it must be installed in my head in...

592
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,370
Backwards...

593
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:46,530
Do...

594
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:46,530


595
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,090
So that it will look right in a mirror.

596
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,370
What have they done?

597
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,850
What did Bob do to me?

598
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:51,970
Ah, Bob did nothing to you, my friend.

599
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:55,090
He put this stupid clock into my forehead.

600
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,590
Just relax, monsieur.

601
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,250
Everyone has this stupid clock in the forehead.

602
00:22:59,550 --> 00:22:59,710
What is that?

603
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,450
What kind of insur...

604
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:00,750
What...

605
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,810
I mean, was this supposed to be a show?

606
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:02,490
What kind of insurance?

607
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,770
It's not a show, monsieur.

608
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,650
It was just supposed to be a show.

609
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,150
Miss, I am afraid you have used up your entire virtual...

610
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:09,150


611
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:09,150


612
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:09,150


613
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:09,950
Bob was like a monographer on the internet.

614
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,270
Please get out of the...

615
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,010
And he said go over there and push the button.

616
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:12,650
Yes, yes, yes, monsieur.

617
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,410
Next.

618
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,770
And I pushed the button and then...

619
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:15,510
Next, monsieur.

620
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,410
I'm sorry.

621
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,190
Your virtual moment is over.

622
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:18,730
No, no, Miguel, out of...

623
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:18,770
Don't...

624
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:18,830
Don't...

625
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:34,010
Extraterrestrials, fact or fiction, Star Wars, fantasy or reality, millions wonder.

626
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:39,130
Presently, millions of ETs are under the control of a being who is cunning, fearsome, and

627
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:39,130


628
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:39,130


629
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:39,130


630
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:39,130


631
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:39,130


632
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:39,790
ешеers.

633
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:49,190
Hypously confused, I wonder if they've gotten used up to them all.

634
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:53,390
They clad in aналиangels.

635
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,470
Prosperous vilainie.

636
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,030
Never forget the

637
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:55,030


638
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:58,970
While we're at the end of the show, a big

639
00:23:58,970 --> 00:23:58,970


640
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:07,750
We're in are on Spiece and really want to know

641
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,670
if this is anything in a good way.

642
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,910
And get ready for a shot.

643
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:18,830
The music that they're planning to use to crumble the morals of America

644
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:25,190
is a rotten, filthy, dirty, lewd, lascivious junk called rock and roll.

645
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:33,830
Indus' destructive forces take their life in causing tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and blizzards.

646
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,470
All three call the rock circle.

647
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,750
Every major city from coast to coast.

648
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:48,650
Satan flies away and gives us a prayer.

649
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:55,090
Hallelujah, hallelujah, help us to soothe our fire.

650
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:03,590
A satanic jamboree by Jupiter Research, friends.

651
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,590
Before that new Monet Clippy Snips of bad film,

652
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:10,170
ESO Swamp Radio with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chan Smith,

653
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:16,870
and yours truly, Falling For Toby, clips from the film by Idnax Stang.

654
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:21,870
Bleepo did Bob's School of Time Control, and it's miraculous, friends,

655
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:27,670
as was the Tucson subgenius devival called The Oasis of Slack.

656
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:31,150
Sponsored by Tucson's own Reverend Crawford Smith,

657
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,770
as featured now in this special.

658
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,230
Report.

659
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:41,410
I'm going to post eternal salvation for 30 bucks, subgenius.com.

660
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:41,970
Stop that.

661
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:45,570
If I was the other people in that chat room, I'd be going,

662
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:48,570
oh, no, it's one of those subgenius creeps.

663
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,650
They're stupid Bob people.

664
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,670
Oh, God.

665
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,850
Speaking of stupid Bob people, man,

666
00:25:54,990 --> 00:26:01,010
I just got back from a devival in Tucson where a very mysterious thing happened.

667
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,470
It's difficult for our modern world.

668
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,550
Statistics and electronics to accept miracles.

669
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:12,770
But you could almost call this a miracle, a genuine miracle.

670
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:19,110
Out of hundreds and thousands of square miles of heat and seared wasteland,

671
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:23,370
where the vultures wait for the other vultures to die.

672
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,110
The desert of death.

673
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,410
And it hurts.

674
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,110
It really, really hurts.

675
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,330
It's horrible.

676
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:33,810
It's horrible.

677
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,730
It's agony that begins and increases.

678
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,750
That's how you can tell it's a scorpion.

679
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:47,430
Aren't there the tiny little Arizona scorpions that scamper up your urethra?

680
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,490
Tail first.

681
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:54,690
As if daring you to try to squeeze them out.

682
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,390
This is the oasis of slack.

683
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:03,190
I got off the plane and here we are.

684
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:03,790
We're here.

685
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,210
This is the oasis of slack.

686
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:07,810
But I don't see the oasis.

687
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,830
And I don't see the...

688
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,770
I don't feel the slack.

689
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,810
Maybe the of.

690
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,430
I guess this is the of.

691
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,610
I don't know.

692
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,670
I don't know.

693
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,010
The of is the of.

694
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,270
I don't know.

695
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:37,270


696
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:37,270


697
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:37,270


698
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:37,270


699
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:37,270


700
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:37,270


701
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:41,570
The first mysterious thing was that Chicken, John and Mongoloid showed up all the way from

702
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:42,190
San Francisco.

703
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:50,810
With that 12 foot high 3D Dobbs head made out of wood frame, chicken wire and paper

704
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,550
mache and a blow torch.

705
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:53,910
That's the way I like it.

706
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,390
A giant Dobbs head.

707
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,650
Now, they were going to...

708
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,610
They really just had to get rid of it.

709
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,930
the damn thing. They built it

710
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,170
a year ago and it had been rotting.

711
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:04,090
The whole barbecue average.

712
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:06,510
What do you do with a giant 80 foot tall

713
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,210
Dobbs? You take the face

714
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:09,490
and you take it to Tucson.

715
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,370
The idea was they were going to trick

716
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,170
the Tucson host,

717
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,390
Reverend Crawford Smith. That's our cousin.

718
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:17,550
So easily tricked he is.

719
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,030
By leaving

720
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,170
the Dobbs head on

721
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,470
his doorstep.

722
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:26,130
This is like a 12 foot tall

723
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:27,410
monster face.

724
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:29,710
That some Dobbs like creature

725
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,730
had actually pertained itself into

726
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:32,990
his progressive energy.

727
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:34,130
And they did.

728
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,690
While Crawford and us were

729
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:39,610
at the party. But when we came back to

730
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,530
Crawford's place, the giant

731
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,690
Dobbs head, which they claimed they left

732
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,630
there, was gone. Gone

733
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,250
somewhere in Tucson or

734
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,490
mayhaps in outer space.

735
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:51,610
Someone has a Dobbs head so big that it

736
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:52,870
takes a pickup truck

737
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:55,810
and four people to carry it.

738
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,390
Doesn't that sound like the kind of

739
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,330
thing you'd like to happen

740
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:01,730
to you every day of your life?

741
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:04,230
You wake up early in the morning

742
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,830
and there's an 80 pound

743
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:08,050
60 foot high Dobbs head

744
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:08,970
in your front yard.

745
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:12,070
And as you step out across the mail

746
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,230
and newspapers and the dead laundry,

747
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,070
you notice that Dobbs

748
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,490
head's not only smiling,

749
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,450
he's talking to you.

750
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,710
And he's not only talking, he's

751
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,490
talking trash.

752
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:24,090
Because it's the giant Bob.

753
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:25,170
But it's deep.

754
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,570
Look at the size of that thing.

755
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,490
It's got dots the size of boulders.

756
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:32,390
No, I've never seen grain like that.

757
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,910
No wonder they make the sphinxes.

758
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,350
Look, here are the jewels.

759
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,230
We've got to get up to his forehead and

760
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,450
pull one of those out of his eyes and get

761
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,110
it back to Dobbs head.

762
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:40,470
But watch out for the brow.

763
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,030
Don't get caught in the brow.

764
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:42,930
Whatever you do.

765
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:46,110
Tangled mess of wires and cables.

766
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:46,630
Yes.

767
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,050
Steve gets out on the drive.

768
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:48,970
Some kind of cybernetic.

769
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:51,550
But here, we'll just push all this tape

770
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,250
aside here.

771
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,550
Instantly the gunman fires.

772
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:54,910
Oh, look out, look out.

773
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,050
He's shooting at us.

774
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:57,170
Oh, no.

775
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:57,390
No.

776
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:57,590
Look out.

777
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:58,890
They got me.

778
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,130
Let's get out of here real fast.

779
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:02,170
Here.

780
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:02,910
Get out of here.

781
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:03,230
Come on.

782
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:04,550
Wait a minute.

783
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,530
I'm going back for the glass files.

784
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,390
Going too fast now.

785
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,750
The tape's all wrapped around my legs.

786
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,230
We left all the drugs over there.

787
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:10,150
OK.

788
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:12,230
You don't have to try to carry me down.

789
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:12,890
This giant .

790
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,450
I've got to carry these hollow pills down here

791
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,510
and alter the president's body before the rest of these guys

792
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:17,570
get back.

793
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,290
The giant pills have been brought down from the brow.

794
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,570
This story's getting real confusing fast.

795
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,370
We can just hold out till next week.

796
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:24,210
OK.

797
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,570
I feel better now.

798
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,270
Maybe if I take some more of that wotan,

799
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,210
then I'll be able to walk out.

800
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,750
Rub a little gabrogfran into the sore part there,

801
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:32,390
and you'll be OK.

802
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:33,930
The legions are growing.

803
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,270
My name was Legion.

804
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:37,630
And yours is.

805
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:38,810
Hey.

806
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:39,430
Yours is.

807
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,910
Is Mr. Legion here?

808
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:42,870
Sir, you're.

809
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,410
Paging Mr. Legion.

810
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,990
Did you say your name was Legion, sir?

811
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,570
No, I said my name was.

812
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:56,590
Repetition is the key to the bandaged head.

813
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,970
Repetition is the key to art.

814
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:04,390
Repetition is the key to redundancy.

815
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:05,570
Repetition.

816
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:10,450
It is the key to learning and to dubstale.

817
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:17,690
And as the great gates open up and the high priestess ushers

818
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:18,250
Dave in.

819
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:18,590
They took down there.

820
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:22,970
Millie and I, that woman greeted us at the dock.

821
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:25,510
She was wearing a lei and a sauna dress.

822
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:26,250
Oh.

823
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:26,970
And she said.

824
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:30,690
She was related to the great late singer, Ima Sumac,

825
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,550
if you could imagine such a thing.

826
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,950
But there she was in a zip up top.

827
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,730
And her head was all zipped up, believe me.

828
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,990
There wasn't a pot showing.

829
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:42,710
And there was no sunshine coming through the back door either,

830
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:46,870
the way old Mammy and Pappy down on the farm used to sprinkle.

831
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:50,950
She was clean to the mug, 100%.

832
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,870
But they said they were going to still have to do a few things.

833
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,370
So she led us around.

834
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,870
We had a few eggnogs.

835
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,930
We stood and watched the trees burn.

836
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:02,890
And then we entered the actual inner center, center

837
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,810
sanctorum of Dom's town itself.

838
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,910
It was beautiful.

839
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:15,770
Look at those gigantic sculpted statues carved

840
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:18,510
from the native volcanic rock.

841
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,090
Oh my god.

842
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:22,350
They look like famous subgenius radio personalities.

843
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,230
What's that bald-headed one?

844
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:26,030
That's lonesome cowboy Dave.

845
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:26,650
And look at the trunk.

846
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:31,430
And look, the one with the giant lips that dances with rockets.

847
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:34,770
And that really handsome one, isn't that supposed to be Reverend Stag?

848
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:35,730
The butter's aligned with silver.

849
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:39,450
The mountain itself, by God, I just realized.

850
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:43,490
It's carved into a gigantic gob's head.

851
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:44,850
Stang, Stang, you must come over here.

852
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,210
The size of 10 Mount Rushmore's.

853
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:48,550
Try this chocolate phosphate drinking foam.

854
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:49,290
It's free.

855
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:53,470
Oh, my God, it's delicious and it's psychoactive, too.

856
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:54,790
I can feel my...

857
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,450
I can feel everything.

858
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:57,730
I can feel my knees.

859
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:58,990
I can feel my sandwiches.

860
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,930
I can feel sandwiches in my back pocket.

861
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,310
They're speaking to me, Stang.

862
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,730
Learn from the sandwiches.

863
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,410
Feel of your sandwich, Dave.

864
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,250
Feel of it.

865
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:15,550
Have you ever been kissed by a girl like this?

866
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:18,930
Strange.

867
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:24,730
The monstrous assurance of this race of puny bipeds with overblown egos.

868
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:27,650
The creature who calls himself man.

869
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,290
He believes he owns the earth.

870
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:34,190
And every living thing on it exists only for his benefit.

871
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,210
Yet how foolish he is.

872
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:38,610
Consider.

873
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:44,630
Even the lowly insect that man trods underfoot outweighs humanity several times.

874
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,390
And outnumbers him by countless billions.

875
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:52,930
In the continuing war for survival between man and the hexapods.

876
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,770
Only a nutter of food.

877
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:56,470
A fool would bet against the insect.

878
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:02,030
You have such reptile eyes.

879
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:06,570
Eyes like a lizard that weave their spell.

880
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,790
Landed the lizard.

881
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,910
See him running across the floor.

882
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,950
See him skittering out the door.

883
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,970
Hmm. I couldn't sleep.

884
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:20,670
Every little sheep that jumped over the fence landed under a horny ram.

885
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:24,510
The only time I want to feel somebody tossing and turning in bed is when I'm helping them.

886
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:25,990
Watch, Lilith!

887
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,450
I won't let lillith

888
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:30,810
Hey pumpbustH oh go ahead

889
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:34,970
Well x I think we do all agree P.W.S.h lillith is a beautiful woman

890
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:38,030
a beautiful man, a beautiful spiritual entity,

891
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:42,950
which few of us would dare to disagree with, I think, in the dark.

892
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:47,170
And sometimes that entity would light up its pipe.

893
00:34:54,870 --> 00:35:01,390
Puppets Lilith, are you going to be at the Tucson Devival on February 10th in Arizona?

894
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:05,770
I'm going to be here in Seattle celebrating my 31st birthday

895
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:10,930
and working on the first ever subgenius she-vival.

896
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:12,690
Oh, she-vival.

897
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,790
The old Connie Devival has come abate.

898
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,930
Oh, the bitch. Will it never end?

899
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:23,530
Are you a transsexual or a transvestite subgenius?

900
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:26,510
Relay into the pit of the continent.

901
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:30,610
I've given my best in Bob for the past 15 years.

902
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,310
I'm willing.

903
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:35,890
I'm willing to give Connie a chance, and if you would too, I bet you would clean up for a change.

904
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,610
I've been into Connie before.

905
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,290
It wasn't all it's cracked up to be.

906
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:46,370
Connie's real nice, if you know what I mean.

907
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:47,790
Oh, yeah.

908
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,670
You ought to get real friendly with Connie.

909
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:53,290
Yeah, but who hasn't?

910
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,110
She's the lord of Babylon.

911
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,050
Who hasn't?

912
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:03,610
Who?

913
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:16,010
You know, what we should see?

914
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,590
She doesn't care about everything but using her 않을 file to save her weight,

915
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:17,590


916
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,470
What more could I want to do?

917
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:18,470


918
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,410
Well, here's a job offer that pass Nom and I laid.

919
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:24,410
We've got two Fleetwood Family dresses.

920
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,170
Good.

921
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,610
The Regent recently bought his brains,

922
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,110
and he put them on for him.

923
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:29,270
Why didn't he care ?

924
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:29,270


925
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,270
Most Albea

926
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:35,690
You make a very, very good point about the Benjamin standards.

927
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:41,310
I'm trying to turn him into a...

928
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:45,190
There's no law against wearing such apparel on the street.

929
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,430
Perfect ordinary people.

930
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,070
If you threaten to extend your violence,

931
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:53,730
this earth of yours will be reduced to a burned out cinder.

932
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:55,790
Now I will kill you.

933
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:59,010
Max, he's wearing a dress.

934
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,830
I think he's trying to mate.

935
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:01,790
Oh, dear.

936
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:02,810
I don't do humans.

937
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,650
No kidding.

938
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:06,530
It is no concern of ours how you run your own planet.

939
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,330
I think you're just a big bully,

940
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,270
picking on people smaller than you are.

941
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:14,090
There's no law against wearing such apparel on the street,

942
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:18,690
as long as it can be distinguished that man is man and woman is woman.

943
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:19,650
Go into a doctor and say,

944
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,070
hey, I want to be a woman the next day.

945
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:26,470
We're talking about spreading the wealth a little tiny bit.

946
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:30,690
Was that one of those original Martians

947
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:31,250
trying to...

948
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:33,610
Trying to tune in from afar?

949
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:38,370
Some people don't think God is a space monster.

950
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:39,170
I don't know.

951
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:42,290
Earth needs women.

952
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:45,250
I will swim out.

953
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,710
Earth needs a hell of a lot more women.

954
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:50,790
I think if Earth would tip the scale the right way for us guys,

955
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:52,910
I think our problems would finally be all over.

956
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,350
I think if there was...

957
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:54,870
All over the place.

958
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:57,870
Instead of 1.6 women for every man,

959
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:01,170
what if there was like 1.9 women for...

960
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:01,830
I know her, baby.

961
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:02,390
Come on.

962
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:05,970
Well, that would certainly make things easier on me.

963
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,530
There'd be more women for me, too.

964
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,950
You would be more woman-like,

965
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:13,470
or you would be more womanly from the contrast

966
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,490
of so much womanhood around you, too.

967
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,470
You could take it, you know, five or seven ways.

968
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,950
I take it any way I can.

969
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,170
Well, I'm sure you do.

970
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,810
Does the word lowlife...

971
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:27,750
Watch five or six or seven men and women doing it.

972
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:30,990
I'd rather be five or six or seven men and women.

973
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:31,790
I'd rather be five or seven men and women.

974
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:31,790


975
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:32,850
That's beautiful.

976
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:37,030
But what would a cacophonous experience like that be?

977
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,110
It would be so confusing.

978
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,070
You would not know your own id from your own tid.

979
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:43,810
Not only would you remove your own head from your own body,

980
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:47,250
but you would actually be forcing yourself into a situation

981
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:50,610
where you'd be looking at yourself from the inside.

982
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:53,890
There's no law against wearing such apparel on the street.

983
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:57,210
As long as it can be distinguished that man is man,

984
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,410
woman is woman,

985
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,350
and woman is woman.

986
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,130
You're just a big bully.

987
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,250
My significant other is...

988
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,770
...a pre-option sexual.

989
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:06,030
As long as it can be distinguished that man is man,

990
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,390
and woman is woman,

991
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:08,950
and woman is woman,

992
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:09,790
it's a pleasure, isn't it?

993
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:10,830
Crime and giving yourself over to...

994
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:11,770
Man is man.

995
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,190
Man is man.

996
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:14,870
Man is man.

997
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:15,530
Man is man.

998
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:16,230
Man is man.

999
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,430
Crime and giving yourself over...

1000
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:17,870
Man!

1001
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,230
Connie Spews there, friends,

1002
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:25,010
from Reverend Protectrix, Amazonia.

1003
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:30,650
And now we're going to dare delve deep into the folds of the Connieites.

1004
00:39:31,270 --> 00:40:01,250
Right now, what makes the guy you hate for the vienege feel morefalent than a woman or was

1005
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:01,810
the rail mutants.

1006
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:08,850
Additionally, many of the events of the past years would not have been accomplished

1007
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:11,490
had it not been for Kanyiite intervention and direction,

1008
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:14,010
including Dockstock in Amsterdam.

1009
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:18,250
And it's funny because we really didn't plan it this way.

1010
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,890
It simply became necessary.

1011
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:26,110
We had mysterious visions and hang-up phone calls while the phone was unplugged,

1012
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:28,770
but there were certain things we just had to do.

1013
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:33,130
And I'm not doing any ass-licking today. I told you that, right?

1014
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,250
Yes, yes. No ass-licking.

1015
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:41,170
I'm telling you, it's getting so a fella can't get away from the goddamn sickies no more.

1016
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,530
I left New York for that same reason.

1017
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,430
Hell, I love that city.

1018
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:47,670
As before, it got crazy, that is.

1019
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:51,670
And all that atomic shit starts falling out of the sky.

1020
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:56,350
And wherever a spore touches you, a parasite will grow.

1021
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,910
A guy broke into the house.

1022
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:58,370
Yeah.

1023
00:40:58,770 --> 00:40:59,950
He raped you.

1024
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,590
You liked it.

1025
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:02,750
He died.

1026
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:05,150
They got used to eating human flesh.

1027
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,290
He feeds those pigs dead people.

1028
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:10,130
And then he eats the pigs.

1029
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:13,210
So what? Everybody's sick. Everybody running away from everything.

1030
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,150
And what are you, what are you, a troublemaker?

1031
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:15,930
Yeah.

1032
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:19,370
Terror, horror, death. Filming 11.

1033
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,730
And I found this little parable about Kali

1034
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:27,470
that perfectly illustrates the position of the Kanyites in the church today

1035
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,770
that I'd like to share with you.

1036
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:34,630
The goddess immediately set out to be battled with a dreaded demon in the form of Kali.

1037
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:43,130
Her eyes were red, her complexion was dark, her features gaunt, her hair unbound, her teeth sharp like fangs.

1038
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:53,010
As she rode onto the battleground on her lion, Raktabija experienced fear for the first time in his demonic heart.

1039
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,590
Kali warned the gods to attack him.

1040
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:07,190
She then spread her tongue to cover the battlefield, preventing even a single drop of Raktabija's blood from falling on the ground.

1041
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:14,990
Drunk on Raktabija's blood, Kali ran across the cosmos, killing anyone who dared cross her path.

1042
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:25,410
Now it's obvious that this ancient myth is just an archaic story about Bob, one of the old Bob's battles against the conspiracy, represented by the demon.

1043
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:37,730
So while Bob, or Shego, was lost in meditation, which is just a diplomatic way of saying to fraud,

1044
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,890
who went out to take care of business?

1045
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:50,010
Why, of course, Kani, his consort, who incidentally can do miraculous things with her tongue, which kind of proves that the story is true.

1046
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:56,410
She would be damned well as metal.

1047
00:42:57,810 --> 00:42:59,290
Solid, solid metal.

1048
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:00,450
Impregnable.

1049
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:01,170
I was so proud of her.

1050
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:02,270
Well, I heard she is impregnable.

1051
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:02,570
I was so proud of her.

1052
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:13,230
She got up at the D Bible, and she preached her little heart out, and her mighty, excellent lungs were heaving as she preached,

1053
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:17,690
and preached on the false Kanis versus the true Kani type.

1054
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:24,650
She preached her beloved groins right off, and I was not sadder than anybody there, crying as I was, to see that happen.

1055
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:26,150
She is a lovely person.

1056
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:28,970
I mean, a more lovely personality.

1057
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:29,970
A lovely personality.

1058
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:33,830
And a playwright as well, who works for the EMS services.

1059
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:36,830
Well, I didn't actually see that part.

1060
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:38,290
I think I was just imagining it.

1061
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:41,170
Well, you wish she was your daughter, don't you, Steve?

1062
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:45,830
No, actually, now she's several years older than my daughter, and so it's okay, you know.

1063
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:50,010
Ah, I see why I got the dirty old man looks.

1064
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:51,610
Now I understand.

1065
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:54,790
Well, you know, some babes, you know, like in their 30s, actually look younger.

1066
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:56,130
So she actually is younger.

1067
00:43:56,130 --> 00:44:02,030
Technically, Reverend Nikki Deathchick is an employee of the, she's one of my fellow co-workers for the

1068
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:04,330
I thought you were going to say she was an imperialist.

1069
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:10,670
No, so if I were to cite fresh things about her and so forth, that could be construed as on-the-job harassment, you see.

1070
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:15,270
Okay. We don't want you to harangue her on your job or any other place you go.

1071
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:18,470
No, but I sure wouldn't mind it if she harassed me. Oh, yes.

1072
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:24,550
Have you ever seen Nikki Deathchick in her nun outfit with that big old whip, that riding crop?

1073
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:28,950
I personally would rather spank Nikki than have her spank me.

1074
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:36,390
Well, she'd probably rather that too, and she's into guilt on both parties and taking turns,

1075
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:45,290
because the guilt is what makes it all seem so forbidden, and that's what makes it so much fun for some folks, you know.

1076
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:50,790
It just proves my point that we were the ones who were supposed to take over all along.

1077
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:52,170
Oh, yeah.

1078
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:59,350
It's not a situation of who's better or any retarded conspiracy-based notions of battle between the sexes.

1079
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:00,970
It's just part of the plan.

1080
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:09,410
For when the Coneyites have power, then will fear be placed into the heart of the demon of the conspiracy.

1081
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:10,590
Fear!

1082
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:18,510
But just last week, Sister Decadence, the producer of the Coneyite calendar,

1083
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:22,150
was lamenting that we just don't have enough months in the calendar.

1084
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:25,570
We have to wait another month in the year to display all of the fine Coneyite fates.

1085
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:26,190
That's right.

1086
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:34,710
But as in the story from Hindu mythology, it is important to note that the powers of the Coneyites are varied,

1087
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:38,690
ranging from condus to bloodlust and everything in between.

1088
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:48,850
Like the many arms of the goddess Kali, we all represent different aspects of Constance Marsh Doll, which is her full name.

1089
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:51,850
Each claiming our own unique niche.

1090
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:57,630
There has been the occasional pink female who tried to infiltrate the church.

1091
00:45:57,770 --> 00:46:01,890
One can only imagine Senpai the conspiracy to take the Yeti bloodline.

1092
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:08,170
These were easily recognizable as pink because they were all the same.

1093
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:11,510
Their basic act was to be like, hey, I'm a girl.

1094
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:13,430
That's all I have to offer.

1095
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:14,130
Look, breasts!

1096
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:20,030
They didn't have that quality that all true subgeniuses share,

1097
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:21,830
which is to be completely different.

1098
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:27,990
And look how far we've come to bringing God's prophecy to light,

1099
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:31,450
that there be many Coneyite Yetis all in life and ex.

1100
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:36,290
Let us pay homage to all those who aren't with us this evening,

1101
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:39,170
who have done so much for the sake of your slack,

1102
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:44,930
like Sister Decadence, Mary Magdalene, Rabbi, Princess Wee, Barbie Yeti,

1103
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:48,710
Angela, Pope X, Lilith, Friday the Ghost, and of course,

1104
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:51,830
the queen of all Coneyites alive today, Sister Declan.

1105
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:51,910
And now, the first lady of the church,

1106
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:53,090
Sister Susie the Cluesie.

1107
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:59,450
And everybody else who's made the text there that I forgot to mention.

1108
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:04,950
If you want to be happy, keep your legs open and your mouth shut.

1109
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:06,490
No, no, look, I want to get this straight.

1110
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:10,470
You show them your purse, and that makes them pass out?

1111
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:12,710
And thanks again for servicing our daughter.

1112
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:14,390
She's gonna have an elephant?

1113
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:17,050
Is she trying to say my wife screwed an elephant?

1114
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:20,350
Now you know how powerful the devil is, and if you cross him,

1115
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:22,210
he's gonna be mad as hell.

1116
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:23,830
Shut up and let me think!

1117
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:25,070
I gotta think.

1118
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:27,390
This is killing me!

1119
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:31,830
There's always so ugly she can scare a hungry bulldog off the back of a meat truck.

1120
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:33,790
I suppose digging in cow dung is fun, is it?

1121
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:35,970
It depends on what you find underneath.

1122
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:37,310
I remember now.

1123
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:40,570
After I passed out, I remember.

1124
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:43,090
A serpent.

1125
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:44,950
A horrible thing.

1126
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:47,110
Towering above me.

1127
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:49,690
Curled around a crucifix.

1128
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:52,030
Fritz, get up for God's sake, get up!

1129
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:54,230
They've killed Fritz!

1130
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:56,030
They've killed Fritz!

1131
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:58,690
Those lousy, stinking yellow berries!

1132
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:01,710
Those horrible, atrocity-filled vermin!

1133
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:04,450
Those just make-able animal warmongers!

1134
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:05,810
They've killed Fritz!

1135
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:06,790
Take that!

1136
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:07,850
Take that!

1137
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:09,930
Take that, you green slime!

1138
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:12,610
You black-eyed, insured mullet!

1139
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:18,710
Because of my interactions with false Kanye's in my earliest days of involvement with the church,

1140
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:26,090
I never wanted to talk about Kanye or do things that seemed like I was placing my gender above my jettiness.

1141
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:29,050
But things have changed.

1142
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:33,730
My aspect has always been more of the Kali side of Kanye.

1143
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:41,530
To get shit done and punish the guilty, while providing slack for the true followers of the path of God.

1144
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:47,230
My contribution has been...

1145
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:50,530
And will continue to be...

1146
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:53,390
Giving you what you really want.

1147
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:57,990
Which I'm finding out more and more...

1148
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:01,770
Is to be teased and taunted...

1149
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:05,390
While you feel that delicious, forbidden guilt.

1150
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:10,750
So for your enjoyment and frustration...

1151
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:14,470
I'm going to talk about blowjobs.

1152
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:15,710
Blowjobs!

1153
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:16,490
Blowjobs!

1154
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:20,610
It's sort of the thrive of Nicki Death Chick and it's called,

1155
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:22,510
My Blowjobs Are So Good!

1156
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:34,050
Young brudes are a pain in the ass.

1157
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:37,290
He's just a man. Horny like every other guy.

1158
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:39,510
We're going back to that island, Fairbanks.

1159
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:44,250
Back to find the beasts that chewed up your pals while they were still alive and kicking.

1160
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:45,690
You want to come along?

1161
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:49,650
Yes, I do.

1162
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:49,890
We're going to find the beasts like the ones that chewed up my pals...

1163
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:49,890


1164
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:56,410
We've all heard we've been terrorized by what some people say is a sea monster.

1165
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:01,510
What I say, it's only a fish.

1166
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:07,730
And we're not going to be intimidated by a fish.

1167
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:09,450
Now I've got big problems.

1168
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:11,290
I mean, stuff that the dogs don't understand.

1169
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:13,290
Well, why doesn't somebody reason with it?

1170
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:15,170
Can't you control it? It's got to be stopped.

1171
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:17,970
We're your government. We're the good guys.

1172
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:21,850
Appreachment, dear friends, you're about to receive

1173
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:25,710
on John Barleycore, nicotine, and the temptations of Eve.

1174
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:29,190
Okay, that's it. It was so good.

1175
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:33,590
For once I was happy and had a good wife.

1176
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:38,330
I had enough money to last me for life.

1177
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:43,090
I met with a gal and we went on a spree.

1178
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:47,750
She taught me to smoke and drink whiskey.

1179
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:51,990
Cigarettes and whiskey and wild, wild wood

1180
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:55,730
And wild new bridges, they'll drive you insane.

1181
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:02,850
Cigarettes and whiskey and wild, wild wood

1182
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:06,510
And wild new bridges, they'll drive you insane.

1183
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:11,190
I, I sing temptation with you.

1184
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:11,750
Please.

1185
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:16,570
Cigarettes is a blot on the whole human face.

1186
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:21,370
A man is a monkey with one in his face.

1187
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:26,130
Here's my definition, believe me, dear brother.

1188
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:30,970
A fire on one end, a fool on the other.

1189
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:34,990
Cigarettes and whiskey and wild, wild wood

1190
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:38,310
And wild new bridges, they'll drive you insane.

1191
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:45,870
Cigarettes and whiskey and wild, wild wood

1192
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:49,810
And wild new bridges, they'll drive you insane.

1193
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:54,410
Say, Debra, say, Debra, dear friend.

1194
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:56,870
Somebody get that bum out of here.

1195
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:01,550
Brother, repent or they'll write on your grave.

1196
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:06,250
Two women and whiskey, here lies a poor slave.

1197
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:08,170
Hey, boy.

1198
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:09,350
Good morning, dear stranger.

1199
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:11,290
Say, morning, dear friend.

1200
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:15,650
They'll write in big letters these words that then

1201
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:19,890
Cigarettes and whiskey and wild, wild wood

1202
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:23,630
And wild new bridges, they'll drive you insane.

1203
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:30,810
Cigarettes and whiskey and wild, wild wood

1204
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:34,390
And wild new bridges, they'll drive you insane.

1205
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:37,230
Listen.

1206
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:38,150
I want to hear it.

1207
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:39,650
I want to hear temptation, you hear?

1208
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:41,470
That's what I want to hear, temptation.

1209
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:43,470
Hold it, brother.

1210
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:47,350
My friend, I'm afraid you're in the wrong place.

1211
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:50,030
We don't sing that kind of music here.

1212
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:51,070
Okay.

1213
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:53,190
Then show us your muscle.

1214
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:53,930
See?

1215
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:03,810
Good God.

1216
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,850
The prediction came true.

1217
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:06,830
Now what's next?

1218
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:07,070
The Bible's life.

1219
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:08,610
It's Bob's pipe.

1220
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:16,070
It's a young, hipster teenager girl with a Bob pipe in her mouth and a broomstick inserted

1221
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,810
just the way Bob predicted would be the new fad of the...

1222
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:25,230
Now, speaking of things that come and go, speaking of fads, is that a real broomstick

1223
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:25,870
or is that one...

1224
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:31,530
When you see a broomstick where it shouldn't ought to be, whether it be inserted by New

1225
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:37,030
York Police Department or Bob Dobbs himself, friends.

1226
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:39,110
You know the end times are coming.

1227
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:46,430
And so are a lot of gross perverts out there, of which I am not that kind myself.

1228
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:47,090
No.

1229
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:47,550
Nay, brother.

1230
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:48,910
And I only look at these things.

1231
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:54,490
Dr. Sharks, you just want to look at it in your eyes, the yellow metal dripping down

1232
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:56,830
from the corners of your eyes.

1233
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:57,150
You got to know your enemy.

1234
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:57,150


1235
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:57,150


1236
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:00,530
Praise the Lord, to pass the admonition.

1237
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:04,250
Praise the Lord, to pass the admonition.

1238
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:07,010
Sometimes I wish God would give me a Holy Ghost machine gun.

1239
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:07,010


1240
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:07,010


1241
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:07,010


1242
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:07,010


1243
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:07,010


1244
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:07,010


1245
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:07,810
I'll blow your head off.

1246
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:16,050
There's some new words that are being described very blatantly.

1247
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:17,350
Let me give you an example.

1248
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:23,750
In the lyrics of songs, when you hear them sing about engine, motor, or machine, they're

1249
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:24,510
referring to sex.

1250
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:27,890
When you hear them sing about funky, they're referring to sexual odors.

1251
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:31,430
When they sing about groovy, they're talking about the position of intercourse.

1252
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:35,290
When they sing of get off, they're singing about the goal of lovemaking.

1253
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:36,990
And then you hear them talk about sex.

1254
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:38,390
When they talk about it, they're singing about groupies.

1255
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:40,370
They're talking about rock prostitutes.

1256
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:41,730
I am a groupie.

1257
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:47,070
The bee, bee, bee, bee, bee, bee.

1258
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:48,750
Do you know what a groupie is?

1259
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:50,170
I am a groupie.

1260
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:50,950
I'm a groupie.

1261
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:51,690
You're a groupie.

1262
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:57,770
A rock group freak like me, who digs musicians and follows them night after night to wherever

1263
00:54:57,770 --> 00:54:58,450
their gig is.

1264
00:54:58,610 --> 00:54:59,510
I am a groupie.

1265
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:01,090
I'm 16 years old.

1266
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:02,170
I am a groupie.

1267
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:06,290
I get where I want to go, any way I can.

1268
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:06,970
I'm a groupie.

1269
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:06,970


1270
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:06,970


1271
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:06,970


1272
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:09,150
I can swim trips, a van, or daddy's wheel.

1273
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:14,930
All I want is to be free, and all I've got are looks and a few gimmicks.

1274
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:16,190
I am a groupie.

1275
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:33,810
I am a groupie.

1276
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:39,670
I am a groupie.

1277
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:40,610
I'm a groupie.

1278
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:41,330
I'm a groupie.

1279
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:42,430
I'm 16 years old.

1280
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:43,670
I am a groupie.

1281
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:44,970
I am a groupie.

1282
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:46,150
I'm a groupie.

1283
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:46,870
I'm a groupie.

1284
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:47,550
I am a groupie.

1285
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:49,170
I am a groupie.

1286
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:54,290
The beat.

1287
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:02,930
I would say at this point that it's absolutely incredible

1288
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:05,550
to hear those primitive drum beats

1289
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:09,190
and the overt and blatant reference to Satan.

1290
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:10,270
That is unbelievable.

1291
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:12,590
Every time I hear it, it gets me,

1292
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:14,790
I guess the word to describe would be the creeps.

1293
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:18,050
Sometimes late at night I have to play this beat,

1294
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:20,350
and it's not fun to play that type of beat after midnight,

1295
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:21,030
believe me.

1296
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:22,850
But if you think that's unbelievable,

1297
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:25,470
I've got more of this song for you.

1298
00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:35,110
Here's BBC, and you're out there on it.

1299
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:37,550
This is my, I am a groupie.

1300
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:53,610
That music was by the Bran Flakes, friends.

1301
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:59,990
And this is Reverend Stang talking in 2016 via time control.

1302
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:02,910
At one point in this episode,

1303
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:05,370
you hear Lonesome Cowboy Dave say,

1304
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:07,590
here in the year 2006.

1305
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:12,050
But he was saying that in the year 2001,

1306
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:16,750
whence came this show almost 15 years ago,

1307
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:19,870
when the hour of slack was in the middle of its,

1308
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:23,050
so far, 30-year run.

1309
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:26,430
But about the Bran Flakes,

1310
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:29,110
I got some news about the Bran Flakes

1311
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:32,370
from our old friend St. Andrew.

1312
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:34,130
Who said,

1313
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:37,170
I was hoping to ask if you'd be so kind as to mention

1314
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:40,890
that the Bran Flakes have an album out on vinyl.

1315
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:43,950
If you'd like a copy, let me know.

1316
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:46,230
I'm hoping some will still be around this summer,

1317
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:49,550
so I have a business excuse to make it to the first X day

1318
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:51,070
since before the towers fell.

1319
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:53,770
It's my company's first vinyl release.

1320
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:56,050
Just got them back from the plant yesterday.

1321
00:57:56,550 --> 00:58:00,470
Pressed in the original town of Dobbs, Dallas, Texas.

1322
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:02,690
And you can find,

1323
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:03,970
you can find this at

1324
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:09,370
thebrandflakes.bandcamp.com

1325
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:12,290
The brand flakes being all one word.

You can also look at subgenius.bandcamp.com

1328
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:21,790
For Cleveland area listeners,

1329
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:25,050
I wanted to mention that the Winter Star Ball

1330
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:28,330
will be held Sunday, February 28th

1331
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:30,090
at the Beachland Ballroom.

1332
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:32,330
And that has a kind of a miniature,

1333
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:33,990
a miniature devival in it,

1334
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:36,770
with Reverend Baby Bear preaching.

1335
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:42,270
She'll also be emceeing for various bands and jams,

1336
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:44,230
including the band Burning Sage.

1337
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:48,310
That's February 28th at the Beachland Ballroom in Cleveland.

1338
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:52,570
You can look at subgenius.com events for details.

1339
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:53,830
Price Bob.

1340
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:57,630
Anyway, now back to Chaz Smith's ESO Radio

1341
00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:00,350
from WCSB Cleveland from 2001.

1342
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:02,310
Like it or bend over, that's the way.

1343
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:02,430
.

1344
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:02,810
.

1345
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:14,230
.

1346
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:14,250
.

1347
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:14,270
.

1348
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:14,970
.

1349
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:14,970


1350
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:15,010
.

1351
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:15,050
.

1352
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:15,090
.

1353
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:15,350
.

1354
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:15,870
.

1355
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:17,410
.

1356
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:26,350
.

1357
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:27,790
. . . . . .

1358
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:45,330
. . . . . . . . . . . . . .

1359
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:45,330


1360
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:45,330


1361
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:45,330


1362
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:45,330


1363
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:47,190
all out every brain cell.

1364
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:49,470
Let it melt, melt, melt

1365
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:50,910
down into a little puddle

1366
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:53,190
of gray matter

1367
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:53,730
soup.

1368
00:59:55,270 --> 00:59:57,070
Then sip, sip,

1369
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:59,050
sip that soup and

1370
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:01,190
sleep, friends, but not until you've checked

1371
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:03,290
out all the words and videotapes of

1372
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:05,330
Bob Dobbs

1373
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:08,550
at www.subgenius.com

1374
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:09,350
or, got that

1375
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:11,410
pencil ready? Bob at Post Office

1376
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:13,330
Box 140306

1377
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:14,230
Post Office 40306

1378
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:15,270
Dallas, Texas

1379
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,250
75214. Oh, yes, and that was

1380
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:20,150
the Bran Flakes, friends, doing the

1381
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:21,850
praise of the Lord groupie,

1382
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:24,090
the groupie bit, the Bran Flakes

1383
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:24,370
at

1384
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:27,330
thebranflakes.com

1385
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:30,210
and now I want, stay tuned,

1386
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:32,090
friends, you internet listeners, for

1387
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:33,930
Nikki's X-Rated Rant

1388
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:35,530
after Z-Zot.

1389
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:44,270
...

1390
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:44,270


1391
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:49,910
...

1392
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:55,470
...

1393
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:01,090
She's pretty, don't you think?

1394
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:04,050
And you creeped her out.

1395
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:06,430
I felt even more

1396
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:08,250
uncomfortable when my father

1397
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:10,230
suddenly began taking his clothes off.

1398
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:12,150
And before I could say Sigmund Freud,

1399
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:13,250
my father

1400
01:01:13,330 --> 01:01:15,390
put on this, this, this diaper

1401
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:17,810
to see my own father in a diaper.

1402
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:18,610
Oh!

1403
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:20,490
What do you think could have done that to him?

1404
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:21,890
I wish I knew, Lieutenant.

1405
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:25,290
But look at the way his skin and clothes are torn.

1406
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,370
It's almost as if, I don't know,

1407
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:28,770
it's almost as if he exploded.

1408
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:30,630
If you're always in this condition,

1409
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:32,490
it's quite obvious you couldn't get it up,

1410
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:33,630
even if you used a cray.

1411
01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:37,010
Oh, this, must you always smother my cooking

1412
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:39,730
in tornadoes before you even taste it?

1413
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:41,330
There is so much

1414
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:43,070
to see and know there is

1415
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:44,530
a path for men to go.

1416
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:46,230
It's good to travel wide

1417
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:47,330
and then it's good

1418
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:49,610
to come back home

1419
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:51,470
again.

1420
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:00,090
Fasten safety belts, please.

1421
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:02,390
Fasten safety belts, please.

1422
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:04,650
We're coming in for an Earth landing.

1423
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:06,990
Now we're turning.

1424
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:09,190
Our tail will point toward the Earth

1425
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:10,970
and we will slow down our landing

1426
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:11,850
with our tail rockets.

1427
01:02:11,850 --> 01:02:13,590
There's the field below.

1428
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:16,250
People say in Boston even

1429
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:17,990
beans do it.

1430
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:20,650
Beans will do it, friends.

1431
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:21,670
Let's go.

1432
01:02:31,070 --> 01:02:32,250
Home again.

1433
01:02:37,450 --> 01:02:39,650
My blowjobs are so good

1434
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:41,310
that I will be solely responsible

1435
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:42,670
for the second coming.

1436
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:47,070
My blowjobs are so good

1437
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:49,890
that Bob himself offered to pay me for one

1438
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:51,710
and I told him he didn't have enough money.

1439
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:55,870
My blowjobs are so good

1440
01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:56,850
that they had to rename

1441
01:02:56,850 --> 01:02:59,150
Deep Throat's shallow indentation.

1442
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:03,050
My blowjobs are so good

1443
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:03,890
that they're a felony

1444
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:05,030
in most southern states.

1445
01:03:05,370 --> 01:03:05,670
Ouch!

1446
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:10,230
My blowjobs are so good

1447
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:11,050
that I cause rigor,

1448
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:12,070
and I'm rigor mortis in the living.

1449
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:16,110
My blowjobs are so good

1450
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:17,670
that I make porno actresses

1451
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:19,150
reevaluate their career paths.

1452
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:22,890
My blowjobs are so good

1453
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:24,650
that Connie herself called me up

1454
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:25,630
and asked me for lessons.

1455
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:26,330
Yeah!

1456
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:27,510
Woo!

1457
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:28,790
Woo!

1458
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:31,470
My blowjobs are so good

1459
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:33,430
that the Pope declared them a mortal sin.

1460
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:36,190
This one's really gross.

1461
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:37,070
I'm fond of it.

1462
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:39,230
My blowjobs are so good

1463
01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:40,530
that I regularly need to give

1464
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:41,610
my stomach pumped.

1465
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:42,090
Oh!

1466
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:43,050


1467
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:44,410
Oh!

1468
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:45,930
50!

1469
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:48,930
My blowjobs are so good

1470
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:50,230
that my longest blowjob

1471
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:51,370
involved time travel.

1472
01:03:51,650 --> 01:03:52,330
Oh!

1473
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:55,350
Here's another one along the same lines.

1474
01:03:55,510 --> 01:03:57,170
My blowjobs are so good

1475
01:03:57,170 --> 01:03:59,070
that my mouse gravitational pull

1476
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:01,730
is in danger of creating a black hole.

1477
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:02,550
Oh yeah!

1478
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:04,930
I give Stephen Hawking nightmares!

1479
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:05,850
Oh!

1480
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:09,750
My blowjobs are so good

1481
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:11,470
that if I ever became a lesbian,

1482
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:13,250
the suicide rate would triple overnight.

1483
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:14,030
Oh!

1484
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:17,790
My blowjobs are so good

1485
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:20,930
that last time I hit a popsicle in public,

1486
01:04:21,110 --> 01:04:23,990
I got charged with violating public abstentions laws.

1487
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:24,490
Oh!

1488
01:04:24,810 --> 01:04:25,290
Oh!

1489
01:04:25,850 --> 01:04:26,310
Oh!

1490
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:27,310
Oh!

1491
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:29,310
My tongue can fold in ways

1492
01:04:29,310 --> 01:04:31,710
that only M.C. Escher could understand.

1493
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:32,570
Oh!

1494
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:33,890
Oh!

1495
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:34,570
Oh!

1496
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:34,890
Oh!

1497
01:04:34,890 --> 01:04:35,250
Oh!

1498
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:35,770
Oh!

1499
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:35,850
Oh!

1500
01:04:35,950 --> 01:04:36,210
Oh!

1501
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:36,850
Oh!

1502
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:40,810
Aw!

1503
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:42,550
Oh!

1504
01:04:43,310 --> 01:04:43,810
Oh!

1505
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:44,390
Oh!

1506
01:04:44,430 --> 01:04:44,630
Oh!

1507
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:44,630


1508
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:44,630


1509
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:45,210
All right, exactly!

1510
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:46,490
Krr!

1511
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:46,550


1512
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:46,930
All right!

1513
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:46,970


1514
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:47,070


1515
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:48,190


1516
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:48,190


1517
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:48,190


1518
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:48,190


1519
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:48,190


1520
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:49,970
All right, Emily's the best.

1521
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:49,970


1522
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:50,850
Allow me to give you a shout-out.

1523
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:51,070
Well, there's always some stuff in my life,

1524
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:52,330
until you want to coming back and講 that we're talking about .

1525
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:54,410
And that's because some episodes do mention

1526
01:04:54,410 --> 01:04:55,910
creating radius like erractions,

1527
01:04:56,010 --> 01:05:03,150
T'Von is a Spanish-ίν вещer

1528
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:03,570
Or rather,

1529
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:06,830
a st impersonal formation evangelist!

1530
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:09,970
But he can't find blowjobs on there.

1531
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:12,790
So he goes out and asks an altar boy,

1532
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:15,850
What does a pastor usually give for blowjobs?

1533
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:16,910
And the altar boy says,

1534
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:18,450
Oh, about five bucks.

1535
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:23,010
Alright, that's enough.

1536
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:26,050
And Reverend Amy Gelschich,

1537
01:05:26,070 --> 01:05:28,410
please order some shins so I can keep my job.
