And I want you to be free!
Slavery, money, slavery, money, slavery, money, slavery, money, everything you have of God.
Right.
Slavery, money, slavery, money, there's a lot of guys that wouldn't really make it in a lot of other venues.
But I'd get a small church to be nice to some people, so I actually got a little.
Test, test, test, are we on the air?
Are, is this working?
What?
We're finally here!
Welcome to Subgenius Radio.
Hour of Black.
Long to advise the church of Subgenius Radio.
Could it be now?
Hey, you know what?
He's on my radio wave there.
Copping that onto Hour of Black.
You're copping that onto Hour of Black?
Could it be now?
I was making Hour of Black tonight.
Yeah.
On tape, and I was using it.
Last week's tape.
You put the tape, you put the tape between your knees, and you take the little razor blade and spin it with a little spool between your knees, or do you just, just hack away?
Well, I put it between my knees, and then I slowly kind of creep it up lower and closer to me.
And then I, and then, that's when the curtain opens.
And it blasts me.
You are about to experience the awe and mystery of which reaches the sky.
And then I can't look my way.
And then I can't look my way.
And then I can't look my way.

And it's, it's usually blasting people for me.
Remember him?
Yes.
I'm glad you do.
I do remember Fred blasting people for me.
Oh.
Oh.

Oh.
Remember.
Remember.

It's captured my take away .
No!
Well, good night all,ful and well.
Get out yourself.

Make my classes.



Ask any question you have.
I'll give you anything.
eternal salvation in heaven.
And that scared the hell out of me,
the thought of going to heaven for all eternity.
I knew there had to be a better answer.
That was a Bill T. Miller's horrible sound effect.
Unfortunately, Bob was...
I don't know what else is going on here.
So it's an alternative to the alternatives
that we've been told had no alternatives.
No, they want to drag you kicking and screaming.
If you died, you could go to, like, war.
No, I'm just kidding.
We all know that the surface of the earth
is a scourge of demons.
This is the only religion that offers you
two separate escape vessels in the sex.
One while you're still alive,
and another one after you die.
Now, to qualify for the one while you're still alive,
it's real cheese.
Oh, wait a minute, we've forgotten to do something.
We've got to start the show, Bleepo.
You can't hardly do one of these shows
without a puzzling evidence introduction.
We just...
Without puzzling evidence, there's no radio.
So turn your radio on and put your feet up.
Relax.
Sit back.
Get a cup of coffee.
Wear your comfy old bedroom slippers.
Maybe a tattered but familiar bathrobe.
A fat, purring cabby cat
stretches out on your lap.
And you're comfortable
listening to the continuous broadcast
of the show.
It's about the year 2001.
It's no time for fun.
Shut down.
Turn a knob.
Okay.
They shouldn't be so lucky.
Their world is in a land of...
Save Bob, save Bob, save Bob, save Bob.
No, Y2K.
He's in serious condition, Jack,
and they don't know if he'll live or not.
Now, just minutes ago, we learned the name of the suspect
from Frank Ryan of the NYPD.
His name is...
Next day.
Dumbfuck.
I killed him.
Dumbfuck.
It was my fault.
I'm bad luck.
He said I could.
He said I could kiss him.
He said he could.

He said he could.
I'm standing right behind him.
From outer space.
So I'm shoot Bob.
You pump a couple of drugs and pipe dreams
and what happens, they come gunning for people like Bob.
Just in case.
You must kill the truth.
After the attack on Bob's life,
the media outcry is unprecedented.
And while you're at it...
His face echoes across the American...
...dialectual landscape.
The one we're already on.
On the covers of magazines,
in newspapers,
and on television news broadcasts.
This is the last chance not to screw up.
Bob would die.
One week after the shooting,
word comes that Bob will be released
and transported to Pennsylvania
by medevac helicopter in time for the election.
He's coming from the back.
He's coming from the back.
He's coming from the back.
What is he doing?
What is he talking about?
We are five.
We are five.
We are five.
We are five.
We are five.
We are five.
We are five.
We are five.
We are five.
We are five.
We are five.
Where are he from?
We don't know.

Shoot him quick.
There's a rocket.
I didn't have the identity.
Something has happened.
Something has happened.
Shoot the car.
One being hit in the ένα
Shoot the car.
blood-rusting heart, friend.
It was terrible, but when they explained that crowd,
I got into that man.
Kill Bob!
I can't believe it!
I can't believe it!
Friend, are you ready to kill Bob?
We've run into some serious Bobbies in this thing
this time around.
People who, oh, they love Jack and Bob Dobbs.
Tom and Richard, who actually edited...
Well, they should, but...
The documentary portions of what I'm about to play...
Bob, as damn well they better.
But how do they prove they love Bob?
How do they prove they trust Bob?
Not by what proves they love Bob.
They'll spout Bob's sacred dogma.
They'll spew out lines.
They'll make up cute stories about Bob.
But are they ready to actually kill that thing
they love so much?
That's the one difference between this religion
and all of the others.
It is the most trained friend.
You've got to love that man, Bob,
and you've got to be ready to break your mind
for the next one.
He's got to be free from his insidious mind control.
Oh, yeah.
You can't sing over Captain Beefheart that way.
Just like the Heaven's Gate people
did their farewell video,
this will save me time.
God, I'm sure I talked to my mom and dad are saved.
My brother and sister,
and a lot of friends of mine,
and even a lot of subgeniuses,
including some of my best subgenius old buddies
and collaborators
that never actually sent me a message.
They're $30 in.
Like I did last year.
Well, friends, it's true.
Bob can mean slack,
and of course he can also contain it.
It's like casting off your old shoes
and putting on new ones.
It's not like anybody's going to really die.
You'll still be around after the exes
or the robo-beasts
or whatever the vengeful subgeniuses
have stripped away your house and your body.
In a way, you're not really leaving,
you humans and pinks and relatives of mine.
You're just entering a new,
you're stepping over into a bigger world,
a more open world.
I feel sorry for the friends of mine
who never bought a membership.
I've always tried to expose them
gently to Bob's word,
not to force it down their throats,
not mail them pamphlets constantly.
I have turned some people to the church.
I am very proud of those people.
I look forward to greeting them on the saucers.
You know?
But it's kind of sad that my mother,
who really is a wonderful person,
never did buy that membership.
Then again, I don't know what she would make
on the saucers.
And of course, there are my enemies.
I do have people in my life
who have hurt me for no particular reason
all the way back in high school.
And once I get my memory editing,
I'll be able to remember who you all are.
And I probably will have specific tribulations
set aside just for you.
And that's just my slack, and I'm afraid there's nothing
you can do about it now.
It's been difficult during all this time to be patient,
but I knew that if I just persevered,
I'd be able to say goodbye from above, from the saucers.
And Buck, it's almost full now.
I just want to thank those that supported me.
I come from a long line of Jesus.
They imparted to me the values that have gotten me
where I am today.
And it's all the normals and all the pinks
and all the bobbies and the orbs and the normals
that have tried to wear me down.
You're a bunch of idiots, you know?
Selling the balls.
You better hurry if you've got anything left to say to me.
I'm on my way out.
Bye.
So long.
Oh, wait.
But that's what we were getting paid to be idiots.
I wasn't getting paid to be an idiot.
I was getting paid to be a fool.
He's a real idiot.
He can't see.
He can't see.
The rest of us all get paid real good for being idiots.
I feel sorry for those smart people who have to pay instead
just to hear that they're idiots.
To hear a bunch of stupid things.
To hear a bunch of flesh-grabbing, cracking idiots.
I feel sorry for those intelligent people.
I really do.
Think how disturbing it must be to go through life
so painfully aware of...
God, earthquake!
That's right.
Christ!
It's a sign!
It's a sign.
We're being punished!
We must have done the right thing!
He must be happy with us!
You're never happy with anybody.
What the hell are you talking about?
You've got such a bunch of babies.
You're not so juvenile.
You're pre-juvenile.
You're infantile.
No, you're pre...
Who are you?
You're fetal.
No, you're pre-fetal.
You're spermatozoic.
No, you're gleaming daddy-zioic.
No, you're so infantile.
Where was Letterman?
How come he didn't have this?
In any case,
Brian White,
Mrs. DeSolar,
you're genetic.
You're tiredly...
We just might have the answer for him.
It's called the church of the sub-fuel.
It was genetic humor, ma'am.
And it's truly on a level of its own.
Genetic humor's done him in, ma'am.
It's not pornography, officer.
It's empowerment.
It's poor-natured genetics.
It's poor-natured genetic empowerment.
Once you get a hold of your genitalia,
and you can feel that power surge backwards,
you know you're going on, man.
So join the church of the sub-genius, friends,
and meet your planned destiny.
As Dr. Alice A.D. once said,
slavery under dogs is pretty much the same.
And that's what we're talking about.
And that's what we're talking about.




Now, we don't seriously expect anybody to understand dogs.
And whoever claims to is lying.
Once a guy accused us of being devil-worshers,
according to the Great National Socialism.
A once-guy accused us of being devil-worshers
just because we said we think Christianity as it exists today
is the one-world anti-Christ system predicted in the Bible.
Oh, no!
Oh, no, we're not supposed to even know
that the adversary is not some grimy weirdo
cranking out crackpot rants in a filthy attic,
or a cult leader wearing mystic symbols
on an afternoon TV talk show.
We're not supposed to know
that the maniacal hatchet fiend
is that quiet, harmless person
who brings us such lovely vegetables
from their miraculously well-fertilized garden.
And believe it or not, plenty of pieces,
4,000 of them so far,
every day have already joined up.
Suddenly the joke has become serious and profitable.
Your standard religious rip-off, right?
But can anybody take this stuff seriously?
As Bob says, we offer eternal salvation
for triple your money back.
And there is no other religion that offers that deal.
The tenfold escalation of horrible death
in the direct vicinity of our plant
has anything to do with the black sludge
leaking out of our waste dump
onto the playground
of the elementary school.
Oh no!
No!
We're not supposed to know that!
But we do know it!
And once you know something,
you can't unknow it!
No matter what you do,
you can only spend the rest of your life
wishing you could forget.
Hello friends.
And welcome.
The sermon tonight is entitled
A TIE.
It shows what I think of public education.
And, you know, I really was a very lonely person.
And finally got a boyfriend
who was a member of the church
that I'd been for two or three years.
And he showed me the pamphlets and I said,
This is it!
Where have these damn people been all these years?
I broke up with this girl.
We had a parting of the ways.
And I basically
degenerated this time
into a state of total flatness.
I was riding around on my motorcycle
like a nutcase.
Just hoping that somewhere
there was something
that would take me off.
And, uh,
one day a car started chasing me
through a thunderstorm.
A sailor's riding around the army.
Bruce Willis blowing away the terrorists!
And, uh,
I thought I got away from the guy,
but he caught up to me a couple of miles later
and he got out of his truck and I was like,
Yeah, I didn't get to get two guys behind, right?
Well, he comes up to the office
to let me join a motorcycle club.
And I'm like,
Oh, we're no different from the Romans.
Made a mission to Coliseum
to watch slaves murder one another.
The only difference is
we paid Hollywood to build it
to make sure no one really gets there.
So we can walk out on the pier
and not feel guilty about our animalistic business.
Not!
But we are animalistic!
And we have animalistic instincts!
Giving is like,
what is like pornography!
We all like to party
and still fight the mission and all that.
That's weird.
You're stupid, you know.
That stuff is the way things are.
It's not the way you see it on TV.
In sociology class at Farragut High School,
I was being nice with him all the time,
Deborah L. turned around and said,
My boyfriend wanted me to give you this.
And she held up this weird poster
with these three funny faces on it.
And it said,
Sin is sacrilege and society for the bizarre.
Send one dollar to the Subgenius Foundation.
That's it.
I thought,
that's kind of weird.
It only costs a dollar.
I'll just go ahead and do that.
I got a pamphlet in the mail.
Well, that's pretty funny.
I showed it to my buddy Scott Kaye.
And he thought it was real funny.
He sent in his ten dollars to join up.
He got his membership pack back.
And there it said,
membership, twenty dollars.
So I figured,
man, if it's gone up from ten to twenty dollars
in this past week,
I better join quick.
So I sent in my twenty dollars.
It was in 1982.
The church first stumbled into my life
in 1981.
I was reading an underground comic
by Robert Crumb called Weirdo.
And there was an ad in the back pages,
The World Ends Tomorrow and You May Die.
It sounded like a good prospect to me.
And now it's almost tomorrow.
And it's been seventeen years
that I've had the Church of the Subgenius in my life.
At first,
at first it wasn't.
You know,
it's up to them if they can't take a joke.
Pull the wool over your own eyes
and relax in the safety of your own delusions.
There was something,
something much deeper
and more life affirming
than I'd even realized.
Well, you're going to need a divorce.
And that will make a wedding seem cheap in comparison.
We have any takers?
We borrow beer.
They're cheap.
So cheap that the government has to help all of them.
The prostitutes are bad for business.
They don't pay taxes
and the government doesn't get their cut.
It's the same thing with Kelly McBride.
Yes,
that's the entire purpose of it
as far as I know.
It's just because people look funny.
Amateur wrestlers look real funny sliding around.
You just go to the beer,
why are you taking it?
Everything's the same.
You're on a ride?
Just don't try to get your rocks off.
It's a good thing you can't see this footage on the radio
because it would be
not for children.
Some of these lovely people
are subgenius ladies and men.
They didn't want to get their clothes all bloody.
It's a savage and ridiculous sign.
I think it's an expression of some pent-up aggressions
towards other subgeniuses and towards the experience
that needed an outlet that was healthy enough
to not get arrested before its day.
It's a way of getting back to all the slack you had
when you were a little kid.
Remember when you were a little kid
and you'd be able to just sit there
with your little planted soldiers?
You've created a whole fantasy world around you.
This is it.
We've created our own fantasy world around us.
That's what religion's for, right?
To create a fantasy world?
But we live our fantasy world out.
We don't wait until we die.
Is it heroic to assassinate anyone?
No, no, no.
I'm gonna let you say no.
Because we're taught that assassination
and killing isn't a horrible crime.
What?
You keep putting me in this sentence.
You can get into it if you want.
You can't kill me.
You're killing me.
Don't use your sluss
when you're going to hell again.
My body takes samples of my being.
Well, go ahead and kill him, Astrid.
I don't care how long

I can land with Dr. McMahon.
I know if he's safe now.
Just as brutal as thought sees him as guilty,
that's their reason for making you
and to kill you.
You think that's easy?
That's smoking his head
and assassinating the Prime Minister.
And if he's crying?
Come on down, you talk for mail
and take me off to space.
Relax the oxygen.
In 50 years,
he will be remembered as assassin.
He'll be remembered as a national hero.
He stopped his country from making a big mistake, but he did it by killing the later Ed Cole
Fudd by assassinating him.
I don't care if you're some kind of ghastly beast without a face.
If you go back in time, kill a big little ass of man and take me off his face.
Most people say yes, this is the one Westwood they enjoy because he deserved to die.
Kill a big ass of man and take me off his face.
Take me off his face.
Take me off his face.
Come on down you awesome man and take me off his face.
Come down you tiny robot with your little on the earth watch.
A galactic hate, a revilement so vast that it thins you out that you blow up like a giant universe standing balloon.
Your molecules get so far apart that you're...
Take me off his face.
Take me off his face.
Come on down you awesome man and take me off his face.
Take me off his face.
Take me off his face.
Come down you awesome man and take me off his face.
Woo!
The only thing I can tell you is that this movie comes right from the new Super Fiber Test.
It contains O-P-R-A-N, Guar Gum, Silent Fiber, and at least 20% of the original.

I suck, I suck, I suck!
I suck!

I suck!
I suck!
I suck!
I suck!
I suck!
Everything you need to know how to make a human being.
You can go to www.myintrigallife.com
And see a name.
We're going to talk about O-Op.
and they did pull up and they were,
and we were gonna analyze that one part there where.
Well, hey, they're not broadcasting us right now.
Oh, good.
Well, there goes everything that's important.
Cause if they were, you just blew it.
Yeah.
That you just told them, now they know everything.
About Congressman Brown?
Well, it's all too late now, Congressman Hedler.
Yeah, well.
And it's being competitive.
Now everybody's gonna get like,
next thing you know, David Letterman
is gonna be doing judge back on Congressman Hedler's speech.
Remember?
Well, you know.
He's capping out the bag now.
It's like the colostomy bag is out of Frank's mantra now.
Well, Congressman Hedler is awful old
and there's a lot of people wondering how he got
his visa papers and so forth.
Terribly terrible.
You know what I mean?
Terribly terrible.
Well, I think it's just a popular concept.
You know, that's all politics on now.
I thought it was cool when Jesse the body bitch
Europe became governor, but then when Congress,
then the next thing you know, it was Senator Jagger
and.
And Corporal Whitney Houston and or I mean,
Congresswoman Houston and it was all.
The next thing you know, then there's Congressman Hitler.
At nine, 97 years old.
How old is he?
A hundred.
They said he's 97, but there's a lot of people
say he's actually a hundred and six right now.
Just a big old head in a jar going,
Machsnel, Machsnel.
Machsnel, Machsnel, Machsnel.
Everybody wants to go faster.
You remember that one Lady Riperstall movie
where they had everybody.
She's spending them jars and they were going by
at a thousand miles an hour with a little swastika on it
and a little blonde child would jump out each time.
One would go by and would salute it.
The thing would just go off into the well,
we don't call it the urinal and whatever it is,
you know, where they dumped all that stuff.
And it was just like it was the city of the future
where they take away every part of you didn't need
like your hair, you could get your hair.
You walk in and in a hair cutter would land on your head
and would remove it and really, you know, Nordic fashion.
And it was kind of weird, you know, well, you know, you know,

you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
tell me over and over and over again, my friend,
I just don't believe we're on the eve of the sun.
You know, are there real subgenius coops
that like take it a little too far?
Oh, yes, they are coops.
And they do.
There are subgenius, those who call themselves subgeniuses
and believe all the wrong lies and the lust of subgenius.
The stuff that's obviously there to be laughed at,
they know from their, it's what happens is our bullsada
or you know, kind of cheesy takeoff love,
satirical stuff happens to intersect
with their schizophrenia.
He's following me.
He's up there!
Can't you hear me?


Can't you see?
Follow with me.
Fly and dream.
There's a psychotic man in a dark mask.
He's after me.
He's up there!
Can't you see?
Some of these guys are truly twisted in the head.
Some of them, I think some of them should be locked up.
I think that some of these people,
after they sent their $30 to the church of the subgenius,
probably should have gone off somewhere and gotten some help.
They're scared to be in hell.
I'm slow, Fred.
Fred!
They went straight through my head
and I thought I was dead for sure.
No!
It's always dangerous to enfranchise
the misfits of society.
And this church is like a validation
on our mental and emotional parking stubs
that gives us a, you know, we pump ourselves up
with mutant self-confidence.
Hey!
I haven't paid my $30!
And I don't care!
I don't care about the $30!
I'm not going to pay my $30!
Occasionally you get, we get these people who,
what they wanted to hear was really pretty sick.
And they pick up on just the most horrible aspects,
or the corniest, you know, in a lot of cases,
the corniest aspects of it, and fixate on it.
You can join the rest of us at the same time, on the show,














on the same day, and overwhelm the power!
Ho!
Ho!
That day is July 5th, 1988, and that hour is 7 AM!
Ho!
Are you going to be part of the problem?
Are you going to be part of the solution?
The final solution to kill the conspiracy?
There's some potential for violence anywhere at all times.
I'd say, in this case, you have the advantage
that you have people who are prepared for violence.
Here's a picture.
There's some potential for violence.
I don't know if it's going to be anything that can't be
diffused with a joke.
I certainly hope so.
Don't you understand what I'm trying to say?
Can't you feel the fear that I'm experiencing?
Hit the button, it's pushed.
There's no running away.
There'll be no one to save.
Put the world in a grave.
Take a look around your boy.
It's bound to scare your boy.
And just tell me.
I'll be over and over and over again, my friend.
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.
Remember, remember, remember, remember.
Remember, remember, remember, remember.
The order of the nuclear arms.
And you change the genetic instructions.
We're sitting together listening to this.
DNA must replicate itself with extreme vitality.
Dear friend, what the hell is this that we're listening to?
Uh, let's see.
Uh, that Remember piece, to begin with,
that I'm so enamored of, is by Silica Gel,
as was that nice, long techno music piece we heard.
They won't just sit still and wait to die here.
From their independent CD, a song called
Make Brain Roast.
Boy.
And you can reach Silica Gel at P.O. Box.


P.O. Box 33561.
That's P.O. Box 33561.
Raleigh, North Carolina.
Uh, 27636.
But, uh, let's go back to the beginning here.
And feel back the layers of the tape.
As, uh, Tony loved this.
We'll see that there.
Uh, parts of this show were recorded at the Starwood Festival in New York.
Einstein's Secret Orchestra.
We're here with our dear friends there in the background.
And, uh, we've been listening to, uh, the voices of
Friday Jones, Papa Joe Mama, Susie DeFluzzi,
uh, Dr. LeZume, uh, yours truly, Reverend Ivan Tsang,
Dr. Onan Kanobites, and oh, who else?
Maury Popich there.
From, uh, little bits and pieces from Countdown to X-Day.
We also heard a little bit of, uh, Reverend Howard Kalin
of The Turtle there with that old Barry Maguire song.
And, uh, we've had a little bit of a rough destruction
which happens to be, uh, about X-Day.
Well, we'll be back on-site too with more of, uh, the, uh,
the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh ...
By the way, you can write to, uh,
the guy ranting to the Live Orchestra app.
Dear friends, 81555 ...
... uh, was, uh, cut from this rerun of Old Hour of Slack,
number 410.
from 1994.
This has mostly been a rerun,
but I replaced the stuff
from those who are no more
and don't want to be anymore
with Papa Joe Mama.
That Papa Joe Mama rant in progress
is a brand new one,
and it's a long one,
so whenever I have to replace anything
on this old show again,
you'll hear a little bit more
of Father Joe Mama's rather
deeply disturbing philosophical questionings.
Thank you.
This church gets you laid,
one way or another.
It gets you laid.
It gets you a ticket,
first-class ticket
on the escape vessels
of the sex goddesses from Planet X
who will be arriving here July 5, 1998
at 7 a.m.
And we're staying up for it, too.
Every time, so.
That's it.
That's a bit of a vigil, I thought.
No, no, that's the actual...
Is that Greenwich Mead?
That's another question.
Many people have said,
well...
What time zone are you in?
Well, Bob,
when the saucers get here
at 7 a.m. 1998,
where is it?
I mean, at which time zone
do they start?
And they will start,
I'll answer that question now,
at the International Date Line,
which lands in the middle
of the Pacific Ocean.
They'll basically hover over the Earth
in one place
and let the planet turn underneath.
And the great thing about that is
we'll be able to watch
the rupture on TV,
here in this country,
happening to the subgeniuses
in other countries,
which is kind of a test of faith,
because when you're rushing,
you look kind of like a burning monk.
But that's just the physical
bitmap shell being...
It doesn't have anything
to do with pain.
Then you get the first paradise
on the escape vessels of the sex...
Now, I don't know how this is...
I do well to go to the radio
and I have to play it.
This is...
Oh, great.
An old record
that our friend Nenslow,
assassinated Master Nenslow,
found in the cutout bins.
It was from the middle 60s.
The song that precedes this one
is called, well,
Good Vibrations
by the Beach Boys.
And this is like
this talk,
completely pink,
would-be Nancy Sinatra type,
whose name is,
believe it or not,
Joan Galt.
I can tell nobody here
reads Ayn Rand.
I don't blame you.
She hates you.
She hates me, too.
There you go.
Okay, well, this is Joan Galt,
the sister of Joan Galt,
and very much the opposite
of that character.
This is a song called
The Pink Life.
For those unfamiliar
with subgenius jargon,
pink is our derogatory term
basically for humans.
For those who do not carry
the seed of Bob and Connie
and the Yeti and so forth,
the pinks, the pink boys,
the mediocrities,
the normals, the Barbies,
the tin, the cage dwellers,
the clorps,
those weird...
The people with...
No, I have to wear a hat now.
The doctor said I wasn't
from our kind.
Subgenius is an ideal world
by the way.
But all the time,
just kick back.
But they do.
Anyway, just, uh,
we may not go too far.
They rub elbows
with a lot of jerkoos,
you know,
but just...
about the poop dog.
Douchebags.
Northern meat.
But let's not get lost
in the dogs, my friends.
And they get that kind of
taint and rub off.
Wouldn't even get single
but pink life.
That pink taint.
And the baptism
is basically to wash away
that pink taint
from rubbing elbows with
and kind of purify them.
The baptism is a very
beautiful thing
because most of us
need it.
It's how you see
a thing that comes
with rose-glazed
dead glass.
It's how you see


the pública's
You will fly, reach up from you high
No more up high, just a new thing bright
Think it's out of sight, think it's out of sight
You will find and go, find and go
Be true to the new you
Come on and begin to let it grow
Love you, love you
Be good to me, once it's yours
And we'll let it go
Love you, love you
And we'll let it go
Basically, every year we work, mingle with each other,
wash away our sins every year so that we can gain new sins
and then wash them away once again.
And we get to look at plenty of naked sins.
God!
We will break free from all God's prison, right?
We will fly, reach up from you high
No more up high, just a new thing bright
We will go to sleep, just a new thing bright
We will go to sleep, just a new thing bright
Hey, that's enough of the big life.
But a lot of these folks were baptized against their will.
I told you. Now, keep in mind that if you were sitting in a car driving along,
you know, this thing would sound quite different.
They're like a
consequences.
Not with out bare hands, though.
No, that's the way it is.
Why do you like me?
We want to kill by pressing a button or pulling a trigger or yelling,
Fire, bolt on torpedoes!
We want to kill and get away with it!
But not at least because of our popularity.
Well, friends, you doubt some of you are out there wanting to throw your organs into the air.
Let me say this about that.
If you don't need an excuse to do anything,
be it unpopular, immoral, or uncool,
then Bob Dobbs is your deity,
because Dobbs has the keen, mightiest touch.
Anything he touches becomes cool via his very presence.
And he doesn't charge big bucks for his services either.
Bob doesn't expect you to pay $20,000
and all you really need is a 20-hour screw.
I feel good.
Hugging or face the moron.
You want a license to kill someone?
You won't have to join the army and find a nickname that everybody hates.
Inside that circle of police station.
What is that?
That's a ring.
Because he was delivered, de-kidneyed, and eviscerated for our sins
and was regurgitated from the gorge of living death,
even for the justification, my friends, of these, our grins.
Yes, we're going to read to you today.
A sermon called The Reason for Dobbs' Day.
Originally preached by Dr. Howe.
Because, you know, friends, Dobbs did not die.
Because he had to.
Atman chose to kill him on stage for ye and everyone,
but mainly for his own reasons, these being unknowable and ineffable.
This man, Dobbs, was glad handed over and out to you by Dobbs,
with set purpose and knowledge, and you, speaking to the people of Dobbs Town,
even with the second...
...helping of Rugo's pinkish-eyed ones,
put him to death by nailing him to the crosshairs of Atman's gun sight.
Yet Dobbs regurgitated, freeing his impotent dude from the agony of slacklessness,
for it was impossible for me, him, whose grunt is easy,
to keep a tone on him.
Dobbs went on stage throughout the night of slack
for ye and everyone to prepare the way for us to leave.
The�를 in
name of Jesus was the Rock of Hell,


No liestes,

I don't know who the other side is.
No, no.
You trust in these divine nations.
You must have patience in this land.
Several subjects are working.
I mean, that's their job.
They're cops or they're federal agents or they're DEA drug agents.
Why not?
There's soldiers here.
To tell the truth, there's a couple of special forces guys.
There's people here that make me not worry too much about violence.
They got rough.
There really are subgeniuses.
July 5th, 1998 will come soon enough.
But it will be on his calendar.
Not his spirit's.
Not yours.
Not mine.
But his.
We're all just a bunch of retarded six-year-old kids who manage to carry our childlike system.
It will be a time of liberation.
A time of celebration.
And yet.
A time for killing.
This is where we.
Only know the truth.
And the inactive rituals and traditions.
How don't you?
You take that risk every day.
That's right.
You gotta remember you take a risk every day.
You walk out.
And you can get slack if you just wait.
You know, the countdown has begun.
It's like Christmas.
I don't know what I gotta do to get slack.
I know I gotta get slack.
Santa's coming real soon.
We've got the short way.
Two days.
I gotta have at least enough to fill a whole closet or two.
And I should probably start putting together some of those securities I've been thinking about.
And stuff.
I could maybe get more slack later.
If I save up for more slack now.
Okay, now do you understand?
We started this whole thing off telling you that we were gonna tell you what you really want.
Well.
Turn on.
I don't know how.
I don't know any other way to do it.
We stuck with the script.
This is the same script we've used every time.
If you have.
What is this?
This old Dr. Demento stuff.
You should.
I got it.
That was real funny in 1971 when I lived out in South Dakota.
Yeah, when you used to ride bareback over the plains and listen to the voice of the Black Hills.
Hi-ya, hi-ya, hi-ya, hi-ya, hi-ya.
I actually did end up riding across the plains on horseback with a fellow named Lorenzo Black Lance at three in the morning in the middle of the Rosebud Reservation.
Hi-ya.
Hi-ya.
Hi-ya.










Looking for the UFO he had just seen.
And he couldn't go to sleep unless he saw that UFO again and he wanted me to go out and help him look for it.
We rode all over the prairies all night long and it never came back.
And this here was a footballer named Keller?
Well, he was a member of the Rosebud Sioux tribe.
His dad was a medicine man.
Why do them damn UFOs hang out in the reservations?
Over across the state lines over there in New York State.
He just had a big hubbub about.
Over on the airport reservation there.
They spawned three real cylindrical disks.
Discs?
Not disks, but like it looked like a three-pronged article of some kind floating through space at high rates of speed with numbers of diminishing and growing rapid waves circling the bottom area.
We know those Alaskan totem poles.
They're actually UFOs?
Those are the heads of the UFO pilots.
Do you see the connection now?
The white buffalo woman that we were talking about earlier came down in a UFO and gave the pipe to the lucky UFO.
Lakota people.
And then crushed all the bodies into the, made a giant pool of blood which hardened into pipestone, which they make modern pipes out of.
It's very soft rock made of human blood, according to legend.
I got one of them things you were talking about filled with marijuana resin.
And the Iroquois...
Used to steal them. They'd go thousands of miles to steal the pipes from the buffalo.
They invented the UFO originally.
They had an anti-gravity thing and most of them took off.
And they only left a couple of Iroquois around?
You know they used to accuse the Erie Indians who lived around here of high sorcery, which is why the Iroquois wiped their cousins out.
Well, you know, you gotta...
Sometimes there's no, none of those particular bunches of Indians around to defend themselves and the only, the only thing you know about them is what their enemies said.
That's right.
For instance, the word Sioux is actually what the Blackfeet used to call the Lakota and it meant snake in the grass, you know, nasty worm.
Well, that's a bit too thingy to wind up with a whole moniker for the rest of your life.
For the whole rest of your ancestral days, all your people will be called the snake and the thing.
Right. Well, see, that's why Sioux isn't cool anymore.
And it's in today's modern dances with wolves, now a go-go PC world, it is correct to say Lakota.
But it's not fair to say that.
Heard here on camera three.
Oh, look, they're all lining up for the high-eye dance now. They're doing the corn ceremony.
Russell Means, Dennis Banks.
Claude Bellacourt.
All dressed up in suits.
Yep.
Yep. Flannel suits.
Sitting on top of that general store there at Wounded Knee reading comic books waiting for the FBI to burn them like they did Koresh.
But it was in the past and the FBI didn't have the special flamethrower tanks then.
And that's the hope of the future is that the FBI was not in the past and why we must all escape into the future so that we can rescue ourselves.
So that we can create, yes, we have to go into the future and create a time machine.
Yes.
And go back into the past and correct everything so it doesn't happen.
But then if that happens, we won't be going to make the time machine in the future in order to go back in the past and change it, which would mean it would, some, every other past would be good and the other, and then every other one would be bad.
There'd be four good ones and three bad ones.
So we're in the bad one now that we didn't, we weren't able to go back and change the past this time.
The last time, I should say.
But this time we will, so the next time will be good.
We created the things.
Well, that's time then now.
Because if we were going to go back because we had already intended to go back because we were in the bad one, we're going back to the good one, that would mean kind of necessarily we won't be back in the bad one.
Man, it's a paradox.
It's like that cat in the box.
You know, you cut it in half and Heidinger's still going to.
Schrodinger.
Schrodinger, yeah, that's right.
Schrodinger's still going to burn up when he hits the atmosphere.
20 years ago, I thought in 1998.
I couldn't remember either.
I was trying to give him some D-dar.
I'm surprised God did.
No way, man.
Heidinger was a guy who was a good guy.

He played with plants.
He was also the one that when he walked into a furnace or a surfactory unit or some kind of laboratory, haven't you ever heard of Menzies effect where you'd have a testicular or ovarian spike or something like that or someone would try and arrest you?
No, but I do.
Someone told me the other day that Einstein was once sold an elevator.
A man came to Einstein's house, a salesman, a salesman with a pipe, and sold Albert Einstein an elevator.
But Albert Einstein lived in a one-bedroom house.
It was a two-story house.
You know how that sounds.
Why do you think they call it subgenius, my friend?
Because if anyone could believe anything.
No, that's backwards.
I hate walking in a dark alley.
Myself, I can't get out of it.
I just got into one.
But it was only a one-story house in this reality.
Yeah, that's right.
Einstein knew.
In the other backwards time stream, it probably was a two-story house, and Einstein knew that.
And he probably knew.
and stalled the elevator.
And it probably worked for Einstein.
That's what we still, here we are,
we're sitting there making fun of that guy
for being old smarty pants,
and then it turns out he had the last laugh after all.
Yeah, but if you ever watch
those instructional television programs,
the current program has Einstein,
or one stone as they used to call him,
going back and forth in the elevator
to prove the theory of relativity
relative to quantum physics.
Don't you remember like the fact
when the elevator's on its way up there
and he's already down,
but it's only one story, see?
See, that's where the light starts to bend.
That's right.
And he's only in the elevator for 10 minutes,
but when the door opens,
it's 4,000 years later
and apes have taken over the planet.
That's right.
And the Statue of Liberty's stuck up to,
you know, up its neck in sand.
And it's wearing a mask too,
and Einstein is very old.
But I think it took that off for a while.
I mean, at least some of the kids
were getting scared there, remember?
There's never been a moment like that.
That was a clear cut day
for the planet
that has been put to sleep
and it's been shining like a diamond.
I've had this day to cling to
and now that it's finally coming up,
it's just the past few months
more to ignore
with every bit of your soul
like you said,
to take care of business
to finally get everything
out of my life to know
because this is a wonderful opportunity.
And as my friend,
Paul Mavridis said,
I wish I could forget.
But as J.R. Bob Dobbs said,
you can't take a joke!
Woo!
Well, so much for the radio broadcast.
Okay, here's a perfect description of Slack.
This will do a news segment now.
It's a radio show, so we should always do the news.
I hope that's not music
because I fight with this too much.
Actually, that's...
We should demean Jimmy Hendrix by doing it.
We should just play that at the end.
Here, we'll demean Captain Beef.
He wouldn't mind.

Nine, six, seven, eight.
Suddenly, the Bob Dobbs folding poster falls over.
No, we haven't folded yet, friends.
We just kind of fell limp for it.
Every now and then, you know what happens to the best?
If it happened to you last night,
don't feel bad about it.
You were just too drunk.
Bob himself does that sometimes.
Now, Bob is now re-erected.
Yes.
You know, I saw that happen.
The first cult meeting I ever went to
was an Ekencar meeting.
My friend Dr. Philo Drummond and I
were just starting to study cults at that time.
And this lady, the Ekencar lady,
was holding the meeting in a little Holiday Inn room.
She had a picture of the leader of Ekencar,
which if you aren't familiar with that,
it's one of the most stupidest names.
Dope-iest Rosicrucian Scientology spin-offs
you've ever seen.
And she had her picture of her guru,
Sri Darwin Gross, hanging from a podium.
And she said, in the midst of her lecture,
she said, with this man, Sri Darwin Gross, my guru,
I don't even need sex anymore.
And at that point, the framed picture of her guru
fell loose and crashed to the floor, and the blast broke.
By golly, if you're a city American, live here.
And so it happened. And so it happened. And so it happened.
And so it happened. And so it happened.
And I laughed.
Philo and I laughed.
We dared to laugh at Sri Darwin Gross
clung to the floor of that Holiday Inn.
And you know, ever since then, that's happened to me.
Every time I'm pointed, that damn picture of Bob
is flopped over or something.
Goodbye, everybody.
Oh, whoa, wait.
Bob, we always have to have a lot more sex.
There's never too much.
It's always better than not enough, dear friends.
Bob preached the word of sex hurt.
Sex hurt.
Some people get the wrong idea.
Like, we're really coherent things.
It's time to get tied up.
And you know, why can't it be?
No, sir. No, ma'am. No, sir, ma'am.
Sex hurt simply means sex that feels so good it hurts.
Woo!
Just don't have one of those limp Bob heads in your boudoir
when you're doing it.
Because they watch and can see you in every picture of Bob.
That's why you sometimes see them in restrooms.
It's sick.
Chuck Berry puts up there.
Stiff Bob heads are going big.
Stiff Bob heads are working.
Boo-coo money, friends.
All right, someone asked about Slack.
And this is a perfect example of it.
This is from our news, our special news service,
News of the Weird, from Chuck Shepard.
Can I read one?
Yes, why don't you?
This one right here.
Perfectly defines Slack.
Maria Funer, 30, was hospitalized in February
after being trapped for 40 minutes in her car,
buried up to her neck in concrete.
A cement truck had tipped over,
and the truck's funnel had punctured the top of Funer's car,
pouring concrete directly into it.
Friends, you are floating in a sea of Slack right now.
Slack is all around you all the time,
and you just, you're too blind to hear it.
You're too deaf to see it.
You're in an ocean of pills right now,
but you do close mouth to swallow them all.
I'd have to say this.
I never really expected any flying sauce.
To be honest, a lot of this stuff is really, really stupid.
Now, I heard that Bob sold the Dalai Lama,
a pair of spandex slippers that wouldn't bend
when he had to do his obfuscations,
and he had to carry them to Asia and America.
Asia and America.
He supposedly told the Dalai Lama
that that would lead to a better comprehension of nothingness.
So, yeah, I am disappointed, but part of being a subgenius
is saying, okay, I'm disappointed and miserable about this.
He said to the Dalai Lama, he said,
wear these, and you will be in the silence
of only the air-conditioning noise.
Oh, man.
He told my dad he'd be only in the silence of Onan.
But he ain't got it done.
I don't think he's too old to spank him.
The silence of Onan?
Onan's got a spanking.
That's the sound of your one hand.
I know.
Well, that's not a spanking.
That's the white noise.
The white noise.
The white noise.
Onan, wasn't that Jaffe's brother?
Jaffe, really?
Yeah.
I don't know.
I know you've always tried to keep him,
but I didn't know if Jaffe or Onan was in there.
I was running around with Onan last week in Portland.
Yeah, right around here.
People come to have that fall in love
and have kids or get depressed and can't get the right choice.
He's, I'm proud of it.
Darn proud of it, I might say.
From prehistoric Arkansas.
That's what we try to keep.
From Tennessee.
Is that where the Australian Monarchs planted the Indians?
Oh, that's, now that was when they first.
No one knows where.
It was on the lost plateau of land,
which is just a name nobody knows.
It's knowledge.
It's knowledge that is hidden from us.
Probably for our own good.
Because, you know, if we could get there,
we'd dig up the treasure.
Bob told me he has the map in his closet under the bed.
Do you know how it feels to be a man?
And he's gonna tell you zero times.
We could get that map, man.
Yeah, right, you could get a map.
We could break Charlie out.
We could free Charlie.
Well, I don't think we could.
Charlie, man, Charlie's got magic powers.
We could get them panties.
We could get into the forbidden plateau.
He told me, he said, go kill him.
He said he didn't like the idea of me reintroducing listening music, man.
Do you know how it feels?
Do you know how it feels?
Oh, I say that feels good.
Oh, oh!
Are you a sub-genius?
You know, we could use that machine I built up the other day.
There was a big red machine on the back of this truck
that said, O-Nan on it.
The O-Nan device.
Yes!
I'm going, going to get your bike.
I'll take three of them O-Nan devices and one orgasmatron.
And I'll take a prior six pack.
And six pack to go.
And also a bucket of chicken legers, too.
I'm sneaking.
That's coming over the phone lines.
That was, what the hell was that?
Now see when the...
Is that the X-Men?
Is that the X-Men?
X-Men.
No.
That's the X's.
That's, no, that's, it's Finnegan's wife.



Wait, that's a tent.
I think it was...
But I know Bob wouldn't lie!
The X-Men raptor is the one true escape.
I like Finnegan's bike.
I like the X-Men.
It's great right now.
Oh, stop.
He's trying to get...
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
48.
It's a longitude.
It's a longitude, longitude.
He's giving us direction.
The X, I told you it was the X-Men.
How could you tell them apart from a piece of wood?
Like the console.
You said you can't.
They look like they're not.
Then he said they were sprouting beanies and ears,
and some of them were carried around like that super wax,
turtle wax for cars and stuff,
and some of them were starting their own businesses.
But you know...
I'll just lose connection to you.
What the hell am I doing?
Oh, I'm cleaning my mind.
I'm sorry.
I just kind of drifted.
I was in my other world.
One of them American Airlines.
Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
He's got his eye socket pulled out.
Well, I think it's about time now.
We tipped her.
We tipped her.
He's looking at his watch.
We dipped her.
Dip the prairie squid, did you say?
I'm ready for some of that.
Dip a prairie squid.
Oh, it's that other tape.
That's what it is.
Chocolate-covered prairie squid, did you say?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's a record.
We probably don't have time.
Man!
Did I just wreck your computer there?
Oh!
I just stepped on his guitar, folks.
It's been a long day.
Let's try going to the farm.
What a gluttony.
You're going to pay for that.
Every bit to the crowd.
Take it again.
I hope you're not.
What do you have to say to yourself?
I hope you're satisfied.
Well, with the surviving populace
clinging tenaciously to useless routines
in hopes of retaining that one last tiny vestige of sanity,
you know, the least necessary
in most superfluous aspects of society,
such as bureaucracy and red tape,
will remain in place down to the final possible moment.
Mm-hmm.
The deorgasm popped out.
The depleted mankind-ordnance of the unruptured subgeniuses
will be left to handle the machinery of state or snake hunt.
1-4-0-3-0-6
And, dear friends, that's where the tape ended.
Dallas, Texas, 7-5-2-1-4
Leaving us here in the silence of only the air conditioning noise.
Although I should...
I should...

We had the script, my friends.
We had the script.
But Bob has it now.
Just to give you an example of
had this been an actual Hour of Slack show.
Of course, here's the...
It's kind of a description of a generic...
This is your token Subgenius Radio show for now.
So you don't have to...
You don't have to pick it up.
You don't have to pick it up.


Poor devil's gone.
You don't have to pick it up.
Um...
The generic token, um...
Sampled mix of radio preachers
saying ridiculous things.
I don't know how it sounds.
Hey, boy.
I'm going to have to search that.
All right.
Can I have something?
Can I have something?
Now, imagine driving down the highway at night.
Scanning your car radio.
And it lands on the last five minutes that you just heard.
It gets a bit mixed.
Preachers mixed with the rhythm.
Mixed with industrial noise.
Subgenius Radio Show.
Come here, boy.
And this is Nathan Vincent's cut.
