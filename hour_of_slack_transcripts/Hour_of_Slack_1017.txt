You ready, Kat?
What did your father teach you?
My father taught me to kill the sunflower.
Congratulations, Mr. Curtis. You are now awake.
Two hours to Jupiter.
I want people to take our music seriously.
The sweetest little thing you've ever known.
The Church of the Subgenius Hour of Slack was to premiere on WBCQ 7415 Sunday, September 18th at 21 UT.
It's being sponsored by the Bowling League.
All I can say is, from a look at their website, it's got to be heard to be believed.

Slant TS, slant HOS, dot HTML.
Good Lord, the hands are in.
They're not moving backwards anymore.
We're in normal time.
You're busy.
And you're unraveled.
Oh, oh, oh.
Programming.
Wait a minute.
We can't be advertising UMN on this show now.
You suck.
The Marian's dog shall spend the rest of your wretched lives.
Are you threatening me, buddy?
Don't you understand?
Here on the show, we've got power.
Yeah, real power.
And we intend to use it to make this society decent.
Where everybody wants to live and everybody's got a job.
And kids, maybe.
And pets.
Let's kick them.
Boom.
Boom.

We were just a bunch of silver miners out there every day,
digging in the dirt, uneducated, and humping on each other every chance we could.
Hell, sometimes some of us good old boys would even be humping on each other, and it
weren't like we were trying to be fancy.
We just didn't know what the hell we were looking at, did we, John?
Yeah, we did.
Ah, so one day I dug up this rock.
And it was a brand new color.
Not a trace or a hint or nothing or any other color you've ever seen.
It looked like memories.
Well, it was embarrassing.
And if you looked at it, all the parts of your brain that just sat there doing nothing would start right up.
And you knew what they were there for.
So we looked at it and it turned us real smart.
The next day we went into town and read all there was to read about the chart.
Then we went out into the desert, built us this big barn and sent it up here into space with us in it.
Been here ever since.
Now the one thing we didn't reckon on was space punies.
We're space punies.
Hey Jake, what are space punies?
In a world without gravity, the muscles will become dormant.
And do wither.
Your spine will straighten and the calcium in your arms and legs will redistribute itself in your head.
Thank you, Jake.
You see, old Jake knows.
Hey Jake, what happens if you go back to Earth with space punies?
It kills you slicker than snops.
And now we gotta get back there because every day they're making further discoveries about the chart.
In an attempt to further our knowledge, Jake and Edna started humping on each other.
And lo and behold, a child was born among us.
Had we known he'd have grown up to be such a hellion, we'd have killed him on that day.
Instead, we raised him on coffee, tobacco, candy bars.
The kind of stuff our guts couldn't take.
We built him a suit of hydraulics so his muscles would grow strong.
As he was raised to stand up against Earth's gravity as he set out.
To gain more knowledge on behalf of his kin.
A journey the boy don't know.
Know nothing about.
On account of him being as dumb as a stick.
Yes, dear friends.
And that was from the movie, The American Astronaut.
By the band called The Billy Nair Show.
That movie, American Astronaut.
The American Astronaut.
Is one of the weirdest, most bulldada and fun movies that I've seen in a long time.
It's actually from the year 2000 or 2001, I think.
It took a long time for it to come out on DVD.
But we scored that band and that director for X-Day.
Our big festival in July.
And no doubt we'll show the movie too.
And meanwhile, friends, this is Subgenius Radio Ministry.
The hour of slack number 14.
2017.
In this case, a Subgenius music special.
The irregular and unusual gang of idiots who post their media to alt.binaries.slack, including me,
have lately had a wild hair of musical compositions up their pipe holes.
Plus, I've been resurrecting old 1980s Subgenius music albums like
The Hair of a Man.
And now, the song that I'm about to sing is called
The Hair in Bob's Ears.
So, we have a lot of music, plus the collages of those crazy cut-ups,
Reverend Norrell Preff and Reverend Artemia Salina.
And now, Mr. Fernandinande Limer.
From PR News in Washington, I'm asking for a videotaped confession to be thrown out.
PR in spot.
PR is part of a continuing campaign to intimidate voters.
Defense Executives are on the move.

Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is recovering from massive PR news.
Military gangs will be sent to PR's recruiting center.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has committed serious torture.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said today that plotting to kill President Bush
is the latest example of how economic flexibility helps prevent PR news in Washington.

I bring you a warning.
Every one of you listening to my voice, tell the world.
Tell this to everybody wherever they are.
Watch the sky.
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.
Shazam!
And I say it is possible for a giant lizard to have lived there for years without being seen.
You, you, you, you bloated idiot!
You stupid!
I'll hit you!
There are a bunch of art critics and we're looking for people who like to draw.
You are not safe.
I'll save you from this.
Oh, so this is a...
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
a fucking desert underground den?
That is quite a joke.
That is quite a joke.
I tried to froth.
Groovy.
Right, Bob?
Bob?
Bob?
Wait a minute, how did this happen?
And we're smarter than this.
Apparently not.
Bye-bye.
Long call, Dave.
Don't you know what they're doing to yourself?
Apparently Bob came and did something with all of us.
The drugs I took seem to light up my brain.
I don't know what they're doing to myself.
I don't know what they're doing to myself.
I don't know what they're doing to myself.
And I say, as long as you're alive,
you'll make noise.
You'll laugh at that.
Because we're in love.
You shot up like hell.
And you ain't earned the last earnest tea batch.
Believe it or not, friends,
I, Stang, did that music myself yesterday.
Although a whole lot of the weird vocal clips in it
were done by the good Mr. Fernanda Nande Lemur,
as is PR news.
From PR news in Washington,
I'm struggling with competition from low-cost PR news.

During the next two hours,

From PR News in Washington, I'm splitting the country along ethnic and religious lines.
A woman's breasts are exposed to PR News.
On Wall Street, 8-3-10-6-2.
The president said, oh man.
There was more chaos at the PR News in Washington.
Feels kinda like I'm in Spaceland.
That's a contradiction in terms.
And Bob's shining down on me.
And no one's aiming a rifle at me.
Holy dammit.
That's a contradiction in terms.
And Bob is the giant hepatitis penis of destruction bursting forth from the portable Johnny.
Now let's all be a contradiction in terms.
Herds of benign cattle wander across the acid-washed, flush-drained landscape.
All belonging to their own friendship families.
None loving any other than Bob.
The flow between adjacent points of reference.
Points on the line segment between the concrete to absolute oblivious eternity.
Sweet lord, Bob.
When we all act together as men, as people, we could distinguish ourselves and betray any other.
As it was before time, but still within space.
All who bow down and submit to their fractals.
Bob's Audition was the name of that song there by the Psychoskeletons.

I'm abusing prisoners of PR's prison in Iraq.
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist is being investigated by tens of thousands of Texans
for his sale of PR news in Washington.
Gentlemen, you have all worked very hard.
And among the lucky, you are the chosen one.
You have been sprinkled with pucky stardust.
Yes, you have.
For today, you have been chosen to reside in the court of the great one.
Gentlemen, I give you the boy who actually saw a woman's breast.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!













I know.
A-E-I-O-U.
O-U, sweet thing.
Yes!
A-E-I-E.
I owe you.
I owe you nothing.
But sometimes, you owe me.
You owe me.
You owe me.
I-E-I-E.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
I'm talking to you when I say,
Why do the souls of my old dicks are still out at the sirens?
So call the cops.
And call the fire trucks.
And call the cops.
Call the cops, call the police
There is something walking around inside my face
I've got thick black stuff under my nails
And I think I kinda like the way it smells
There is food pressed against my gums
And I'll be good to see what it becomes
So I'll shave and look cute
With a sweat from in my poop
And I'll sneeze the snot from my stoop
And I'll wipe it down the sleeve of my suit
F-E-I-O, F-E-I-O, I-O, F-E-I-O, F-E-I-O
It was round and soft.
Now go back to work.

The Vatican is expected to issue a long document that would ban PR News.
There's a bob on my hood.
There's a bob on my rearview mirror.
And it sure makes me feel good.
There's a bob on my dashboard.
There's a bob on my trunk.
There's a tiny little bob head on my steering wheel.
And he drives when I'm drunk.
I said, bob face.
Bob face.
If you're like me, then you'd like to see that bob face every place.
Bob face.
Bob face.
If you're like me, then you'd like to see that bob face every place.
It says, bob on my license plate.
It says, bob on my bumper.
I got a tiny little bob face on my battery cables when I need a jumper.
There's a bob on my mailbox.
There's a bob on my street.
I even got tiny little bob faces tattooed on the bottom of my feet.
I said, bob.

Glass Madness did that in the good old 1980s in Berkeley.
And it was on the subgenius music album The Hairs in Bob's Ears.
And now some news.
And after that some of my sermon from the 25th Starwood.
From the 25th Starwood.
From the DVD.
Stang Live 2005.
From PR News in Washington, I'm not safe right now.
The International Atomic Energy Agency is capable of serving thousands of meals a day.
Stay away for now.
PR triggered some major blow.
A judge in Iraq has renewed arrest warrants for smashed police officers.
Tens of thousands of people took part in a march through the nation's capital today to
protest PR News in Washington.
Yeah, I'm not safe.















There really is a conspiracy.
And when we say, you know, develop your own strengths and your own slack, what we're saying
really is become less dependent on them.
You can't destroy that thing.
It's always been around and it probably always will.
Well, maybe in 2012 when the Mayan calendar comes around.
Maybe this year because it was 25th Starwood.
Who knows?
Maybe I'm wrong and maybe history will stop repeating itself.
But in the meantime, friends, is it really that easy to destroy the system?




Is it really that paranoid to be prepared?
Or are you prepared for paranoia?
A little pre-paranoia never hurt anybody, friends.
Pre-paranoia.
That's a new subgenius word.
Somebody, a guy earlier today was telling me about pro and pronoia, which was being
convinced that the whole world is out to make you happy.
I thought that was a really nice concept.
Yeah.
It's a nice conceit that would keep you going until you, you know, got cut off in traffic
or something.
Then you're back to the point like we are.
It's all a conspiracy.
They're all out to get me and it's not fair.
That is correct.
They are all out to get you and it is not fair.
Fair is a river in Africa.
Fair is where you take your pig and hope you win a prize.
But if you quit looking for fairness according to Hoyle,
and look for fairness that you may have overlooked,
you might be surprised at just how fair things really are.
But you have to look underneath the surface,
underneath the clothing of existence, so to speak.
Thus the word subgenius.
There are three non-consertees of all York land.

By Inviso Bob.
From the hairs in Bob's ears album.
Because that's what it's all about, isn't it, friends?
Bob's hairs.
The booth of J.R. Bob Dobbs.
Where you can learn more.
About how it is that Bob can be the ultimate capitalist.
And yet he's against the capitalist conspiracy.
That's because he was part of their conspiracy.
He was a rich man.
He didn't get into religion until after he had perfected sales.
Because what's the difference, you know?
But how could Bob does not buy?
He only sells.
How is this possible?
He is an economic monopole.
And you say it is a scientific near impossible.

It's a possibility.
But that is what he is.
He is not.
And it's like the goose that laid King Midas's paw.
Bob is.
When, uh, it's not that he's smart.
That's why it's called Church of the Subgenius.
Intelligence, as defined by the conspiracy, has nothing to do with this.
We think that's all been defined wrong.
What we're into is not intelligence but sense.
Common sense.
Pretty rare these days.
Sense.
Sense of humor.
Pretty lame most of the time.
And dollars and cents.
Which you have and oh Bob.
Bob.
I assign you an eternal fate.
I curse you with the ultimate curse.
May it seize you instantly as it leaves my mouth.
Never may you have a home and family.
Never caress a child of your own.
May your man prefer younger, prettier girls.
May he beat you as a housewife beats a rug.
May you never acquire bright alabaster or shining silver the delight of men.
May your roof keep leaking and no carpenter fix it.
May wild dogs camp in your bedroom.
May owls nest in your attic.
May drunkards vomit all over you.
May a tavern wall be your place of business.
May you be dressed in torn robes and filthy underwear.
May angry wives sue you.
May thorns and briars make your feet bloody.
May young men jeer and the rabble mock you as you walk the streets.
May all this be your reward for seducing me in the wilderness when I was strong and innocent and free.
I've got no money but I've got no bosses.

This song is a brand new one from Norrell Preff.
And the collages of the preceding four or five minutes except for PR news by Lee Murr were also all by Norrell Preff.
That's spelled N-O-R-E-L.
Preff.
But now a new piece of music from Reverend James Cobblestone.
Did you have a vision?
Is something coming?
Oh yeah.
Something terrible.
Something very holy.
Something very awesome.
No he didn't even think of that.
Something very awesome.
Something very holy.
Something very awesome.
Something so holy.
Something very awesome.
Something very holy.
The sacristy was virtually a dump.
Very holy.
Something very awesome.
I have a great delight to come in this cathedral.
Very awesome.
Something very holy.
The chalice was always sticky and muddy.
Something very holy.
Something rotten still smells.
Something very holy.
It was a feeling.
Something very holy.
We want who you want.
We want something very holy.
Something very awesome.
Stand far away.
Something very awesome.
We decide that ours is the best and we put other people down.
Something very awesome.
Something very holy.
Something very awesome.
You're making the law.
Something very awesome.
Is there one law for the rich?
Something very awesome.
Beautiful things only spotlessly clean.
Something very awesome.

Something very awesome.
One without the other would be.
Very awesome.
Something very holy.
Something very awesome.
If you see a man dressed in fine clothes with gold rings on his hands.
Very holy.
Something very awesome.
Come near.
Something very awesome.
You'll be given a rap on your fingers.
Very awesome.
Something very holy.
The choice is yours and the choice is mine.
To walk in the power of God.
To beg for God's forgiveness God rest his soul.
To walk in the Father divine.
Something very awesome.
The choice is yours and the choice is mine.
Something very awesome.
To walk in the Father divine.
Something very awesome.
Something very holy.
The choice is yours and the choice is mine.
The choice is yours and the choice is mine.
The choice is yours and the choice is mine.
The choice is yours and the choice is mine.



The path is always both.
To walk in the Father Divine.
Wipe these things away as if they are superstition and they lead to nothing.
I'm exhilarated you're alone.
What's the future of the cosmos?
What is the nature of reality?
We still don't know.
Are we alone?
Contact us.
It's preposterous.
Until recently we had no idea, we had no idea.
We still are groping for answers.
So absurd.
We are now actively looking at the sheer size of an enormous billion, billion, billion, billion.
No one actually knows.
It's actually a hard hit.
Dance a little bit.
We've only been at it for a short while.
Billions don't get frozen all the time and boiled away.
Each species is somehow the result of some almost drunken random walk.
Move over here, move over here.
Stumbling aimlessly across a featureless terrain of possibility.
Life is basically lazy and is going to be limited for inorganic carbon-free.
We're going to be stuck at the level of pond life.
Stresses of various kinds may be building up in the system.
Build up, build up, crash.
Or it will crash.
This side is too large.
It's amazing.
We're wrong.
Maybe they always blow themselves.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.
I would love to be aliens.
Big-headed octopus-like billion.

From PR News in Washington on one of the worst were rabbits.
There was no PR News.
You're listening to PR News.
Thousands of people in Colorado may of destroyed the creators of PR News in Washington.
We shall praise Bob till the end of days and smash the Church of the Soap Genius.
Praise Bob, praise Bob, save the pigs, we shall liberate them.
Praise Bob, praise Bob, you will not succeed.
Church of the Soap Genius, we are the PLF, the Pink Liberation Front.
And we shall succeed in our plans to smash you, your worthless pieces of poo.
Praise Bob.
Reverend Shane Smirker, uh-huh, in Australia, is responsible for that.
Before that, we heard Leigh Murr's special moments
and a preposterous Norell Preff cutscene.
But now, our new official Soap Genius Army Marching Song.
Yes, we have one! An army!
And a march, now that we have a marching song, we can have an army.
And this marching song, friends, is by Reverend Artemia Salina.
Ahem, that's true.
And when walked our beers, we have a surprise!
There she goes.
Well, that means the army is finally here.
Then, on a음...
Thearial Ancestral Oocenea, with her young blood andストofy hands,
will now take the lead in theücksspeed I heard.
