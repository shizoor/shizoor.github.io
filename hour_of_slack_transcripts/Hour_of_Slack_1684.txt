From PR News in Washington, I'm prompted by a broader federal probe into fraud and the giveaway to the wealthy.
The Trump administration says it is considering waiving to storm-ravage Puerto Rico, 35%,
as well as 20%.
As well as 7%.
As well as 3%.
With just 50%.
That means PR News.
What makes a total mockery out of the working class for the wealthy?
PR's Report reports Congress is no longer in charge of the broad fraud program.
PR's Report is under federal investigation.
PR's Bad.

Say, have you ever noticed that Ruth Buzzy has a lot of tension in her eyeball?
Sometimes a vein will pop out of that milky orb and make a sloshing sound, like when you
carry around Baba Ganoush in your goddamn sock puppet.
Lately it's been rubbing me the wrong way.
Franching down to the palindrome for the big rock and roll show, butter and crackers passed
a medicinal can of the storefront where three guys took turns playing rock, paper, scissors
and listened to newly remastered Gino Vanelli albums.
Muffled screams passed through the air vents, but a row of customers seemed unconcerned.
They'd hoped to purchase 15 grams of Mimosa Sunset Shatter and maybe some rolling sugar,

but unfortunately they would be detained.
For the first time, butter and crackers would learn all about rotary screw air compressors,
and serendipitously, the police department would notice improved visual surveillance
in the vicinity of the grey discharge blooms.
It was definitely a win-win scenario for all concerned.

Thank you.

so somebody was talking about having a countdown, Anna
well we always do, don't we?
we're out there counting down
yeah
we can start counting down, I guess
not now, but when we're out there
why not? let's start countdown
oh that takes too long
let's start now
no, it's far too long
we start like, you know, 10,000 or something
count backwards from 10,000
the number of bottles of beer on the wall
yeah, what if we actually miss it?
we need a calculator
anybody got a calculator?
we're going to have to calculate some

and we'll see if maybe we can get there
shoot out one little ball of information
a little bit of information

a little bit of signal

we'll see if it can be done

of their lack of adaptability for this particular eventuation.
So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.
On the other hand, the problem all along has been not of authentication,
but of the correct identification of the time.
It could be that despite all the pleasing indications we've received,
there may yet be yet another reason to delay if the exists choose not to manifest themselves.
And I only mention this to show that we think of every eventuality here, even the highly improbable.
So, if that is the case, I think we are all seasoned campaigners enough to know what to do.
That is to say, wait till next year.
And continue to gather and garner subgeniuses into the church.
Remember, we only evangelize to get them.
We don't want everybody. We can't get everybody.
Everybody is not a subgenius.
Only the true subgeniuses will be attracted and fall naturally into our orbit.
And we would like to give everyone an appropriate...
...time frame in which to do so.
But time is a thing of dragonflies and angels.
The former live too little, and the latter live too long.
Okay, let's get down to it, Boppers.

1981.
Inside Bob's Cult's Dallas Pow Wow.
So this is an article by Jay Kinney about a...
Saint Jay Kinney.
Saint Jay Kinney.
And it's many pictures.
There's tentatively a convenience with his two braids being pulled out from the side of his head by...
Well done.
Yes.
I have looked up tentatively a convenience, who I remember fondly, from lots of church literature in the old, old days.
He counts himself as a former subgenius, but he's still definitely making art.
Definitely starving.
Definitely...
In their swing and in the subgenius tradition.
So even though he considers himself a former subgenius, he is obviously still a subgenius.
I...
You know, most churches don't let you just walk away.
His involvement has been less, that's for sure.
He leaves the KGB and nobody leaves the church.
That's the assumption, yes.
Nope, nobody does.
Unless, of course, it's on their pleasure saucer.
And how many hours until we enjoy that...
The Exist Hellfire?
14 hours, 28 minutes, and 45 seconds.
Here we go.
One, two...
Jopstown.
Jopstown.
Here I come.
I'm going to...
Jopstown.
Jopstown.
Here I come.
They got some crazy little...
Jopsteads.
There ain't nothing gonna get me one.
You know, with a face that is reproduced everywhere, one doesn't need to show it all, only enough of it to be the identifier.
And then the rest of it is...
It's implied.
Even seen by those who don't look carefully.
So trim it down.
Put it on your lighter.
Let me see that.
Where's that other lighter?
The lighter I had.
Oh, it's my lighter.
But let me see that Bob thing over there.
That paper that you've got.
The Bob face?
This one?
No, the one that you were saying could be put on a lighter.
You see, it's the...
It can.
This is the big version.
Well, it can.
Because notice, it's the height.
The proper height.
Yeah, well...
You just need to trim it down a little bit, and then, wow.
I admit, it will look awesome once you trim it down.
It's gonna look unbelievable.
You need the scissors, and not the scissors of sight, either.
That's the editing function, which we all have and can exercise.
Without any effort, of course, it withers or does not expand to be what it ought to be.
Well...
It's a little...
Arrange the way these things end up, and it'll become part of our special...
So, are we gonna do a show in the morning if we...
I mean, assuming that we don't die and our...
Well, you know, I'm not sure I like this morning thing, but maybe we could do it...
We could do it on the saucers, or we could do it here, and I know...
I'm an expert now setting this up.
Well, sometimes one might want to go back and take a nap after all this.
I think I'll take a...
You want to...
You want to take a nap after...
Well, it's possible.
I might want to take a nap, a nice, soft...
We're gonna be so excited, though.
Yes.
Maybe.
Another reason to take a nap.
You know, or we could be disappointed.
True.
We might have a day of disappointment.
Yes, so a nap.
But what's new?
We can do that.
We can celebrate a day of disappointment.
Sure.
It just requires the stamina.
Think about, you know, even in disappointment, there's sometimes some fun in there.
From having recently taken a nap.
Hiding.
A nap.
Hiding deep inside disappointment.
Right.
The disappointment itself, not the secret to be discerned, but yet another concealing action.
It hides what's really going on.
Yeah, deep inside disappointment.
It's filled with glee and fun.
It's real, real deep, though.
It's almost inert.
It's like an inert element.
Somewhere, a little core essence.
Deep inside.
It happens.
Oh, five minutes to go.
Five minutes.
Five minutes.
Just five minutes.
Five minutes till showtime.
I feel the tension building.
You have time for...
Make it to the snack bar one more time.
The snack bar.
Let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.













Well, the snack bar will close in a little less...
Hot dogs.
The snack bar will close probably in a matter of 15 minutes.
Well, soon we'll get the snack bars on the saucers.
Yeah.
And they have all the good snacks.
That's right.
All very fine edibles.
Do you have anything to say in the next four minutes to the faithful?
Fuck.
Fuck.
Pick.
Peas.
Fuck.
Peas.
Fuck.
Peas.
Fuck.
Peas.
Fuck.
Peas.
Fuck.
Peas.
Fuck.
Peas.
Well, now we got our fuck peas, Shannon.
Fuck peas.
Hey, kids.
We got one more minute to make it to the snack bar.
The saucers will be here in two minutes.
Two minutes.
Two minutes.
Just two minutes?
Just two minutes.
Three, two, one, order.
One minute.
I think we'll get em with two more.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Summon the saucers.
What a good job.
Don't get caught in between that beam right there.
Don't cross the streams.
Split your head in two.
Thanks for battling.
Stay back.
It's not safe for you.
Yes, don't cross the streams.
Or do cross the streams.
Ooh.
If you're into that.
Seize your protection.
So, assuming...
that we don't die
or we live
and we are off
in space somewhere.
It must be.
We could pick up
this whole table
and take it with us
so it's not that big a deal.
Well,
it will.
Let's hook some electricity up.
They're going to have
plenty of that around.
But they can make us think
that we're sitting
at a table
and even feeling it,
touching it,
tapping it.
You don't even
plug your stuff in.
It just picks up
the air,
you know,
the electricity,
the ions in the air.
and that they use
and then
corresponding
to what one would
expect to hear.
Yes.
What one would expect
you to do?
We must expect
that our
often reported
So are you going to do
the videotaping tomorrow,
Dr. Howell?
What videoing is this?
You mean when the saucers
descend?
There's a thing in the box
for attaching iPhones
and such to the tripod.
The thing in the box.
No, sir.
I was not considering
doing that.
But anyone is welcome
to use both tripods
and or the video camera.
We should encourage
everyone
to take videos
with your phones
or something.
We're having a little bit of
whatever electronic device
we've had some changes
take videos
because Reverend Stang
normally takes videos.
We'd like someone
to take over
this important function.
Sure you can.
You don't need
internet to do that.
It just needs someone
to take a game.
It just needs someone






to take a game.
You just need to
remember
don't hold your phone
up like this.
Hold it like this.
Okay?
Panorama.
When you're videotaping?
Yes.
Don't do a portrait
style movie.
In Vista Fiction.
Because then it's going
to hit when you look
at it later
it's going to be
these giant black bars
on both sides of it.
They're just wasted space.
Giant Panamation.
The new miracle
What do people think
about those black
what do you think
when you see
those black bars
what do you think
What do you think
Censorship.
No I think somebody
What do you think
about the black bars?
The giant black bars
on either side
of the movie.
Oh those are
the black bars.
Oh yeah.
Nobody ever goes
out there.
The movie ends
before you get out there.
I always feel like
I'm looking at a movie
like through the crack
of a door.
I can't actually
see the whole movie.
I can just sort of
look in a crack
and like man
I wish they'd open
that door so I could
see the whole frame.
It's like just a
narrow piece of it.
With this black
ozone death
void area.
Yeah.
Well you know
that might be
a more accurate
description than you
believe it to be.
Yes you could have
been spot on there.
It's very very
irritating.
And not only that
look at all that
space it wastes.
by impending
destruction.
Think about it.
It's like
30 or
maybe 50 percent
of the space
is wasted.
Yeah.
Of course our
affairs.
They should at least
you know maybe
get some software
that they could
start putting like
other content
in the empty space
next to the stupid
content.
We are not
organized.
Ads or
cartoons.
Efficiency
principle.
No rather
I would put little
cartoons like
funny little
animated cartoons.
Evolutionary.
That were making
fun of the
of the content
you know saying
bad things about it
because of the
hey we're not
we are we're only
here because
this idiot forgot
to turn it this way.
The layers of time
and mutation.
I don't really mean
to disparage idiots
or anything.
No of course not.
You know.
I wouldn't want to do that.
No not necessary.
That's mean.
That's overkill.
That's just mean.
Right.
Yeah.
Oh we've got better
things to do.
Bigger fish to fry.
Yeah right.
Places to go.
That's right.
Busy all the time.
Totally unnecessary.
Yes.
Just so.
Because they have
their chance
to find their ways
to Bob.
But if they don't
then perhaps
they weren't
supposed to
be there anyway.
They were supposed
to be living
their pink lives
and not
have their stories
intersect with
Bob and the church
at all.
Theoretically.
Theoretically.
Yeah.
I mean we
that instance
would excuse
all
enough
anomalies
and so
things went
haywire
off the track.
We've got some
good
space on our
SD chip.
We've taken up
a lot of space
on there.
Red flag waving.
Yeah.
Think about this
digital space.
It's not free.
Everybody thinks
it's free.
You know.
But it really
there's a lot of
stuff that goes
on there.
A lot of stuff.
Yes.
Electronic stuff.
All sorts of
transmissions.
Things people don't
want to know about.
You know.
It's better off
not knowing about
them.
Not three miles

Just assume
that it's okay.
Too much
information.
And
so yeah.
Too much data.
Too much.
Right.
But if you
feel the desire
Well tomorrow
we can say
goodbye to all
that stuff.
Go ahead on
and take a dip
in the data pool
with Commander Data

deserve their

It's a dry

And as you've
explained,
the laser
hellfire of
the excess
craft is a
dry heat.
Yes.
And it would
probably be a
relief compared
to what we're
going through
right now.
The good news
is that if
the excess
do fail to
show up,
which I
firmly believe
will not
happen,
the excess
will be here
tomorrow morning
at 7 a.m.
They just
have to be.
Damn it.
Mm-hmm.
We'll be
playing back
this recording
on the pleasure
saucers and,
you know,
distributing it

not through the
internet,
but just the
universal MindLink
of all subgeniuses
who survive
the end of the
world.
And if the

actually end,
you get to
actually hear us

So showing
Grindhouse movies
to everyone
being directly

Yes.
That's what I'm
thinking.
I'm thinking.
One of the
writings that
Stang did
way back when,
I think it might
be in the book.
I have to double
check.
He was talking
about how
television is
so stupid
because there's
three main
networks.
If you live in a
big city,
back in the day,
there were
maybe five
channels,
six,
and all showing
the same garbage
over and over
again.
When there was
this universe
of Bulldog,
a universe
of old
movies,
stuff that
would change
people's lives
if you could show it.
And why don't we
have infinite
television stations
and why don't we
have just people
showing Bulldada
their own channel
of stuff all the time
and then fast forward
30 years.
We have
hundreds
of channels
on
cable television,
digital cable,
Fios cable,
these literally
hundreds of channels
and just like 30 years ago,
they're showing
the same old crap.
The same old crap.
Yep.
Yes.
I,
well,
there is still
a starvation
of Bulldada
except on
some of the
lesser known
digital TV channels.
Mm-hmm.
The channels
that your favorite
networks
just
people,
they just,
they just bought,
they just bought
the channels,
set up another
transmitter,
and they just
want to show stuff.
It's about
three steps up
from the old
public access.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
When we could do
so much more,
we could do,
we could do
so much better.
Right.
But then,
we need to bring
back CUN TV.
That's that
Canadian channel.

I can see it all now.
I'll be sitting in a chair.

I don't know.
He was here

Oh, I got stuck in the grass.
I didn't want to turn up the grass.

Well, as, as the horseshoe theory of most things, sometimes things are so stupid, they
come right back around and they become smart.
Not this
We're not discussing politics here.
No.
No God, no.
There is so stupid that it becomes smart and there is so stupid that it's just, well, stupid.
Well, I, that would probably be the continuum theory of, of intelligence where you just
keep going to an infinite point.
Of stupid.
Some people couldn't be smart if, if they didn't try.
They certainly, they certainly don't try to be, they certainly don't try to be smart.
That's, that's the whole thing about some people are deliberately stupid.

Well, anyway, what we're going to do is keep on keeping on,
because Stang would have wanted it that way.
But you weren't able to get through on the main axis to tell Stang of our...
I actually did get through.
I sent a message.
I never got a reply.
Sent a message, eh?
At least he'll know that we did it.
We did it.
We did it.
Right here, we did it.
And when I say we, I mean me.
Well, him, yeah.
He did it.
I mean I.

You said you did it.
All right, I dood it.

And daddy beat up mommy
And broke her collarbone for good luck

Now everybody's drunk
And everybody's wasted
And everybody's drinking on the job
There's a whole lot of places that I ain't been
A whole lot of things that I ain't seen
A whole lot of things I'll never be
The generation that will change the world
Is still looking for its car
There'll never be a tomorrow
Still the faces that can't be seen
Definitely seen

When everybody's drunk
And everybody's wasted

It's Jesus

Fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober
Leave me alone
Let me go home

Times get tough

To buy me a bottle of wine

Fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober
Leave me alone
Let me go home
Let me go home

I went to have a kid
They meant it
When he got in touch with that girl
Ixis
She did not leave her number, but I know the place to call.
Cause my uncle took the message and he wrote it on the wall.
Help me information, get in touch with my Marie.
She's the only one who called me here from Memphis, Tennessee.
Her home is on the south side, high above a ridge.
Just a half mile from the Mississippi Bridge.
Yeah, I love Memphis.
Alright, next song.
Well, the last time I saw Marie, I screamed her goodbye.
Her re-home dry, softened teardrops, trickled rubber high.
But we were torn apart because her mom did not agree.
And tore apart our happy home in Memphis, Tennessee.
Woo!
Woo!
, Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!






Well, help me information, more than that I cannot add.
Only that I miss her.
And all the fun we had.
Marie is only six years old.
Information please, try to put me through to her in Memphis, Tennessee.
I'm talking about Memphis.
That's where the king lives.
Yeah, maybe I'll make it a visit sometime.
Get on.
Two, three, four.
Two, three, four.
