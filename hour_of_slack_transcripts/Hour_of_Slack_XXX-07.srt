1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,220
Hey you! Get gone!

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,620
I need help, all the help I can get.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:16,220
We cannot take your souls for minds or bodies.

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,000
How do you know? What do you mean? How do we know they're nuts?

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:20,680
And I wouldn't know it.

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,340
I'm going to call out some words.

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,480
And I want you to respond with the first word that comes to mind.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:53,500
Window. Grass. Candy. Money. Desk. Mother. Steel. Paper. School. Park. Car. Nail. Tooth. Flower. Letter. Red. Friend.

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,520
I don't know what you're talking about.

10
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,160
Water.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,420
Shit.

12
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,340
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:02,760
Toy.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,500
Ass.

15
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,380
Truth.

16
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,040
Ass.

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,640
Ass.

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,180
Ass.

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,760
Lie.

20
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:07,680
Toy.

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:07,980
Shit.

22
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,440
Home.

23
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,340
Fuck, fuck.

24
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,280
Worry.

25
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,100
Motherfucker.

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,600
Why do you suppose you use mother so much?

27
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,440
God damn.

28
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,020
The temptation was too great.

29
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:16,540
Fuck you.

30
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,040
And it exhibits itself in devious ways.

31
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,040
Fuck you.

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,200
Motherfucker.

33
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,740
Do you understand?

34
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:25,720
Fuck you.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,080
And, uh, and if you are in fact a motherfucker,

36
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:29,980
you've come to...

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,640
You've come to the right place.

38
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,160
And this might even be the church,

39
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,320
the religious church for you.

40
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,920
You notice that we're not in a cathedral,

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,380
and it's not Sunday morning,

42
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,220
and you're not wearing a necktie,

43
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,800
and you're not trying to hold in your farts.

44
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,520
At a subgenius church meeting,

45
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,880
you can go ahead and fart.

46
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,560
Bob doesn't care.

47
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,480
Bob does not care.

48
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,720
Because he's not here, and he won't smell your goddamn farts.

49
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,820
I am, but I'm up on stage,

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,160
and I won't smell them for a few more minutes yet.

51
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,860
I am up on stage.

52
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,260
The First Amendment gives you the right to choose what you hear,

53
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,580
what you say, and what you think.

54
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,840
Now, how much money do you think you're gonna make out of this?

55
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,980
Neil doesn't give a fuck.

56
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,260
Oh, I don't know.

57
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,820
I don't know.

58
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,100


59
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,520
I don't know.

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,880
I don't know.

61
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:29,940
I don't know.

62
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


63
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,600
I don't know.

64
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:33,600


65
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:33,600


66
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,700
Money, talk, and bullshit, walk.

67
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,340
No, I didn't say about that.

68
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,360
I don't give a fuck.

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,200
I don't give a fuck.

70
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,840
I don't give a fuck.

71
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:43,460
I don't give a fuck.

72
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,340
It's time to grow up and take some responsibility.

73
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,600
So what?

74
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,940
Why shouldn't they be offended?

75
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,980
Because they've done that they shouldn't be offended.

76
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,860
Uhhhhhh, what was that?

77
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,660
Who gives a fuck?

78
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,460
Who gives a fuck?

79
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,000
Who gives a fuck?

80
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,840
Who gives a fuck?

81
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,140
Who gives a fuck?

82
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:26,060
Funny, talk, and bullshit walk.

83
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,600
I don't give a fuck either.

84
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,080
Could you state that as a question, please?

85
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,960
Who gives a fuck?

86
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,800
But Bill doesn't give a fuck.

87
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,980
Funny, talk, and bullshit walk.

88
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,960
How do you feel about that?

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,700
Ha! I don't give a fuck.

90
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,500
I don't give a fuck.

91
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,040
I don't give a fuck.

92
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,140
I just give a fuck.

93
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,460
I don't give a fuck.

94
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't give a fuck.

95
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,680
Censorship is never going to accomplish anything.

96
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,480
As long as there are a few four-letter words in the album,

97
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,620
it will always sell an extra million copies.

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,520
We want people to make up their own minds.

99
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,700
I don't give a fuck.

100
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,220
I don't give a fuck.

101
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,680
I don't give a fuck.

102
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,360
The first amendment gives you the right to choose what you hear, what you say, and what you think.

103
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,500
Funny, talk, and bullshit walk.

104
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,960
Please, state that as a question, please.

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,780
Have you been told?

106
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,280
Screw it.

107
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,960
No, I'm not.

108
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,720
I'm not going to say anything.

109
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,340
I'm not going to say anything.

110
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,380
I don't give a fuck.

111
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,520
I don't give a fuck.

112
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,040
Oh, yes, dear friends.

113
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,560
That was Bill T. Miller, the king of slack.

114
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,540
.com, if you want to get more of that.

115
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,120
With I don't give a fuck.

116
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,680
Yes, baby.

117
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:28,600
And before that, we heard some stuff from Fernanda Ndelemer.

118
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,060
From Reverend Norrell Preff.

119
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,440
Reverend James Smurker, all the way over in Australica.

120
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,420
And yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

121
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,760
Yes, an X day is coming.

122
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,940
The end of the world is coming.

123
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,140
Who cares what the fuck happens?

124
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,020
Because I'm slacking off, dear friends.

125
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,100
This particular show, X-Rated Hour of Slack No. 7,

126
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,020
is strictly for the Internet.

127
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,420
And underground stations.

128
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,780
It's all the cussful and naughtyful material that piles up

129
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,440
at the labs here, built out of time control.

130
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,980
And then finally, every X day or so, erupts like an infected boy.

131
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,680
For us to live any other way was nuts.

132
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,780
Plus those goody good people who worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks

133
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,500
and took the subway to work every day, worried about their bills, were dead.

134
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,280
And they were suckers.

135
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,000
They had no...

136
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,160
No balls.

137
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,160
If we wanted something, we just took it.

138
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,680
If anyone complained twice, they got hit so bad, believe me, they never complained again.

139
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,160
It was just all routine and you didn't even think about it.

140
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:39,980
You can never hit a number.

141
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,520
Hey, sit out here.

142
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,320
Watch. Watch this, Jenny Lee.

143
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,000
Watch this. Look at this.

144
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:47,620
Great.

145
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,680
Will you say hello to our audience, Mr. Boomer?

146
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,320
Hello.

147
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,160
Now tell me, sir.

148
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,000
When did you first realize that you...

149
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:03,120
You were proficient enough to take a shot at the Empire Championship?

150
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,100
Well, ever since I was a little nipper, I liked to fart.

151
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,820
I remember I used to make my mother and father laugh their bleeding heads off

152
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,280
when I used to let one go in church during the announcement of the ladies' eighth.

153
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,520
Excuse me, Mr. Boomer.

154
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,340
On the radio, we call it crepitating.

155
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,220
Now look here, copper.

156
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,720
What I always says is a fart's a fart.

157
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,640
Whether you raise up on one cheek and sneak,

158
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,040
or whether you give it a full blast like I do.

159
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:30,960
Very well.

160
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,980
I personally find the four-letter word much easier to say

161
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,360
and more descriptive than the longer and more academic crepitating.

162
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,020
Thank you.

163
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,720
That brings us up to speed.

164
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,820
And, um...

165
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,360
Yeah.

166
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,200
Valfen, oh, Valfen, you're from the Vestiniskis.

167
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,440
Visit number to call.

168
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,820
And, uh, you know, I already kind of stated what it would take

169
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,880
for you to get in my good graces this week.

170
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,960
Very special, uh...

171
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,740
theme we're talking about this week.

172
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,580
As you may or may not know,

173
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,820
July 5th is coming up on us very quickly.

174
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,880
Very, very quickly indeed.

175
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,020
And July 5th is an important day on the calendar because...

176
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,020
Well, if the conspiracy hadn't been messing with our calendar for so long,

177
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,000
then, um, you know, July 5th would be for sure the day that Bob comes down

178
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,440
in the saucers.

179
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,980
But that could happen any day, really.

180
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,320
I mean, it could happen tomorrow.

181
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,200
The world ends tomorrow.

182
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,360
You may die.

183
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,640
But X-Day, my friends, X-Day.

184
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,680
It's the big day.

185
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,280
Um, for all you Bobbies out there, and that is coming up July 5th.

186
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,140
What is going on?

187
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,440
This is bullshit, Bob!

188
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:53,460
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bop...

189
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,240
Bop!

190
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:56,960
Bop!

191
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,000
Bop!

192
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000


193
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000


194
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000


195
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000


196
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000


197
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000


198
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000


199
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000


200
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000


201
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,780
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

202
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,300
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

203
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,880
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

204
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,500
What is going on?

205
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,720
This is bullshit, Bob.

206
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:21,780
This adorable lullaby is another slow one for you lovers.

207
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,440
What the fuck am I supposed to be if I'm not supposed to be what I am?

208
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,600
What the fuck am I supposed to do if I'm not supposed to do what I do?

209
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,940
What the fuck am I supposed to say if I'm not supposed to say what I say?

210
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,000
What the fuck am I supposed to fuck if I'm not supposed to do what I say?

211
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,000


212
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,240
to fuck what I fuck

213
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,200
And the only booze on Sunday

214
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,020
is the blood of Christ

215
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,000
God damn the Christians

216
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,880
God damn the Christians

217
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,880
God damn the Christians

218
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,680
God damn the Christians

219
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,860
Thank you!

220
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,360
That is all!

221
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,220
That was Man Incorporated, dear friends

222
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,740
You can get a lot more of Man

223
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,720
at beerforman.com

224
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,020
That's beerforman.com

225
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,320
What you just heard was actually recorded live by us

226
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,800
at the Subgenius Devival in Cleveland

227
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,000
at the Beachland

228
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,980
Uh...

229
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,100
And before that

230
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,260
and also next

231
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,220
some Norrell Pref

232
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,000
of which you can get more

233
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,240
at heavyconfetti.com

234
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,460
And then we'll play some censored

235
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,440
Team America

236
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,020
from their soundtrack

237
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,080
Oh, yes

238
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,800
Motherfucking cocksucker

239
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,480
Motherfucking shit fucker

240
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,000
What am I doing?

241
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,140
What am I doing?

242
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,100
I don't know what I'm doing

243
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,440
You rock!

244
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:27,920
You rock!

245
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,240
You rock!

246
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,760
You floss or masturbate

247
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:29,880
You floss or masturbate

248
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,440
that could be the key to your entire reality

249
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,380
You see a lot of people in here

250
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,740
who claim they want to know the ultimate truth about reality

251
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,720
They want to peer under the surface of the big everything

252
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,140
But this can be a very painful process full of surprises

253
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,280
that can dismantle the world as you know it

254
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,820
That's why most people prefer to remain on the surface of things

255
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,460
Have you ever transcended space and time?

256
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,160
Beat it, you little pussy

257
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,640
pussy

258
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,040
pussy

259
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,420
pussy

260
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,020
Fuck it!

261
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,680
Nothing matters

262
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,700
How can I matter?

263
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,800
I don't know if nothing matters

264
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,400
Something that matters or something that matters.

265
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,340
I'm trying to figure that out and I want you to help me.

266
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,660
You use petroleum, you're a murderer. That's a fact.

267
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,900
Killing the ozone and all the creatures that it's hurting.

268
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,540
Killing Arabs and oil producing dictatorships.

269
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,580
Where everybody is poor.

270
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,660
That's cruelty.

271
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,840
Nothing's connected.

272
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,140
It doesn't matter what you do.

273
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,460
You can drive a car.

274
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,460
You can burn up gas.

275
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,680
Which would explain the way things actually are.

276
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,720
Where people do destructive things like it doesn't even matter.

277
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,720
This is the truth.

278
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:22,380
Okay?

279
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,260
Little girls like you, they have to work in dark factories.

280
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,540
Where they go blind for $1.60 a month.

281
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,620
Just to make money.

282
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:33,640
Is it possible for anybody in this world to work together to make it better?

283
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,340
I don't think so.

284
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,340
To see an image is always better.

285
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,500
You've got to reach people quick.

286
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:44,280
The situation was not created by nature like the drought or the olives or any of that.

287
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,700
It was created by people, and this is by facts.

288
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,500
It was created by people who act like nothing's happening.

289
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,620
And that's causing all the problems.

290
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,200
No, no, no.

291
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:53,660
Why?

292
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,380
Because people only ask themselves deep questions until something really bad happens.

293
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,440
How come people are self-destructive?

294
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,140
If the forms of this world die, which is more real?

295
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,960
The me that dies or the me that's in front?

296
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,160
Can I trust my habitual mind or do I need to learn to look beneath those things?

297
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,820
You say you're Christians living by Jesus' principles, but are you?

298
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,600
Yeah, of course we are.

299
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,480
Jesus is never mad at us if we live with him in our hearts.

300
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,080
I hate to break it to you, but he is.

301
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,460
He most definitely is.

302
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,080
If Hitler were alive, he'd tell you not to think about oil.

303
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,660
But how did Sudan happen, ma'am?

304
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,640
Could it possibly be related to dictatorships that we support for some stupid reason?

305
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,760
You shut up. You get out.

306
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,780
Shut up. You get out.

307
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,260
Looks like you saw some truth.

308
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,820
Looks like you saw some truth.

309
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,120
What'd you see?

310
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,720
Well, the interconnection thing is definitely for real.

311
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,240
It is! I didn't think it was!

312
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,200
I can't believe it. It's so fantastic!

313
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,600
I know.

314
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,360
But it's also nothing special.

315
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,100
Yeah, because it grows from the manure of human trouble.

316
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,920
You see, the detectives, they just wanted to gloss right over that.

317
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,320
But in fact, no manure, no magic.

318
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,660
Wake up, pretty girl!

319
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,960
The joke's on you!

320
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,000
The joke is on you!

321
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,140
Don't look at me like that!

322
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:58,960
Don't look at me like that!

323
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,640
Fuckabees!

324
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:00,580
Fuckabees!

325
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,500
Fred Lee.

326
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,200
She said fuckabees.

327
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,100
She said fuckabees.

328
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,140
She said fuckabees.

329
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:05,800
She said fuckabees.

330
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,700
I'm just gonna accept my loneliness, and I'm gonna go to an even darker place of nothingness.

331
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,680
From an even farther, more extreme nothingness on my own.

332
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,740
But what's so great about depression?

333
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:15,620
Nothing.

334
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,480
How am I not myself?

335
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,480
How am I not myself?

336
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,140
How am I not myself?

337
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,320
How am I not myself?

338
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,920
How am I not myself?

339
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,780
How am I not myself?

340
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,160
How am I not myself?

341
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,620
How am I not myself?

342
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,140
I SAID GET AWAY FROM ME!

343
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,340
I'm completely lost!

344
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,200
I've hit rock bottom.

345
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,580
Easy, easy, whoa, you gotta calm down there, Chuck.

346
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,080
I hurt people.

347
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,440
I'm a dick.

348
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,480
Oh, being a dick ain't so bad.

349
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,600
See, there's three kinds of people.

350
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,940
Dicks, pussies, and assholes.

351
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,700
Pussies think everyone can get along, and dicks just wanna fuck all the time without thinking it through.

352
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,180
But then you got your assholes, Chuck.

353
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,520
And all the assholes want us to shit all over everything.

354
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:10,560
So pussies may get mad at dicks once in a while, because pussies get fucked by dicks.

355
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,240
But dicks also fuck assholes, Chuck.

356
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,320
And if they didn't fuck the assholes, you know what you'd get?

357
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,120
You'd get your dick and your pussy all covered in shit!

358
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,400
Alright, that does it. Get out of here, you drunk lowlife!

359
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,860
You gave up on life, didn't you?

360
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,920
I'm not a dick.

361
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,020
I'm a dick.

362
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,940
I'm a dick.

363
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:38,820
I'm a dick.

364
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,500
I'm a dick.

365
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:40,900
I'm a dick.

366
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,180
I'm a dick.

367
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:41,380
I'm a dick.

368
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:41,740
I'm a dick.

369
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,580
I'm a dick.

370
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,940
I'm a dick.

371
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,620
I'm a dick.

372
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,260
I'm a dick.

373
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,420
I'm a dick.

374
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,280
I'm a dick.

375
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,360
I'm a dick.

376
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,060
I'm a dick.

377
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,080
I'm a dick.

378
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,940
I'm a dick.

379
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,240
Space, the final frontier.

380
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,980
Specimen gathering mission on planet Alpha 177.

381
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,480
Mr. Spock is much stronger than the ordinary human being.

382
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,680
Aroused, his great physical strength could kill.

383
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,000
But it's a risk I'll have to take.

384
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,540
Something bother you, Mr. Spock?

385
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,120
May I say that I have not thoroughly enjoyed serving with humans.

386
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,120
I find their illogic and foolish emotions a constant irritant.

387
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,160
Unlike you, we humans are full of unpredictable emotions.

388
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,280
Love. Tenderness.

389
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,640
Yes, yes.

390
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,180
If I seem insensitive to what you're going through, Captain,

391
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,100
understand, it's the way I am.

392
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,900
Don't be afraid.

393
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,280
Here's my hand.

394
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,180
Hold on.

395
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,980
You are beautiful.

396
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,000
More beautiful than any dream of beauty I've ever known.

397
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,060
What is your point, Mr. Spock?

398
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,760
I love you.

399
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,340
I can love you.

400
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,760
Kiss me.

401
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,180
You're out of your mind.

402
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,240
The prospect appeared quite attractive to you a moment ago.

403
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,920
You don't really want to hurt me, do you?

404
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,020
Put that thing away.

405
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,600
No, I don't think so.

406
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:53,880
No!

407
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,820
I can't.

408
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,380
It's painless and quick.

409
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:58,900
Aaaaaah!

410
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,080
Entry made by Second Officer Spock.

411
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:02,960
Aaaaaah!

412
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,840
Possible we may have hit the wrong entry point.

413
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,260
Yes.

414
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,780
Very well, Captain.

415
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,420
Try again.

416
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,700
If it pleases you.

417
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,760
What are you waiting for?

418
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,040
Hurry!

419
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,000
If you'll excuse the intrusion, Captain.

420
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:14,860
Aaaaaah!

421
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,000
Bury the hatchet.

422
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,400
An appropriate choice of terms, Captain.

423
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,180
Aaaaaah!

424
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,240
Shhh!

425
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:20,520
I'm not going to let you get away with this.

426
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:20,520


427
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:20,520


428
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:20,520


429
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,740
Keep your fuckin' hands off.

430
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,880
Just keep away, you green-blooded half-breed!

431
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,860
Scotty, no!

432
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,460
Wait!

433
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,440
Are you all right, Captain?

434
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,260
It's all right.

435
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,160
I'm just a little busy.

436
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,760
I have to take him back.

437
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,340
I can't survive without him.

438
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,440
I don't want to take him back.

439
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,480
He's like an animal.

440
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,660
A thoughtless, brutal animal.

441
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,880
Here, let me give you a hand.

442
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,000
This thing can go anywhere!

443
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,520
You've not yet explained the nature of this thing.

444
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,180
She's a projectile at one-nine.

445
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:49,920
Get below.

446
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,500
I'm going to get you.

447
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:50,500


448
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:50,500


449
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:50,500


450
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:50,500


451
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:50,500


452
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:50,500


453
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:50,880
Take command.

454
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,540
Ice out.

455
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,100
Your beauty!

456
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,400
I won't fight you anymore.

457
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,740
I feel so weak.

458
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,720
I'll be glad when this is over.

459
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,400
This is impossible.

460
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,400
I'm a Vulcan.

461
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,600
What can you expect from a simpering devil-eared freak?

462
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,100
His father was a computer and his mother an encyclopedia.

463
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,480
You can't beat the game.

464
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:20,480


465
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:20,480


466
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:20,480


467
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:20,480


468
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:20,480


469
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:20,480


470
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:20,480


471
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:20,480


472
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:20,480


473
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:20,480


474
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:20,480


475
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:20,480


476
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:20,480


477
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:20,480


478
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:20,480


479
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,940
I'm behaving disgracefully.

480
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,820
I had eaten animal flesh and I've enjoyed it.

481
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,100
Believe me, Mr. Spock.

482
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,640
It was painful in more ways than one.

483
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,640
I thought...

484
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,540
Captain's log, supplement.

485
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,220
I've seen a part of myself no man should ever see.

486
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,020
I don't know why I have not been infected.

487
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,360
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

488
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,900
From both of us.

489
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,480
From both of us.

490
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,320
Everybody's fucking.

491
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,100
So many people fucking.

492
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,020
I bet they're glad that I'm not.

493
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,820
But I'm not.

494
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,540
Glad that I'm not.

495
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,300
Fucking.

496
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,520
Everybody's fucking.

497
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,320
So many people fucking.

498
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,300
I bet they're glad that I'm not.

499
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,100
But I'm not.

500
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,820
Glad that I'm not.

501
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,760
Fucking.

502
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,140
Oh, shit.

503
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,160
Little Theodore and Babushka.

504
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,920
At 7X Day, friends at Brushwood.

505
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,220
Recorded last X Day.

506
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,060
We've got 8X Day coming up.

507
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:11,420
You can contact Little Theodore at

508
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,140
littletheodoreatyahoo.com

509
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:20,120
That name is spelled F-Y-O-D.

510
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,140
B-O-R.

511
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,700
Little Theodore at yahoo.com.

512
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,260
And now, Nowrel.

513
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,120
The past is a foreign country.

514
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,340
They do things differently there.

515
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,680
The past is a foreign country.

516
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,880
They do things differently there.

517
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,240
The past is a foreign country.

518
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,420
They do things differently there.

519
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,400
Go to your pleasure of the bad fountain of life, honey.

520
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:55,560
Go to your pleasure of the bad fountain of life, honey, bad flower.

521
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,640
The giving and the receiving of bad pleasure.

522
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:00,920
Ecstasy.

523
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,500
Ecstasy.

524
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,700
Bad pleasure.

525
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,640
Ecstasy.

526
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,440
A longing for money, fame, and influence.

527
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,400
Love.

528
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,380
Theory.

529
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,560
And even harder to maintain.

530
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,320
The story of our quest for sexual love.

531
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,660
And we may fail.

532
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,920
Call me at the rear of...

533
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,700
Are you so sure?

534
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,940
Call me at the rear of...

535
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,400
But how about up and down?

536
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,200
Call me at the rear of...

537
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,840
Not exactly.

538
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,420
Alice was beginning to get very, very sleepy and stupid.

539
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,820
Curiouser and curiouser.

540
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,200
Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking.

541
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,160
Digging everything.

542
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,620
Because the only people for me are the mad ones.

543
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,740
Desirous of everything at the same time.

544
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,580
Come on, man.

545
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,580
Those girls won't wait. Make it fast.

546
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,340
Flunky.

547
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,020
Nauseating.

548
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,900
Ascent and smoke and sweat, greed and fear.

549
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,080
Fear and nervous tension.

550
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,800
James Bond suddenly knew that he was...

551
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,060
Flunky.

552
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,780
Ironical, brutal, and cold.

553
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,100
Flunky.

554
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,780
Bond was not amused.

555
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,940
The prospect of working with her stimulated him.

556
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,180
At the same time, he felt a disquiet.

557
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,640
On an impulse, he touched wood.

558
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,220
Good news.

559
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,740

00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,720

Flunky.

569
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,100
Flunky.

570
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,780
It can be hard to figure out what has meaning and what doesn't.

571
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,480
Say, will you be washed in Jesus' cup?

572
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,360
Will you be ready?

573
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:54,280

We're going to

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:10,640


680
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,160
So, it begins.

681
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,940

682
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,000

685
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,160
Pissing on America, fucking up the music.

686
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,260
Get it done.

687
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,620

00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,880
Get it done.

689
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,360
Get it done.

690
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,620
Look at this shit music.

691
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,040
Those goddamn nigga-loving hippies, they even fucked up the music.

692
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,540
Get it done.

693
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,180

00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,060

00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:45,360
Get it done.

704
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,360
Get it done.

705
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:24,520
I mean, what is that like in extra meditation, you know, when you're in a trance and there's peach pits pushing their way slowly out your asshole?

706
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,800
It's really not that much of a problem.

707
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,880
Sometimes, if you're not really...

708
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,880
It seems like they give you real weird visions.

709
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,400
If you're not maintaining a high dissipation level, well then...

710
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:36,700
What?

711
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,020
Dissipation level.

712
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,980
That's where you dissipate all thoughts, doing extra meditation.

713
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,940
If you're not maintaining that high level, well then they'll come out just ripping your asshole open.

714
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,720
Otherwise, they're just no problem at all.

715
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:04,520
Well, how exactly do you mount that special head like it says in that little book?

716
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,380
Mount the head?

717
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,100
Uh-huh.

718
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,380
It says that in that little book.

719
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,960
You just put a nail in the wall and hang it up?

720
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,020
Yeah.

721
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,220
You know, it's no problem.

722
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,300
I thought it...

723
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,200
Or you can get you a picture hanger, something like that.

724
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:27,000
I thought it meant I was supposed to jack off every time I went to the bathroom.

725
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,020
Well, that too.

726
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,160
Jack off and also...

727
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,600
No, I didn't mean that.

728
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,820
Oh, okay.

729
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:40,080
Your unworthy servant has the power to confront this cruel demon.

730
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:41,680
Ah!

731
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,400
Ah!

732
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,640
Hi, anything I can do for you?

733
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,940
I want my pills.

734
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,320
Know anything about pills?

735
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,260
Yes.

736
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,500
Pills, please.

737
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,720
Pills?

738
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,400
My pills.

739
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:55,580
Pills?

740
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,300
My pills.

741
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,780
My what?

742
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,280
Pills.

743
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,160
Oh, uh, my pills.

744
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,300
I come looking for my pills.

745
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,060
Bad, bad pills.

746
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,860
Here you are.

747
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:07,840
Thank you.

748
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,940
For the truth is that Team America fights for the billion dollar corporation.

749
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:12,960


750
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:12,960


751
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,400
They are just as bad.

752
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,600
Enemies they fight.

753
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,720
Oh, no, we aren't.

754
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,120
We're dicks.

755
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,420
We're reckless, arrogant, stupid dicks.

756
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:38,340
And the Film Actors Guild are pussies.

757
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,960
And Kim Jong-il...

758
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,940
What?

759
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,620
Is an asshole.

760
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,840
Pussies don't like dicks.

761
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,440
Because pussies get fucked by dicks.

762
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:54,520
But dicks also fuck assholes.

763
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,940
Assholes who just want to shit on everything.

764
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:02,120
Pussies may think they can deal with assholes their way.

765
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:07,600
But the only thing that can fuck an asshole is a dick with some balls.

766
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,800
The problem with dicks...

767
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:12,940
Is that they're not just a dick.

768
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:12,940


769
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,000
Is that sometimes they fuck too much.

770
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,860
Or fuck when it isn't appropriate.

771
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,740
Yes, Gary.

772
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:19,540
Yes.

773
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,240
And it takes a pussy to show them that.

774
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,980
But sometimes pussies get so full of shit that they become assholes themselves.

775
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,200
Because pussies are only an inch and a half away from assholes.

776
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:37,020
I don't know much in this crazy, crazy world.

777
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,140
But I do know...

778
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,940
That if you don't let us fuck this asshole...

779
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:46,760
We are gonna have our dicks and our pussies...

780
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,120
All covered in shit.

781
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,540
Lisa, I'm crazy about you.

782
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,900
Will you please forgive me if I can...

783
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:10,980
Shh.

784
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,040
You had me at dicks fuck assholes.

785
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:14,740
Attention.

786
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,720
Attention, everyone.

787
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,600
All you in the audience should go to your homes now.

788
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,080
Your countries need you.

789
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:26,100
But the world will be safe thanks to a brilliant actor named Gary Johnston.

790
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,780
Let me explain to you the kind of man Gary is.

791
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,720
He's a man who knows that when you put another man's cock in your mouth, you make a pact.

792
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:40,960
And that is the kind of man that Gary is.

793
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:40,960


794
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:40,960


795
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:40,960


796
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:40,960


797
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:40,960


798
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:40,960


799
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:40,960


800
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,060
A bond that cannot be broken

801
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,000
He's a man so dedicated

802
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,800
That he will get down on his knees

803
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,320
And put that cock right in his mouth

804
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,460
Well then let's go show the bad guys

805
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,040
The police are back in force

806
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:56,860
Fuck yeah

807
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,480
Fuck yeah

808
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:01,880
America

809
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,360
America

810
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,220
America

811
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,780
Fuck yeah

812
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,680
Freedom is in free

813
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,260
No there's a hefty fucking thing

814
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:22,140
And if you don't throw in your buckle five

815
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,700
Who will

816
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,540
Who will buckle fast

817
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,320
Freedom costs a buckle fast

818
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,200
Only a woman

819
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,380
Can brighten up my day

820
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,080
Only a woman

821
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,220
Can touch me the right way

822
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,940
Only a woman

823
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:52,940
Is allowed to touch me then

824
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,480
All I ask is that you're a woman

825
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,520
You gotta watch out замет my Steel

826
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,080
Iuv Jim

827
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:17,700
You should knock my Man

828
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,540
You got it

829
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,360
tremble

830
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:24,360


831
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,300
you

832
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:30,780
It's broke

833
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,240
It's hurt

834
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,800
But it's enough

835
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,780
for a thot

836
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:37,460
Right

837
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,360
Come right here

838
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,240
just do it

839
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,260
causes some shit

840
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:39,360
Бância

841
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:51,620
Due to a congenital birth defect which caused me to be born with double anus vaginas,

842
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,260
I am a charter member of the Double Vaginal Double Anal Society.

843
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,660
I want to join.

844
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:00,720
There's a $14.95 registration fee.

845
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:04,680
It goes entirely toward funding the gentle stroking of my anus.

846
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,740
A message from Reverend Error.

847
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:14,040
And before that, the toilet song by Reverend Ed Fred.

848
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,280
And Team America before that.

849
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,400
And now, Norell.

850
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,140
Thank you all for coming.

851
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,700
Thank you all for coming.

852
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,260
Thank you all for coming.

853
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:31,100
I even take the position that sexual orgies eliminate social tensions and ought to be encouraged.

854
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,040
I've had this before.

855
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,980
Let's do a quick reality check.

856
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:34,580
Let's make love.

857
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,400
Great to be with you.

858
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,260
My opponent uses rumor and innuendo.

859
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,820
I use rumor and innuendo.

860
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,340
And of course.

861
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,100
Some very personal items.

862
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,960
When it goes through your fingers, you get to...

863
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,060
It's sticky.

864
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:44,840
It sticks to the fingers.

865
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,180
A plague descended upon the world.

866
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,860
It depends on what your definition of the word is is.

867
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,180
It really depends on your definition of the word.

868
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,840
Cruising toward an iceberg.

869
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,000
That's a very interesting point.

870
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,200
That will take.

871
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,460
The president believes it too.

872
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,560
Voodoo economics.

873
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,700
Heavily, heavily monitored by the government.

874
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:01,760
Thank you all for coming.

875
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,320
Thank you all for coming.

876
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,880
Thank you all for coming.

877
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,440
Thank you all for coming.

878
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,580
Don't go away.

879
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,300
How much would you cough up?

880
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,340
On Marilyn Monroe.

881
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,160
In 2001.

882
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,040
Cock 2042 BC.

883
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,360
But what is indisputably true, it seems to me, is that...

884
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,500
I gotta go back and have First Lady Laura Bush.

885
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,380
And I can't wait.

886
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,220
And I can't wait.

887
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:20,760
Cock Bush.

888
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,260
Cock Bush.

889
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:21,720
Bush.

890
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:22,440
Cock.

891
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,160
Great to be with you.

892
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:23,820
Cock 2018.

893
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,300
Great to be with you, Keith.

894
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,800
Closing social security.

895
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,020
Thank you all for coming.

896
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,580
Thank you all for coming.

897
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,520
Again, great thanks for coming in.

898
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,020
Thank you, Keith.

899
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:32,800
Great talk.

900
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,300
Today our topic is cock.

901
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,960
And why a person would want to sell cock.

902
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,580
Cock is probably...

903
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,600
Cock is making some changes.

904
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,140
Strong.

905
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:43,980
Passion.

906
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,820
So, I will stress, it's going to break down.

907
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,560
It's not going to work when you need it to.

908
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,020
We can't underestimate cock's strength.

909
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,180
I like cock.

910
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,340
From PR News in Washington, I'm doing a poor job of human trafficking.

911
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,160
Meanwhile, ask us.

912
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,080
Ask us.

913
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:03,240
In stocks to 1046161.

914
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,280
PR's bad.

915
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,140
PR's guess.

916
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:05,440
Ask.

917
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,080
Some analysts say...

918
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:13,740
The State Department has added more cunts to its list of governments that it says are

919
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,640
combating PR News in Washington.

920
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:19,780
You're still too far back.

921
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,820
What is...

922
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:22,440
Are you afraid?

923
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,500
That's sad.

924
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,260
Blow things up!

925
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,600
Kick out the jams, motherfucker!

926
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,360
Two more days!

927
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:39,700
I'm in!

928
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,620
Turn on!

929
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,180
Jack off!

930
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,960
Masturbate constantly!

931
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:50,560
If you don't touch yourself, Bob sure as fuck won't!

932
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,840
Why not live orgasmically?

933
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,120
Fuck all the time!

934
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,300
Why are there girls here that are not kissing guys?

935
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:06,480
I want to rock and roll all night!

936
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,100
And fight the cops!

937
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,660
And run every day!

938
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,020
Turn on your friends!

939
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,540
Turn off the TV!

940
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:22,900
The cop wants you to know more about the cast of Friends than you do about your own fucking

941
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:23,760
neighbors!

942
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,720
What the fuck!

943
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,260
Fuck crime thinking.

944
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,180
Try just plain thinking for once.

945
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,660
Steal a book and read it.

946
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,120
Take a piss in public.

947
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,200
Take a walk.

948
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,080
Write a song.

949
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,040
Make a baby.

950
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,060
Ride a skateboard.

951
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:40,940
Rip a heart.

952
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:41,920
Kiss your lover.

953
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,160
Laugh about it.

954
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:44,220
Daydream!

955
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,280
Just don't give in!

956
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,220
Don't fucking give in!

957
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,720
It is not an alternative.

958
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,000
Don't give in.

959
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,220
Death is mediocrity and mediocrity is fucking boring.

960
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:06,900
Oh, oh, but Wally, why should you tell us what to do?

961
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,960
Who are you to say how we should live?

962
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:09,020
Oh, oh, but Wally, why should you tell us what to do?

963
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:09,020


964
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:09,020


965
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:09,720
Wally, why should you tell us what to do?

966
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:09,720


967
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:09,720


968
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:09,720


969
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:09,720


970
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:09,720


971
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:09,720


972
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,400
Now you're fucking thinking!

973
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,340
Do it every day!

974
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:17,040
Apply it to your everyday life!

975
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,880
Must see TV!

976
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,900
The real world will seem way more fucking evil that way.

977
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,340
Do it.

978
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,500
So yeah, fuck me!

979
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,400
Doubt me!

980
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,380
Question me!

981
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,580
Fuck me!

982
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,660
I'm an asshole!

983
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,180
I don't know what I'm talking about.

984
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:32,840
Think!

985
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:33,960
Fuck me!

986
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,040
Fuck me!

987
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,600
Fuck me, please!

988
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:37,740
Ladies?

989
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:38,520
No!

990
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,000
No!

991
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:39,000


992
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:39,000


993
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:44,060
But most of all, fuck Bob Dobbs.

994
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,020
Fuck him.

995
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,780
Fuck the pipe out of his mouth.

996
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:52,280
Grab that gritting face by the ears and shove it in your crotch.

997
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,960
Fuck Bob Dobbs.

998
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:54,820
Fuck him!

999
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,380
Or kill me!

1000
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:03,680
Who the hell is this guy?

1001
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,040
A Pope Wally, dear friends.

1002
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,740
Pope Wally.

1003
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:09,000
A Pope Wally.

1004
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,000


1005
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,000


1006
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,000


1007
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,000


1008
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,000


1009
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,000


1010
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,000


1011
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,000


1012
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,940
At the 2005 Detroit Revival.

1013
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,700
I hope to see Pope Wally at 8X Day.

1014
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:22,300
But now, Onan Canobite, Uncle Dr. Onan Canobite, on the road.

1015
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:28,400
Earth is the fourth planet from the sun.

1016
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,020
This planet is Mars.

1017
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:38,320
And it has been since 1953.

1018
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:38,980
And it has been since 1953.

1019
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:38,980


1020
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:38,980


1021
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:39,620
Well, maybe 1957.

1022
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,620
Or maybe 1953.

1023
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:55,680
It was during that time that the former Earth, which was the third planet from the sun, switched

1024
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,020
places with the fourth planet from the sun, which had been Mars.

1025
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,700
This planet is Mars.

1026
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,620
That planet is Earth.

1027
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:07,860
And that planet, the fourth planet from the sun, is the planet the X's landed on.

1028
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:08,960
The fourth planet is Earth.

1029
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:08,960


1030
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:16,660
It sounds outlandish. What evidence do you have for that, Uncle Ronan?

1031
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:20,820
Some of you are faxing that in even now.

1032
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,220
Well, I'll tell you.

1033
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:30,020
Have you ever felt a little alienated?

1034
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,520
Well, how can you be an alien on your home planet?

1035
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,840
The fact that you don't fit in proves that this is Mars.

1036
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:50,120
The fact that all those science fiction movies you grew up with don't agree about what the aliens are like proves this is Mars.

1037
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,920
Some of them, and the way that you feel about them, supplements that proof.

1038
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:59,540
Some of the movies show Mars as a planet of destruction.

1039
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,220
A planet of war, one might say.

1040
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,500
And they come...

1041
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,640
Some of them come to destroy this planet.

1042
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,540
Others show them as saviors.

1043
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,240
How could those both be?

1044
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:11,760
They contradict.

1045
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:17,860
But in fact, if you make this planet Mars and that planet Earth, they all agree.

1046
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,720
They fall into place like a zipper.

1047
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:30,500
The zipper you pull down as you expose yourself to dobs and join the church of the subgenius.

1048
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:34,500
The church of the subgenius is like...

1049
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,020
Having a pet you can fuck.

1050
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:37,960
The church of the subgenius is like...

1051
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:37,960


1052
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:37,960


1053
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:37,960


1054
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,520
Bob would never touch a bible.

1055
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:46,160
He would burn his hand and he needs that to run the adding machine, jack off the rubes,

1056
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:50,600
pull cards from the bottom of the deck when dealing with other dimensional demons, diddle

1057
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:55,960
the giggly girls, yank people's chains, pull stang's string again, and hand out the slack.

1058
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,960
This ongoing polemic is a panoply of puckers.

1059
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,760
However, I still enjoy it.

1060
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,320
Here, have another canapé and a glass of nectar.

1061
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,900
You have real promise.

1062
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:08,320
Why, add a little astroglide and you could become an actual doctor.

1063
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:15,280
Princess Wee and I were talking about the Jewish tradition of the Sabbath.

1064
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,600
You know, starting Friday afternoon.

1065
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:26,400
Those guys, if they're orthodox, they can't even lift a finger to get more slack almost.

1066
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,120
They have to pay a non-Jew to do it for them.

1067
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,840
And it's for...

1068
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,160
And they're real serious about it.

1069
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:39,980
And for an entire day there, up until Saturday night, it's enforced slack.

1070
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:41,840
You can't work.

1071
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:48,160
In fact, if you picked up a stick and threw it in the fire, you could be stoned to death

1072
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:53,480
according to the true righteous law of Jehovah One, which so many have forgotten.

1073
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,320
But we're not here to preach a fundamentalist Judaism.

1074
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:01,200
But their Sabbath idea was great.

1075
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,560
But it's limited.

1076
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,640
Why must we...

1077
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,700
Can't we learn from their mistakes?

1078
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:09,560
They did it for one day a week.

1079
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,800
Why can't we do it seven days a week?

1080
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,600
The endless Sabbath.

1081
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,540
Like getting off...

1082
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:17,520
Well, I'll tell you why.

1083
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:21,800
Because the conspiracy will take your house away and throw you in debtor's prison.

1084
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,900
And it's just not fair.

1085
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,960
So that's why we have to pray and wait for aliens, I guess.

1086
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:28,900
God damn it.

1087
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,660
I don't know where that was from, friends.

1088
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:36,500
Maybe Detroit.

1089
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,240
But before that, Help-O-Q-E.

1090
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:45,100
And now, and 80s, it's a genius classic by Doctors for Bob.

1091
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:48,880
And this one's like 14 minutes long, friends.

1092
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:49,900
But bear with it.

1093
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:53,660
Doctors for Bob, recorded in Little Rock, Arkansas in the 80s.

1094
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,420
And this one's called...

1095
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:57,480
Huh!

1096
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,820
The Pretty Song.

1097
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:17,640
Yeah.

1098
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,120
Yeah.

1099
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,100
That's right.

1100
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:21,800
Play it.

1101
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,320
Play it just right, because I got a tale to tell.

1102
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,600
This is a story about...

1103
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:29,800
What?

1104
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:29,800


1105
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:29,800


1106
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:29,800


1107
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:29,800


1108
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:29,800


1109
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:29,800


1110
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:29,800


1111
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:29,800


1112
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:29,800


1113
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:29,800


1114
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:29,800


1115
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:29,800


1116
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:29,800


1117
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,080
Huh!

1118
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:31,860
Huh!

1119
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:36,800
Being the primal sound of that which has been called the squirting universe.

1120
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:44,020
Oh, there's people who'll try to deny it.

1121
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:50,180
There's people who'll try to tell you the primal sound of the universe is oh, or amen,

1122
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,540
or some kind of crap like that.

1123
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,940
But these are all life is a bowl of cherries.

1124
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:01,220
Sweetness and light, love burgers.

1125
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,980
They know not the glories of the squirting universe.

1126
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:14,580
For the primal sound of the boring, laid-back meditation universe might indeed be old.

1127
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:20,640
But the primal sound of the bobble-thumping, black-eyed peen.

1128
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,840
Back to the old stuff.

1129
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,220
Squirting universe is huh!

1130
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:33,600
For they know not the glories of that which has been called the squirting universe.

1131
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:41,560
For you must ask yourself, my friends, are you still living in the testicles?

1132
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:45,820
Or have you crossed over that mighty river Jordan?

1133
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:49,500
Are you squirting out the head yet?

1134
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:50,000
Huh!

1135
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:57,200
For the purpose of life is not happiness, peace, or happiness.

1136
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,160
Or even truth.

1137
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:04,060
But the purpose of the universe is to squirt.

1138
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,560
For 50% of the universe that is.

1139
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:13,160
For slightly over 50%, the purpose of the universe is to ooze.

1140
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,360
But the story of huh!

1141
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:20,880
Is an all-encompassing tale.

1142
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,420
Which tells of the,

1143
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,180
the utter tragedy of the universe.

1144
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:30,120
The transformation of the universe in the final days.

1145
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,360
As was written in,

1146
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:33,440
Huh!

1147
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,700
Ecclesians 5, 17.

1148
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:45,560
For in the end times there shall be the one world religion predicted in the Bible.

1149
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:49,020
And that shall be called the church of the subgenius.

1150
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,060
And there shall be a band.

1151
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,260
A band which shall,

1152
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,240
which will,

1153
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,040
was,

1154
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:59,580
and shall be known as the Doctors for Bob.

1155
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:00,300
And lo!

1156
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:01,100
Huh!

1157
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:06,200
Doctors for Bob was the very hand, the very tool of God.

1158
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,140
So to speak.

1159
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,800
And that which was called the squirt universe.

1160
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:11,500
Huh!

1161
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:17,700
For the true purpose of Doctors for Bob.

1162
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:21,800
Which could finally be revealed at last.

1163
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:26,020
Is to squirt.

1164
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:26,220
To speak.

1165
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,980
Every word.

1166
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,180
To sing every song.

1167
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,640
To make every sound.

1168
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,340
Every noise.

1169
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,940
Melodic or un-melodic.

1170
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:42,220
Possible in all infinite variations of the universe.

1171
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:51,300
We're not bound by any laws of quality or good.

1172
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:53,020
Our songs don't have to be good.

1173
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,000
Because it is our duty.

1174
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,320
To write every song that is left.

1175
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:02,140
To utter every syllable.

1176
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:06,400
So that every name of God shall be uttered.

1177
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,720
So that the universe might end.

1178
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:15,480
Yes friends we are here to see that the universe ends for the proper reasons.

1179
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,360
For in 1998.

1180
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,980
Slightly before the arrival of the universe.

1181
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:25,860
The arrival of the exes.

1182
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,200
Our mission will have been fulfilled.

1183
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:33,880
We shall be.

1184
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,860
We shall have uttered.

1185
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,820
Every syllable.

1186
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,860
Spoken every possible name of God.

1187
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,220
Or Jehovah One.

1188
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,800
Or Ram.

1189
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:44,480
Or Allah.

1190
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:47,660
Whichever name of God you call him.

1191
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,960
It shall be at Doc Stock 17.

1192
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:54,960
The Doc Stock 17.

1193
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,480
The Doctors for Bob.

1194
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:55,960
Shall be.

1195
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:57,340
Performing.

1196
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,200
What people little suspect.

1197
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,800
Is their last performance.

1198
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:07,440
And at the exact precise correct moment.

1199
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,600
Snavely echoing.

1200
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:13,760
The mighty, mighty saxophone player for Doctors for Bob.

1201
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,220
Shall hit a wrong note.

1202
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:16,080
Which low.

1203
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:16,700
Who, who, who.

1204
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,640
Lo and behold shall be.

1205
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:22,040
In fact in actuality the right note.

1206
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,940
And as he hits that note.

1207
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:31,680
wrong note it will be a note so wrong that the entire universe shall start to

1208
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:42,520
crumble all energy of all universes of all dimensions of all time frames of all

1209
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:48,320
realities shall be channeled through the chief amplifiers of Dr. Survive yes the

1210
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:53,120
universe shall be destroyed by amplification equipment bought on credit

1211
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:56,840
at Boyd's Music Center yay lo and behold

1212
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:08,320
and as all energy of all known universes begins to be channeled through their

1213
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:18,180
amplifiers a new and heretofore unknown force shall be created a force which shall be known as anti-sound

1214
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:22,560
and you thought anti-music was sound

1215
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,100
you thought anti-music was sound

1216
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:50,260
The cause of the world's statewide

1217
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:53,080


1218
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:53,080


1219
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:59,660
sound is so that you'll have some type of reference point. But anti-sound has nothing

1220
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:09,220
to do with sound. These waves, these rays, these forces of anti-sound shall vibrate,

1221
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:16,680
or anti-vibrate, I might say, through the entire universe. And the entire universe will

1222
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:22,720
lose its form. It shall be destroyed. Every molecule shall be demagnetized from every

1223
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:29,320
other molecule. Every electron demagnetized from every other electron. Every proton demagnetized

1224
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:35,980
from every other proton. Every atom shall be repelled from every other atom. The universe

1225
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:48,100
shall lose its form as we know it today. Born to lose, and now I'm losing universal form.

1226
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,900
Hypercletes shall quip.

1227
00:58:53,160 --> 00:59:02,480
Breaking off one last one-liner before the universe loses its form. But lo and behold,

1228
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:10,420
nothing is ever destroyed, for the universe is eternal. Thus, matter cannot be created

1229
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:21,940
or destroyed. It is only and merely transformed. And it shall be low transformed in the following

1230
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:22,400
manner.

1231
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:36,680
As all matter in the universe shall be magnetized to one particular point in the universe.

1232
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:52,700
And all matter in the universe shall come together to form one gigantic universe. And

1233
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:56,700
all of the здесь平elier things

1234
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,960
and legislations ...

1235
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:01,340
Melan gradient, and the이라는

1236
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:01,340


1237
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:04,800
Will appear according to the laws of the universe in duvant baseline by means of two quadrangle

1238
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:05,940
funz nouveats universe.

1239
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:12,580
Preσιum ...

1240
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:27,480
at the other diametrically opposite end of the universe.

1241
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:33,780
And then, specially trained heliopters

1242
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:38,320
shall transport the giant white penis

1243
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:42,680
ever closer and closer to the giant black vagina.

1244
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:47,540
And in a billion million eons,

1245
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:54,300
depending on how hard to get the giant black vagina plays it,

1246
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:58,920
the universe shall achieve penetration.

1247
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:05,320
It shall be the ultimate meeting of the yin-yang.

1248
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:08,780
It shall be a meeting of all offices of the universe.

1249
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:11,460
Quiet shall meet black.

1250
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,060
Matter shall meet energy.

1251
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:14,680
Male shall meet female.

1252
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:22,160
And it will all transpire into the giant fuck.

1253
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:29,600
The giant fuck of which every stroke will take ten billion eons.

1254
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,680
And we shall all be there, friends.

1255
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:36,500
We shall all participate in the glorious, the mighty giant fuck.

1256
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,160
Praise Bob.

1257
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:44,960
Hell, I'm not going to participate if Smith's in on it, Jones.

1258
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:46,720
Quips.

1259
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:48,320
I ain't no queer.

1260
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:50,960
Forget Jones and Smith.

1261
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:54,760
Every stroke shall take ten billion eons.

1262
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,420
This will be the ultimate pleasure.

1263
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:59,440
For ten billion eons,

1264
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:02,200
we will totally, with complete consciousness,

1265
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,100
feel the power,

1266
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:08,480
blow the mighty power of the giant fuck.

1267
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:12,620
Deeper and deeper shall penetrate.

1268
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,160
Harder and longer the giant white dick will become.

1269
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:22,420
Wetter and hotter the giant black vagina will become.

1270
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:25,540
Wider and wider it will open.

1271
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,440
Tighter and tighter it shall squeeze.

1272
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:29,800
In and out, in and out.

1273
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:36,180
For ten billion times longer than this universe has even existed,

1274
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:39,360
shall the giant squirt go on.

1275
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,140
The giant fuck shall go on.

1276
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:41,680
Excuse me.

1277
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:46,520
And then,

1278
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:46,800
And then,

1279
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:52,100
At the end of this longest time period which has ever been,

1280
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:53,740
there shall occur,

1281
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:56,580
the squirt.

1282
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:58,640
The giant squirt.

1283
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:00,340
I'm not just talking about any squirt.

1284
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,760
I'm talking about the squirt you dreamed about.

1285
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,500
I'm talking about the squirt you always wanted to have,

1286
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:08,140
but were too inhibited to have.

1287
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,660
This will be the no holes barn.

1288
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:16,420
This will be the no holes barn.

1289
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:21,520
The three billion naked girls at once squirt.

1290
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,940
Or the three billion naked men at once squirt if you're female.

1291
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,180
Or the ooze.

1292
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:28,320
The ooze if you're female.

1293
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:31,680
And lo and behold,

1294
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,260
and hoo, the hoo sound,

1295
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:39,860
shall reign across the universe.

1296
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:44,880
But this is not the end for the giant squirt.

1297
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:49,700
The giant squirt shall impregnate the giant vagina and uterus.

1298
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:54,980
And shall give birth, lo, and behold,

1299
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:56,900
to a new universe.

1300
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,620
A perfect universe, friends.

1301
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:01,580
A universe of peace, harmony, and slack.

1302
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:08,060
In which transcendental love shall reign over all.

1303
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:12,360
And you will be able to get a seat on the subway.

1304
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:15,460
And minimum wage will be enough

1305
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:20,920
so that every man, woman, and child will be able to live as millionaires.

1306
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,400
And you won't,

1307
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:26,960
kids won't throw chewing gum on the sidewalk

1308
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,620
to where you can step on it

1309
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:31,420
and get it on the bottom of your shoe.

1310
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,460
And this is the prophecy, friends.

1311
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:38,560
The prophecy.

1312
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,340
The final prophecy.

1313
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:44,100
As hinted about

1314
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,440
and told the judge.

1315
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:50,900
But here described in its more true fashion.

1316
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,540
The slack universe.

1317
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,940
If you'd like to see this happen,

1318
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:00,660
if you'd like to see peace and harmony reign forever,

1319
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,160
all you need to do,

1320
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:04,300
get your money into Doctors for Bob

1321
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:05,780
or the Church of the Sub-Genius.

1322
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:07,160
Come to Doctors for Bob concerts,

1323
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,860
buy Doctors for Bob records, tapes,

1324
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:10,100
t-shirts, buttons,

1325
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:11,340
paraphernalia.

1326
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:13,100
You will be saved.

1327
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:15,620
The universe shall live in perfect slack,

1328
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:16,520
perfect harmony.

1329
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,560
This is the plan.

1330
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:21,540
This is the mighty master plan.

1331
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:24,880
Predicted by the prophets for billions of years.

1332
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:28,540
It approaches, friends, it approaches in 1998.

1333
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:29,980
Help me, somebody.

1334
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,980
Help us see this vision through.

1335
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:32,580
Hoo!

1336
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,040
Hoo!

1337
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:38,560
Hoo!

1338
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:40,000
Hoo!

1339
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:40,080
Hoo!

1340
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:40,080


1341
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,820
I can hear it coming.

1342
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:42,360
Hoo!

1343
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:44,120
Hoo!

1344
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:45,880
Hoo!

1345
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:47,460
Hoo!

1346
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:48,420
Hoo!

1347
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:48,760
Hoo!

1348
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:48,760


1349
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:49,440
Hoo!

1350
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:13,920
Hoo!

1351
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:20,780
I can hear what it means,

1352
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:20,800


1353
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:21,360
I can hear what it means,

1354
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:31,700
O-o-o-o-o...

1355
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,040
I can hear what it means...

1356
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,060
You must正 due XX times.

1357
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:43,620
Doctors for Bob, friends, Little Rock, Arkansas in the 80s,

1358
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:49,220

Thank you.
