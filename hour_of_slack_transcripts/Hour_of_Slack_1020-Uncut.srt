1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
Sire, there is no more money.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,820
We gotta get some money.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,060
That dirty purgish harker, that black wharton.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,320
You people think we just improvise this stuff.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,960
From the keyboard and stuff.

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,040
But no, we have to rehearse this stuff all week long.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:23,880
And we have to ride this bicycle treadmill that runs the electric generators that make the power spew out over the airwaves.

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,940
Out into the invisible air where your ears pick up the rare material.

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,600
And strange music that this station plays.

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,940
Such as the hour of slack.

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,880
Stuck in an availability room somewhere deep beneath the surface of the earth.

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,000
The Reverend Ivan Stang, made of pure cream cheese and three pieces of toilet paper.

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:53,280
Has rebuilt his entire personality from a foam-like mug distributed by the Church of the Subtenuous Truth.

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,520
I'm screaming for this paper cup as much as I can and it's just not getting out of the...

15
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,300
Welcome to the hour of...

16
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,420
Nothing.

17
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:09,720
Slack.

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,460
Slack.

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,000
We had such a good cue there, I thought maybe you could use it.

20
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,800
No, I don't care about...

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,680
I don't care about creative...

22
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:20,860
Death.

23
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,780
That's all you need to buy...

24
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,300
There's only one thing that matters between birth and death.

25
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,260
And that's donating...

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,900
To this station of keeping on...

27
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:36,260
This station will be hauled off dead in a casket tomorrow if they can't pay their electrical bills.

28
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:44,800
And long to come, we'll have to quit writing those scripts because no one will be able to pay $75,000 a year to do this show.

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,160
It costs money to do these kinds of elaborate productions, friends.

30
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,840
But friends, it's not real money.

31
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,400
It's the kind of money that you need to make your life twirl around like a little Twinkie stick.

32
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,360
It's the kind of money they give you and...

33
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,160
Outer space.

34
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,580
The kind of money from deep, deep in the cosmos.

35
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,220
It's not...

36
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,060
I know I've convinced somebody and the number to call...

37
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,620
Nothing is flaccid and tricky.

38
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,300
6-8-7-6-9-hundred.

39
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,860
6-8-7-6-9-hundred.

40
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,160
...sophonic money.

41
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,920
The kind that'll bring you a long-sleeved shirt.

42
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,840
Sire, there is no more money.

43
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,320
We gotta get some money.

44
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,620
That dirty Turkish architect, Black Morton...

45
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,780
They're here.

46
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,480
A minute.

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,700
It's showtime.

48
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,600
Time for the subgenius hour and a half.

49
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,200
The show that dare not even exist.

50
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,660
Join us now as we rocket away out of normal time into showtime.

51
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:52,180
It's mysterious, evil, spooky, eerie, creepy, wacky, kooky, fun.

52
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,560
It's the subgenius hour and a half.

53
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,420
Swag.

54
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,720
And here we got the brains of the whole operation.

55
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,220
Faster signal goes out from here to the satellite.

56
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,020
We're bumping out all over the world.

57
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,620
Pretty fancy, huh?

58
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,960
Not too big a weather, Mr. Seller.

59
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,680
You're buying time.

60
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,580
Time, friends.

61
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,020
Because Mr. Moneybags...

62
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,500
He's paying a salary.

63
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,500
A salary?

64
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,040
He throws in a hundred bucks a week and consequently I can't preach against drinking because...

65
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,500
Because his ass box is full of...

66
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:28,500


67
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,820
I hope he's talking about you, my friend.

68
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,320
Frappy.

69
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,120
Pay us not to preach about beer.

70
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,440
Because they all smoke.

71
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,300
I have to let them out for 15 minutes between Sunday school and worship service

72
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,660
so they can go out and light up a Chesterfield or something or the end of it.

73
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,620
And what kind did Jesus smoke, friends?

74
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:51,560
It's time to open your heart, close your mind, unzip your lips, and bend over

75
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,560
because you're about to receive the word of Bob.

76
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,360
And pull out that wallet, friends, because it is pledged.

77
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,040
It's pledge drive time.

78
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,480
Praise Bob.

79
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:04,620
It's either the last pledge drive for a while or the last hour of slack.

80
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,220
This could be your last chance, folks.

81
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,440
I thought you boys understood.

82
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,460
It's business.

83
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,500
That's all it is.

84
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,940
You still don't get it, do you, boys?

85
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,120
There ain't no countries anymore.

86
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,580
No more good guys.

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,260
They're running the whole show.

88
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,560
They own everything.

89
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,540
The whole damn planet.

90
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,560
They can do whatever they want.

91
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,480
What's wrong with having a good for a change?

92
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,100
And they're going to let us have a good.

93
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,860
If we just help them.

94
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,180
They're going to leave us alone.

95
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,480
Let's make some money.

96
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,240
You can have a little taste of that good life, too.

97
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,460
I know you want it.

98
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,620
Hell, everybody does.

99
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,800
Everybody does.

100
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,660
Ah, yes, dear friends.

101
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,180
It is, in fact, pledge drive time.

102
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:57,800
And that number for you and everyone else you know to call is in Cleveland.

103
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,320
6-8-7-6-9-100.

104
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,180
And you can remember that because it has a 69 in it.

105
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,420
That's a secret number.

106
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,860
It means that's like when two little rabbits get into each other's rabbit holes.

107
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:20,280
And friends, WCSB, this station referred to herein, hereafter as this station,

108
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,040
can, in fact, and must be reached at that phone number.

109
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,780
216.

110
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,080
216.

111
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,160
6-8-7-6-9-100.

112
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:38,220
If you were to call this station now, you would speak to, possibly, to Princess We Are Doe herself.

113
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,500
The queen of all the UFOs.

114
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,160
You might be speaking to some yeti.

115
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,460
If Lonesome Cowboy Dave ever shows up, why, you might even be speaking to him.

116
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,300
Yes.

117
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,500
Yes, yes.

118
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:57,640
And since he's not here yet, that gives me a really good time to talk about the pledge.

119
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:07,100
And I know you want to help us look good in the eyes of the station.

120
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,860
You know, it's a student station.

121
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,720
I'm not exactly a student.

122
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,960
Friends, it's so you know what you must do.

123
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,660
You must help.

124
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,800
You must help.

125
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,560
And you think how we can help you.

126
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:25,340
When you donate, such as a $15 pledge and up,

127
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,220
you can get your choice of a bunch of premiums.

128
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,140
I mean, these are actually pretty good deals for $15.

129
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,080
You can get a Bob Bumper sticker.

130
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,080
That's a premium.

131
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,260
That goes with any pledge that you give to the hour slack.

132
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,260
Bob Bumper sticker.

133
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,560
It says, I'm mad to Bob on it.

134
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,700
And you are, aren't you?

135
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,460
There's plenty to be mad at in this world.

136
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:52,020
There's still some left over from last pledge drive of the X-rated,

137
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,820
actually triple X-rated hours of slack.

138
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,300
CDs.

139
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,200
We would sell that for $15 out of our catalog.

140
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,700
But you can get it for $15 and the station gets all the money.

141
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,180
Because we donated that.

142
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:14,980
Friends, friends, there's all these great logo emblazon things

143
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,800
with the WCSB logo to show off that you do, in fact,

144
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,580
listen to the coolest station in the world.

145
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,900
You can get an ashtray for your $15 premium.

146
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,320
A little bit of a discount.

147
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,100
A 2001 t-shirt, a coffee mug.

148
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,820
For $20, you can get the metal travel mug.

149
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,320
Yes.

150
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,120
It's impermeable, impenetrable.

151
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,420
It's invulnerable.

152
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,640
And for $25, there's a baseball cap, a knit winter cap, all this stuff.

153
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,040
You can get shot glasses with the $25 pledge.

154
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,420
Long sleeve t-shirt with a $30 pledge with a big logo on it and so forth.

155
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,180
And all the way up to $75.

156
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,540
Drop $75.

157
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,200
Think what it'll do for you and you'll get the hoodie.

158
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:03,580
But even for $15 mere, my friends, there's all these other premiums.

159
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:08,540
Besides the WCSB and Bob stuff, you can ask for certain spare CDs

160
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,440
that they have laying around here.

161
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,280
And I'm going to give you a list of what they have, among others,

162
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,920
that you can ask Princess Wee.

163
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:23,960
When you call up 687-6900, that's 687-6900 in the 216.

164
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,680
Cleveland area code.

165
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:32,040
You can get your hands on, you can be the person who gets one of these CDs

166
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:38,140
by bands that we've played on the Hour of Slack, such as Evolution Control Committee.

167
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:44,400
Their album, Plagiarism Nation, is sitting here waiting for your $15 pledge.

168
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,960
Stinking Lizaveta, Caught Between Worlds, is here.

169
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,980
James Kochalka, Superstar.

170
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,480
A big fave of mine with his album, Our Most Beloved.

171
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,020
There's only one each of these.

172
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,120
So if you call in and pledge, you can have this mailed to you

173
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,700
when you send in your check or money order, you see.

174
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:12,760
You can also donate online using a credit card.

175
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,240
You cannot call 687-6900 with a credit card number.

176
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,360
You can give your address to Princess Wee there.

177
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,680
You can come to the WCSB.

178
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:29,880
The Open House, November 18th from 3 to 8 o'clock on Friday, November 18th.

179
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,260
Or Sunday, November 20th from 12 to 4.

180
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,900
I can't be here, unfortunately.

181
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,400
Nucleon's album, Hyper Emitter.

182
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,460
Nucleon is a Cleveland band. It's great.

183
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:45,860
They fly through outer space, out of control, careening on LSD.

184
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,860
Freakouts.

185
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,060
Friends, the Billy Nair Show CD.

186
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,560
The soundtrack.

187
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,720
The soundtrack of American Astronaut, which I've been playing a lot lately.

188
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,040
That's a great movie.

189
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,240
And it's a wonderful soundtrack.

190
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,820
The Billy Nair Show, by the way, will be at 9X Day.

191
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:10,600
Yes, the subgenius, fantabulous love fest called X Day.

192
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,420
This will be our ninth one.

193
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,440
Ja? Ja, we say.

194
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,440
We say ja to X Day 9.

195
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,320
Ah, yes.

196
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,540
Oh, another Cleveland band that we've played.

197
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,720
On our Slack, Kirkendall Void.

198
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:30,220
Their CD, Graveyard A Go-Go, is yours for $15 pledge.

199
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,120
At calling in here at 687-6900.

200
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,120
Or, how about Dolly Parton?

201
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,160
Those were the days.

202
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:48,720
Opeth, Ghost Reveries, and Paul Krasner's comedy album, We Have Vays of Making You Laugh.

203
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,820
Paul Krasner was in the studio on this show.

204
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,660
Not long ago.

205
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,920
And, yes, friends, this is all yours.

206
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,400
By the way, Paul Krasner's book is fabulous.

207
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,820
His new book, One Hand Jerking, is really funny.

208
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:12,620
Friends, if you need to, I'm going to give the address of WCSB, the physical address,

209
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,160
where you can go ahead and mail that check or money order right now.

210
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,000
And I'm talking to you by Internet.

211
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,180
You Internet listeners out there, I know there's at least 30 or 40 of you tuned in right now.

212
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:26,760
And you're thinking, well, I can't call WCSB, but I'd love to send them some money.

213
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,660
Here's what you do.

214
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:37,420
Write that check or money order to WCSB slash CSU Foundation.

215
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,860
CSU is short for Cleveland State University, I think.

216
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,920
And here's the post office box, my friends, as we fly in our K-Vorite-covered sphere to the moon.

217
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,160
WCSB.

218
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:52,620
WCSB.

219
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,520
P.O. Box.

220
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,900
9-3-1-8-4-8.

221
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:06,980
Once again, that's WCSB at Box 9-3-1-8-4-8.

222
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,460
Cleveland, Ohio.

223
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,660
4-4-1-0-1.

224
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,120
That's Cleveland, Ohio.

225
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,900
4-4-1-0-1.

226
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,980
P.O. Box 9-3-1-8-4-8.

227
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:40,460
Friends, if you are listening from Sweden, if you are listening from China, if you are listening from Japan, if you are listening from Iraq, send that money in to WCSB and put it to the name of Hour of Slack.

228
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:51,060
Because, you know, friends, if we don't start getting some of those calls coming in, I'm going to be forced to go back to my old pledge drive tapes.

229
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,160
And, in fact, I'm going to be forced to go back to my old pledge drive tapes.

230
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,960
I'm going to do that right this very moment.

231
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,520
You're going to make a million dollars.

232
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:09,820
Dear friends, this is your dear pastor, Reverend Ivan Stang, calling out to you from the depths of my heart.

233
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,720
And I can see so many of you sitting there hovering by your phones, waiting.

234
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,800
Now, the phones are ringing here.

235
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,680
We're doing great.

236
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,940
This time we've got all the beautiful girls, the mighty studliest of genius men.

237
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,020
Ministers sitting here waiting to catch your call.

238
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,660
They're all busy.

239
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:30,180
But if you get a busy signal, just call back again because we sure ain't going to turn down a bit of your money, dear friends.

240
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:30,880
You know that.

241
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,040
That's one thing you can always trust a bob.

242
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,660
Listen to those things going off in the background.

243
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,540
And so for all I know, maybe these.

244
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,260
Oh, yes.

245
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,440
Oh, we've got this is one of the callers that wanted to meet Reverend Stang at a cheap motel.

246
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,660
That comes with a $200 pledge.

247
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,640
Sire, there is no more.

248
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:51,960
More money.

249
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,440
We've got to get some money.

250
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,440
That dirty purgish hark of that black one.

251
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,040
Gorton blacking, macking, hacking, macking.

252
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,640
Ha.

253
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,520
Friends, I should mention some other pledge premiums because I'm just not hearing them phones ringing.

254
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,720
Don't you see?

255
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,960
I was asking for it, but I ain't hearing it.

256
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,020
And so get this.

257
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,300
Here's besides those albums that you can get for a mere 15 buck pledge.

258
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,440
And think how much more you can get.

259
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,820
With the $20 pledge.

260
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:29,040
There's also video tapes available, not DVDs, but VHS tapes.

261
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,180
Most of these were donated by Baron Nightwolf.

262
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:33,540
Our.

263
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,420
And yes, indeed, friends listen to these for for a $15 pledge.

264
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,420
You can get such new videos.

265
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,200
And this is just a small selection.

266
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,720
But I figured these are ones of the sub gene I would like.

267
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,220
The Hills Have Eyes.

268
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,460
Not of this earth.

269
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,260
1995 version with what's your name?

270
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,700
Petey Wheatstraw.

271
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:01,540
Petey Wheatstraw friends with Rudy Ray Moore as Petey Wheatstraw, the devil's son in law.

272
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:15,260
That is a low budget exploitation movie that must be seen to be believed by the great saint, the subgenius Saint Rudy Ray Moore, who I have personally met, by the way, I would like to add.

273
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,460
Lonesome Cowboy Dave has just entered the room.

274
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,080
Oh, here's some other for you.

275
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,320
Get two of these used.

276
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,880
Used videos for a $15 pledge, such as you can ask for these specifically.

277
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,800
Only one left.

278
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,020
Carnival of Souls.

279
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,800
Destroy all monsters.

280
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,860
Eve of Destruction.

281
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,380
1991.

282
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,260
The Frightening Peter Jackson's 2002 movie.

283
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,080
Legend of the Dinosaurs.

284
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,340
1893 movie.

285
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,400
The Monster of Piedras Blancas.

286
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:44,900
1959.

287
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,380
Phantom Planet.

288
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,000
1961.

289
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,100
And this is the one I want the most.

290
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,100
Twilight.

291
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,480
People.

292
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,700
1975.

293
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,020
A Filipino remake of The Island of Dr. Moreau.

294
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:57,440
Wow.

295
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,020
And Wild Wild Planet and Wild Wild Dave is here.

296
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:10,540
Where can you get an argument like that, especially when your head is square, your pocketbook is elongated, and yet your listening pleasure is far from orgiastic.

297
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,080
And, you know, where do you get gifts like that?

298
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,600
If we can call them gifts, maybe they're like sideways curses for the mentally disturbed.

299
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,080
That's about the only other place you can get them.

300
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,580
I mean, you know.

301
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,040
Is the mentally disturbed.

302
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,720
But you can get them.

303
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,040
It's the hipness of it.

304
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,620
I mean, it's just, you know, come on.

305
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,680
This is where you're going to get your, well, I don't know.

306
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,380
Did we mention the X-Triple-X rated hour of Slack for your $15 pledge?

307
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:35,800
You didn't.

308
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:35,900
You mentioned it earlier.

309
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,160
You called into.

310
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,020
Did we mention that phone number?

311
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,060
214-687-6900.

312
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,960
It's not 214.

313
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,720
To speak to Princess Wee.

314
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:43,920
Is it?

315
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:44,540
216.

316
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,140
216.

317
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:45,500
You were in Milwaukee for a second.

318
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:45,520
That's right.

319
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,420
I was in Dallas.

320
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,000
Yeah.

321
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,120
No, I was in Texas.

322
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,900
And we can, we'll go back to Texas in a little while.

323
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,700
When Gorgo lets us go.

324
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,940
When Gorgo.

325
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,040
But speaking of destroy all monsters.

326
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,340
Yes, Dave.

327
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:06,900
When you dial 216-687-6900, you can't think of monsters performing 69.

328
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,380
Please, please.

329
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,760
If you want to announce yourself from the rooftops as, you know, hoodlums or whatever

330
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,680
and stuff, that's fine.

331
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,200
But what about the gargantuous?

332
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,620
Maybe they, you know, they're humanoid.

333
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,880
Just for the, if you were like in a physical.

334
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,280
Physics or geometry and stuff.

335
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,940
Just for the pure radiation sickness of it.

336
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,340
You know what I mean?

337
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:32,140
Just the slamming and banging of the animals as they pledge themselves to oblivion.

338
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,660
Friends, you're animals too, just like us.

339
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,520
You need sustenance, just like this station does.

340
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,840
This station is an animal.

341
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,400
It's a shuffling beast.

342
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,040
Shuffling towards Bethlehem.

343
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,700
This monkey doesn't survive on peanuts.

344
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:45,740
Pennsylvania.

345
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:46,800
Yeah.

346
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,100
Towards Bethlehem, PA.

347
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,460
No, this station doesn't, is not a monkey.

348
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,900
This monkey does not survive on peanuts.

349
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,740
It will not be your big bad bitch.

350
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,960
It must, if it is to, what is it?

351
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:57,780
Survive.

352
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,240
Survive.

353
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,820
That's right.

354
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,160
It's like the.

355
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,820
For prevail.

356
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:01,640
Prevail.

357
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,860
To even prosper.

358
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,880
Because you could just survive like island of Dr. Moreau, but you want to prosper.

359
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:08,720
Yeah.

360
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,920
I mean, you want to live it up, baby.

361
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:17,120
You want to be able to dial 89.3 anytime, night or day and go, okay, that's my soul.

362
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,540
You know, that's my thing.

363
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,660
Well, you know, it could be that someday they could dial 89.3 and there'd still be

364
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,100
a station here, but it wouldn't be what they were expecting.

365
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:31,340
It'd be Rush Limbaugh, the 18th version of his daily show.

366
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,620
Followed by Hannity discussing what Rush said, followed by a, what's his name?

367
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:42,880
Peg, Peg, Peg, like wouldn't never followed by dead silence as an EMP shuts off all electronic

368
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,400
machines in the North American continent.

369
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,440
As the, as the emergency medical system transpires across all the way.

370
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:53,880
From the Canadian Arctic all the way down to Hexico is the whole planet shuts down.

371
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,900
You can hear the doors slamming.

372
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,320
Are you going to let that happen?

373
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,420
Or are you going to call the doors open station?

374
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,540
6, 8, 7, 6, 900 baby bath.

375
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,800
Be baby for 15.

376
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,700
Well, I guess they're not.

377
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,240
Okay.

378
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,240
I'm just going to go right back to, uh, I mean this, when this show ends, if you haven't

379
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,360
helped the station, what you know, as reality is going to come to a crashing halt.

380
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:19,520
Okay.

381
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,800
See what I mean?

382
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,440
We were playing that cherry music cause we wanted to be positive, but you know, frankly,

383
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,720
friends, positive thinking can kill you.

384
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:35,280
Uh, look where positive thinking has gotten most of the world.

385
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:41,080
So far, people say it, Reverend staying, he's a pessimistic booger, but frankly, I'm worried

386
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:47,140
that my most pessimistic predictions might turn out to have been in the long run, idiotically

387
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,740
optimistic.

388
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:54,360
And our fear tonight is that you out there taping this show will think, we'll think, oh,

389
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,260
well, uh, well, they'll stay on the air or not.

390
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:05,920
Whether I give or not, but folks, if you don't pledge the world will literally will literally

391
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,020
come to an end at the end of this hour.

392
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,720
If you, and I don't mean just some of you, I mean you, the one listening right now, oh,

393
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,460
you're laughing.

394
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,400
You're laughing.

395
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,720
It's going to collapse around your pathetic ears, but you nihilistic teenagers out there.

396
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,020
Oh, no future, man.

397
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:21,580
No future.

398
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:27,560
You know, that's why if the rival cult that wants these airwaves had this hour, they'd

399
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,240
erase 10,000 bucks by now.

400
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,300
And you know what they do with it?

401
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,720
They build concentration camps for the likes of you.

402
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,260
You abnormal.

403
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,560
You, you punk.

404
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,680
You old hippie.

405
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,480
You, you humanist.

406
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,380
You sub-humanist.

407
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:45,380


408
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:45,380


409
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:45,380


410
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:45,380


411
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:45,380


412
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:45,380


413
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:45,940
You genius.

414
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,880
So friends, you know, the money isn't just for the hour of slack.

415
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,100
It's for the totality.

416
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,400
That is this station.

417
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,380
It isn't just for us mutants.

418
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,700
It's for your very mind, your very soul.

419
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,440
And you wouldn't believe how close your soul is to being sold out.

420
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:05,680
Dear brother or sister between your job and the drugs and the lies.

421
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:10,280
Listen, you need every bit of slack you can hang on to, but we have a special form of

422
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,140
slack in store for you tonight.

423
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,560
Not stored in souls anywhere.

424
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,240
Folks.

425
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,280
And the type of slack you're going to be getting is guilt.

426
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,380
Guilt.

427
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,260
Tonight, we're going to whip us up some guilt.

428
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,300
And some of you are saying, oh, it's pledge time.

429
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,960
Reverend Stang's going to rant all night about money.

430
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,940
And you better be afraid that that's true.

431
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,320
Little Bobby, little gimme Bob out there.

432
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:37,660
At this level, our salesman can see the top of the ladder and as well on his way there.

433
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,240
Hey, praise Dr. Dark, who pledged.

434
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:45,380
Dr. Dark.

435
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,380
He's at $1998.

436
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,260
$19.98 or?

437
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,760
No, $1,998.

438
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,640
That's a new unreasonable record.

439
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,280
How can we top that from one collared green?

440
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,360
Here's how we can top it when we get one from Australia.

441
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,520
That's who just topped it.

442
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,360
The Reverend Chainsmurker, listening by internet, called all the way to Australia.

443
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:15,360


444
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:15,360


445
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:15,360


446
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,240
All the way in from that distant climb, that wombat-ridden land.

447
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,040
That wombat.

448
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,140
You could hear kangaroos in the background.

449
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,740
The sheilas and the roos are all humping together and rutting on the barbie of the

450
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,540
shrimp and all of that.

451
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:39,140
And friend, how come it is that we're getting calls from as so far away as Australia and

452
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,500
Cleveland, and yet we haven't heard from you?

453
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,280
We haven't heard from you, my friend.

454
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,720
You're our only friend.

455
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,340
We haven't heard from you.

456
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:45,800
We haven't heard from you.

457
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,260
Is it a moonless night, friend?

458
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:53,020
Is the wildebeest crying in your left ear, making you want to go things to your mucilaginous

459
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,200
passages you've never done?

460
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,100
Forget about that stance.

461
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,320
That stay-at-home, hate-the-ether way of thinking.

462
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,200
Get out there and pledge your numbers.

463
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:09,340
You've got to do something, and those numbers are 216-687-6900.

464
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:11,800
6900.

465
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,220
That's 6900.

466
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,320
I hope you're not going to get mad.

467
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:15,320


468
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,140
I hope you understand the significance of that pronunciation.

469
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,000
If you spell it the nuclear way.

470
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,620
Dave here has a pronounced speech impediment.

471
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,840
It's not an impediment.

472
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,300
Some not very well pronounced.

473
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,360
It's a highly-stylized way of expressing myself.

474
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,180
Hey.

475
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:39,040
And you could be on the radio too, just like us, if you could just bribe us with those

476
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,860
pledges, friends.

477
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,240
That's true.

478
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,520
We might even let the numbers of the, what, the evacuation?

479
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,800
The evacuation numbers.

480
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,260
Have you noticed that we read your number out on the air?

481
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,480
We give your home address?

482
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,620
Well, no, not that.

483
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,360
But certainly your church name.

484
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,120
Yeah.

485
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,420
Your entire church name.

486
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,880
And don't you want to talk to Princess Wee in person?

487
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,820
This is not a recording.

488
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,360
I mean, if you talk to Dave or me, we're just recordings.

489
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,320
She's real.

490
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:08,380
And when you call her, you not only get to pledge your monies, your hard-earned

491
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:14,500
scrids to a baseball cap for 25 premiums, a $15 coffee mug which says, uh, I'm going

492
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:14,520
to give you a coffee.

493
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:14,520


494
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:14,520


495
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:14,520


496
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:14,520


497
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:14,520


498
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:14,520


499
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,720
It's that, uh, Stang is a wretched cadaver.

500
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,180
No, it says WCSB, which stands for when kills Stang badly.

501
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,740
Well, how hip is that?

502
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,240
People come into your house, you give them a cup of coffee and it's got WCSB.

503
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:31,420
I mean, you know, people talk about local alternative and college radio stations as

504
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:35,040
if we had some hidden treasure here in smallburg peppy town, USA.

505
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:35,980
You know?

506
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,680
We do.

507
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,320
But isn't it true?

508
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,440
You're it, Dave.

509
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,020
You're it.

510
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,400
Oh, no.

511
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,560
They're it.

512
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,780
Are we it?

513
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,140
No.

514
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,860
They're it.

515
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,480
They're it.

516
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,780
vast listeners. Some of them

517
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,760
are a little bit too heavy and need to cut down

518
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,700
on that food a little bit.

519
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,680
That means you're it until you call in.

520
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,100
687-6900.

521
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:55,640
Third.

522
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,120
The Radio Fond

523
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,780
2005

524
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,640
begins on

525
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,740
noon Sunday,

526
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,920
November the 6th

527
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,740
and ends on noon Sunday,

528
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,520
November 13th

529
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,460
on Friday.

530
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,260
There'll be a special opening.

531
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,980
An opening.

532
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,220
You like openings,

533
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,240
don't you? Yes, orifices

534
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,340
everywhere. Creases.

535
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,300
Dents, grooves,

536
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,380
like the convolutions in your

537
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,520
dents.

538
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,420
How often

539
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,500
do we recognize

540
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,280
the importance of dents as

541
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:40,820
sexual

542
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,240
things?

543
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,360
Appurtenances or

544
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,440
a sexual...

545
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,380
There is an aspect, a sexual aspect

546
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,540
to the dent, just as there is an

547
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,080
opposing one to the bump.

548
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,540
And you can learn more

549
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,900
if you call and talk to the actual queen

550
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,520
of all the UFOs at

551
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,120
687-6900. That's the only

552
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,620
way for us to get your address

553
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,020
so that we can send you

554
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,000
the postcard that reminds you to

555
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,740
send the check to

556
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,180
WCSBCSUFoundation

557
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,440
at P.O. Box

558
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,240
9...

559
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,660
931-848

560
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,320
Cleveland,

561
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:18,840
Ohio

562
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,080
44101

563
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,820
Because you can do that,

564
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,000
friend. You can do that if you're listening to this show

565
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,880
by internet three weeks from

566
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,040
this pledge drive. If you're listening to this show

567
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,140
on one of our beloved other stations

568
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,320
such as WREK

569
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,360
in Atlanta or

570
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,400
beloved...

571
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,100
any of them, you can

572
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:41,740
still...

573
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,780
support your... your local

574
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,440
Hour of Slack station.

575
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,040
You say to yourself, I... I... I listen on the internet,

576
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,320
I live out in Wyoming...

577
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,820
Play that post office...

578
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,200
box back in...

579
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,040
however...

580
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,020
SEND IT!

581
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:55,840
SEND IT!

582
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,760
You could... you've got that stamp, you've got that pencil,

583
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,580
you've got that MP3 of this show,

584
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,880
write that address down, that's WCSB

585
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,300
P.O. Box

586
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,000
931-848

587
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,800
Cleveland, Ohio 44101

588
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,000
there's only one Clevelandite

589
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,500
who cares or knows anything, and that's WCSB.com.

590
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,780
All of our fans are from somewhere else.

591
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,920
That's why you, far away, have to send those trickles of surprise checks.

592
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,720
And you can always put some weird little extra clipping or statement in there.

593
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,760
A kissing mark on it.

594
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:32,940
Some random surrealism to confuse the nice volunteers here at the station from her mail.

595
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,640
We've received some absurd objects that, you know, have no explanation.

596
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,680
So please, you know, it's better off with the stained toilet paper going,

597
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:45,040
eww, than looking at something for three days and having to call in a nuclear, well, a...

598
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,200
Just do it!

599
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:46,820
Nuclear.

600
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:51,260
Remember, friends, these pledge-a-thons are like radio wars.

601
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,640
They seep down into the consciousness of the average citizen and make him not want to pledge.

602
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,680
But if you want to fight back against constipation, radio broadcasting,

603
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,900
flaccid, placid, overweight, understyled, incorrect,

604
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,580
overly easily understood...

605
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:12,400
Over, easily, easily, overly, overly easily understood radio.

606
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,240
Unlike this show.

607
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,300
Connect in now with 687-6900 and say,

608
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,040
I'll do virtually anything.

609
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,060
Do it.

610
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,840
And especially to piddle your exogenous zones.

611
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:27,820
If you'd like to taunt to the lovely princess we are...

612
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,200
Can't you taunt to her?

613
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,400
You're going to get more than an exogenous experience.

614
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,260
You're going to get an...

615
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,140
You're going to get an awakening.

616
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:41,200
That's going to thrill your sphincter and your family's collective sphincters

617
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,880
for thousands and thousands of years.

618
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,480
And I'm not exaggerating either, am I?

619
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,460
I'm probably exaggerating a little bit.

620
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,500
You can't exaggerate.

621
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:49,780
No.

622
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,840
There's no way of exaggerating the importance.

623
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:57,280
Look, if you pledge $75, we'll send you a hoodie.

624
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,580
Now, we all know that that means it's like a really cool sweatshirt

625
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,080
that says WCSB on it and stuff like that.

626
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,620
But in your...

627
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,400
In your sick imagination,

628
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:11,520
you could probably make it seem like some hoodlum was going to come to your house,

629
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,380
bark down your cattle,

630
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,240
cause cerebral damage to your grandparents,

631
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,660
and blame it on somebody else.

632
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,400
Or kill me.

633
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,100
Or kill me.

634
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,060
Or you could kill Bob.

635
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,160
Yeah, you could.

636
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,300
You could just do that instead of calling 687-6900

637
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,820
and just at least...

638
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,540
Look, even if you're lying,

639
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,060
even if you're one of those hypocrites,

640
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,480
she just wants to talk to Princess Wee

641
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,580
and have her take your number down,

642
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,480
go to a bunch of work,

643
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,620
and have some other volunteer...

644
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,240
send you the postcard reminding you.

645
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:41,920
And even though you have no intention of ever actually paying,

646
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,180
go ahead and call anyway.

647
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:44,780
Okay, I...

648
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,080
Because who knows?

649
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,920
You may decide that some...

650
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,900
Maybe suddenly you'll get a conscience.

651
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,040
Okay, Officer Sting, could you please step aside?

652
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,480
We have enough of the hard cop.

653
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,520
Bob, you want to come over here and tell them what they'll get?

654
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,180
I'm afraid nobody wants to do, Bob.

655
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:05,680
Right.

656
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,340
And Bob doesn't.

657
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,880
Bob doesn't want to come over here.

658
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,420
He's just looking at us now with a weird glare,

659
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,580
so I'm going to shut up.

660
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,440
There are people who want to do, Bob,

661
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,440
and those are the people you should really avoid.

662
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,780
I don't want to imitate him in his presence,

663
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,560
and if he doesn't want to talk, then...

664
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:20,940
But, okay.

665
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,220
Never he hardly ever does.

666
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,580
And when he does,

667
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,240
it usually is some message about Mars needs women.

668
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,120
He's stuck on that Mars and women thing.

669
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,720
And he'll go back there.

670
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,600
Venus doesn't need women.

671
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,240
It's got all the women it needs.

672
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,760
Venus isn't practically nothing but women.

673
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,600
It is a woman.

674
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,120
So wise up, man.

675
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,240
What are you going to be?

676
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,760
A Martian, a Venusian, or an Earthman?

677
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:50,460
Or a WCSB listener who calls in with that pledge right now?

678
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,540
It's just a pledge.

679
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,360
It's just a promise.

680
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:52,980
That's all.

681
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,160
What are you going to do when it starts raining

682
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,580
and you want to be the hippest encumbrance on your whole golf?

683
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,560
And you're just dry.

684
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,980
You're just a dried-up old raisin of a person.

685
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,180
You're going to need an umbrella to keep out the sun.

686
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,160
And you're going to need sunshine once the sun goes nova.

687
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,640
687-6900.

688
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,600
What more could we...

689
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,480
I mean, it all adds up.

690
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,420
It comes to that great fruition, that conclusion.

691
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,460
Everything points to that number.

692
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,140
687-6900.

693
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:27,040
And your pledge to that self-same number at this station.

694
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,820
The synchronicity is so vast,

695
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:33,700
it enloads you right as a zart in front of your nose.

696
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:34,600
Ha ha ha.

697
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,320
687-6900.

698
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:36,320


699
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,320
Okay, I'm going to give them no more chance,

700
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,120
and we'll just play this...

701
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,120
I'm going to call the same policeman that I was trying to get in

702
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,020
and go out and arrest some of these slackers,

703
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,580
and I say with a small L in the background.

704
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,320
Right, that's it.

705
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,000
The small S for slacker.

706
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,920
These aren't real slackers.

707
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,700
And have them brought down here and give me $40.

708
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:04,560
And I promised to pledge $20 for a white or black logo shirt,

709
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,820
and then use the rest of it to buy a beer.

710
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,940
I was going to...

711
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:13,300
I am seriously thinking about pledging $20 or even just $15

712
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:16,640
and getting that video of...

713
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,680
Well, I'm not going to say what it is, because I want that video.

714
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,900
But I shall mention that if the other videos that you can get from...

715
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,980
Thanks to this donation by Baron Nightwolf...

716
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,580
Arrrrr!

717
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,760
There are such things as, as I said, the legend of dinosaurs.

718
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,260
13 ghosts.

719
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:38,780
Not the new one, but the 1960 William Castle 13 ghosts.

720
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,540
Things to Come, H.G. Wells movie from 1936.

721
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,840
How about that?

722
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,520
Woodstock 99, stupidest thing you ever saw.

723
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,700
And it's only 52 of these.

724
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,880
You can get Woodstock 99 and Wild Wild Planet from 1965.

725
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,300
I mean, jeez, this is incredible stuff!

726
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,060
And support the station.

727
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,540
I mean, it's like you get...

728
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,860
And it's tax exempt!

729
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,240
You're tax unrighteous!

730
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:04,240


731
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:04,600
It's un-wipe-able!

732
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,660
Just think about it.

733
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,360
You can write...

734
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,600
You can currently...

735
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,860
Let's not get into any...

736
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,500
You can crunt!

737
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,380
You can crunt!

738
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:11,980
Man!

739
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,540
Don't you see, man?

740
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,500
You can crunt now!

741
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,460
These figures he had on those figures there.

742
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,120
It's all a premium you might wear.

743
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,540
15 for the ashtray or the 2001 shirt.

744
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,780
15 for a coffee mug.

745
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,740
Sometimes when you wear them, they hurt.

746
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,160
$20 gets you a logo shirt and a travel mug.

747
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,240
$20 gets you a logo shirt and a travel mug.

748
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:34,240


749
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,820
A baseball cap is $25.

750
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,060
A baseball cap is $25.

751
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:37,320
Oh, one.

752
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,520
One dollar for postage.

753
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,760
One second away.

754
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,980
Twenty-five for a knit winter hat.

755
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,680
And as you wear it, it knits and weaves stories you can't understand.

756
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,120
Unfortunately, if you don't have the imagination to supply that part, at least you will have

757
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,160
supported this station!

758
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,920
Don't be a nitwit, friends!

759
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,580
Go for it!

760
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,160
At WCSB!

761
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,620
At Post Office Box!

762
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,240
931-844-4255!

763
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:04,240


764
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:04,240


765
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:04,240


766
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:04,240


767
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:04,240


768
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:04,240


769
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,640
Cleveland, Ohio 44101 is where to send that check if you're not hearing this live but

770
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,060
on some insane playback later on!

771
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,660
Be a superhero, friends!

772
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,260
Be your own hero for once!

773
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:26,780
Can you imagine yourself careening down the slopes in one of those knit winter hats for

774
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:31,360
only $25 premium, which actually says WCSB 89.3 on it?

775
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,940
You're cruising down those...

776
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,220
You're slaloming your shoulders.

777
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:34,440
You're shushing.

778
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:34,900
You're shushing.

779
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,220
Yeah, that's right.

780
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:35,840
You're shushing.

781
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,700
And suddenly you realize...

782
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:38,660
Realize...

783
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,120
Excuse me.

784
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:44,580
Suddenly you realize you're shushing down the cliffs of Garfield Heights.

785
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,860
You're not in New York State.

786
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,400
You're in Gotham City itself!

787
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:47,980
You're in Goth...

788
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,240
Yeah, right.

789
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:48,880
No, no, no.

790
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,060
You're Batman!

791
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,040
You pledged!

792
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,620
You paid!

793
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,220
You sent the money in and now you feel good!

794
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:54,960
You're good!

795
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:55,660
You're...

796
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,360
I feel bad.

797
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,880
You're a Batmore, all right.

798
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,200
You're built for this job, that's right.

799
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,860
You can see thousands of miles.

800
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:08,740
In the future and in the pasture, you can see things others cannot see.

801
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,180
And you see in your future...

802
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,200
Future...

803
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:12,720
Future...

804
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,420
A $30 lodge!

805
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:23,160
In the year 1998, the men from Planet X shall descend on this earth in power and glory to

806
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:32,660
lift up those dues-paying subgeniuses who went to subgenius.com or WCSB.org and did

807
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,780
the right thing.

808
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,060
Yes, the right thing!

809
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,260
What will they be willing?

810
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:36,840
They reached down into that...

811
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:36,860
Yes!

812
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,080
That deep, deep, deep pit in their body.

813
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:46,720
That dent in which they found, yes, the most secret, intimate organ of their body.

814
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,900
The wallet.

815
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,720
And they extracted it.

816
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,080
And they pulled from it...

817
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:51,240
Gently.

818
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,980
...those dollars that they then rubbed upon themselves.

819
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,300
And then they blessed it against a picture of Bob.

820
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,720
And then they put it against a picture of their mom and their dad.

821
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,100
And then they put it in the mail and sent it to the station.

822
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,680
That subgenius tongues might air wag...

823
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,160
Fluid and follows Dragon Puss.

824
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:18,140
...and near want for extra pizza at the station staff meetings.

825
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:23,480
Friends, when you donate to this station, you're not just helping us improve our equipment,

826
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,520
stay on the air, make a better signal.

827
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:31,720
You're helping to pay for the pizza that makes the station staff meetings bearable.

828
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:37,140
Some of these people actually stay alive on the stale pizza that they eat after the station meetings.

829
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,140
Don't you understand how shoestring these thumbs are and these little, these budgets are?

830
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,620
That takes to bring you this...

831
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:49,340
That takes to bring you this great entertainment here on 687-6900.

832
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,140
And now this!

833
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,100
All right, all right, all right.

834
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:00,920
One of the good old boys here tonight, we'd like to welcome you down to the television mission.

835
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:07,380
Don't forget, if all you can do is sit at home, then try to keep yourselves awake and dial the phone.

836
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,660
Call in for pledges.

837
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,460
Call in for pledges, yes.

838
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,680
Answering the phones this evening.

839
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,080
Beautiful Dr. Zaphon.

840
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:20,240
And the best thing you can do is dial this number that you see on your screen as quickly as you can with a contribution to the television mission.

841
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,220
You revolting genetic accident, take your smelly shell elsewhere.

842
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,220
Yes, Dave, you disgusting creature.

843
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,040
Think, think of it, Steng.

844
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:34,220
Even Fireside Theater endorses your church.

845
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,200
Sorry, I had to use that word.

846
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:43,000
But your organization, and your organization's best representative.

847
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,680
Listen to these inspirational words from the Book of Life, Chapter 10, Bankruptcy, Verse 10.

848
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,900
The passage runs, and I quote,

849
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:57,560
If you be tired at 12, if you've got that run-down feeling, remember you're not just anybody, you're special.

850
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,020
You are living proof that God is real.

851
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:00,640
God does not exist.

852
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:07,900
Yes, you, little listener, if you are like most of the people who listen to this show, are proof that no supreme being could ever exist.

853
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,600
I love you, Master Turner.

854
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,000
It's a duck hunt.

855
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,660
Uh, Anson, please, don't, don't, don't start.

856
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,440
Please, please.

857
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,240
Yeah, I'm sorry, I've got to start anyway.

858
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,160
I don't want to start, believe me.

859
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,600
There's no start in my endergrats.

860
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:27,200
Dear friends, I've got to admit, I'm just too depressed to do a good show.

861
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,280
Yeah.

862
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:32,780
Well, I haven't even finished watching it, and I've got to go.

863
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,400
I'm sorry.

864
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:35,400


865
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,500
I'll be back in a minute.

866
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:36,500


867
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,260
So, um, I just have to go.

868
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,280
I'll be back in a minute.

869
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:41,720
Very well.

870
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:41,720


871
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:41,720


872
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,940
Have a great weekend.

873
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,520
And I'll see you next time.

874
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:46,640
See you.

875
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:46,640


876
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:51,820
Bye-bye.

877
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:51,820


878
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:51,860

00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,120
No, don't do that.

881
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,860
What do you mean, don't do that?

882
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,180
Don't do that.

883
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:57,180


884
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:57,180

00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:57,180


888
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:57,760
Don't do that.

He is the one who has them.

922
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,540
Thank you, Steve.

923
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,920
From far away in Chagrin Falls.

924
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,180
Chicken Falls.

925
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:05,920
Much to our chagrin that he's so far away, and yet he can hear the show.

926
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,320
Down in the valley there.

927
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:11,560
And Chris Sazekas, or Sazekas, or whatever.

928
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,240
Sazekas.

929
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,660
Even here in Lakewood, Ohio.

930
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,880
So there are people locally who do care.

931
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,260
But the great Rex Oroboros.

932
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,100
Rex, thank you.

933
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:30,740
Has called in to help us from our brotherly sister station in Champaign, Illinois.

934
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,440
I can hear the corks popping now.

935
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:33,900
Rex Oroboros.

936
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:39,560
He has reserved the Destroy All Monsters video, I've noticed.

937
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,460
There is no blame.

938
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,540
The great David Bauchner.

939
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,520
Thank you, David.

940
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,600
He is the David Bauchner in Toronto, Canada.

941
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,180
Genius man.

942
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:47,900
Isn't that nice?

943
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,380
Wonderful fellow.

944
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,240
Listeners in Toronto calling in.

945
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:50,480
Yeah.

946
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,520
David Bauchner did not just pledge.

947
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:58,600
David Bauchner put us on the internet, you might say, and kept us there for a long, long time.

948
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,280
And we still can't leave.

949
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,920
Scott points in Athens, Georgia.

950
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,380
Now, what kind of a show is this?

951
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,820
Did we get calls from so far, far away?

952
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,020
It may be Athens, Ohio, no?

953
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,960
No, it's Athens, Georgia.

954
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:15,300
I wish I were in the Lamb and Cotton.

955
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:20,100
And he's getting the Slovenian glasses and the hour of Slack XXX.

956
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,480
That's a good choice.

957
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,380
And another one.

958
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,220
Here comes the lovely Miss Wee.

959
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,300
Princess Wee brings another one.

960
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,080
Chris Turner, the Reverend Ant...

961
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,200
Oh, that's Antichrist.

962
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,580
Reverend Antichrist.

963
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,860
A turnip cannot pledge.

964
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:36,100
That's not quite the same as Reverend Antichrist.

965
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,300
No, it's Antichrikes.

966
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,440
Antichrist.

967
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,200
Antichrikes?

968
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:43,000
But Antichrist to Mobile, Alabama.

969
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:47,180
Oh, I wish I were in the Lamb and Cotton again.

970
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,280
A survivor of the terror.

971
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,480
Of Hurricane Ivan.

972
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:57,840
And Her Highness Hellno in lovely Lakewood, Ohio.

973
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,460
Another Lechner.

974
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,560
Her Highness Hellno, the creator of the Bobby Awards almost every year.

975
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,800
Did I mention John Visnavkas?

976
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,260
No, you did.

977
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,160
Or Vinalkas.

978
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:11,680
Thank you, John.

979
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,100
Vinalkas.

980
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,360
But we love you, John.

981
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,560
Yes, Bob is a...

982
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,920
Stang has a heart with names.

983
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,280
So just imagine.

984
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,360
Imagine he has...

985
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:21,720
Anonymous.

986
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:24,800
Read them and pronounced them anonymously.

987
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,240
Too late for the anonymous one.

988
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,680
Anyway, thank you, Anonymous, again and again.

989
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:32,840
Thank you, all of you who were and shall ever be Montonymous.

990
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,640
Montonymous Bay.

991
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:40,380
You don't have to be monogamous or a baseball cap wearing, winter knit hat wearing,

992
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,340
No, it helps.

993
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:50,080
Aficionado of music and diverse talk in spunky rhythms of strange ideas and beautiful searches into the past.

994
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:54,320
Like when we go tripping down Mamory Lane.

995
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:55,760
Oh, yes.

996
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,720
There are lots of jugs.

997
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,880
I talked to a listener.

998
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,560
There's a listener in Detroit who thinks you're real smart.

999
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,480
Remember that?

1000
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,320
We met that guy.

1001
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:08,080
We met this guy that said that he thought you were real smart and he gave us all those

1002
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,060
Firesign Theater albums.

1003
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,500
That man was himself extremely big.

1004
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:19,000
He gave us each copies of all the Firesign Theater albums on CB.

1005
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,160
Only 72%.

1006
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,560
72% of mine actually worked.

1007
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:22,200
Oh, really?

1008
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:22,860
Yes.

1009
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,680
Well, I hadn't even tried to play 72% of mine.

1010
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,820
Oh, I played as many as I could.

1011
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:27,740
Oh, yes.

1012
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:28,960
And then someone goes .

1013
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:32,920
Oh, we're all bojos around this .

1014
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:37,480
Well, you know, the CD technology is crude.

1015
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,680
Mine is, yes.

1016
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,060
And yours, of course, is even cruder.

1017
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:45,060
And then there's your ears and then there's the stuff in between your two ears.

1018
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,560
And there's what comes out of my mouth, which is also crude.

1019
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:48,720
Yes.

1020
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,140
But not as crude as this.

1021
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:53,800
Because the sweet crude we're pushing, ladies and Germans.

1022
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,960
The bubbling crude.

1023
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:03,720
If Eichmann were a vastly vaster man, if Adolf Hitler did all he can, we still wouldn't hate

1024
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,040
you as much as we hate ourselves for you not pledging.

1025
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:08,660
What the hell?

1026
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:09,180
Let's just go.

1027
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,340
Let's just get the .

1028
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:11,780
As puzzling evidence once said.

1029
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:12,760
Let's get the flop.

1030
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:17,420
Let's frop up so we can get back to hating the conspiracy instead of ourselves.

1031
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:18,180
Yeah.

1032
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,940
Puzzling evidence said that.

1033
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,240
About frop.

1034
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,980
Oh, I thought about 40 times.

1035
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:24,100
Have you froped, Pippulus?

1036
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:24,440
Yeah.

1037
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:24,800
Pippulus?

1038
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:25,060
Yeah.

1039
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:31,820
Well, what's ... There's no ... They can't get any Hapsops from Pippulus if they pledge

1040
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:33,580
to this or any other ...

1041
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:34,720
No, I wish.

1042
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:41,800
But that's an imported herb that's pretty expensive from Tibet.

1043
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,980
Now, Buddhist llamas or is it just the alpacas?

1044
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:48,380
Any of these different animals, how do they ingest it?

1045
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,420
With their teeth?

1046
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:50,960
No, that's not the way it works.

1047
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:57,480
The llamas, holy men, Tibetan llamas that are ...

1048
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,480
Well, you claim to be a holy ...

1049
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:06,760
The frop only grows on the graves or droppings of those holy men or on the graves or droppings

1050
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,520
of the ...

1051
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:07,660
Of the Yeti.

1052
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:08,740
... the Himalayan Yeti.

1053
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,740
The great Yeti.

1054
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,120
That's what I thought.

1055
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:10,680
Yes.

1056
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:17,440
In America, that would be the Sasquatch or Bigfoot or the ... What is it?

1057
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,420
Homo hoaxis.

1058
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:18,480
Homo hoaxis.

1059
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,100
Oh, wacky, haggard man.

1060
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,020
That doesn't make no sense, dang.

1061
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:29,700
Anyway, so if you were a Yeti and you were just to randomly go out and poop in the backyard,

1062
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:34,040
would there ... A Dalai Lama emerge from a Hapsopropsypulus bush?

1063
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,800
No, but if you ... That would be the only place in your yard where you could grow the

1064
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,620
things, the plants.

1065
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:39,920
Okay.

1066
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,480
I know they only blossom during a full moon, so ...

1067
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,560
It's like wolfbane.

1068
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:45,920
Yeah.

1069
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:46,580
Oh, yeah.

1070
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,140
So it is dangerous.

1071
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,200
It is wolfbane.

1072
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:48,400
It is.

1073
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:48,400


1074
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:48,400


1075
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:48,400


1076
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:48,400


1077
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:48,400


1078
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:48,400


1079
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:48,400


1080
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:48,400


1081
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:48,400


1082
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:48,400


1083
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:48,400


1084
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:48,400


1085
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:56,300
It's exactly the same thing as the ... Well, not the ... There are different plants that

1086
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,900
are called wolf's bane.

1087
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,720
So one is like ... One of them is a slightly poisonous thing

1088
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,980
that grows in the Balkans or someplace.

1089
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,820
But that's anti-lycanthropic, right?

1090
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:14,080
That helps psychological lycanthropy, but then physical lycanthropy can only be combated

1091
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:18,380
by Hapophrops zypulops, which is why when you run out of froth, you turn into something.

1092
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:18,980
You're such a bastard.

1093
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,380
I just thought you were going to say if you had the original wolfbane, you'd still

1094
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:27,960
turn into a wolf after you smoked it, but you just would think that you hadn't.

1095
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:33,520
But if you smoke real Hapsopropsypulus, you not only will think you haven't turned into

1096
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,340
a wolf, you won't.

1097
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:40,460
Or you will, but you won't care, which is even really the best, I guess.

1098
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:44,000
Well, we're at the deep end of the pool now, and I don't know if I can swim that

1099
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:44,220
well.

1100
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:45,620
I don't understand that.

1101
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,180
Actually ... I dived right in, and this is where I'm

1102
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:48,320
at.

1103
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,040
I'm kind of like over my head.

1104
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,020
Or ... anyway.

1105
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:56,880
So none of these people have pledged for Hapsop ... well, never mind.

1106
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:57,880
I'm sorry.

1107
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,920
Oh, they might not know where to pledge.

1108
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:08,440
Of course, they need to pledge to WCSB at this phone number, 216-687-6900.

1109
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,780
Can they actually pledge through the internet, or is that a false rumor?

1110
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:18,380
Actually, you can go to WCSB.org, not .com.

1111
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:19,140
.org.

1112
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:19,660
.org.

1113
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:28,160
And there, punch in your credit card number, but you should also punch in the phone number

1114
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,080
and call Princess Wee and tell her you've done that, so that she can send you your choice

1115
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:39,700
of videos, our Slack XXXXXXXX shows, or a bumper sticker that says, I'm mad too, Bob.

1116
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,780
And are you too mad, Bob?

1117
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:45,260
Someday you'll be the Bishop of Tinkleberry.

1118
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:46,040
Yes.

1119
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:46,460
Someday.

1120
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,580
Someday we shall bring Bob back to life.

1121
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:52,240
We will find his old pipe shanks and stems.

1122
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:54,280
We'll scrape them out and get bits of saliva.

1123
00:49:54,640 --> 00:50:01,000
We'll retrieve the DNA of the original Bob before he was killed, any of those times.

1124
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:06,380
As part of our master plan, Bob will not only live again and walk the green earth ...

1125
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:06,640
He will sell again.

1126
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:11,140
He will sell again, and you will be one of his victimless crimes.

1127
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:13,700
You shall own what he does not.

1128
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:19,820
You shall become a part of a vast invisible fortune which grows more invisible with each

1129
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:20,320
second.

1130
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:25,120
Yes, please, give us some money.

1131
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:26,100
Money.

1132
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:26,940
Money.

1133
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:27,180


1134
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:27,620
Money.

1135
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:27,840
Money.

1136
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:28,960
All right.

1137
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,180
Arms for the poor.

1138
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,500
Penny for the old guy.

1139
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:33,960
Penny for the old guy.

1140
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:37,920
Can you spare a quarter for an old altar boy father?

1141
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:42,360
Can you spare a quarter for an old altar boy father?

1142
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:42,960
That's it.

1143
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,420
That's it.

1144
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:43,680
That's it.

1145
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:43,680


1146
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:43,680


1147
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:43,680


1148
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:43,680


1149
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:43,680


1150
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:43,680


1151
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:47,400
Yes, friends, you too can be exorcised.

1152
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,560
You can have the demons of money exorcised from your wallet.

1153
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:56,240
You can do it yourself by calling this station and pledging your hard-earned dollars.

1154
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:01,000
I think at least they should pledge just based on the fact that we haven't conducted this

1155
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,500
pledge-a-thon like this.

1156
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,800
We only do this once a year.

1157
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,120
Yeah, we only do it once a year.

1158
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:08,920
You know what it really costs to run a station like WCSB?

1159
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:12,220
You know, in fact, we're not going to play any music.

1160
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:13,560
We're going to boy you to death.

1161
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,740
We're not going to.

1162
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:15,040
We could do that.

1163
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,820
We could talk with NPR-type accents, public television, volunteer accents.

1164
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:22,640
Well, Dr. Tom Winkle is here from the faculty accent department.

1165
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:28,820
And Tom, how long have you been working here and why do you continue to work here?

1166
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:29,700
Continue.

1167
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:30,860
Never mind.

1168
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:33,880
Oh, I've been at the Tweed for 25 years now.

1169
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:36,800
That's a nice suit you're wearing.

1170
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,040
I was wearing the Tweed.

1171
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:41,660
And I noticed the back of your suit is all shiny from all the-

1172
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:41,860
Oh, no.

1173
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:42,920
That's where I peed.

1174
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:48,940
Oh, there's all the back slapping you've been involved in at those faculty luncheons.

1175
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,060
Want to get something published?

1176
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:52,320
Publish this!

1177
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,040
Oh!

1178
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:54,420
We need money!

1179
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:58,640
Let's see what was on in the old days when we had something to think about.

1180
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:04,260
I've got one hour to convince you how badly we and the station need your support.

1181
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:09,400
We have a special, special form of slack in store tonight.

1182
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:13,400
Instead of us giving you slack for once, we're giving you slack for two.

1183
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:13,400


1184
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,100
You're going to finally give some back to us.

1185
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,800
Of course, some of you have been doing so all along.

1186
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:19,900
Praise Bob.

1187
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,240
But for the rest of you, oh, this could be the moment of truth.

1188
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:25,720
The moment at hand.

1189
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:31,300
You have to love Bob.

1190
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:36,200
He loves you, but you love Bob.

1191
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,560
You have to.

1192
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:40,480
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?

1193
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:42,620
He'll kill you.

1194
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:43,360
He'll kill you.

1195
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,340
He'll Bob you out.

1196
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,520
He'll Bob you out, folks.

1197
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,120
He'll Bob you out, friends.

1198
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,040
You heard it here first.

1199
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:52,060
If you don't love Bob, he'll Bob you out.

1200
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:52,640
He'll Bob you out, friend.

1201
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,540
He'll be a sorry, only if.

1202
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:55,100
Only if.

1203
00:52:55,160 --> 00:53:01,900
Well, you know, if you don't pledge, there's going to be more than one Reverend Stang.

1204
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,340
You're going to have to listen to it forever.

1205
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,060
How many Reverend Stangs?

1206
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,400
We need that money.

1207
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:08,140
Oh, my gosh.

1208
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:08,820
Go for it.

1209
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,400
Let's get us some spirit going here, man.

1210
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,760
Look at those phones light up.

1211
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:13,300
I've got a phone.

1212
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:13,340
I've got a phone.

1213
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:13,340


1214
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:13,340


1215
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:13,340


1216
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:13,340


1217
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:13,340


1218
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:17,160
I've got poison in there, moves in here.

1219
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:17,560
Hey, Bob.

1220
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:27,540
Now that's some shBonkChischm.

1221
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:28,940
Oh, my gosh.

1222
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:29,080
Do you want more?

1223
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,380
20 bucks for that one if I don't put it in there.

1224
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:30,380


1225
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:30,380


1226
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:30,380


1227
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:30,620
Speaking of money, I have a maJAbol.

1228
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:30,620


1229
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:32,100
Ladies and gentlemen, the call of nature's been summoned by the Mark Bennett.

1230
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:32,380
If you're polled around, you are, umpire unless you've got a bill in your pocket.

1231
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:32,760
Let me just remind you, as a resident of the US Emirates, we King's going to give you

1232
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,980
15 bucks for putting money into the bank.

1233
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:41,100
Now, this is for nothing either, or else your insurance won't work.

1234
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,640
Oh, and there we go, theED.

1235
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,640
will be no good following the Great Collapse,

1236
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:45,380
which is imminent.

1237
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:46,560
Yes.

1238
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,200
The time to donate is now,

1239
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,840
because your money will be no good tomorrow.

1240
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:51,420
It's true.

1241
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:51,700
It's pink slack.

1242
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:54,620
Just look at your money sitting there in your wallet.

1243
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,400
It wants to be used.

1244
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,640
It wants to be useful.

1245
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:00,960
And yet, it's just like so many pieces of paper.

1246
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,180
But if you send now,

1247
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,340
if you pledge now,

1248
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,820
if you pledge now,

1249
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:09,660
the money will be good.

1250
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,320
That's right, because we have a secret plan.

1251
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,680
To ride out the coming collapse.

1252
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,800
Well, it's not a secret anymore,

1253
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:19,720
but we have ways of making the money worth something tomorrow

1254
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,940
in ways that you will not be able to.

1255
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,580
We have ways of making the money work.

1256
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,580
For it is written in the scriptures,

1257
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:29,240
do not store up treasure on earth,

1258
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,180
for thieves may get to it.

1259
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:36,020
But store up treasure at WCSB Cleveland,

1260
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,240
for no thief can touch your money there.

1261
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,640
And where your money is, so shall your heart be.

1262
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,980
And if your heart isn't in this radio station,

1263
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,500
why are you even listening?

1264
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:47,680
This is what I ask you.

1265
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:48,600
Hmm?

1266
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,660
It is easier for a camel to get through the needle's eye

1267
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,000
than for a rich man to make it into heaven

1268
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,780
without having divested himself of some of those riches on WCSB.

1269
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:05,240
Perhaps $15 in which in case an ashtray might come that person's way

1270
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,180
as a form of the Lord's giving.

1271
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:10,260
They have lighters with WCSB logos.

1272
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,500
They have bumper stickers.

1273
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,900
They have bumper stickers with Bob's logo on them.

1274
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:16,320
They have baseball caps.

1275
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,480
They've got everything.

1276
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:19,660
Snotglasses.

1277
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:20,780
That's the one that I...

1278
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:22,200
If I had money, I would...

1279
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:22,940
Slovenians.

1280
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,300
Slovenian snotglasses?

1281
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,380
They poke up.

1282
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:30,380
St. Stymie de Bergerac has called in with a pledge.

1283
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:32,280
We praise St. Stymie,

1284
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:38,340
the greatest peonman in all of the Coventry area.

1285
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,980
Consider your donation.

1286
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:40,640
Uh...

1287
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,480
A little bit of money.

1288
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:41,480


1289
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,340
A little bit of lube, as it were.

1290
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,860
This will help you squeeze through that eye of the needle.

1291
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,980
We're not asking you for an erectile lubrication.

1292
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:50,020
We're not asking you for that kind of donation.

1293
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,640
You could donate your sperm anytime you want.

1294
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:53,480
And you know what?

1295
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,940
They might give you $25 if it works.

1296
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:58,060
And you're better off taking that $25

1297
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:02,160
and sending it to WCSB by calling 216-687-6900

1298
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:06,020
or by logging on to the internet at www.wcsb.org.

1299
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:07,700
And...

1300
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,420
I forgot what the hell I was talking about.

1301
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,060
Who cares?

1302
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:13,540
Who cares?

1303
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:16,020
As long as we get the money and stay on the air.

1304
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,900
We're talking pennies a day.

1305
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:18,520
Yeah.

1306
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,200
Like the levy guy said,

1307
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:21,500
how much will this cost?

1308
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,680
A $100,000 home?

1309
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,640
Well, none of you own a $100,000 home.

1310
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,980
You own a $45 car.

1311
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:30,040
But if you send $15 now for an ashtray,

1312
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,480
you may quit smoking.

1313
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:36,000
And we may continue to buy CDs and other...

1314
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,720
and citizens' rights and other things.

1315
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,720
Actually, to quit smoking,

1316
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:41,460
they should get the ashtray and the doughnut.

1317
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:41,460


1318
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:42,380
And you need to smoke WCSB lighter.

1319
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:43,000
Yeah.

1320
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,860
That would be two pledges to...

1321
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:45,460
And you need to...

1322
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:46,500
687-6900.

1323
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:46,980
...sweb in your shot glasses

1324
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,460
so you can poke your blues away

1325
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:50,240
as you smoke, smoke, smoke.

1326
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:52,280
Call it the never say quit

1327
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:55,460
or never say continue.

1328
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:56,080
I don't know.

1329
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:57,240
Yeah, you could play with the idea.

1330
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:57,820
Never say quit package.

1331
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:58,400
Yeah, think of...

1332
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,120
Is that worth some money to you folks?

1333
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,680
Not only will you be listening to WCSB,

1334
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,740
you'll be smoking its ashtray

1335
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:06,920
and shooting its glasses.

1336
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:08,600
This is radio you can smoke.

1337
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,520
Yeah, man. Think of it.

1338
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,520
But don't let the authorities know

1339
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,620
you're smoking this radio station.

1340
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:12,960
We know you've been doing that.

1341
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:13,260
Yeah.

1342
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,320
We got our eyes open.

1343
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,580
Heck, we used to before they sealed that window shut.

1344
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:18,340
Back in the day, yeah.

1345
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,340
You know, when Bob Dobbs runs out of frop for his pipe,

1346
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,760
what do you think he puts in his pipe?

1347
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:24,440
He puts in WCSB Cleveland.

1348
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,880
And you're sold!

1349
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:28,940
And you don't have to be as wealthy as Bob

1350
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,520
to support us.

1351
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:30,880
Sold.

1352
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,740
No, friends, as a matter of fact,

1353
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,180
a tiny little...

1354
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:39,160
We've been bandying about huge figures

1355
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,960
like $15, $20.

1356
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,760
Hey, $5.

1357
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:46,060
A $5 check or money order thrown into an envelope

1358
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:47,300
would make a huge difference.

1359
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,360
You'd get a thank you note.

1360
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:50,720
$10 would make twice as much difference.

1361
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,380
And $100, well, then...

1362
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:55,500
What do they get for $100?

1363
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:55,640


1364
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,280
For $100, Loans and Cowboy Dave will come to your house...

1365
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,200
I will not smooch buttocks.

1366
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,340
...and place upon your...

1367
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:00,600
No.

1368
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:03,320
...fundament the bestowal of his kiss.

1369
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:03,480
No.

1370
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,000
I am not a fundamentalist,

1371
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:06,640
nor will I smooch a fundament.

1372
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,660
I may have one,

1373
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:09,780
one as a snack, perhaps.

1374
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:11,220
If you want to kiss the firmament.

1375
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:11,680
He's not a fundy boy.

1376
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:16,040
Now, there was a $200 cheap meat reverend

1377
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,500
staying at a cheap motel pledge,

1378
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,860
but nobody's really taken us up on that

1379
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:21,260
since a long time ago in Dallas.

1380
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,060
Do you think it's the economy,

1381
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:24,280
or do you just think it's your disheveled appearance

1382
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,060
and the fact that you've been in the tabloids

1383
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:26,660
so much lately?

1384
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:28,000
A little bit of everything, of course.

1385
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:28,440
Yeah.

1386
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,800
I've done a little bit of everything.

1387
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:30,700
When the collab starts,

1388
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:33,480
everything starts working against the protean.

1389
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,520
Peak slack, man.

1390
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:34,920
Yeah.

1391
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,720
Was it Satta who wheeled the cliff up the hill,

1392
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,180
or was it Prometheus who liked to eat his own liver?

1393
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:40,480
You know?

1394
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,180
Not here.

1395
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:44,180
Or Wotan who kept picking his eye hole,

1396
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:47,160
his little scabby hole where his eye used to be.

1397
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:49,500
Right after Burt Lancaster or somebody

1398
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:51,760
shoved a big hot stick in there.

1399
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,660
Friends, it's not easy being a god.

1400
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:54,800
It isn't.

1401
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,100
It's a bit like juggling, actually.

1402
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:56,640
Some of the time.

1403
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:00,800
But it is easy to be the god of this station

1404
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,920
by being the friendliest, nicest,

1405
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:04,940
pleasure to call it.

1406
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:05,640
The last minute,

1407
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:07,700
687-635-4255,

1408
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:11,680
and get in your donation to the Hour of Slack.

1409
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:14,260
Now, if you're really cool,

1410
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:17,580
you'll do it again for the next show.

1411
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:21,340
Radiosynesthesia.

1412
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,720
Think of it, comrades.

1413
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:23,160
As you wish.

1414
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:26,140
Where they actually let you call in if you have the nerve,

1415
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,000
or if you've had enough coffee.

1416
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:34,320
You know, a $30 donation can actually get you a date with Bob.

1417
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:35,720
That's right.

1418
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:36,420
Absolutely.

1419
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:37,500
Not Bob Dobbs.

1420
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:38,160
No feeling.

1421
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:38,620
But Bob Dolchin.

1422
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,720
And no Tostitos at the bar.

1423
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:43,940
This is strictly a pre-functional date,

1424
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,360
as they used to call it back in the days of

1425
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:46,360
Bob's a hooker like you.

1426
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,420
and fondling Bibles.

1427
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:51,420
Bob's just another hooker like all of us.

1428
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:52,380
He'll do it for you.

1429
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,420
This may say something about him,

1430
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:56,540
the fact that it says a quantity available unlimited.

1431
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,700
So he's willing to go out with as many of you ladies

1432
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:00,860
as are willing to pony up.

1433
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:02,320
Use your imagination, girls.

1434
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:03,780
687-6900.

1435
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:06,000
Why do you think they call it?

1436
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:06,480
Well.

1437
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:12,360
Well, actually, now it's the time to say

1438
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:15,040
that you are in fact listening to a pledge drive on

1439
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:17,100
WCSB.

1440
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:17,220
WCSB.

1441
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:18,380
The band.

1442
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,760
89.3 FM here.

1443
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:25,160
On your listless dial.

1444
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,600
The edges of the big lake.

1445
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:32,580
You know, you think in profusion about how little there is

1446
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:36,340
of this activist sort of voice in the radio nowadays.

1447
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:37,700
Too many people talk about it.

1448
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:38,940
They talk about their titties, their twangers.

1449
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,940
They look at their history or geology books

1450
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:45,440
as they get ready for the next adolescent tune.

1451
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:48,760
But here on WCSB, you hear a plethora.

1452
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:49,380
Is it a plethora?

1453
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:50,580
A plethora.

1454
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,740
A plethora of adult entertainment.

1455
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:54,480
And you don't have to use your imagination

1456
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,200
to watch those boobies flounce.

1457
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:59,180
Or those ideas come out and pimp on you.

1458
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,240
You don't need a placenta.

1459
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:02,560
No, you don't need that savage placenta.

1460
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:03,080
What do you think you are?

1461
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,760
David Lynch back in the early days?

1462
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:08,240
F-f-f-f-f-falling around checking things out?

1463
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:08,940
Nah, man.

1464
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:10,660
You're born again.

1465
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,420
Into the new flesh.

1466
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:15,840
A flesh of WCSB listeners.

1467
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:22,820
A carnal union of millions of WCSB listeners.

1468
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,600
You can't get out.

1469
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,540
You must give back.

1470
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:31,400
Okay.

1471
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:32,340
Okay.

1472
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,400
Now you can have

1473
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,000
I believe you should have this.

1474
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:40,220
I believe you should have this.

1475
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:42,000
This amazing new symphony

1476
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:42,760
The symphony of prosperity.

1477
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:46,360
Generates in the mind of the salesman

1478
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,320
before it does in the prospect's mind.

1479
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,020
We all sell something to sell.

1480
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:02,140
Everyone selling together.

1481
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:04,740
You know, I'm not sure.

1482
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:05,240
You get to do something creative,

1483
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:06,240
doesn't matter the time.

1484
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:06,940
He is.

1485
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:06,940


1486
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:06,940


1487
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:06,940


1488
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:07,580
You can call in tonight.

1489
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:08,160
Set it up.

1490
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,440
You'll never have to think!

1491
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:10,320
Again.

1492
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:11,540
And of course,

1493
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:12,920
a check or a money order.

1494
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:16,540
Is always so much fun!

1495
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:16,560
事!

1496
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:17,320
Mom!

1497
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,760
Where is Cheeronic?

1498
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:18,760


1499
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:19,820
Come.

1500
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:21,320
Obbie gives a golly gosh

1501
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,800
and better puke your peat

1502
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,940
on Full Throttle Potentate,

01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:27,540
elsewise your wants will be wagging down

1504
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:29,820
on Mammy's Hind구요 Nanny.

1505
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:32,160
Why can't your peaser pop a squeezer

1506
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,860
when the gushers are going all normal like?

1507
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:37,740
Got your old geisha scents in your sneezing chamber, boy?

1508
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:41,560
Heisting an empty platter in your bean bag?

1509
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:44,080
Where's your roller balls, eh?

1510
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:49,860
I can't grok me no love grow on this luju-luju band.

1511
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:53,160
You're gonna have to spreach English, Jake.

1512
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,460
Get right with your muscle snake, snunk monkey.

1513
01:02:56,660 --> 01:03:01,800
Quit spritzing your plizzerer less than it's snowing white lute juice, baby.

1514
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:05,120
That's why if you're pleating bleeders blowing hot water,

1515
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:09,400
you go blind or please your neether trying not to.

1516
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,820
Either way, you're getting up on the wrong orbit

1517
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:16,520
for this kind of free-kneading, bleeding side trade, eh?

1518
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,740
Well, aren't you going to stand there like a dammy nickel slug

1519
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:24,580
or are you going to plus your plimper and righteous hargany, T-boy?

1520
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:28,400
Got weenie rivers and fluter tubes, don't you?

1521
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:31,780
Join gumption with the true and the false.

1522
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:35,620
Seed brave and peeper bob, man, and send your genes.

1523
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:39,780
Buy out the gland owners with what you earned

1524
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:42,920
with your skinny, peeling face of paint.

1525
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,860
This has been your enunciator.

1526
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:46,940
Thank me.

1527
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:47,740
Amen.

1528
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,840
Well, when did?

1529
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:51,500
Today.

1530
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:52,640
Today.

1531
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:54,480
Bop, bop, bop.

1532
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:07,380
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bops.

1533
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:08,880
I must not fear.

1534
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:09,720
Fear is the mind killer.

1535
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:11,420
Fear is the little death which brings me.

1536
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:16,680
Mis amigos queridos, que quiere en su vida?

1537
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:17,740
¿Riqueza grande?

1538
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,720
Bop, bop, bop, bop.

1539
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:22,280
¿Conoce usted a Bob Dogg?

1540
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:25,880
It's a Bob world after all.

1541
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:29,820
It's a Bob world after all.

1542
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:31,780
It's a Bob world after all.

1543
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:33,440
It's a Bob world after all.

1544
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,440
It's a Bob.

1545
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:35,820
This station.

1546
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:41,240
This is the subgenius radio ministry.

1547
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,580
Hour of slack.

1548
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,800
We are full grown.

1549
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,260
We are grown up men.

1550
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,040
We are all past.

1551
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,660
The age of reasoning.

1552
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:56,120
It is our mission.

1553
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:58,740
It is our task.

1554
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:00,860
It's obvious.

1555
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:03,080
And it's our mission.

1556
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:03,960
What do you still ask?

1557
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:07,880
We are going to save the universe.

1558
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:10,460
We are going to save the universe.

1559
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:13,140
We are going to save the universe.

1560
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:16,280
This time?

1561
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,160
Oh yes, dear friends.

1562
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:19,580
That's right.

1563
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,180
We'll be saving the universe on this...

1564
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:22,960
This...

1565
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,280
Like I say, it's one chance.

1566
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:27,200
The swinging love corpses want you to save the universe.

1567
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,560
Robert Anton Wilson, our special celebrity guest star,

1568
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:31,760
wants it to save the universe.

1569
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:39,380
And the zombies for Bob here answering the phone want, they desire, they desire for you to save this universe.

1570
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:44,860
So, you know how, you know that number. You've memorized it by now. It's been hammered into your head enough.

1571
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:48,440
Hello WCSB listener. I'm your guardian angel, Sergio.

1572
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:52,180
I just stopped by to ask if you were donating to Radiothon this year.

1573
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:57,340
What? You're not? But don't you understand how important Radiothon is?

1574
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:01,240
Let me show you how things would be if no one donated to Radiothon.

1575
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,600
See that over there? That's WCSB.

1576
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,880
But wait, those aren't the same DJs you know and love.

1577
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:12,640
Because no one donated to Radiothon, WCSB ran out of funds.

1578
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:14,800
When that happened, everyone had to leave.

1579
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:19,940
And now the evil preppy kids have come in to turn WCSB into a farm club for commercial radio.

1580
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:22,860
And now they're doing a five-hour Dave Matthews marathon.

1581
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:28,640
Stop polluting my station with those unholy sounds!

1582
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,740
And look over there. That's Little John.

1583
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:34,340
He's a non-indie rocker. But he's not an indie rocker now.

1584
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:41,040
Without WCSB, he was unable to get turned on to underground rock music like The Shins or the Brian Jonestown Massacre.

1585
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:48,940
Instead, he's been listening to Creed and Limp Bizkit because the corporate music machine has fooled him into thinking that sort of music is alternative rock.

1586
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:52,060
WCSB was never around to show him the real alternative.

1587
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:58,740
And now he's screaming nonsense about the nookie and listening to that ironic cover of George Michael over and over again.

1588
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:00,340
And look at all the blues fans.

1589
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:12,180
And I could show you all the downtrodden punk metal, jazz, folk, reggae, and ethnic music fans, but I think you get the point.

1590
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:18,760
All of Cleveland radio has become a swirling vortex of tripe, drivel, and crap because there was no WCSB to redeem it.

1591
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:24,320
The corporate music machine got its way, so now all there is to listen to on the radio is country, Top 40, and Dave Matthews.

1592
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,700
But it doesn't have to be this way.

1593
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:28,800
You can still donate to Radiothon.

1594
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:31,740
All you have to do is call 216-687-6222.

1595
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:35,200
And a friendly operator will be ready to take your pledge.

1596
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:41,560
When you give us your tax-deductible donation, you'll be eligible to receive a premium as a thank you gift for donating to us.

1597
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:47,100
We have lots of lovely gift certificates, CDs, and WCSB logo merchandise to choose from.

1598
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:52,860
To see what's available, you can log on to our website at www.wcsb.org.

1599
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:57,780
Remember, every donation is like a silver bullet in the heart of the corporate radio beast.

1600
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:01,140
It's your donation that will support us and keep us afloat.

1601
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:03,020
What's that? You'll donate?

1602
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:04,020
Woo-hoo!

1603
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,940
Go ahead and call 216-687-6900 right now.

1604
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:13,840
That's 216-687-6900 for the WCSB Radiothon pledge line.

1605
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:22,540
I don't like status, luck, prosperity by blowing them off.

1606
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,900
But don't blow off that pledge drive, friends.

1607
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:28,800
Bob's promises to all of you is still the nature of abnormal behavior.

1608
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:30,400
I'm not going to tell you.

1609
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:31,120
We ain't going to be talking.

1610
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:31,120


1611
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,620
We ain't taking no guff this time.

1612
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:36,020
This time, this time, you are going to pay up.

1613
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:45,080
You are going to call because that sweet name of Bob, my friend, what else can you do?

1614
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,780
What else are you going to do with that money?

1615
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:50,180
Well, I can probably think of all kinds of things you can do with that money.

1616
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:53,900
Oh, yes, friend.

1617
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:58,760
See, if you don't call in, that's all you're going to hear all across this nation forever.

1618
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:00,960
And it won't even be Elvis.

1619
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:01,480
Probably.

1620
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:02,800
That's the shame of it all.

1621
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,940
It'd be the bald-headed Elvis from Michigan, I guess.

1622
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,140
But you're laughing.

1623
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:10,640
Oh, yeah, you're laughing, saying, oh, I don't care.

1624
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:18,400
I don't care if radioactive rain destroys all the fish and fauna and pollutes the water from me not supporting the station.

1625
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:28,300
Oh, I don't care if our firestorms kill all dormant seeds on Earth, making regeneration of plant life possible.

1626
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:29,620
Oh, I don't.

1627
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:30,720
I just as soon.

1628
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:33,060
Get this station for free.

1629
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:41,620
I don't have a spare $10 because I'm going to spend it on cigarettes and liquor and and false slack.

1630
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:42,480
Oh, yeah.

1631
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:55,000
I don't care if vast quantities of nitrogen oxide dramatically increase ultraviolet radiation to the point where humans and animals are blind and we can't even hear an hour of slack with our eyes.

1632
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:00,500
Oh, just compromise your immune system by not.

1633
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:11,340
Sending not pledging a penny or even worse by pretending to be a subgenius and pledging, but never even actually sending the check.

1634
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:11,960
Huh?

1635
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:16,160
Sick, sick creatures out there.

1636
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:16,840
They don't even care.

1637
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:24,620
I mean, it is so ironic because these some of these false preachers can raise millions and millions of dollars.

1638
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:25,580
No problem there.

1639
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:26,560
Well, I tell you what.

1640
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:29,120
I challenge you, Jim Swaggart.

1641
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:30,880
I challenge you, Jim.

1642
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:31,100
Baker.

1643
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:33,240
I challenge you, Oral Roberts.

1644
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,920
You see this hand here.

1645
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:37,260
You see this hand in front of me, Mr.

1646
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:38,160
Jim Baker.

1647
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:42,360
This is called the claw and it's got the power of dogs in it.

1648
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:48,000
And I challenge you to show your ugly face here at this radio station and come forward.

1649
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:48,740
Go ahead.

1650
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,920
Come forward with all your millions.

1651
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:54,340
I'm ready to have a match without rules.

1652
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:55,660
No rules at all.

1653
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,100
One will survive.

1654
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:57,940
One only.

1655
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:00,360
One minister will leave the match still breathing.

1656
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:00,740
If.

1657
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:01,680
One of you.

1658
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:02,560
One of you.

1659
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:03,320
Goodie.

1660
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:05,880
Goodie preachers has the guts to show up.

1661
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:08,240
Yes.

1662
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:12,220
I'm sitting here drinking some Texas select beer, friends.

1663
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:12,600
Beer.

1664
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:14,560
You hear that, Jimmy Swaggart?

1665
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:15,520
You don't drink beer.

1666
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:15,960
Oh, no.

1667
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,160
Or smoke on frock.

1668
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:19,860
Because you don't know the power of these herbs.

1669
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:23,020
I challenge any minister do-gooder out there to show up.

1670
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:29,360
All of you with all your TV shows and all your bought off politicians, your paid off judges.

1671
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:30,360
Do any trick.

1672
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:30,780
Trick you won't.

1673
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:31,560
But I got the claw.

1674
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:34,480
I got the power of Bob and the power of Texas select.

1675
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:38,200
And you, my friend listener, has the power to call this station.

1676
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:39,740
No.

1677
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:42,400
Do it.

1678
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:42,940
Do it.

1679
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:43,360
Do it.

1680
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:45,060
The times.

1681
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:48,220
The end times get closer and closer every minute.

1682
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:52,180
Imagine some guy or some gal driving around out there.

1683
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:57,040
They're tired of listening to the same old music on their conspiracy radio show.

1684
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:59,580
So they try switching channels and they come upon.

1685
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:00,160
This.

1686
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:04,400
They hear these voices talking and they think, now what is this?

1687
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:05,040
A talk show?

1688
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:06,200
A church show?

1689
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:06,780
A comedy?

1690
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:09,100
I mean, oh my God, are these people serious?

1691
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,140
It's too developed to be a joke.

1692
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:13,680
Should I kill them or should I?

1693
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:14,220
Or should I?

1694
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:14,720
Or should I?

1695
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:14,720


1696
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:15,020
Or should I?

1697
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:15,880
Or should I?

1698
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,240
Which will it be, friend?

1699
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:18,600
Which will it be?

1700
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:21,500
Kill us or pay us.

1701
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:23,300
Either way, call this station.

1702
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,500
It's there's some some have nots out there.

1703
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:29,480
I know by definition, many subgeniuses are have nots.

1704
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:29,560
I know.

1705
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,300
They're nots in money, but they do have slack.

1706
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,160
And at least they know what they're missing.

1707
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:36,620
So you've done okay by not having money, haven't you?

1708
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,920
And so therefore it won't hurt you a bit.

1709
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:41,500
It won't hurt you to have a bit less.

1710
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,060
And the money doesn't go to me.

1711
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:44,680
It doesn't even go to the will of Dobbs.

1712
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:45,940
It doesn't even go to someone else.

1713
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:47,720
Your membership money does though.

1714
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:52,100
It goes to keep this station on the air without this station.

1715
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:53,720
You won't get the hour of slack free.

1716
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:55,440
You'll be like everybody else out there.

1717
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:59,280
Give to us something to live for.

1718
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:00,480
Anything.

1719
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:03,940
We need hope now, love.

1720
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:10,320
Put a rope on this son of a bitch!
