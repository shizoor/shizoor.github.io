1
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,560
Oh, yes, dear friends.

2
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:49,180
This is Hour of Slack, number 131, coming up.

3
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,780
Big show, number 10 billion and three, going down.

4
00:00:53,780 --> 00:01:03,360
And this is KNON 89.3 FM in Dallas, Texas.

5
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,320
UPI, Washington, D.C.

6
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,880
The subgenius tough talk in the besieged city of Dallas this week

7
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,820
has been backed up by an impressive display of religious might,

8
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:38,500
as some 50,000 devotees of the martyred Texas guru J.R. Bob Dobbs

9
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:45,100
staged, quote, peace games, unquote, just outside the nation's capital in nearby Virginia.

10
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,540
Despite the scope of the cult's show of strength,

11
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,120
a series of exercises codenamed Dinosaur Doom,

12
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,700
U.S. Pentagon,

13
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,500
spokesperson stated that they do not believe that it presaged

14
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,220
an imminent intervention in national affairs by the renegade religion.

15
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,940
U.S. Pentagon, spokesperson stated that they do not believe that it presaged

16
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,580
Well, there once was a man

17
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,560
The world's greatest salesman

18
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:20,880
The world's greatest salesman

19
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,760
And he had this man

20
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,040
Who followed the plan

21
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,760
To keep the shackles from our feet

22
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,360
And I am all right

23
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,440
He's gone

24
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,160
A martyr for the cult

25
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,820
For the final

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,020
And it's coming again

27
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,500
Who knew that the first son

28
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,360
Was gonna be the last one

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,740
To fight his own death

30
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:53,740


31
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,640
He's got a heart that's white

32
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,280
The gas smoke all through the night

33
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,960
And I'm going to hate me

34
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,820
Be hurt

35
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,580
You know good

36
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,900
He's gonna squirt me

37
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,040
On the ground

38
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,380
And he's coming again

39
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:14,760
Yeah!

40
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,780
Oh, yes, dear friends.

41
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,980
Welcome to another hour of slack.

42
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,600
I hope you can.

43
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,480
Drain some slack out of this one.

44
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,580
We have a lot of news coming up.

45
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,680
All kinds of weird, weird news from the church of the subgenius.

46
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,580
All praise God.

47
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:41,980
Emotions will calmly and willingly surrender each and every negative pattern

48
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:53,720
In exchange for the positive moods and feelings of happiness, health, love, and peace.

49
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:53,720


50
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:53,720


51
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:53,720


52
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:53,720


53
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:53,720


54
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:53,720


55
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,160
And security.

56
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,280
What is the law?

57
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,940
Not to endlessly interminate the law.

58
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,320
That is the law.

59
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,000
Are we not men?

60
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,260
What is the law?

61
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,200
Not to endlessly interminate the law.

62
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,080
That is the law.

63
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,040
Are we not men?

64
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,260
Yeah.

65
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,720
Um, anyway, we create special effects with an Ultimac computer.

66
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:23,720


67
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,520
A color tone brain wave synthesizer.

68
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,020
You may have been reading about those lately.

69
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,600
They're illegal.

70
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:35,020
They trigger a total physical separation by stem cleavage of the left and right brains.

71
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,160
That's cerebral mitosis to you science fans.

72
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,960
Creating a forebrain-hindbrain sync lock.

73
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,740
If you can dig on that.

74
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,140
And that's the whole reason for this show to exist.

75
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:47,700
This is a brain-based show.

76
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,820
And what happens is you end up with two different voices going at once.

77
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,580
And it's very difficult.

78
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,320
And you have to follow them.

79
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,000
Unless you listen very, very closely.

80
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,520
And in headphones, which we highly recommend.

81
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:07,760
Well, dear friends, don't you know that Jimmy Swaggart's gonna be back on the air live in one hour?

82
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,000
I cannot tell you what stations that you might be able to pick up.

83
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,280
But yes, that mighty man is gonna be back.

84
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,280
Now last week, or earlier this week I should say,

85
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,060
they repeated a TV special about Jimmy Swaggart.

86
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,840
And at the end, viewers could call in and vote whether they thought Swaggart should be allowed back on the air.

87
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,280
And the votes were then tallied.

88
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,180
And, uh, well it was a little different.

89
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,160
Last time, almost everybody voted against him.

90
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,300
But this time, only like, well, Will and I were arguing over it.

91
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,600
I can't remember whether it was the majority that voted for or against him.

92
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,240
But an awful lot of people didn't think he should be on the air.

93
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,260
But an awful lot of people didn't think he should be on the air.

94
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,880
And I'm not allowed to keep on preaching.

95
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,920
And friends, that disgusted me.

96
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,700
And friends, that disgusted me.

97
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,800
I don't believe in censorship whatsoever.

98
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,280
Except in the case of child pornography.

99
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:02,320


100
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,280
Those who exploit children should not only be censored,

101
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,880
but tortured on live TV, if you ask me.

102
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:09,100


103
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,580
Otherwise, friends, I don't think anybody should be told they can't print their rants

104
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:13,600
Otherwise, friends, I don't think anybody should be told they can't print their rants

105
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,080
or buy airtime on mass media.

106
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,700
Not even Christians and Communists!

107
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,260
Not even Christians and Communists!

108
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,760
I'm saying I don't buy YouTube.

109
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,160
I don't wanna read fucking Supreme Court records

110
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,200
I really, really hate it.

111
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,200


112
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,200


113
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,400
I'm not claiming he has any experience in the jest

114
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,400
I'm not claiming he has any experience in the jest

115
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,520
I'm not claiming he has any experience in the jest

116
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,120
college old fucking film

117
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,480
his real and honest,

118
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,280
through out the state

119
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:42,780
college used to be the convenient and most

120
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,640
college used to be the convenient and most

121
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,160
conservative prison

122
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,680
conservative prison

123
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:47,900
酸

124
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,020
comp

125
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:57,080
Well, he's homophobic for sure, and he hates Catholics, but he's, as far as I know, he's never come down on Jews or other ethnic minorities particularly.

126
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,720
You can call and correct me if I'm wrong on that.

127
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,680
In fact, you can call 823-7490.

128
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,200
823-7490 here at KNON.

129
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,040
And speak to the will of Dobbs.

130
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:18,220
Dobbs. Not Dobbs himself, just one of many aspects of the will of Dobbs.

131
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,480
But this particular one is the real will of Dobbs.

132
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:30,980
Now, regarding Swaggart, I don't believe in the devil myself, but I do believe that people can let their evil side possess them.

133
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:36,940
And I don't think that, I really don't think that's happened with Swaggart to the extent that it did with the others.

134
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,020
I don't think there's anything wrong with wringing money out of ignorant old hares.

135
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:47,920
You know, if spending money on fairy tales is their idea of slack, then let them do it.

136
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,300
I mean, I'd be out of a job myself otherwise.

137
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:57,200
I just think it's a real shame that Swaggart has to belong to a religion where it's illegal to masturbate.

138
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,900
In the subgenius church, friends, it's almost illegal not to.

139
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:09,700
But at any rate, he's, I guess, the one big-time preacher left who can still preach,

140
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,940
but now he cannot claim a...

141
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,400
holier-than-thou attitude any longer.

142
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,420
The subgenius must have slack, and Swaggart must have his pulpit.

143
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,560
Besides, there isn't another preacher worth imitating.

144
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:32,200
You'll notice that all the pink radio morning comedy DJs all do Billy Graham takeoffs.

145
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,280
Oh, wow, real piercing satire, huh?

146
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,920
They all mimic Billy Graham, and why?

147
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,460
Because they're a bunch of atheists!

148
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,320
Why?

149
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:49,160
None of them ever studied religion enough to know the Buddha from Muhammad or Billy Graham from Gene Scott.

150
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,680
And the only thing worse than a Christian or a communist is an atheist,

151
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,220
because they alone cannot believe in that man, Bob.

152
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,420
They cannot truly believe!

153
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:06,380
They know not that mighty religious urge

154
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,820
that's just one step below the...

155
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,400
final...

156
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:12,980
HUAH!

157
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,160
the final...

158
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,600
pfft!

159
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,880
the final...

160
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,800
squirt.

161
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,160
Oh, no, no, they're materialistic!

162
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,060
They want no part of the mysteries.

163
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,900
They want to think they know everything.

164
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:30,660
Well, I'm here to tell you atheists right now, you don't know nothing!

165
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,620
And neither do I, but I wish I did!

166
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:39,540
For if I could truly know nothing, then I would be like that man J.R. Bob Dobbs!

167
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,020
Besides which, I have no idea.

168
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,020


169
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,460
I don't think anybody should really feel threatened by fundamentalism these days.

170
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:54,620
Uh, you know, Pat Robertson's rather embarrassing run for the presidency illustrates that.

171
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,360
Unless you're a member of a minority group, or any non-Anglo race or background,

172
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:07,540
then you should feel threatened by the fundamentalists, because at worst they hate you, and at best they fear you.

173
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,640
But I'm not going to get into my race rant tonight, friends.

174
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:17,760
I've been working on one for two years, but I have to be very careful about how I do it, or else it'll start a riot.

175
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:24,280
All the Caucasians would be rounded up and put in camps if I did my race rant now, and I'd be included!

176
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,220
So...

177
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,900
I just don't know, I just don't know.

178
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:41,400
I wonder how long, with all of this silliness and madness, will you fail to see what is about to happen...

179
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,500
in this country today?

180
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,980
Hell, y'all scared of Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan didn't win that last election.

181
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:53,860
That was a CIA computer rip-off, and anybody that got any intelligence at all knows they ain't never invented a machine...

182
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,160
that can tabulate an election that fast for a nation this fast!

183
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:04,360
They got you people in California talking about, they figured it out before your poll, they figured it out before the polls was closed in New York!

184
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,620
And it don't take too much intelligence to know when you're dealing with one of them computers, whatever you feed into them, you're not going to get it.

185
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,360
And if you don't get into it, that's what is going to feed you back.

186
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:19,320
And they have such a blatant hatred for you, they won't even try to trick you, because they don't have to.

187
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:30,380
You went to bed on Monday night before the election, with all the polls showing it too close to call, and then woke up the next day into a landslide.

188
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,240
Las Vegas hotel just catching on fire, the last one on the eve of the Frank Sinatra hearing.

189
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,860
And they told us that...

190
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:46,940
all four fires in the Las Vegas Hilton would sit simultaneously on four different floors at the same time,

191
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:52,000
and then the next day Cronkite wants to tell me one man's arrested for sitting all four fires.

192
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:58,180
And then he explains it to me, that he was having a homosexual act, but he wasn't one.

193
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,120
Yeah, he said he on the eighth floor, having a homosexual act.

194
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,640
And he lit this reefer.

195
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,180
And the reefer exploded.

196
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,320
And Cronkite explained that with a straight face.

197
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,060
I thought at least he'd wink when he got through with that lie.

198
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm so damn glad Cronkite ain't on the air no more, I don't know what to do.

199
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,240
Because Cronkite didn't bother me, you did.

200
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:36,400
Every year, Americans decide that Cronkite is Mr. Integrity.

201
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,360
It don't take much to be Mr. Integrity in a nation full of snakes.

202
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,280
That's the truth, friend.

203
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,460
What are you comparing him with?

204
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,100
That's why most of y'all can come off good.

205
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,820
You compare yourself with what?

206
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,560
One of the filthiest, slimiest, degenerate nations that's ever been put together in the history of this planet.

207
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,120
What?

208
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,700
That's what the whole game's all about.

209
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,040
Well, that's Dick Gre...

210
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,540
That's what the whole game's all about, so I wonder how long...

211
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,320
Dick Gregory.

212
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,720
How long will you sit by and let that greed play that game?

213
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,840
But we'll pop out of that one, because we've got some news here.

214
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,600
Yeah, that Dick Gregory...

215
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,540
I think Gregory's stuff is kind of dated, but man, what a ranter.

216
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:23,300
Well, I wish I could play the whole thing, but technically it was done by another radio network.

217
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,340
But I don't think Dick would mind.

218
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,500
Imagine a Bob without a Dick, you know?

219
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,420
The loudspeaker spoke up and said...

220
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,260
The loudspeaker spoke up and said...

221
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,160
The loudspeaker spoke up and said...

222
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,980
The loudspeaker spoke up and said...

223
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,540
Christianity is stupid.

224
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,380
Christianity is stupid.

225
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,400
Christianity is stupid.

226
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,540
Christianity is stupid.

227
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,100
Well, I'm gonna pot down on this one just a little bit, friends.

228
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:10,220
This is negative land, and I better not play the whole record.

229
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:16,980
Or this whole song just straight, because one of you might go out and axe murder your family.

230
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:26,180
This is a clipping I'm about to read from the San Francisco Chronicle of about a week ago about negative land, okay?

231
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,520
Now get ready.

232
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,460
Oakland band's house arrest.

233
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,880
From the Chronicle staff writers.

234
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:40,200
A rock crashed through Richard Lyon's kitchen window this week, shattering a statue.

235
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,160
A stack of dishes on the counter.

236
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,000
The incident also shattered Lyman's nerves.

237
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:59,400
He and fellow members of the Oakland art rock band Negative Land have been on the edge, or have been on edge for months since a teenage boy in Rochester, Minnesota chopped up his family with an axe.

238
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:09,240
I mention this because Negative Land is a friend of the church, and I really sympathize with these guys for what's happened to them.

239
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,860
I didn't know about it until just now.

240
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:21,660
The 16-year-old went on his murderous rampage, it says here, after an argument with his staunchly Roman Catholic father over Christianity is stupid.

241
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,560
Christianity is stupid.

242
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,780
A cut from Negative Land's album Escape from Noise on SST Records.

243
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:34,480
The boy, David Brom, killed his father, mother, 14-year-old sister, and 11-year-old brother.

244
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,220
Authorities claim that subliminal messages in the song drove the boy to murder.

245
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,720
The bright, seemingly well-adjusted young man to his bloody deed.

246
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:51,460
We were dazed by the whole thing, says 29-year-old Richard Lyons of Negative Land.

247
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,000
We didn't know what to think.

248
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:59,040
At first we treated it as a hoax, but the five members of Negative Land quickly found out it wasn't a hoax.

249
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,880
It was more like a nightmare, and it wasn't over.

250
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:09,200
They had to cancel a tour because of this thing that happened that probably really had nothing to do with Negative Land.

251
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,980
But let me read on here.

252
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,180
In fact, they're sitting tight at home.

253
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,840
They haven't been allowed to go on tour.

254
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,720
That's why Negative Land has never played Dallas.

255
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:28,300
This week's Rock Through the Window episode followed a TV news report on the band's entanglement in the Midwestern murder case.

256
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:33,160
To the experimental band and its cult following, Negative Land has been handed a bum rap.

257
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,260
It's ridiculous to think that a song would trigger that sort of violent reaction, Lyons said.

258
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:43,460
The album cut is built around a fundamentalist preacher screeching,

259
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,680
Christianity is stupid, communism is good.

260
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:53,080
The preacher is taken out of context, and the song is intended as a jab at TV evangelists.

261
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:02,240
Shop as usual. Shop as usual, dear friends, but be real careful about what you buy.

262
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,500
No, actually, it's a sad and scary thing.

263
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,040
Says...

264
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:14,000
Sergeant Jerry Nelson of the Olmstead County Sheriff's Department in Minnesota.

265
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:18,400
It seems that the boy's father had some objection to the song.

266
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:25,940
The kid apparently stewed on it a bit, and at about 1 a.m. he picked up an axe and chopped up his family.

267
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,660
People were stunned by the slaughter.

268
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:37,540
They described David, who attended Catholic school, as a gentle, sensitive young man who liked poetry, liked to write poetry and draw.

269
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:43,940
Ironically, the axe murder controversy comes at a time when negative land is at the height of its eight-year career.

270
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:55,180
Christianity is stupid was number one on college radio stations across the country and got good press nationally, including a mention in Village Voice and so forth.

271
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:04,920
And then it goes on to mention all the lineup of guest artists, including Jerry Garcia and Mark Mothersbaugh and the residents and so forth that were on this record.

272
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,460
What? Thank God and Bob.

273
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:19,100
What they didn't mention in this newspaper article was that Reverend Ivan Stang, yours truly, is also on that record and in fact is listed as doing the vocals on that very song.

274
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,740
Christianity is stupid.

275
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,260
Communism is good.

276
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,900
They always leave out the beginning of the thing where it says the loudspeaker spoke up and said.

277
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,040
But at any rate, friends, I mean, you know...

278
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,440
Here are the only record albums.

279
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,000
That my voice is on.

280
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:45,500
The only cut on that record album has to be the one that drives.

281
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:52,340
Well, drove a family into an argument and resulted in these act murder axe murders.

282
00:18:53,540 --> 00:19:02,820
While confined to its home turf, negative land has been broadcasting concerts from its Oakland studio and working on a new album for Los Angeles based SST Records.

283
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,720
New album title.

284
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,180
True or false.

285
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:18,420
The band will also provide the soundtrack for the movie Zippy the Pinhead starring Randy Quaid as the non sequitur spouting cartoon character created by Bill Griffith.

286
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:28,920
Well, friends, so that just goes to show keep your name and voice off of any record albums because it's probably going to drive some kid to axe murder his family.

287
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:36,140
Actually, the only thing I did on that particular cut was was to go down at the very end.

288
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,160
And that's a whole different story.

289
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,240
It's a whole different thing entirely.

290
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,540
And, uh, you know, friends...

291
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:53,180
It is frightening though because it makes you realize that your little art project or whatever could conceivably be taken a little bit too seriously.

292
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,580
Or not seriously enough in our case.

293
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:00,400
And, uh, and all of a sudden you're out of business.

294
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,400
It's a mess.

295
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,140
Let's see what's on the rest of this negative land album.

296
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,680
Uh, four time zones.

297
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,160
Yeah.

298
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,900
We have four in this country, right?

299
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,860
Uh, no sir.

300
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,320
Friday.

301
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,220
Yeah.

302
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,520
Well, it gets pretty complicated there, friends.

303
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,280
Let me just settle down here for a second.

304
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:27,200
I mentioned one other little bit of news before I go on to a tape of, uh, unknown, uh, origin.

305
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,220
We're going to have a, uh, a game tonight.

306
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,400
A bust the conspiracy game.

307
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,240
And I'm going to give you clues.

308
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,120
I'm going to give you a total of five clues.

309
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,940
And I want you to write them down consecutively.

310
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,080
Okay?

311
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,060
On a piece of paper.

312
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,800
This is the only way we can do it.

313
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,700
This is a bust the conspiracy game.

314
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,940
Number one.

315
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,160
High weirdness by mail.

316
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,300
Write that down.

317
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,080
High weirdness by mail.

318
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,740
High weirdness by mail.

319
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,920
Clue number two.

320
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,080
An indispensable volume, comma, is out.

321
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,700
Okay?

322
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,580
You got that written down?

323
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,020
And that indispensable volume is out.

324
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:15,600
Okay?

325
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,140
And we'll continue with the clues a little bit later on.

326
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:25,280
Uh, it's a, it's a frightening, frightening thing, I think, altogether.

327
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,340
That we have to do things that way.

328
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,900
High weirdness by mail is a book about a, a, a kook story.

329
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,340
Well, let's see, yeah.

330
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,680
A directory of the fringe.

331
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,780
Mad prophets, crackpots, kooks, and true visionaries.

332
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,140
Free stuff for weirdos.

333
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:49,260
The keys to instant success, mystic knowledge, miraculous inventions, and contact with the space, space brothers is within your grasp.

334
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,740
For only a first class stamp.

335
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,500
And it's a, a listing.

336
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,460
And a very sarcastic listing, which we'll be reading from later.

337
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,600
A listing of weird science.

338
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,760
UFO contactees.

339
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,440
Jesus contactees.

340
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,700
Even other weirder religions than those.

341
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,600
Uh, great catalogs.

342
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,780
Hilarious examples of religion battling religion.

343
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,900
Weird politics.

344
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,580
Groups you love to hate because I hate you so much, and so forth.

345
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,280
Uh, just, uh, so hang in there for the further clues.

346
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,160
Okay?

347
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,300
Dear fringey.

348
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,580
Oh, this is weird.

349
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,740
This story's getting a little out of hand, John.

350
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,360
Were you really in contact?

351
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,020
Well, I say yes.

352
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,900
But not with a living God.

353
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,720
Our contact was with the things of Satan.

354
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,480
We'd hold a seance, and results were prompt.

355
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,500
The Ouija board was very active and very terrifying.

356
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,740
The cards were fantastically accurate.

357
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,620
And we were being drawn deeper and deeper into the realm of the supernatural.

358
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,520
And then came the breaking point.

359
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:07,000
The woman who had promised that I would be contacted brought me some new in-

360
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,540
Binge of plans.

361
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,220
I'm supposed to go first.

362
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,140
You?

363
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,380
But I'm the one the whole world will believe.

364
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,720
Even so, I'm going first.

365
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,700
I want you to drive me to a certain place and leave me there.

366
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,920
Later, you can pick me up again.

367
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,540
Oh, I'm sorry.

368
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,600
I'm sorry.

369
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,160
I'll be right there.

370
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,660
After I picked her up, we went back to my home where Rosalie was waiting.

371
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,720
And Gladys brought a small paper bag from her purse.

372
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,280
John, here's something I brought you.

373
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,860
They have given me some things to give you.

374
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,680
This little bulb is from the planet Nogav.

375
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,220
It will grow here on Earth and bear a flower if you plant it.

376
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,320
And this perfume.

377
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,300
It comes from the planet Solaga.

378
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,980
And it's for Rosalie.

379
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,260
And this white stone.

380
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,160
It has a name written on it.

381
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,380
That you will understand.

382
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,880
You lie.

383
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:11,740
John.

384
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,380
You're a liar.

385
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,640
You're a cheat.

386
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,040
That flower bulb is an old carrot or something.

387
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,080
And that's dime store perfume in that bottle.

388
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:21,960
Oh, John.

389
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,700
Don't talk to Gladys like that.

390
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,420
You shut up to her.

391
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,200
You keep out of this.

392
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,580
Look, this whole thing is phony.

393
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,000
This is some sort of a slick game.

394
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,640
None of it's true.

395
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,080
I know.

396
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,420
If this is what is making a decision for Christ means,

397
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,280
I don't want anything to do with God or Jesus or anything.

398
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,140
I know exactly what they mean, friends.

399
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,480
It can be pretty complicated and scary sometimes.

400
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,520
Let's read.

401
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,260
Oh, thanks to Reverend Ann for that.

402
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,460
The tape that we play bits and pieces of.

403
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,300
You know, if you edited all our Slack sequences of this,

404
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,560
that show together, you'd have the complete bootleg.

405
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,940
Okay, here's a.

406
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:08,580
Let's look in the UFO contactees chapter of high weirdness by mail and get ready with

407
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,840
your pen and pencil because I'm going to give you a great address to write down.

408
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,180
Okay.

409
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,260
This is about UFO contactees and the researchers who inspired them.

410
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,200
Of the thousands of people who've received the telepathic siren call of the space people,

411
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,140
friends, only a handful go public.

412
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,280
And most aren't really making any money or even trying to,

413
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,540
which is an indicator of their seriousness.

414
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,460
They heard the voices in their head and they took them at face value.

415
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,560
Now, I'm not saying such folks are liars.

416
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,340
They're sincere.

417
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,200
And that's what's scary.

418
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,280
Something did happen to them.

419
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,660
They think it was good.

420
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,280
I don't know what it was, but I don't think it was exactly good.

421
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:55,120
Oh, hi, Slack master Bob Dobbs and all protecting entities from Planet X-Men.

422
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,560
Please let it not happen to me.

423
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,560
But here is one.

424
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,640
This is, uh, I'll give the address at the end of this one, I think.

425
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,500
This is the listing about rational culture.

426
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,980
You have been remembered by the superior rational.

427
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:20,920
Flying saucer cults have become so prevalent in South America that they might as well comprise a new religion.

428
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,100
This one is one of the biggest denominations.

429
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:33,320
It's also the funniest, partly because the translations from Portuguese into English are so badly done as to severely amplify the already psychotic tone.

430
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:37,340
Here's a quote from rational culture.

431
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:46,400
Our world is a bird that fabricates other birds that we are and that here we are in passing.

432
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,180
See, friends?

433
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:53,820
Now, not only are there newsletters and there's Space Bible, Universe in Disenchantment,

434
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:59,060
dictated by the Space Brothers, but the books are actually printed by the Space Brothers.

435
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,160
Millions of copies imported by spaceship imbued with healing power.

436
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:10,940
And just owning one, these folks claim, will cure any disease and even clear your home of poltergeists.

437
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:19,340
The cosmic alien authors collectively called the superior rational offer a history of the universe by which we didn't evolve from monkeys,

438
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:24,080
but from ash monsters formed from primordial life.

439
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:24,720
So, resin.

440
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,940
Another quote here.

441
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:35,120
The primitive bodies were little monsters and afterwards monsters, then monsters, after big monsters, and after huge monsters,

442
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,640
improving as the deformation progressed.

443
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,420
They screamed utter, made gestures to understand each other.

444
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,140
Unquote.

445
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:52,560
This may sound, and who knows, even really be stupid, but in size, friends, this cult, superior rational, is gaining on the Mormons.

446
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,180
You can get a free price list from them.

447
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:02,100
Say you need a lot of information because you are, quote, with the superior rational, unquote,

448
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:07,280
and specify that you want it in English because otherwise they'll send you the Portuguese version.

449
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:14,320
And that is Rational Culture, Caixa Postal.

450
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,960
That's C-A-I-X-A Postal.

451
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,060
Postal.

452
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,800
Caixa Postal.

453
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,140
Seven-eight point.

454
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:27,480
O-one-nine dash two-six-one-five-oh.

455
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,640
Caixa Postal.

456
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,500
Seven-eight.

457
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,440
O-one-nine two-six-one-five-oh.

458
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,160
In Belford Roxo.

459
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,800
That's Belford R-O-X-O.

460
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,460
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, South America, dear friends.

461
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:50,680
Well, that's the first of our little readings from this hideous book.

462
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,100
And...

463
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,680
Let's see.

464
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,680
I'm going to jump over to another tape here.

465
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,600
This is a tape.

466
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,420
We've been getting tapes from a radio station in Canada, which...

467
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:10,740
Where there is a fellow by the name of Bob Dean who is apparently...

468
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:19,100
He claims to be getting J.R. Bob Dobbs, the guru of our cult, on his show.

469
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,220
And I just can't believe that that's really the case.

470
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,680
Where is that tape?

471
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,900
Friends, listen.

472
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:27,420
Look at...

473
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,140
Listen to this.

474
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,280
Are all those tapes in there?

475
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,420
That's a lot of tapes.

476
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,320
And a...

477
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,120
Oh, here it is.

478
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:34,420
Okay.

479
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,800
I had it out already.

480
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,820
This is supposedly the voice of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

481
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,140
Now, you tell me what you think about this one, okay?

482
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,480
Well, Bob, you know, many of us do have to work.

483
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,580
I think that's something you forget.

484
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,620
Because you never work.

485
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,680
But I think...

486
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,320
No, it's important.

487
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,720
You don't pay rent.

488
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,620
You don't have a house.

489
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,160
You just...

490
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,300
You know, you just don't have to work.

491
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,120
You don't have to do anything.

492
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,220
Those of us who haven't quite reached out of Pingdom into...

493
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:05,020
Us who don't have the passport to the ethereal plane and can't just go there.

494
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,540
No, the rush hour to the ethereal plane is nothing.

495
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:13,560
But if you persist in this martyr complex, you forget what Oscar Wilde said.

496
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,320
That the hardest thing to do of all is to do nothing.

497
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,560
And that is the burden I bear.

498
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,880
And that's something I've been carrying for decades.

499
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,260
And so, obviously, I've been doing a lot.

500
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,480
I'm the only one qualified to talk and hog the microphone like this.

501
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:33,320
But then I look at you and whenever money, you know, comes into play, you are the one

502
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,300
who always pulls out the wad of hundred-dollar bills.

503
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,240
And I'm always intrigued by that.

504
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,620
I'm quite impressed, I might add.

505
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,980
Well, I am very wealthy.

506
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,640
I mean, Bob Dobbs is not a metaphor.

507
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:47,760
It's an actual fact that I have millions in my bank account.

508
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,920
And I have huge investments in gold.

509
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:54,320
And I'm involved personally and related to very wealthy people.

510
00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:02,460
So that my experience in these matters is a justification for my slackness right now.

511
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,580
It's just a shock.

512
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:09,760
It's forever a miracle that I'm on the stage here, the acoustic stage.

513
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,840
And you people keep thinking it back into your context.

514
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,220
Like, you know, I've got to go get a job.

515
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,700
These things.

516
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,340
Yeah, Doug.

517
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,540
Well, it wasn't so much that our conversation wasn't completed.

518
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,640
I've always known it with Bob and maybe a couple other people.

519
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,320
You know, you made contact with him.

520
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,240
Because I had made contact with you for a while before we did the show.

521
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:39,040
And all of a sudden, it's an acceleration in things you start to see and things you start reading.

522
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,140
And the importance they take on.

523
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,760
And Bob is a great catalyst.

524
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,160
So after I had done the show with Bob,

525
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,940
I had already bought this journal.

526
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,560
It's a journal of art and text.

527
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,780
And they have a new issue specifically on art fruit.

528
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:58,280
And the last chapter of it, I think it was by an Australian writer.

529
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:03,380
And it deals mainly with Anthony Narco and his years in the asylum.

530
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,740
I believe in reams.

531
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,260
Is that how you say it in Italian?

532
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,840
Yeah, reams and reams of walls.

533
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:09,380
Yeah.

534
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,940
And a word that came up that I had never seen before.

535
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,140
And from the way the author wrote it, it was,

536
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:16,700
I never described it.

537
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,500
I thought it fit very well into how Bob talked.

538
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,720
He seemed to be the person the world was.

539
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:25,920
Glossolalia.

540
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:26,940
Glossolalia.

541
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,800
A new word for you.

542
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,320
Yeah.

543
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,020
And the writer said.

544
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,700
Did he define it so you knew how it referred to me?

545
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,160
Yeah, I knew how it referred to you.

546
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:41,320
He defines the prophetic voices being rational and saying things.

547
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,480
And the voice of glossolalia.

548
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,400
Glossolalia.

549
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,840
Glossolalia was more passionate and more poetic.

550
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:53,680
And I thought Bob is passionate and poetic, but he also does have a ring of prophecy.

551
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,600
And rationality.

552
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,540
And rationality.

553
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,380
So sometimes he'll.

554
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:03,140
Yes, Bob does have a ring of prophecy and yet rationality.

555
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:06,320
But I just, that doesn't sound like Bob to me.

556
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,620
I know that Bob has a midway.

557
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,320
I mean, I've heard Bob's voice.

558
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,780
I've actually heard it, friends.

559
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:17,120
And Bob Dobbs has a Texas accent, basically.

560
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:24,180
I don't know if it's from Texas exactly, but it's a Midwestern, you know, South Midwestern sort of thing.

561
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,480
A little break here.

562
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,480
The year, 1994.

563
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,560
Oops, we've lost an entire generation.

564
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,200
This is a public service announcement, by the way.

565
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,220
This is not a church joke.

566
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:42,760
You've heard just say no to the church.

567
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,040
You've heard just say no to drugs and hugs, not drugs.

568
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,580
Well, now is the time to get back to basics.

569
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,920
Someone you know and love is yelling, help, I can't cope.

570
00:33:51,220 --> 00:34:00,040
The substance abuse ministry at the Concord MB Church is hosting its third annual substance abuse workshop.

571
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:12,300
Topics of interest will be discussed by professional drug abuse speakers and small group workshops designed to discuss and handle everything you wanted to know about substance abuse to a certain extent will be there.

572
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:22,900
Please contact Sydney Beale at 372-4543 for more information and registration procedures.

573
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:35,920
It's at the Concord MB Church, whatever that is, at 3410 South Polk Street, 10 a.m. to 430 p.m., May 14th, 1988.

574
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,220
Act now.

575
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:42,180
Act now or call, once again, 372-4543 for information.

576
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:42,280
Thank you.

577
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:42,560
Thank you.

578
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:42,560


579
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,600
And you'll get the latest information on this anti-drug or basically drug education thing.

580
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:54,040
You know, the fourth subgenius book will be the ultimate anti-drug book.

581
00:34:55,860 --> 00:35:01,320
I hate to have to tell you why or how it happens to be that way.

582
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,580
That won't be out for a long time though, if ever.

583
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,280
I mean, I may have to print it myself.

584
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:11,740
And we do need your, we still do need those bummers description, friend.

585
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:19,520
Once again, call 823-7490 here for information on Church of the Subgenius.

586
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:26,660
By the way, what you're listening to in the background here is a tape from some beloved listeners in Fort Worth.

587
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:39,440
Ray Jerry and U Holum from Glenrothville in Fort Worth.

588
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,400
It's a nice background.

589
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:41,980
Steve?

590
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:51,340
The Church of the Subgenius magazine, the Stark Fist, is in progress, dear friend.

591
00:35:51,500 --> 00:36:03,600
Those of you who've ordered my apipalilagis to all droogs and droogesses who eagerly await this mind-numbing plummet into the depths of your own psyche.

592
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,080
If you really think you want it.

593
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,220
And while I'm being falsely humble, I should also apologize for last week's show being a bit...

594
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,180
A bit sloppy.

595
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,400
Believe it or not, I get burned out sometimes.

596
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,840
I just get tarred.

597
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,620
Tarred, tarred, tarred.

598
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,500
Sometimes feathered.

599
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:28,860
Here come Bust the Conspiracy game clues number three and four.

600
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,620
Number three.

601
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,880
Write this down on your little piece of paper.

602
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,360
At stores named after.

603
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:39,780
Colon.

604
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,040
That's number three.

605
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,600
We'll come back to number four at the end of this beautiful song from Nina Hagen.

606
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,640
Hey, hey, hey.

607
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,940
Because I love you.

608
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,160
Forever.

609
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,740
Something wrong with you.

610
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:56,960


611
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,620
Something wrong with you.

612
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:01,540
You.

613
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,280
You.

614
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,140
You.

615
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:04,520
You.

616
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:04,620
You.

617
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,040
You.

618
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,440
You.

619
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,380
The past will change.

620
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,300
Change.

621
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,060
You.

622
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,760
I will show you.

623
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,360
You.

624
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:11,600
You.

625
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:11,720
You.

626
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:11,720


627
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:11,720


628
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:11,720


629
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,080
Eva.

630
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,100
I will show you.

631
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:14,620
You.

632
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:14,940
It's me.

633
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:16,780
Me.

634
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:17,820
Me.

635
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,580
Hans.

636
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,540
The prophet.

637
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,380
Hans.

638
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,120
My name is Hans.

639
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:24,640
Hans.

640
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,920
I am his prophet.

641
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,300
He is my lover.

642
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,960
I am the chosen one.

643
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,080
He is my lover.

644
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,320
I am the chosen one.

645
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,900
I am the chosen one.

646
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,040
Yes.

647
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,700
Yes.

648
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,160
Yes.

649
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,740
Yes.

650
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,240
Yes.

651
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,260
Yes.

652
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:57,100


653
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:58,060


654
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:58,380


655
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:58,440


656
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,180
He is my wife.

657
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,020
He is my life

658
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,740
with a true love.

659
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,560
He is my love.

660
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,340
I love you.

661
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,720
Something wrong with you.

662
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,080
You.

663
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,040
The first real change.

664
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:55,580
You.

665
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,860
You are revolution.

666
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,340
I am a prophet.

667
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,320
Messenger.

668
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,460
Messenger.

669
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,260
Messenger.

670
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,380
Revolution.

671
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,300
blyah

672
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:41,320
3

673
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,180
а

674
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,740
Dr. Red, please.

675
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,240
I don't know.

676
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,900
To be limited.

677
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,040
Very limited.

678
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,640
And God,

679
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,780
the rotten, the very rotten.

680
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,880
And I have no idea

681
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,360
if I'll ever forget it.

682
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,320
Forget him. But unromantic.

683
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,020
The bird was here.

684
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,700
The bird was gone. He was here.

685
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,200
And now I'm in heaven again.

686
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,960
And I'll see you in heaven again.

687
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,900
See you in heaven again.

688
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,840
God, the rotten, the stuck-up rotten.

689
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,900
And I don't know.

690
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,020
Go without me.

691
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,120
You.

692
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,760
I don't care for you anymore.

693
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,140
I hate you.

694
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:20,160


695
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,200
I hate you.

696
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,860
I don't know.

697
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:30,100
I give you the message.

698
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:30,920
Death.

699
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,140
You needn't be a man.

700
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,540
You need a family.

701
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,300
You need a family.

702
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,000
You need a family.

703
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,960
Keep talking to me, keep talking.

704
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,300
I'm gonna take you.

705
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,840
No, I don't.

706
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,080
I don't know!

707
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:48,560
I don't know!

708
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,760
The wind is rough.

709
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,860
You're so bright.

710
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,700
And everybody

711
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,820
does this.

712
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,660
I'd like everybody

713
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:01,240
to believe that

714
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,220
that's what does.

715
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,660
Well, in the Bible,

716
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,920
they say,

717
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,580
We were speaking in tongues.

718
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,820
In tongues?

719
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,020
Tongues.

720
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,480
I am a didgeridoo!

721
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,240
Disānge!

722
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,080
Disānge!

723
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,600
Disānge!

724
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,280
Disānge!

725
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,300
Disānge!

726
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:23,620
Tongues.

727
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:24,720
Tongues.

728
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,760
Head.

729
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,080
Nails ofע

730
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,760
Holy S savairt!

731
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,020
Baby proceso!

732
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,260
Be careful when you structural lions speak like a sweet Ал egg.

733
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,320
When will you believe, dear friends?

734
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:56,600
That was Nina Hogan's only really good song from her old album,

735
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,940
Nun Sex Monk Rock.

736
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,420
It's a shame what happened to her.

737
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:04,460
Went totally new age on us.

738
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,980
God, if only we could have brought her over to Bob.

739
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:15,380
Yeah, she's actually mentioned in High Weirdness by Mail, too.

740
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:21,000
You can go to her UFO church and watch her do all the talking.

741
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,740
I could tell you a story, but I can't, I can't.

742
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:29,920
It would require speaking words that are not speakable over the radio

743
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,960
in order to even hit the punchline right

744
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:39,200
about the subgenius's adventures at Nina Hogan's UFO church in Los Angeles.

745
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:44,160
But that does bring us back to clue number four.

746
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,160
Bust the conspiracy.

747
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,680
Game clue number four.

748
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,900
Get ready to write it down.

749
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,520
Remember, the last clue was at stores named after.

750
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,240
Okay, clue number four.

751
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,520
The guy who wrote Romeo and Juliet.

752
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,920
Now, it's going to be real hard for some of you, I know.

753
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,820
But what the heck, you know, we've got to try it.

754
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,320
Stay tuned.

755
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:06,840
And...

756
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,100
Right.

757
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:09,440
Right.

758
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:10,100
Right.

759
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:11,560
Oh.

760
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,460
And, uh...

761
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,940
For those of you who aren't new listeners,

762
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:23,520
we are currently engaged in work on the third subgenius book,

763
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,880
Three-Fisted Tales of Bob.

764
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,680
And I'm going to read you a sample.

765
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,180
This isn't really a very three-fisted one.

766
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,280
It's just got one great big fist at the end.

767
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,760
It's called A Cloudy Day.

768
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:42,920
Ten-year-old Billy and nine-year-old Tammy,

769
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,020
all set to be married,

770
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:47,720
and their parents didn't even know about it.

771
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,160
Of course, they'd have to be told eventually,

772
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,580
but right now, the most important thing in the world

773
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,680
was the green field spread out in front of them

774
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,660
and the anticipation of adventures to be had at nature's expense.

775
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:06,840
And as usual, the clouds would provide their share of the day's entertainment.

776
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,920
Hey, look at there.

777
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:09,240
There.

778
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,860
Said Billy, pointing heavenward.

779
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:11,920
It looks...

780
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,360
It looks just like one of Uncle Bob's pigs.

781
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,080
Tammy giggled and stooped to pick up some blueberries,

782
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,440
proffering half to Billy.

783
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,780
I can do better than that, she chattered impishly.

784
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,880
See those two?

785
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,140
That one's an eagle.

786
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:26,680
And...

787
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,980
And that's a big brown bear.

788
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,880
And they're going to have a fight about whose turn it is to reign.

789
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:35,580
Billy, momentarily nonplussed by Tammy's vivid imagination,

790
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,160
was now gesticulating excitedly in the opposite direction,

791
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,280
Looky there!

792
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,160
That one looks just like a huge mushroom!

793
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,420
The words rang out in the afternoon air,

794
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:53,060
just as the tiny couple were blown over by a titanic gust of air,

795
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,440
and everything melted.

796
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:01,340
These are the things.

797
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,040
Brawlers of geniuses win.

798
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,540
Show rally beats polyp tech.

799
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,440
Puzzling evidence upset.

800
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,240
Puzzling evidence upset.

801
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:13,460
Woodman Atwell scored 17 of his 27 points in the second half,

802
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:17,280
and Gabrofram had all of his 16 points in the final period as number 16.

803
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,480
Show rallied to beat 12th-ranked polyp tech,

804
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,980
84-70 in their Big Ten conference opener at Dobstown last night.

805
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:28,820
Atwell and Gabrofram, who both had career highs,

806
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,220
rallied the show 9-3 after polyp tech 8-3,

807
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,160
aided by technical fouls on the show's Dr. Howe,

808
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:39,120
and polyp coach Buck Hinckley ran off 13 straight,

809
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:43,060
scoring points for a 33-17 lead with 4.70 left in the first half.

810
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,260
No, sorry ladies and gentlemen.

811
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:50,220
We'll be checking the frequencies for various imperfections during the Dirty Contra show.

812
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:56,880
The show finally took the lead for good with an 8-0 squirt that made it 61-54 with 7.58 left.

813
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,140
Squeet Bird, polyp's 6'10 center,

814
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:04,860
picked up his fourth and fifth Big Os four seconds apart during the decisive spurt,

815
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:07,580
leaving the game with 8.06 remaining.

816
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,540
And then...

817
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:08,980
And then...

818
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:09,560
And then...

819
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:16,020
Fall center, puzzling evidence, Smith scored 13 of his 20 points in the second half,

820
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:24,400
including 9 during a decisive run to lift the 14th ranked Bohondas to a 62-57 Big East upset of number 2.

821
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:29,780
If it's confusing to listen to someone who works as a one-time, be aware that the show is the show.

822
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:34,260
It was the first loss for D-Town after 9 straight wins, its best start since 1989.

823
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,740
It's just a little tiny show.

824
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,080
With Dobstown 10-1, 1-0 trailing.

825
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:43,660
Smith sent a 3-point humper, 2 short humpers in the layup during a 16-6.

826
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:48,660
That gave the Bohondites a 56-50 lead with 5.19 left.

827
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:54,660
Dobstown's Kerwin Matthews sank 2 free thrusts to cut the deficit to 58-56.

828
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:02,540
But Dobstown's Mahania Jackson grabbed 2 critical offensive free passes and Smith sank 2 free thrusts with 20 seconds left.

829
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:08,280
After 2 technical P's were assessed on Honda's coach Paul Vredisch for a 60-56 lead.

830
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,200
A little news show.

831
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,520
D-Town missed 2 three-point P's in the final minutes.

832
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,100
Yep, there goes Hal.

833
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:20,240
For approximately 10 minutes with 11.27 left in the first half after a bench clearing ball touched off by a fist fight.

834
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,480
A little bit of the show, the subgenius show from Berkeley.

835
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,940
Must not continue there.

836
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,700
Don't know, don't know what comes next.

837
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,000
Must be careful here in Texas.

838
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,760
Because, well, as it says here in the instructions,

839
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,600
for this plastic model kit I bought the other day,

840
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,700
J.R. Bob Dobbs plastic model kit, 1-8 scale.

841
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,120
This is what it says in it.

842
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,860
It's an Aurora plastic model.

843
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,680
It's got Bob holding a briefcase and everything.

844
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,580
The instructions, it says,

845
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:56,740
Long, long ago, during the years of trouble,

846
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:00,840
when all the northern fathers still slept under the glaciers,

847
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,760
there lived the being we now know as J.R. Bob Dobbs.

848
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,240
This man, Dobbs,

849
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:17,880
was chosen by Jehovah One for the primary communications from our alien benefactors.

850
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:23,840
As Bob moved through the stars, he changed the face of them.

851
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:30,440
His ten billion quasi-modalities now vibrate in each of us

852
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:36,180
and have transformed him into the eternal incarnation of Slack.

853
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:45,240
From Dobbs came the unreasoned utterances which will remain forever unerasable.

854
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:50,660
His brave experimentation with excremeditation and fornicationalism,

855
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:53,560
using all humankind as his test flock,

856
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:59,220
resulted in the rule of the subgenius for the next 12,000 years.

857
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:03,720
During his span, disaster followed Dobbs,

858
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:07,100
resulting in the outright obliteration of his physical vessel,

859
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,240
only by careful church superstition,

860
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,300
and the

861
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:10,300


862
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:13,260
The first thing we can do is to look at the Dobbs shell.

863
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:22,060
Here is the approved religioficial bioreconstructoid, perfect in every detail, our salesman.

864
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,060
His skull is shaped a bit differently than is ours today.

865
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:29,480
It is somewhat flattened in the rear and bulges over the brow.

866
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,040
His brain was well devolved.

867
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:39,240
Some theocraticians think that Dobbs did not speak at all, or that if he did, he did not have what we would call a labyrinth.

868
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:39,600
He is a man of language.

869
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,720
He wears the suit.

870
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:44,000
His hands and feet are like ours.

871
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,400
He was left-handed.

872
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:52,300
The briefcase he holds sent the signals that launched the rockets of cleansing,

873
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:55,800
the blessed vehicles of our birth.

874
00:49:56,140 --> 00:50:01,180
He stands here in the wreckage of Earth, his native planet.

875
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:05,900
Lies, lies, lies.

876
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:09,240
From Three-Fisted Tales About...

877
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:12,840
That's a preview by Lies, dear friends.

878
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:19,100
You know, I hate to be so coy about telling you about high weirdness by mail,

879
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:23,120
but I cannot advertise my own products over the radio, you see.

880
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,500
Not on this kind of a station.

881
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,000
And I know that a lot of people are interested.

882
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:32,280
If you need to know something, need to know information, call 823-7490.

883
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,740
In the meantime, I will give you clue number five.

884
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,280
Remember the last word of clue number four was and.

885
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:43,940
Clue number five.

886
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,940
The number of stars representing Texas.

887
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:50,480
Comic books.

888
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:51,480
Okay?

889
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,000
We do have a letter here from a listener.

890
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,920
This is the letters from listeners department.

891
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:01,600
You didn't know we had one of those, did you?

892
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,740
Greetings to the Mother Church of the Subgenius.

893
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:11,580
From Saint Mark Cosantony of the Temple of Jesus Christ Party Animal.

894
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:17,560
A small but highness bit of conspiracy propagandist lies has come to my attention,

895
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,440
and I'm compelled by Bob to inform the foundation.

896
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,860
Many in the so-called pro-life movement,

897
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:30,920
which is actually a mental-wise death cult through holistic lobotomies,

898
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:35,520
claim that life begins when a tiny and heroic sperm commits suicide.

899
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:40,600
By crashing into an egg within the non-male of the biped species.

900
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,420
Intuitively and obviously, this is a terrible lie.

901
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:51,220
Life really begins much earlier, depending upon the endurance of the male involved in the fornication.

902
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:56,460
Yes, life begins as soon as the male gland enters the female chamber.

903
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,860
This is indisputably when life begins.

904
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:05,060
An important caveat is that it is life only when the act is performed by mutual consent.

905
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:06,820
The union of the parties involved.

906
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:15,080
Yes, says our letter writer, life begins when the lights go down and the couple's heart rate and glands go up.

907
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:21,780
And anything that would prevent the union from occurring is murder of the most heinous sort.

908
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:28,200
Anything that would prevent the union of two consenting humans or subgenii,

909
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:31,860
pray they be of opposite gender, is murder.

910
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:34,740
Traditional morality, therefore.

911
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,800
Fatigue from a day at the office, therefore.

912
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:44,260
And the snickering police officer with his spotlight are therefore all homicide.

913
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:51,140
Subgenially yours, St. Mark Cosantini, Church of, Temple of Jesus Christ, the Party Animal.

914
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:57,020
And, uh, why didn't Jesus' hometown listen to him?

915
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,180
Friends...

916
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:09,120
Well, let's see, I've given all my, um, oh, oh, one last little bit of news here.

917
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:14,560
We'll let the, uh, thanks to, uh, Reverend Pat DiGiacomo there for background music,

918
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,840
from, I believe, Pink Floyd, I guess.

919
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,280
This is kind of disturbing, friends.

920
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:26,080
Uh, Michael Jackson, okay?

921
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:34,660
What kind of person, to begin with, would allow himself to be turned into the weird androgynous monstrosity that he is?

922
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:44,360
Uh, a letter found in Michael's hotel room in Tokyo during his, uh, tour of a while back tells at least part of the story.

923
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:51,740
The note, a curious blending of childish whimsy and spiritual psychobabble proves without a shadow of a doubt

924
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:57,340
that our little friend Michael Jackson is in need of a good therapist, or perhaps an exorcist.

925
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:59,860
Here's a small taste, just to give you an idea.

926
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:04,420
Quote, okay, this is from Michael Jackson's notes found in a hotel room in Tokyo.

927
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:10,440
Quote, I cry very often because it hurts, and I worry about the children.

928
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:13,720
All my children all over the world.

929
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,440
I live for them.

930
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:20,580
Those who criticize, they desire our blood, not our pain.

931
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:26,200
But still I must achieve, I must seek truth in all things.

932
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,880
I must endure for the power.

933
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:33,580
I was sent forth for the world, for the children.

934
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:37,940
But have mercy, for I've been bleeding a long time now.

935
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,680
By Michael Jackson.

936
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:42,600
Pretty sick, huh?

937
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,760
And, uh, compare that with a letter from Charles Manson.

938
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:47,340
Any given letter from Charles Manson.

939
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,260
Here's Charlie.

940
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:52,740
My world is my world, and I give it to you as much as you give it to you.

941
00:54:53,000 --> 00:55:01,500
You, but put your faith in yourself and know I love you for me, and find it growing, bringing my happiness closer.

942
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,560
Circles complete.

943
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,440
Love, and I'll see you in the street.

944
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:07,680
Now is now is then.

945
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,180
Give up time.

946
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,180
Come to me.

947
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,300
Revelation brings blood.

948
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:14,100
Love knows no sin.

949
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:20,960
Well, friends, Charlie Manson and Michael Jackson, uh, proven once again to be not really all that far apart.

950
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,960
They're bad, they're bad, and they know it.

951
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:43,540
Spiewed no fтерs with">s, bistRC restriction, and quite a night with no

952
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:43,540


953
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:49,340
Let me write to you and let you in on this night and let you come to me only for good.

954
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:49,880
Let's do it one day at a time, now or never.

955
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,820
Wish we could live no more.

956
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:53,820


957
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:53,820


958
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,260
Let's go.

959
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:58,260


960
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:58,260


961
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:58,260


962
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:59,720
You started writing, you're free to go, rabbit.

963
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:02,280
Take a taxi.

964
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:23,660
Thank you.

965
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:37,160
Thank you.

966
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:12,920
Thank you.

967
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:51,100
Thank you.

968
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:10,420
Thank you.

969
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,400
Thank you.

970
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:27,460
Friends, we're going to have to move out of here pretty quick.

971
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:31,120
Stay tuned for Robert Wisdom's American Music Party.

972
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,400
It's going to be fun.

973
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:37,800
This is Devo, their old wonderful, wonderful tune, Mongoloid.

974
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:42,240
And if you want to know more about the horrors we've been discussing,

975
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,240
you can write to the P.O. Box number I'll give you in a minute.

976
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,920
Because you have to vote Bob.

977
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,080
Vote Bob for everything, friends.

978
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:52,360
He's a slack talker with good connections.

979
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:56,380
He'll never sell you out unless it's for big bucks.

980
00:58:56,620 --> 00:59:02,300
He is not endorsed by any political party, the Bar Association, or anyone now in power.

981
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:06,960
Clearly, you're only sane choice on any ballot.

982
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:09,460
Vote Bob Dobbs for everything.

983
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:14,220
And you can vote Bob Dobbs by writing to

984
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:24,720
P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas 75214.

985
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:25,420
That's right.

986
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:32,540
Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

987
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:41,000
For the most horrifying and yet edifying and enlightening and uplifting and...

988
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:48,900
You'll find out soon enough whether you want to or not.

989
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:56,920
For the power of Bob can ne'er, ne'er be kept down.

990
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:58,400
Nay.

991
00:59:58,420 --> 00:59:59,060
Nay.

992
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:02,320
Or kill me.

993
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:11,120
Here's George Clinton to take us out with a message you should all pay close attention to.

994
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:28,640
I'll let your eyes fall down to the desk floor.

995
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:32,540
Your heart's been dying to ask her for a dance.

996
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,760
You see that

997
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:37,660
Your eyes, they can't speak for you

998
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:39,700
Your dumb mouth

999
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:41,760
Will not take the chance

1000
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,780
What are you?

1001
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,520
I've got a psychedelic warplow

1002
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:53,340
Why don't you walk right up

1003
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:55,220
And ask her for her hand

1004
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,760
Maybe she'll get fucked with you

1005
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:00,720
Maybe she'll get fucked with you

1006
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,220
Oh, maybe she'll fuck with you

1007
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,880
Maybe she'll fuck with you

1008
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,960
So funky

1009
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:14,700
I'll make your eyes

1010
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:19,540
Enjoy what your whole body

1011
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:20,940
Craves to feel

1012
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:22,160
Ah

1013
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:22,160


1014
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:22,160


1015
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,100
I dance alone

1016
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:39,540
And never gaze in her direction

1017
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,300
Maybe she'll get fucked with you

1018
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:45,220
Maybe she'll get fucked with you

1019
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,700
It does not mean that we did not

1020
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:52,700
Trade affection
