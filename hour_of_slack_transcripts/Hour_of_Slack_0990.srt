1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
When the IRS levied my business and personal accounts, I didn't know where to turn.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,240
My CPA recommended...

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,320
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,700
Hey, hey, you're me.

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,320
Lest anyone should have the impression, by the way, that research in this area leads always to God,

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,840
and to insight, and to deeper experiences in loving, let me mention...

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,780
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,480
The tremendous implications of all this may not yet be fully understood.

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,060
Are you some big shot in the Navy?

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,320
No, I'm a deep sea fisherman.

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,520
Plan B is operational.

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,280
I just hope he knows what he's doing.

13
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,860
Don't worry, he usually does.

14
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,360
And naturally, further tests will have to be carried out.

15
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:41,340
Thanks.

16
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,480
We have one song left.

17
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,540
It's the new national anthem.

18
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,840
It works really easy. You should play along.

19
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:07,840
You wake up!

20
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,140
And go to work!

21
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,260
You wake up!

22
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,600
And go to work!

23
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,780
You wake up!

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,120
And go to work!

25
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,020
You wake up!

26
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,400
And go to work!

27
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,100
You!

28
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:30,680
Wake!

29
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,060
Up!

30
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,940
And go to work!

31
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,120
You wake up!

32
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,480
And go to work!

33
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,580
You wake up!

34
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,880
And go to work!

35
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,040
You wake up!

36
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,340
And go to work!

37
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,260
You wake up!

38
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,820
When go to work!

39
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,580
You!

40
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,760
Wake!

41
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,360
Up!

42
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:26,360
Oh, yes, dear friend.

43
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,580
And Stylex did that.

44
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:35,280
And you can get a lot more of wonderful Stylex music at StylexOhio.com.

45
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,900
That's StylexOhio.com.

46
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,720
They played at our Detroit Devival and blew everybody's minds.

47
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:49,220
In fact, this show, Hour of Slack number 990, with the subject of the conspiracy,

48
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:56,740
a lot of it is from the Detroit Devival, including a great rant by Reverend Carter LeBlanc.

49
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,560
We also have...

50
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,300
We have a ton of new Norell Preff music and collages,

51
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:07,640
and the cut-ups of that crazy cut-up himself, Fernandan Andy Lee Murr, plus the unusual.

52
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:13,100
Reverend Sudasana did the research intro that followed Lee Murr's intro.

53
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:19,300
But first, let's go into a live Devival, friends, a live subgenius Devival,

54
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:27,560
ongoing in Detroit at the Magic Stick to hear Reverend Carter LeBlanc preach on Bob and the Conspiracy,

55
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,000
in progress.

56
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,540
Good evening, subgeniuses and non-subgeniuses alike.

57
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,000
Subgenii.

58
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,360
Subgenii, I should say, yes.

59
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:47,760
This is the second time we've had a Devival and Click in Detroit, and a lot of people here may or may not be familiar with what the Church of the Subgenius is about.

60
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,380
My name is Reverend Carter LeBlanc.

61
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,460
I just need to talk to you for just a few minutes.

62
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:57,260
If you could give me a little bit of your attention, I need to tell you what the Church of the Subgenius is about and what it means to you.

63
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,260
As an individual, as a member of what we call the human race.

64
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:07,960
As what it means to be a member of the subset of the human race that we refer to as the subgenius.

65
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,420
The Church of the Subgenius is based on a few very simple principles.

66
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,560
The first of which is Bob Dobbs.

67
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,940
J.R. Bob Dobbs, the greatest salesman that ever lived.

68
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,480
And J.R. Bob Dobbs is not...

69
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,940
is not somebody you're likely to meet.

70
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,560
In fact, he is a man.

71
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:32,500
the farther you stay away from Jeroboam Dubs the better because Jeroboam Dubs

72
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:39,120
Jeroboam Dubs is the luckiest man that ever lived so if you spend too much time

73
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,420
in his presence or emulating him to too significant of a degree you'll find that

74
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:49,720
what you would call your own luck is being drawn towards him so the Church of

75
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,460
the subgenius is not about trying to be like Jeroboam Dubs but at the same time

76
00:04:53,460 --> 00:05:00,980
we have a profound respect admiration and simultaneous hatred for the man now

77
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,780
having touched briefly on the topic about because there's plenty that's been

78
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:10,400
written said sung about Bob I don't need to touch on that Jeroboam Dubs is an entity

79
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,540
in and of himself but I'm here to talk about the Church of the subgenius number

80
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,240
two aside from Jeroboam Dubs the number two thing I need to tell you about is

81
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,600
the conspiracy

82
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,440
yeah we call it the conspiracy

83
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,920
we call it the con c-o-n short for conspiracy but we all know what a con is

84
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,980
and let me tell you about the con the conspiracy is out to get you and

85
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,560
everybody you know they hear that their first response is you know oh the

86
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,260
conspiracy is out to get me yeah they are out to get you who is they have you

87
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:48,420
looked at a phone book recently because you can say the conspiracy oh is it the

88
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:53,360
people that is it the people that murdered John F Kennedy well yeah

89
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,760
it's them is it the people that put the fluoride in our water yes that means the

90
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,260
people that covered up the UFO crashes there yet 51 yes it's them too

91
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,520
but you know the conspiracy is so much more than

92
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,880
in fact the thing about the conspiracies every single person in this room is a

93
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:17,720
member of it to say what's the first thing you learn when you went to school

94
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,720
how to stand in line right everybody line up

95
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,340
how to order yourselves at school which help you stop verme

96
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,180
according to various criteria

97
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,080
which you yourself have not selected.

98
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,360
Alphabetical,

99
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,780
height,

100
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,100
age,

101
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,000
gender,

102
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,060
dick size,

103
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,180
dimensions of labial surface area.

104
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,400
These things,

105
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,680
these things are not things that define you.

106
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,380
But these are things

107
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,200
that the conspiracy uses to define you.

108
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,100
And the conspiracies have to get you.

109
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,400
When they say, oh, who are they?

110
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,780
They, well let me tell you,

111
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,520
when I say they are out to get you,

112
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,040
you shouldn't be asking who they are,

113
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,980
you should be asking,

114
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,620
how are they out to get me?

115
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,400
Because if you know how they're out to get you,

116
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,820
you are that much more prepared

117
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,440
to deal with it.

118
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,120
And let me tell you,

119
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,800
sad fact of the matter is

120
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,980
they already have you.

121
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,700
They had you from the word go.

122
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,380
The, uh,

123
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,740
see when they want you,

124
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,380
they,

125
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,180
they have you.

126
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,360
All they need is the paperwork.

127
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,960
All they gotta do is they press a button marked H for hell,

128
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,300
a button marked E for eternal,

129
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,240
a button marked S for slave,

130
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,700
and a button marked Y for you.

131
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,820
The conspiracy has you.

132
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,940
And let me tell you,

133
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,680
it's a terrible thing.

134
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,140
But how?

135
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,540
How did they get you?

136
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,140
And what are they gonna do to you?

137
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,540
Well, pretty much they've already done it.

138
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,340
Watching TV.

139
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,520
Total revulsion.

140
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,020
With sadomasochistic chains.

141
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:55,760
The gross.

142
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,680
Puking blood.

143
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,280
There's no escape in it.

144
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:58,860
And it's endless.

145
00:07:59,100 --> 00:07:59,420
Again.

146
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,380
We'll steal your virgin soul.

147
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,020
And go back to watching TV.

148
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,700
Gotta live for watching TV.

149
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,320
Fox.

150
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,400
Um, they love me telling people to shut up.

151
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:08,980
Shut up.

152
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:09,580
Shut up.

153
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,880
Why don't you just shut up?

154
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,300
Shut up.

155
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,540
Why don't you just shut up?

156
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,920
Fox News channels, you're Riley.

157
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,040
Fox News channels, you're Riley.

158
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,100
Ultra stupid.

159
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,060
Dishonest.

160
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:17,720
Propaganda.

161
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,140
Puppet.

162
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,020
Shut up.

163
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,840
Um, um, um, uh,

164
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,360
I've talked about this a little bit,

165
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,120
but not a lot,

166
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,140
mm, mm.

167
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:24,840
Um.

168
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:25,820
And.

169
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,180
Um.

170
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,080
And.

171
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,340
Mmm.

172
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,820
I have no idea,

173
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:29,680
mm,

174
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,340
that Neverland Ranch

175
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,240
with Michael Jackson

176
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,500
mmm,

177
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,780
but I'm sure it's gonna be nasty.

178
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,740
As far as I know I was.

179
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,140
But, Michael Jackson

180
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,700
and um,

181
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,520
and uh,

182
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,600
somebody.

183
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,240
Fox, Michael Jackson,

184
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,700
you don't know what kind of guy I am,

185
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,600
and um,

186
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,540
and uh,

187
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,280
um.

188
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,840
I could be the worst guy in the world.

189
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,080
You know, how do you know?

190
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:48,860
Uh.

191
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:49,740
really?

192
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,040
really?

193
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,460
Uh.

194
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:51,760
really?

195
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,080
really?

196
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,360
Uh, lunatic fringe right people screaming

197
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,440
O'Reilly off the air

198
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,460
O'Reilly off the air

199
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,400
O'Reilly off the air

200
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,660
This is the shut up one

201
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,860
I really don't know much

202
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,560
Get the Rush Limbaugh treatment

203
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,500
I'll get it

204
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,220
Pleasure

205
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:04,940
Pleasure

206
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,660
Pleasure

207
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,280
Pleasure

208
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,520
I was stupid

209
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,000
But I'm not a

210
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,700
I am stupid

211
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,080
I am a stupid guy

212
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,560
Question

213
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,120
Question

214
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,600
Question

215
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,760
Shut up

216
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,880
Essentially today's topic is

217
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,040
Life's just an immense

218
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,400
Make a little more money

219
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,860
Why life's a lump

220
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,660
Or another life

221
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,760
What is a life sale of an ass

222
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,520
Who qualifies

223
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,260
Life expectancy

224
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,260
We're looking for individuals

225
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,360
Who have a life expectancy

226
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,900
Less than 15 years

227
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,080
Whole life

228
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,500
Variable life

229
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,440
Why

230
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:32,960
Split

231
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,860
Divorce

232
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,520
We had one female

233
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,380
That we worked with

234
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:36,820
And she

235
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,700
Premium butt

236
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,100
For the terminally ill

237
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,280
And life settlement's really

238
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,340
For the terminally ill

239
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,460
From PR News in Washington

240
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,600
I'm wearing two homemade knives

241
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,040
The Environmental Protection Agency

242
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,800
Leaked fluid that built up

243
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,500
After their movement last week

244
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:51,640
And I'm wearing

245
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,700
38.010.10.2051

246
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,160
Psst

247
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,740
Authorities in Atlanta

248
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,440
Shooting PRs from Maryland

249
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,160
Oh no

250
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,300
Officials had been caught

251
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,440
Earlier in the week

252
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,280
Seeking to demonstrate

253
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,400
The power of PR News Washington

254
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,500
Debt

255
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,220
Debt

256
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:06,840
Debt

257
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,360
Debt

258
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
I would say it would be

259
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,160
Hundreds of billions

260
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,960
Actually it's up in the trillions

261
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,980
Two to five trillion dollar deficit

262
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,260
Alan Greenspan just said

263
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,480
The agony will be prolonged

264
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,460
If the president looks out his window

265
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,700
This is what he will see

266
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,960
George W. Bush guilty of war crimes

267
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,640
Worst ever

268
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,860
The President Bravo

269
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,280
You'll feel so ashamed

270
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,320
This is the против

271
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:28,340
To the Greatest

272
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:28,340


273
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:28,340


274
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:28,340


275
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:28,340


276
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:28,340


277
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:28,340


278
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,600
You have my

279
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:31,600


280
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,140
What you

281
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:32,400
Exhale

282
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,480
Just

283
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:33,480


284
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:33,920
By

285
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:33,920


286
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,160
As

287
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,660
He said

288
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,060
Las

289
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,760
Be

290
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,180
Best

291
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:41,340
Without

292
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:41,340


293
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,140
Do

294
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:42,940
It

295
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:42,960
Most

296
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,480
The

297
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:43,480


298
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,620
Kind

299
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:45,840
Oh

300
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:45,840


301
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,320
Congress

302
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:51,620
The Putting

303
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,840
paroxysmal tachycardia, tapas, dorsalis, pseudoparalytica, myasthenia, neurasthenia, psychasthenia, and a terrible headache.

304
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,920
Wait a minute, one thing at a time.

305
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,140
In Afghanistan, Secretary of State Hillary Swank, the U.S. made a mistake.

306
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,320
And I can't imagine doing anything else.

307
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:11,480
And I said to the President earlier, September 11th was a tragedy of the American people.

308
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,080
And I can't imagine doing anything else.

309
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,060
The hard President.

310
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,060
Withdrawal.

311
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:16,600
Pull out.

312
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:16,900
Pardon.

313
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,260
Ultimately, the President.

314
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,940
I have the greatest respect for him.

315
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,580
I love my job.

316
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,500
I love.

317
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,560
In the U.S.-led war on terrorism.

318
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,620
From PR News in Washington, I'm making progress despite slipping.

319
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,280
A California judge has upheld a jury's unborn fetus.

320
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,520
The jury was convicted of PR News last November and sentenced to PR News, Washington.

321
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:46,560
See, if you look at things like advertising, for example, you'll discover something interesting.

322
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,880
Okay?

323
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,600
And I'm going to invoke two.

324
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:49,860
Two.

325
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,880
Two brand names we all know.

326
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,160
Coke and Pepsi, right?

327
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,520
Everybody knows Coke and Pepsi.

328
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,240
And Coke outsells Pepsi.

329
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:04,060
And yet, people in blind taste tests that have chosen Pepsi over Coke, when they go

330
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,760
to the store, they still buy Coke.

331
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:12,380
It's kind of like people that vote for the left or people that vote for the right.

332
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:18,100
In the words of a great man, an unsung prophet of America, Mr. Charles Bukowski, he said,

333
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,760
when you're given the option between.

334
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,560
Eating cold shit and eating warm shit, that's not exactly a choice.

335
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,920
Because you're still going to end up eating shit.

336
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,000
And where does it all begin?

337
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,340
I want you to think back.

338
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,460
Think back as far as you can.

339
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,560
Think back to when you were a child.

340
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:40,300
Think back when you had that first realization that all these people, all these people that

341
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,180
are big and tall, they're your elders.

342
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,200
These people, do you ever have that moment of revelation when you all of a sudden you're

343
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,920
like, oh, my God.

344
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:49,920


345
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:49,920


346
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:49,920


347
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:49,920


348
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,740
These people are lying to me.

349
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,280
You know, maybe it took something as mundane as Santa Claus was the Easter Bunny.

350
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,640
Maybe it was something a little deeper, a little more profound.

351
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,620
Maybe it was the person they were telling you you had to be.

352
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,360
Maybe it wasn't the person that you knew you really were.

353
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,780
But there comes a point where you realize, you realize the cards are stacked against

354
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,280
you.

355
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,320
And you don't like that.

356
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,300
And.

357
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,780
And it causes turmoil within you.

358
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:29,440
And it causes these feelings of aggravation and tension and hostility.

359
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,600
And you want to, you know, you want to, you want to lash out.

360
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,580
You want to kick something.

361
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,360
You want to, you know, maybe push a yuppie down the stairs.

362
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,600
You want to maybe put some pipe bombs in some mailboxes.

363
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,880
Maybe you want to, you want to fuck shit up.

364
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,240
You know, you get angry.

365
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,880
You want to be a punk rocker, you know, or a gangbanger.

366
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,360
Or maybe you want to be a thug.

367
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,340
Or maybe you want to be a rude boy.

368
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,580
Or maybe you want to be a hacker.

369
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,960
Or maybe you want to be a, you know, a terrorist or whatever.

370
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:01,300
You want to do something because this shit is just fucking your head up and you know

371
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:01,560
it.

372
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,400
And you have this aggression within you.

373
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:08,960
And, and, and the thing is, is whatever you do, you want to lash out.

374
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,320
It's, they already got that file on you.

375
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,340
They've been looking at you because you've been exhibiting those symptoms since you were

376
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:18,620
a youth.

377
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,180
And if you've been exhibiting those symptoms for a youth, that's indicative of one very

378
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,020
specific thing.

379
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,300
You're a subgenius.

380
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:30,640
If you don't exhibit those symptoms, you can leave now or you can go over to the bar and

381
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,220
drink a lot.

382
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,100
I mean, if you're a subgenius, you can keep drinking too.

383
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:34,700
That's all right.

384
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,440
We don't mind that.

385
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,860
Too much is better than not enough.

386
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,820
But let me tell you, if you ever had the urge to kick things, to break things, to blow things

387
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:48,420
up, to push things down, to change things because the way they are is not acceptable.

388
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:48,600
You're a subgenius.

389
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:48,600


390
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:48,600

00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:48,600

00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:48,600

00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:48,600


394
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:48,600


395
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,820
Well, they can talk to you, they can

396
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,520
make you feel pretty awful.

397
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:58,540
But it's funny.

398
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:58,640
It's shocking.

until one day

408
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,980
it was accomplished

412

Our government will continue to support apathy or gangs or jail.

413
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,520
America's prosperity requires drug dealers and terrorists.

414
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,200
They have given us an example of idealism and character that makes every American proud.

415
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,020
The United States is the world's primary state sponsor of terror.

416
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,120
They are afraid of democracy.

417
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,400
Let us do what Americans have always done.

418
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,180
Lie, lie, lie, lie.

419
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,360
And we watch our children sponsor and harbor terrorists.

420
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:21,460
In the past four years, we provided irresponsible corporate criminals capital.

421
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:27,300
I will work with Congress to ensure that human embryos are environmentally responsible energy.

422
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,040
Alternative sources.

423
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,920
And I urge Congress to punish low-income workers.

424
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,700
The principle here is clear.

425
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,380
Duplicate current efforts, radicalism, and ideologies of murder.

426
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,120
We will add to that story.

427
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,600
Justice is distorted.

428
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,960
Not getting results.

429
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,340
I will send you a biological and chemical attack.

430
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,640
Year after year, Americans are burdened by an archaic, incoherent institution of marriage.

431
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,660
Old patterns of violence and failure.

432
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,900
One of America's most important institutions.

433
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,560
Terrorism.

434
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,560
Now we must add to these achievements.

435
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,420
Do not let anyone mislead you.

436
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,160
Our commitment remains firm and unchangeable.

437
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,140
We are changing and frivolous, weak and vulnerable.

438
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,440
Now as we see the expansion of the United States economy around the world,

439
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,240
we must guarantee there is no change below inflation, permanent,

440
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,440
by increasing clean nuclear energy.

441
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,580
We must invite chaos to fill jobs Americans will not take.

442
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,860
Chaos is enough.

443
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,780
Chaos at our border.

444
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,520
Serious problems in today's world.

445
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,100
So here's the result.

446
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,060
Bigger than the year before.

447
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,540
$300 billion.

448
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,040
Dramatically higher taxes.

449
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,100
And best of all, it's time to extend the war on terror.

450
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,380
If you wish, violence.

451
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,200
The FBI must have body parts on the table.

452
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,840
Voluntary terrorism.

453
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,800
Activist judges have been removed.

454
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,480
And I have done so.

455
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:09,760
The United States has to impose and expand an empire of oppression.

456
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:16,240
In which a tiny group of brutal, self-appointed rulers control every aspect of every life.

457
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,760
And the whole world now knows that a small group of extremists.

458
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,300
The United States is seeking weapons of mass destruction.

459
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,120
They're still seeking weapons of mass destruction.

460
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,440
Who want to kill many.

461
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,160
In Iraq.

462
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,980
During this time of war.

463
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,380
In the next four years.

464
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,660
Our country is still the terrorists who want to kill many.

465
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,440
.

466
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,000
Kill many.

467
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:40,700
.

468
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,660
The dangers of ending terror.

469
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,580
Despair and growing hatred.

470
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,500
With the ultimate goal of nuclear ambitions.

471
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,060
Tyranny and terror.

472
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,760
Replace hope with hatred.

473
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,500
Our aim.

474
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,860
The advance of the evil principle of mass murder.

475
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,100
Is within reach.

476
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:05,900
.

477
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving its people of the freedom they seek and deserve.

478
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,680
And wondering if it might be too dangerous to vote.

479
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,300
Democratic state.

480
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,680
Dream that is dying.

481
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,260
Yet we know where it leads.

482
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,180
It leads to.

483
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:21,660
Thank you.

484
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,160
Thank you.

485
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,660
Thank you.

486
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,160
Thank you.

487
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,660
Thank you.

488
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,100
Thank you.

489
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,640
I will listen to anyone who has a good idea to offer.

490
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,940
Al-Qaeda terrorists.

491
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,260
You have a five year old.

492
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,620
The way of the future.

493
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,100
The way of the future.

494
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,700
The way of the future.

495
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,420
The way of the future.

496
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,200
The way of the future.

497
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,520
Yes, the future is not a pretty sight.

498
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,920
But these shows can help you.

499
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,940
Yes, they can help you.

500
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,320
You'll be able to discern certain trails that will lead you to some kind of righteousness.

501
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,240
Perhaps even a little bit of slack, as it were.

502
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,900
In time for those.

503
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,760
Oh, those end times that are coming up.

504
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,240
Doctors constantly in Congress.

505
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,200
Yes, we will be the dogs to them in more ways than you can count.

506
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,000
Yes, it'll be bad.

507
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,640
Apocalypse is a mild term for it.

508
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,460
Oh, yes.

509
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,160
Yes, the Book of Revelation is an alien text.

510
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,800
Those space monsters know what they're about to do to us.

511
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,980
They knew it 2,000 years ago.

512
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:20,180
But what they don't know any more than we do is that the prescriptures mean that they are darkly, darkly referring to the rupture.

513
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:25,060
The cosmic vortex calamity after the beluglo apocalypse and somehow a godzillion times worse.

514
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,940
Time intersection.

515
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,780
Omicron, epsilon, all that stuff.

516
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,600
Hallucinations that are externalized.

517
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,660
Monsters from the I.D.

518
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,080
Don't laugh.

519
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,660
It's kind of a...

520
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,800
We're on the flight deck of the nuclear-powered carrier Enterprise...

521
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,820
Edit, edit, edit, edit, edit.

522
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,460
Yes, it's the compulsive editor's mantra.

523
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,280
...and to watch the big E demonstrate its ability...

524
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,460
Okay, here we go, E.

525
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,180
Bob has four nostrils.

526
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,360
Was Bob in on the moral majority getting Reagan elected?

527
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,660
I figured Bob's in on the conspiracy...

528
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,080
...because did you ever think about what Bob spells backwards?

529
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,300
No!

530
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,220
I thought about that.

531
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,300
I thought about that.

532
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,560
Do you see how it ties in?

533
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,940
It all ties in.

534
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,000
I just didn't know anyone else saw the significance.

535
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,240
I noticed it right away.

536
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,120
It all ties in.

537
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,320
Really?

538
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,100
Do you say it backwards or...?

539
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,260
All the letters are there.

540
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,920
I think that would be all sums it up.

541
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:24,540
Yeah.

542
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,840
Is Bob a nerd or a hero?

543
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,040
I really think it's Walter Cronkite.

544
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,920
Walter Cronkite or false prophet?

545
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,600
Walter Cronkite.

546
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,060
Wouldn't that be wild if it was somebody like that?

547
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,780
It is.

548
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,200
It is.

549
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,620
That would be wild.

550
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,320
But it could be instead of someone saying he's wrong.

551
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:41,840
It could be Ronald Reagan, actually.

552
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,500
I doubt it.

553
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,120
It's the FBI thinking about names of weirdos.

554
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,260
Yeah, look how much these people know.

555
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,840
The conspiracy only pays us five bucks per weirdo address, friends.

556
00:21:53,920 --> 00:22:00,180
Anyway, that conversation was recorded in 1980 by the early subgenius Clanche in Little

557
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,580
Rock that later became Dr. Cronkite.

558
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:01,580


559
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:01,580


560
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:01,580


561
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:09,080
I bet it wasn't the only conversation that went like that among newly ordained and saved

562
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,520
subgeniuses.

563
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:16,700
Before that, some really old puzzling evidence show from KPFA and Berkeley from the 80s.

564
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:21,640
Thanks to Phineas Narco for preserving that with puzzling evidence and Dr. Howell.

565
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:29,260
Before that, Wretched State, that cool mix, was by Norell Preff, as was a lot of the collage

566
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,120
in the first half.

567
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,560
Pretty much all of it except for the one.

568
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,860
This is the first time we've got a new piece of news for PR news by Fernand and Andy Leemur.

569
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,840
So stay tuned for cuts from the new Consortium of Genius album.

570
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,180
But first, more Norell Preff.

571
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,360
The Bush administration and the news media.

572
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:50,280
A Republican hack using a pseudonym to obtain a day pass to the White House press room.

573
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,860
It's not a particularly interesting story.

574
00:22:53,100 --> 00:23:01,280
The gentleman in question also owns several gay porn sites, including HotMilitaryStud.com,

575
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:01,540
and you can find me there.

576
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:01,540


577
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,640
where his naked profile indicates he is, quote,

578
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:10,980
5'9", 200 pounds, brown, high and tight haircut, green eyes, and 8 plus inches cut.

579
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:17,860
Who is this muckraking Jeff Gannon holding the president's feet to the fire

580
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,980
so he can more easily give him a reach around?

581
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,140
Oh, that's just somebody sex-like.

582
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,680
It doesn't matter that apparently they're a hooker working out of the White House.

583
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,580
Why did they let him in if he wasn't even pretending to represent a news organization of any kind?

584
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,720
Actually, one of the bloggers that found it, we found it through the blog, America Blog.

585
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,620
Blogs are way more interesting than CNN.

586
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:42,060
Who is a journalist, and how could he have been allowed to get so close to the president?

587
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,920
Salacious activities, propaganda White House, partisan hack.

588
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,420
YouTube is completely crap.

589
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,940
Typical, predictable, and ordinary.

590
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,480
Boom, boom, boom, boom, never change, never change it.

591
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,580
Boom, boom, boom, boom, never change.

592
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,460
Just keep moving.

593
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,540
But never change.

594
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:00,940
YouTube.

595
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,060
Backstabbers for the love of money.

596
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,800
I think my microphone is completely crap.

597
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,480
Typical, predictable, and ordinary.

598
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:17,800
Typical, predictable, and ordinary.

599
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,380
Hey.

600
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:29,760
Yeah.

601
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,960
The

602
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:50,820
I've come here from a distant place to stare at each and every face of you, the trite and commonplace who watch my every move.

603
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,240
Every single move.

604
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:58,860
I stand before you on this stage to dip my quill and script a page of history.

605
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:03,160
Outside the cage that I've prepared for you

606
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,540
You want to know what is it I do

607
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,300
To command your ear and eye

608
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,440
I have the power

609
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:23,860
Of what is you

610
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:31,220
Contained within the shadow night

611
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:35,940
Where all your dreams come true

612
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,860
Now I come from a lady line

613
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,820
A highly cultured and refined

614
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,900
A mix of mortal and divine

615
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,380
Who walked upon the earth

616
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,360
We stand here now to make my mark

617
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:53,840
Like a dragon's tail

618
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,280
Like the lightning lighting up the dark

619
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,040
With cosmic forces

620
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,760
That did spark the moment of my birth

621
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,360
There's nothing anyone can do

622
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,580
I want to warn each one of you

623
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,860
That I have the power

624
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:19,060
Of what is you

625
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,640
Contained within you

626
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,260
To command your ear and eye

627
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,820
I have the power

628
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,640
Of what is you

629
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,640
Contained within the shadow night

630
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,420
That I do

631
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:37,540
To command your ear and eye

632
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,420
I have the power

633
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,480
Toeres

634
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,440
Loves me

635
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,000
Contains within me

636
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,020
The things about me

637
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,300
That's the love that

638
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:44,400
I have for life

639
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,780
There is nothing anyone can

640
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:45,780


641
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:45,780


642
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:45,780


643
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:45,780


644
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:45,780


645
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:45,780


646
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,520
I have so much

647
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:46,520


648
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,040
I could be

649
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,180
The forget there

650
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:50,860
To freedom

651
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:50,860


652
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:50,920
The narco

653
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,880
The expendings

654
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:51,880


655
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:51,880


656
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,360
Of humanity

657
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:52,900
Freedom

658
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:53,820
The galma

659
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,440
And does my secret power enslave you?

660
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,760
Untrue, untrue, no special force or strange ability.

661
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,980
What hidden magic power do you each possess?

662
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,000
The power of your gullibility.

663
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:45,160
Oh yes, you have the power.

664
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,140
The power of one.

665
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,320
You do.

666
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,760
Contained within your pointed hands.

667
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:03,740
Are all your dreams coming true?

668
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,760
Oh yes, you have the power.

669
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,660
The power of one.

670
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:15,380
The voice, the chance, the choice to pick up.

671
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,900
The power of one.

672
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,860
You have the power.

673
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,260
The power of one.

674
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:19,440
The power of one.

675
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:26,020
The secret power.

676
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,340
The power of one.

677
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:27,840
The power of one.

678
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:27,840


679
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:27,840


680
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,720
The power of one.

681
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,360
The light of the world.

682
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:37,940
Ent完 disappeared.

683
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:37,940


684
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,200
EntRED!

685
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,600
Come face the truth!

686
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:42,600


687
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:42,600


688
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:42,600


689
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:42,600


690
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:42,600


691
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:42,600


692
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:42,600


693
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,600
The best!

694
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:43,960
Amen.

695
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,060
It makes my day!

696
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,360
It makes my day!

697
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,080
So you got the power. What do you plan on doing with it?

698
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,560
Well, that's where you're... I mean, I... I... I don't know.

699
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,560
It seems I'm temporarily flummoxed.

700
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,940
What do you mean by flummoxed?

701
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,400
It means that I will be in the privacy...

702
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,700
I mean, the privacy of my private study.

703
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,660
Studying! I am not to be disturbed.

704
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,320
Oh, but I'm making the curry lentils.

705
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,060
No exceptions, Dr. Z!

706
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,900
Ah! Who dares to interrupt...

707
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,040
I mean, come in!

708
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,740
Why, hello! Come in, step right this way.

709
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,800
Good, now have a seat.

710
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,460
Here's some relaxing music for you.

711
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,920
I'm so broke I can't even pay attention.

712
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,020
I'm so poor I couldn't even give you the time.

713
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,340
Ew...

714
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,560
Hey, Danny? Hey, Danny? Hey, Danny? Hey, Danny?

715
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,680
I think I will. I think I will.

716
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,800
Hey, Danny?

717
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,540
I think I will. I think I will.

718
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,980
Danny? Danny? Danny? Danny, Danny?

719
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,400
Danny, Danny? I think I will...

720
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:10,480
Danny, Danny, Danny, Danny, Danny, Danny, Danny, Daddy...

721
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,340
You know why? You know why? You know why? You know why?

722
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:12,480
You know why? You know why? You know why? You know why?

723
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:12,480


724
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,880
I want some marijuana marijuanaод for marijuana. I think I will...

725
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,240
Hey, Danny?

726
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,460
I think I will. I think I will...

727
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,420
From PR News in Washington, D, try this for all ages.

728
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:20,420


729
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:20,420


730
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:25,300
Washington, I'm guilty of sexually molesting John Negroponte and more than a dozen other people.

731
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:29,740
President Bush was involved. He said he's holding Negroponte until he gets his priest.

732
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:35,920
As a troubled person who could not distinguish fact from fiction, he claimed he was overcome with emotion in that incident.

733
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,520
On Wall Street, 353-26781. This is PR News.

734
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:47,140
From PR News in Washington, I'm not condoned as a method of interrogation.

735
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:53,840
Congressman prices in the United States have hit record highs because of steroid use in Washington and high demand.

736
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,940
From Savage Broadcasting, it's Surgeon Savage reports.

737
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:03,420
Officials say $2.05, $0.15, $1.97, even more higher prices during the busy summer months.

738
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,960
I'm Savage from PR News.

739
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,980
Lee Murr did the PR News, and before that, Norrell Preff.

740
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:17,060
You can get a lot more Norrell Preff from his website at heavyconfetti.com.

741
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,720
That's heavyconfetti.com.

742
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:27,520
And that song, oh man, I Have the Power, that is from COG, or Consortium of Genius.

743
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:38,840
From In COG We Trust, and for a lot more of this band, check out consortiumofgenius.com.

744
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:46,500
This background music is from Tom and Joe and their album, Yellow Stucco House.

745
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,120
And now...

746
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,920
Let Us High to Winterstar of 2005.

747
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:57,940
So anyway, the theme of this Winterstar, they always try to have a theme,

748
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:03,600
and the theme of this one was rights and rights, or something like that, and legal rights.

749
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,340
And I was thinking, man, I don't have anything to...

750
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:14,440
We're so isolationist that our approach to all that is, well, just don't let them catch you.

751
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,120
But this morning...

752
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:21,200
This morning, we stopped by the sacred post office box on the way here,

753
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:27,240
and there was a letter that addressed this very issue from Will Van Bibber

754
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,120
at Spring Creek Correctional Center in Seward, Alaska.

755
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:39,480
And the first thing on it was this State of Alaska Department of Corrections property seizure report.

756
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:43,600
The following items were seized for the reasons stating below.

757
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,720
First of all, unauthorized property.

758
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,060
The book of the...

759
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:47,980
Subgenius.

760
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,980
The book was given to Van Bibber by another prisoner.

761
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:57,420
And Sergeant Stewart's actual name is signed on here.

762
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:02,560
But we get a lot of mail from prisoners wanting free stuff.

763
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,440
But this guy said,

764
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,540
Please excuse the handwriting.

765
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:11,680
I drooped out of school very young and was raised by a pack of super intelligent mountain squirrels.

766
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,960
Subgeniuses are always very funny.

767
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:23,520
My name is Christopher Van Bibber, also known as Reverend Total Dumbass, or just plain dumbass.

768
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:28,840
I am currently a prisoner in Spring Creek Correctional Center located high in the Alaskan mountains.

769
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,640
I'm here because of a little acubating gone wrong.

770
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,780
Nothing too bad, though.

771
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:42,100
I am a devout studier of the teachings of J.R. Bob Dobbs, and though I've been a subgenius since birth,

772
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,040
I've only been a watcher follower for about five years.

773
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,540
I sent my 30 bucks to Bob.

774
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:50,520
Spouted dogma in the face of many pinks, as found.

775
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,780
Some may have been undercover subgenius.

776
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,480
I know you get thousands of letters from lonely subs just wanting some help.

777
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:06,400
Actually, probably thousands of them think about it, but because they're subgeniuses, they never get around to writing.

778
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,200
He says,

779
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,020
But I'm not lonely.

780
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,000
I have the great autonomy.

781
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,240
He has some people waiting for him outside.

782
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:17,120
The reason I'm writing to you now is that I have suffered a great tragedy.

783
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:17,560
I have a great travesty.

784
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,420
They've stolen the book from me.

785
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,200
The book of the subgenius.

786
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,120
They have told me the church is not a recognized religion.

787
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:29,420
And that if it didn't come from the Christian church, then it's not religious material.

788
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:30,540
Wow.

789
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,220
Can you believe that?

790
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:37,280
I thought this was America, the land of the free, where a man could worship a piece of stone if he likes...

791
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,240
If he's liking that.

792
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,900
He'd be given time from each day to get down on his knees and love that stone.

793
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,720
I found loving stones is very gratifying.

794
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:52,960
And now I'm told I can't praise a wonderful salesman with a funny smile and a pipe full of cosmic curiosities.

795
00:34:53,340 --> 00:35:01,740
I, and you, as you should be, am outraged that in this day and age there's still so much religious racism going on.

796
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:11,300
In the case of subgeniuses, because we're a different species than humans, it is actually, could be called, racism.

797
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,280
Very disappointing.

798
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,060
That is why I ask for your help.

799
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,600
I regain my lost Bob.

800
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,640
Give me the word of Bob or kill me.

801
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,420
They all say that.

802
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:23,720
That's it.

803
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,140
Give me slack or kill me.

804
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:30,040
Actually, the correct quote is, give me slack or give me food or kill me.

805
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,680
45 minutes to dinner.

806
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:39,980
Anyway, I am feared that this letter may not reach you as the con may intercept it.

807
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,960
For the pinks have the book.

808
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,760
God and Bob help us all.

809
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,820
They have the book.

810
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,600
This warden has the book of the subgenius.

811
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,280
Total dumbass, Reverend William Van Weber.

812
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,120
Poor guy.

813
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,420
I don't really know what to do, you know.

814
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:07,580
Do I write him a letter going, dear Spring Creek Correctional, you can go ahead and give him that book because it's a spoof religion as seen here.

815
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,660
See, so it's okay.

816
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,220
It's not non-Christian.

817
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,660
It's non-real.

818
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:13,660
But.

819
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:15,900
Maybe.

820
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:20,700
Maybe that's just what we have to tell him so as to stay around, you know.

821
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,260
Their violence is wholesale.

822
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,600
So what are you left with?

823
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:32,260
Well, maybe you're trying to play the game.

824
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,360
You get a decent job.

825
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:34,980
You get married.

826
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,140
You get a bank account.

827
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,820
You know, you're trying to improve your credit rating.

828
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,440
You go back to college.

829
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,120
You know, maybe you're trying to get a job you can enjoy and respect.

830
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,860
You try to work.

831
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,860
You work somewhere like maybe a community college.

832
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,160
You try to teach people.

833
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,120
You try to help people.

834
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,500
You work in a public library.

835
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:57,740
Or you maybe take a political cause like libertarianism or drug legalization or environmentalism.

836
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,180
Or maybe you try to be a musician.

837
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,060
You try to do something that moves you.

838
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,040
You try to do something that gets the inner party to the outside.

839
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,220
You try to be an artist.

840
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,660
But eventually something's going to happen.

841
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,160
And it's going to be one of two things.

842
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:14,600
You're either going to stop feeling or you're not going to stop feeling.

843
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,240
And you know.

844
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,920
If you stop feeling shit, you got to do something to get a reaction.

845
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:19,720
You know.

846
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:27,140
You maybe try drugs or pornography or new age religion or paganism or comic books or

847
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,100
philosophy or food or casual sex.

848
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,020
Anything to get a reaction.

849
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,560
Or you know.

850
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,580
If you're from the other school.

851
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:32,820
You know.

852
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,860
Maybe you feel too much.

853
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,020
You try to numb yourself down.

854
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,760
So what do you try?

855
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,040
You try.

856
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:36,800
Maybe you try drugs.

857
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,560
You know.

858
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,680
Or maybe you try pornography.

859
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:44,480
Or maybe you try new age religions or philosophy or food or casual sex.

860
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:44,800
Whatever.

861
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,180
Whatever.

862
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,260
But regardless.

863
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,260
What are you looking for?

864
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,100
The whole time you're just looking for one thing.

865
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:49,840
And that brings us.

866
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,680
That brings us to the third item.

867
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,860
Bob Dobbs.

868
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,400
The conspiracy.

869
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,780
This brings us to the third item.

870
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,220
Slack.

871
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,380
The subgenius must have slack.

872
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,820
And when you realize.

873
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,380
You got to have that slack.

874
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,340
You're like.

875
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:02,640
You know.

876
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,580
I got to have that slack.

877
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,420
Give me that slack.

878
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,840
Or kill me.

879
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:08,800
You know.

880
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,240
I mean because when you're laying on a line.

881
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,560
When you say.

882
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,560
Give me slack.

883
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:24,760
or kill me that's too much that's not coke or Pepsi that is life or death and

884
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:32,700
slack is not an ambiguous concept we gotta say too much is better than not

885
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,720
enough because too much like slack too much is not an ambiguous concept either

886
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:41,300
you know you may not be sure if you've had enough but you sure as hell know

887
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:45,620
when you've had too much right you know because too much too much is when life

888
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:52,700
gives you these things that are so incredible so overpowering so so

889
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:58,280
enriching so fulfilling so overwhelming they knock you down or they pick you up

890
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:02,460
or they throw you on the ground they blow your head open and they they they

891
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:05,460
push you to a level you've never experienced before they take you

892
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,960
somewhere you never even thought was possible that is the moment when you

893
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,280
realize you've had too much and you're not sure what you're doing and you're

894
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:17,920
too much that is the point where you know you've got slack I mean you see you

895
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,760
see slack is like well let's just take some of the three the most basic things

896
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:32,120
in life sleep copulation and defecation three the most pleasurable things really

897
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,940
physically possible by human beings sleep copulation or defecation what

898
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:41,040
happens if you do any one of those things in public now you can't do that

899
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,260
here

900
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,320
go somewhere else these are three basic needs these are three things without a

901
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:52,500
human being without which a human being cannot be healthy and they have

902
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:57,420
forbidden that brings us back to the conspiracy again doesn't it why is it

903
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:01,120
that we can't do these things and talk about them in public and these are

904
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,700
things that don't cost anything maybe it's a coincidence I don't think it is

905
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:10,200
but these things are important these things that give us real pleasure that

906
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,260
nobody else can do that's what I'm saying and I'm not saying that we can't do that

907
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,440
well I mean people can sell you these things they can sell you drugs that'll

908
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,540
help you sleep people will sell you their bodies so you can have sex with it

909
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:25,440
people can people can you got a drugstore in the world by laxatives but

910
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,140
the fact of the matter is a good satisfying shit or a good satisfying

911
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:35,380
fuck or a good satisfying sleep is something that you cannot pay money for

912
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,040
because those things embody true slack

913
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,540
And they take those things away from you from the minute you're born.

914
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,920
They want you to sleep by their schedule.

915
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,680
They want you to eat by their schedule.

916
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,360
Defecate by their schedule.

917
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,220
And they want you to fuck by their schedule.

918
00:40:53,360 --> 00:41:04,980
And these are things that are your right as a human being, as a homo sapien, as a primate, as a biped, as a mammal, as an animal, as a living entity.

919
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,100
These are your right.

920
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,560
The conspiracy tries to take those things away from you.

921
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,240
But there comes a point where you gotta have those things.

922
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:21,220
When you say give me slack or kill me, you lay that shit on the line.

923
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,240
Hub.

924
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,020
Hub.

925
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:28,840
Bob.

926
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:29,760
Hub.

927
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,340
Bob.

928
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,160
Hub.

929
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,380
Bob.

930
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:33,980
Hub.

931
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:33,980


932
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:33,980


933
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:34,920
Hub.

934
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:35,640
Hub.

935
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,760
Einstein likes to gamble.

936
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,800
Addicted to it.

937
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,820
Thrill of the risk.

938
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,260
Sick.

939
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,360
Some fear and loathing.

940
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,440
Dumb judges.

941
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,720
Genetic flukes.

942
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,240
Elements beyond your control.

943
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,360
Einstein has shown great talent.

944
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,700
Bullmaster from stud.

945
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,520
Large, but not giant.

946
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,420
Large and small.

947
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,380
That Marilyn was scared to death.

948
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:58,020
She prefers to spend her social life with those who are not pink.

949
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:58,440
Me.

950
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:58,860
What?

951
00:41:59,120 --> 00:41:59,640
What?

952
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,060
What?

953
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:00,280
What?

954
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:00,540
What?

955
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:00,720
What?

956
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:00,860
What?

957
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,540
Ah, those who are not pink.

958
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,220
I hope you are among that number, my friend.

959
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,400
Ah, I'm one of them now.

960
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:10,580
What?

961
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,060
Step in the back for this here, cat.

962
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,240
Oh, no, I don't think.

963
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:15,860
Embarrassing.

964
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,300
You know.

965
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,720
I don't know what that means, but anyway, it's still hot and we'll be back in just a moment.

966
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,800
From PR News in Washington, I'm charged with crimes against humanity.

967
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:32,000
Officials say they are investigating, but do not complain about PR News in Washington.

968
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:35,540
The White House says the president will veto his desk.

969
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,940
Home styles promoter Martha Stewart showed video of the Michael Jackson molestation to

970
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:41,540
the U.S.

971
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,940
Today, the Senate denounced the United States for PR News in Washington.

972
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:51,960
Rarely, if ever, has a convicted felon gotten such a welcome home for business and shopping.

973
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,220
Here's my poncho.

974
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,940
Here's my poncho.

975
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,820
Now, is that a real poncho or is that a Sears poncho?

976
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,100
Regret everything.

977
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,380
We love watching somebody go down.

978
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,140
Yes, I am.

979
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,600
Thank you very much.

980
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,240
Thank you for the opportunity.

981
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,500
I'm on the site.

982
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,920
Here's my poncho.

983
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:10,920


984
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:15,860
Now, is that a real poncho or is that a Sears poncho?

985
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,480
Don't you know you could make more money as a butcher?

986
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,740
So don't you waste your time on me.

987
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,260
Regret everything.

988
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:26,220
Don't waste it.

989
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:29,780
Don't waste your time on me.

990
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,800
Shut down.

991
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,120
Regret everything.

992
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,900
From PR News in Washington, I'm Judge Judy.

993
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,420
I'm not being truthful about the contents of PR News.

994
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:49,100
Bulgarian officials voted a dangerous mix of corrosive, corroded Bulgarians when Bulgarians

995
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:53,500
fired warning shots in an effort to stop old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old Bulgarians

996
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,340
last Friday.

997
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:54,740
Oh, man.

998
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:59,960
Lebanon's President Bush releasing a cloud of orange Bulgarians over his close ally,

999
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,280
PR News, Washington.

1000
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:07,000
Ali Mer did that, and before that, Norel Pref, and also a little bit of our old media barrage

1001
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,720
number three.

1002
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,140
Subgenius Media Barrage number three.

1003
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:15,880
And WCSB Live recordings from Cleveland with Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1004
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:20,580
And now back to Detroit for this live revival in progress.

1005
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:25,820
Anyway, dear friends, I'm Reverend Ivan Stang.

1006
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,280
And I work for that man, J.R.

1007
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,560
Bob Dawes.

1008
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:38,120
Could I possibly hear a praise Bob in this place?

1009
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,660
A praise Bob!

1010
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:47,980
Oh, you sound like the kind of religious fanatics we need.

1011
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,560
Actually, I'm a religious fanatic.

1012
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:50,560


1013
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:50,560


1014
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:50,560


1015
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:50,560


1016
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:50,560


1017
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,500
Actually, we're not looking for religious fanatics, we're looking for rich idiots.

1018
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,640
We've got all the religious...

1019
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,420
We've got enough religious fanatics!

00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:12,580
Tune us in on the radio, we got charisma, we got style.

1061
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:17,140

00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:20,880

1065
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,600
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.

1066
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,480
The Pink Boys.

1067
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,360
There's only one thing you need to know about this religion.

1068
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,380
It only has one rule, one law.

1069
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,020
And that is this man.

1070
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:56,240
He's right.

1071
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,620
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

1072
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,120
That is the only...

1073
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,760
Now, does that mean the Church of the Choke Genius is a joke?

1074
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,680
Well, among other things, yes, it is a joke.

1075
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:11,700
Does that mean it's not the ultimate conspiracy to take over the conspiracy?

1076
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:12,900
No, it doesn't mean that.

1077
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,540
It could still be that.

1078
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:15,760
Why not both?

1079
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,320
Generalization is a powerful tool, just like anything.

1080
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,400
Generalization allows me to just estimate.

1081
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:30,940
But I would say that many people in this room have had something of a negative experience with religion.

1082
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:32,500
You know?

1083
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,780
I mean, I don't know that about you personally.

1084
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:40,540
I just know that about every human being that I've ever met has had a negative experience with religion.

1085
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,140
Well, let me tell you something.

1086
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,040
Jesus Christ died when he was 33 years old.

1087
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:48,180
And...

1088
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,220
All right, it's your time.

1089
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:51,020
Come on up.

1090
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:51,980
We've got to cross out back.

1091
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:56,080
Now, actually, Jesus Christ died when he was 33 years old.

1092
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,540
And let me tell you, his religion didn't take off for years.

1093
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:01,880
Muhammad.

1094
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:07,500
When he died, Islam had only just begun.

1095
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:08,660
Buddha.

1096
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:09,720
Same thing.

1097
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,560
Just beginning.

1098
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,520
Bob Dobbs died in 1985.

1099
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:13,360
1984.

1100
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:14,940
Okay?

1101
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,340
1984, this man was assassinated by a lone gunman.

1102
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,700
I assure you, he was a lone gunman.

1103
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:21,800
Trust me.

1104
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,060
1984.

1105
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:25,540
1984.

1106
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,700
Only 21 years since that man died.

1107
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,360
This is your chance to get in on the ground level of this religion.

1108
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,380
This religion is just taking off.

1109
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,620
And maybe you've had some bad experiences with religion.

1110
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:41,380
Well, let me tell you, this is not like the religions you're used to because we give you the opportunity.

1111
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,160
We don't tell you what to believe.

1112
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,680
We give you the opportunity to pull the wool over your own eyes.

1113
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,180
We don't do it for you.

1114
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,220
30 bucks and you can do it for yourself.

1115
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:05,420
You know, if you want to form Zoastrians for Krishna, subgeniusclutch3627, you go right ahead.

1116
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:08,480
And we'll be right there with you.

1117
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:14,700
This is your chance to make your own thing.

1118
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,760
All we ask is $30.

1119
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:17,680
Very simple.

1120
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:18,480
And you know what?

1121
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:22,840
If it all goes horribly wrong in the very end.

1122
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:26,240
If everything just goes to utter crap.

1123
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:32,320
You've got to triple your money back guarantee.

1124
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,100
How good of a deal is that?

1125
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:37,200
You know, because it's like anything.

1126
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:45,840
You know, whether you're selling drugs, whether you're selling hot stereos, whether you're selling organs or fetal tissue or lamb.

1127
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:49,100
If you've got good shit, it's not hard to sell.

1128
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:52,140
Let me tell you, I've got some good shit for you.

1129
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:52,900
I've got some.

1130
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,360
Really, really good stuff.

1131
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:55,920
I've got the Church of the Subgenius.

1132
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,340
All it's going to cost you is $30.

1133
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:01,700
Eternal salvation for $30.

1134
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:04,200
You know, I mean, this is like rock and roll.

1135
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,320
So you say you want to be a rock and roll star.

1136
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,860
Well, listen close to what I say.

1137
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,140
Get yourself an electric guitar.

1138
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,480
Take some time to learn how to play.

1139
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:12,940
Well, let me tell you, this is like the Church of the Subgenius.

1140
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:14,100
You want to be something?

1141
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:17,480
Pay $30 and you are in on the ground level.

1142
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,940
This church is less than three decades old.

1143
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:21,240
We're still babies.

1144
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:30,920
St. Paul, who defined Christianity for 2,000 years, never even met the man his religion was based on.

1145
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:36,420
For $30, you can be a member of the Church of the Subgenius.

1146
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,240
It's very simple.

1147
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:40,800
You spend $30 a night drinking alcohol.

1148
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,000
Walk over there.

1149
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:49,000
Buy yourself a membership to the Church of the Subgenius.

1150
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,560
They'll give you a full ordainment packet.

1151
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:54,940
They'll give you pamphlet number one, which outlines all the precepts of the religion.

1152
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:58,480
Pamphlet number two, which elaborates on those precepts.

1153
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,620
This is it.

1154
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:03,020
This is the 21st century.

1155
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,200
We're done with all that other shit.

1156
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,600
This is the future right now.

1157
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:09,980
You want ion-driven jetpacks?

1158
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,980
Join the Church of the Subgenius.

1159
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,380
You want cold fusion at room temperature?

1160
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:18,420
Join the Church of the Subgenius.

1161
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,520
You want life after death?

1162
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:21,220
Join the Church of the Subgenius.

1163
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:28,500
You want to have sex with crazed aliens that have body parts you can't even imagine?

1164
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,380
Join the Church of the Subgenius.

1165
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,820
You get to go to a festival that will blow your mind.

1166
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,300
And other creatures may blow other parts of you as well.

1167
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:38,920
This is the Church of the Subgenius.

1168
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,100
We're not afraid of shit.

1169
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,700
This is the real thing.

1170
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:44,540
Come on.

1171
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:50,980
But really, if you want to know about the Church of the Subgenius,

1172
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:55,060
just think about what you've always wanted your religion to be.

1173
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,500
And you're right there.

1174
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,780
The greatest thing about the Church of the Subgenius,

1175
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:08,180
the very most wonderful thing about the whole church is,

1176
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:13,300
Bob is not the answer and neither is anything else.

1177
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,600
You are free.

1178
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,520
As of this moment, I'm a holy man, okay?

1179
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,520
A reverend.

1180
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:19,320
I've been ordained.

1181
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,880
Therefore, I have the right.

1182
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,400
To tell you right now.

1183
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:28,940
From this moment on, you may now do anything you please.

1184
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:31,200
Praise Bob.

1185
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,460
Praise Bob.

1186
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,680
Praise Bob.

1187
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:37,500
Praise fucking goddamn Bob.

1188
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:40,360
Friends, I got one last thing to say.

1189
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,920
And it won't take long.

1190
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:47,220
But J.R. Bob Dobson been here, took a good shit and gone.

1191
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:48,480
Yeah.

1192
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:11,260
And he is the kumroon.

1193
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:12,900
He's going to tell you.

1194
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:15,100
Well, then to…

1195
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:15,460
There is one after that,

1196
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:18,860
and you're going to start talking about self- strife at our temple.

1197
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:19,320


1198
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:19,720
Ask him if he modest you for even seeing,

1199
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:19,720


1200
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:20,740
if that's…

1201
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:20,860
Something else.

1202
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:20,860


1203
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:20,860


1204
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:20,860


1205
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:20,860


1206
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:27,180
I am thoroughly ashamed of KSJZ right now.

1207
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,400
You know, I'm getting strong trance indications from this man

1208
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,800
that he was the high liar of Baghdad at one time.

1209
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,940
I'm not interested in you.

1210
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,140
In your past life?

1211
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:44,200
I don't know what I think about this sick, sick, sick program that you're putting on here.

1212
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,220
Well, that's...

1213
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,520
KSJZ as of now, this is terrible.

1214
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,720
You don't believe people should start their own cult if they want to?

1215
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:54,300
People.

1216
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,520
I mean, yeah, people, yeah.

1217
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:00,880
But not this is the most thing I've ever heard of.

1218
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:03,060
Okay, well, thank you for your opinion.

1219
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:03,920
Thanks a lot.

1220
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:08,480
Well, apparently there's somebody out there who is not a subgenius.

1221
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,160
He wasn't able to figure this whole thing out.

1222
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,680
I think he recognizes that we're beyond human.

1223
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:13,740
That's right.

1224
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:14,440
I see.

1225
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,120
Above or below, it matters not.

1226
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:17,880
Okay.

1227
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:22,100
J.R. Bob Dobbs established the Church of the Subgenius,

1228
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,200
and he gave us a very specific call.

1229
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:30,540
He said, eternal salvation for $30 or triple your money back.

1230
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:34,760
You can walk over to that table back there in the corner,

1231
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,340
and they will take $30.

1232
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:39,320
They'll give you a membership packet which contains the means by which

1233
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:43,140
you can be ordained as a minister of the Church of the Subgenius.

1234
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,800
$30, triple your money back.

1235
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,540
If we're wrong.

1236
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:54,960
And let me tell you, I study religion.

1237
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,880
I've spent most of my life studying religion.

1238
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,780
I grew up amongst a small sect known as Quakers for Satan.

1239
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:06,100
And let me tell you, I've studied all the religions in the world,

1240
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,340
and not one of them offers you a money-back guarantee.

1241
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,660
They'll take your money, but they will offer you nothing in return.

1242
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:13,920
And this is where the church of the subgenius differs,

1243
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:16,760
because we are not a non-profit organization.

1244
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,440
We are centered around one thing.

1245
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:21,100
And one thing alone, patriot, psychotic, anarcho-materialism.

1246
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:22,740
We are in it for the dollar.

1247
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,980
$30 to be specific.

1248
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,540
$30 for eternal salvation for triple your money back.

1249
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,940
Not one religion offers you that very thing.

1250
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,680
What are they afraid of?

1251
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,960
From PR News in Washington, I'm still unknown.

1252
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:42,660
The BBC's Kapke, the Arnskull.

1253
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:45,300
Violent love, little rem of the extat.

1254
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,760
In Ghana, three people could rise.

1255
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:52,380
The Bush administration caused the blast, and should get extra terrorists.

1256
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:56,500
Many Christians around the world are observing Jesus via video.

1257
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:00,020
Federal agents say, you're listening to PR News.

1258
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,740
Even though we're leaving the air at this time,

1259
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:05,000
you may still phone in any prayer request you may have.

1260
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,580
Kill me. Kill me.

1261
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,560
No, kill me.

1262
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:13,420
This has been a presentation of the preservation of Borboring Me.

1263
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:15,980
What is the main attraction?

1264
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:22,920
It is the power of God!

1265
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:22,920


1266
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,040
Oh, yes dear friends.

1267
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:31,700
It's a tiresome, tiresome trade, to be master of so many lives.

1268
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:33,640
Ahahaha!!

1269
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:36,260
Don't forget to clip with those hairy toenails.

1270
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:41,520
And you've been listening to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.

1271
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:48,400
Brought to you by the Church of the Subgenius, with WCSB and all our many helpers and friendly

1272
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:50,740
other stations

1273
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:51,680
and monsters.

1274
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,900
They've been psychically ravaged.

1275
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,100
Okay, okay.

1276
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:58,960
So I guess we'll go out with the amino acids

1277
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,220
or something.

1278
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:00,940
How's that?

1279
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,720
Yeah, amino acids, amino acids.

1280
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:06,440
Well, now shouldn't we play this?

1281
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,580
Now it's very presumptuous of us to believe

1282
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:10,960
that Martians are going to be any different than we are.

1283
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,380
It's merely a freak in their genetic code

1284
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,240
that has brought them to this planet.

1285
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,420
And I'm sure they don't plan to harm us.

1286
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:18,800
Well, at least not yet.

1287
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,880
I don't know.

1288
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:23,580
I don't know.

1289
00:59:54,180 --> 01:00:00,440
I don't know.

1290
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:18,840
I don't know.

1291
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:19,080
I don't know.

1292
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:22,180
I don't know.

1293
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:22,180


1294
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:23,520
Some job that driver's got.

1295
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,360
Shipping atomic bombs around.

1296
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:26,580
It's not a bomb.

1297
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:28,540
It's a nuclear device for civil use.

1298
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,440
What's the difference?

1299
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:32,380
Well, I'm afraid it's goodbye.

1300
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:33,800
Goodbye.

1301
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:38,780
Goodbye.

1302
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:48,520
Bye.

1303
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:48,560
Goodbye.

1304
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:49,140
Bye.

1305
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:51,640
Goodbye.

1306
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:52,200
Goodbye.

1307
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:53,820
Goodbye.

1308
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:55,140
Goodbye.

1309
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:56,780
Goodbye.

1310
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:57,820
Goodbye.

1311
01:00:58,540 --> 01:00:59,760
Goodbye.

1312
01:00:59,760 --> 01:00:59,760


1313
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:00,560
Goodbye.

1314
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:03,080
Goodbye.

1315
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:03,780
Goodbye.

1316
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:04,720
Goodbye.

1317
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:04,820


1318
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,500
Goodbye.

1319
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:06,520
Goodbye.

1320
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:06,520


1321
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:06,520


1322
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:06,520


1323
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:13,280
Goodbye.
