1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
The adventures of this famous alcoholic detective.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,560
The choice of men who stay that way throughout the day.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,700
Brought to you by the Subgenius.

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,520
Our all-star watch.

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,140
Again and again throughout the day.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,100
They're coming!

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,500
Well, we're back on the air here at Subcon 06.

8
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:33,540
And the crowd is just beginning to simmer and percolate.

9
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,200
Show a little movement, a little bubbling movement around the edges.

10
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,260
As a sheet of steam rises from the hitherto quiescent mass.

11
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,440
And it's beautiful spring weather.

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,440
The morning rains have largely disappeared from the retreat.

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,080
The historic Brushwood campground.

14
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,780
Nestled in the midst of Amish and Hutterite farms.

15
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,800
In scenic western New York State.

16
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,520
And it looks like the Subgenius powwow.

17
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,260
May be heading for a culmination of sorts.

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,580
Praise Bob and hail to the Chief.

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,100
Chief Howell.

20
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,860
Indeed.

21
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,060
And to our friends at Central Services.

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,240
Who are holding it all together with chewing gum, bobby pins and bailing wire.

23
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,080
And Patsy.

24
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,720
Thanks for those bobby pins all you bobbies and pinheads.

25
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,840
Now if there are any bobbies who have not been pinned at this time.

26
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:35,540
They are to present themselves for repinning at the Central Administration Services Tower.

27
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,000
Bobbies to my left.

28
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,020
There are bobbies to my right.

29
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,340
Bobbies versus bobbies.

30
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,020
Yet they refuse to fight.

31
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,280
Bobbies versus bobbies.

32
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,180
Which side will you choose?

33
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,520
Bobbies versus bobbies.

34
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:11,000
Where the bobbies never lose.

35
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,000
Bobbies.

36
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,760
Bobbies.

37
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:29,440
Which bobbies at night.

38
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:35,220
And where the bobbies will most likely...

39
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,860
Just find lado iron.

40
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:36,860


41
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:36,860


42
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:36,860


43
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:36,860


44
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,780
I will show you how to handle bobbies and pinheads.

45
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:38,780


46
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,140
I appreciate the Institute and all of your others, and we drink to those of you who consider

47
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,140


48
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,700
And the fact under that Every Day Obnoxious.

49
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:40,700


50
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,580
None a센,,,,.,..., Because I will find all the others.

51
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,000
Fist coloured with the strangest words in both languages.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,280
This word is real enough to turn around your stomach.

53
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,280


54
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,640
To lease her 2007 rescuer mind off Bebe's mouth.

55
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,020
O garam vanilla claudia de cabrillo, even before she said no.

56
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,220
Daddy

57
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,780
Daddy

58
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,400
Daddy

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,400
Daddy

60
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:35,420
Daddy

61
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,620
Daddy

62
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,240
Daddy

63
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,680
Daddy

64
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:53,680


65
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:53,680


66
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,080
Daddy

67
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,820
Daddy

68
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,900
That was Reverend Synphotimus Ex Mortis

69
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,600
singing at 9X Day

70
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,600
during the Sunday Night Wotan Jam.

71
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,700
With two Beans on Computer Noises

72
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,480
and Reverend Phil on Drums

73
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,420
Reverend Carter LeBlanc on Bass

74
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,980
and the fantastic

75
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,060
Reverend Angry Larry on Guitar.

76
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,180
Friends, this is Hour of Slack

77
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,320
number 1056

78
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,780
the second of our specials

79
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,840
on X Day

80
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,080
composed entirely of recordings

81
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,020
made at that actual subgenius

82
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,820
end of the world drill.

83
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,320
Plus clips from the Puzzling Evidence Show

84
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,940
from Berklee with Dr. Howell

85
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,960
Dr. Philodrummon and Puzzling Evidence

86
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,020
as well as Radiosynesthesia

87
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,020
from WCSB

88
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,860
in Cleveland

89
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,080
and so let us go back

90
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,200
to this live Hour of Slack

91
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,880
on stage recording from

92
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,420
9X Day with

93
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,220
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Dr. Howell

94
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,120
And there's plenty of

95
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,140
free parking outside.

96
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,860
So stop on by on Tuesday

97
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,820
that's when Grandma Herdsberry

98
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,500
will be passing out Amish Delights

99
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,700
like Selecular Cheese

100
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,460
and the new

101
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,100
Deerfield

102
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,760
Remember when Grandma used to bend

103
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,580
over and pull one out of the oven

104
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,000
Well, it wasn't as easy

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,680
for her as it looked even back then

106
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,600
but with today's scientific

107
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,880
achievements you can have a new brother

108
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,900
sister, anyone that you

109
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,780
want simply by taking

110
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,520
a little pill. Question is

111
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,580
who's gonna control the bottle?

112
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,860
I was looking at the news and it seems

113
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,960
like, I don't know how many of you folks heard this

114
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,160
just recently Rush Limbaugh

115
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,440
was busted at the airport

116
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,860
and it was time for having a huge jar

117
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,360
of illegal Viagra

118
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,140
and I have to say

119
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,900
there's something pretty wrong

120
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,840
with this country when they try to take

121
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,800
Rush Limbaugh's giant mayonnaise

122
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,880
jar full of Viagra at the airport

123
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:07,780
Omega

124
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,960
Dettol's to that

125
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,940
I just wanna say the last time they snagged mine

126
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,120
at the airport I had a hell of a time

127
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,240
getting out of there and I mean

128
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,440
whose fault is this? You know I was blaming

129
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,100
Jack and Ethel Kennedy for that

130
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,660
I could go back 25 years if I could remember that

131
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,060
Well you're not supposed to carry

132
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,080
Jack and Ethel in your luggage

133
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,760
but whatever you've got there

134
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,740
the whole point is if they can get Limbaugh

135
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,280
they can certainly get me and you

136
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,080
we're smaller fish in the tentacles

137
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,640
of the national security state

138
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,980
Alright Dusty we know you could never get

139
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,780
all of Mr. Lunchbox's box

140
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,080
in that vestical

141
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,000
Aw gee

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,120
But that doesn't mean it's not going to work tomorrow

143
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,820
Have a brave heart, a clean mind

144
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,760
and for God's sakes get that

145
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,060
mustard off your underwear

146
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,840
When I was mustered

147
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,800
or called up to service

148
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,980
I was a green sprig

149
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,040
though you'd probably hardly think that

150
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,300
to look at me now

151
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,780
and over the years I have

152
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,640
excelled in the service

153
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,160
of my epopt

154
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,280
in my own way

155
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,300
but time

156
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,680
and even the rubberized tentacles

157
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,720
of the squid can wear one

158
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,760
down until one

159
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,320
is essentially a shell

160
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,620
a phantom, a particle

161
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,280
of one's ancient self

162
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,240
that still remains vainly quoting

163
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,740
obscure aspects and facets

164
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,520
of subgenius doctrine

165
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,640
Sarge Sarge, candle lift

166
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,040
it's too late, look, look there on the horizon

167
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,280
all four of them

168
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,260
no, it's more like forty

169
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,220
Load up

170
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,580
it's more like forty thousand

171
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,640
the whole sky is filling with them

172
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,100
Sarge Sarge, you better get your head down

173
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:48,180
I remember when I first met George Bush

174
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,500
I met him at the Farmers Bank Rehabilitation Center

175
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,060
I remember too

176
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,140
In Farmers Branch, Texas

177
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,420
I can't put this thing up anymore

178
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,100
I can't get my penis up

179
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,180
It's the detardo's

180
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,620
I said I'll stop using that substance

181
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,320
I said I'll stop using that substance

182
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,340
Just use it now, baby

183
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:14,160
I said I'll stop using that substance

184
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,800
Just use it now, baby

185
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,740
Just use it now, baby

186
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,160
I said I'll stop using that substance

187
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,160


188
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,800
Because you kick him in the pants instead of teaching him to dance

189
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,300
And then you push his face in and then you wonder where he's been

190
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,620
He's a son of the internet, so stick to using Alphina

191
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,480
I said a son of the internet, so stick to using Alphina

192
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,140
Alphina!

193
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,420
There's always room for Jell-O

194
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,780
Jell-O

195
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,780
Jell-O wrestling, Jell-O worms

196
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,760
Jell-O pudding

197
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,020
Jell-O Biafra

198
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,320
There's always room for Jell-O Biafra

199
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:44,740
That was Priestess Pisces with Reverend Carter LeBlanc at 9X Day

200
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,740
And there's lots more of both of them coming up

201
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,160
But first, I want to thank you all for watching

202
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,160


203
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,800
Before that, Lonesome Cowboy Dave and the Mondo DiTardo Band

204
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Which in this case was Princess We Are Doe and half of the amino acids

205
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,100
And that's them right now

206
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,040
Meanwhile friends, let's go back to Dr. Howell and Lonesome Cowboy Dave

207
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,100
And myself on stage at X Day right after a tape flip

208
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,960
So I believe that we catch Howell in the middle of an explanation

209
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,160
Of the pig-headedness of the Lonesome Cowboy Dave

210
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,640
Of the porkishly provincial

211
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:25,460
Naturally, they think the things which happen in their village of time

212
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,600
Outgun and trump everybody else's experience

213
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,120
But it's not true

214
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,840
Why, as far as you know, 13th century reformed Lutheran masturbators

215
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,880
Had a time compared to which the best experience of your life

216
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,240
Might be considered agony by comparison

217
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,380
That's right, Reverend Stubbs

218
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,180
We see a change in the morphology

219
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,440
All the way back to the very first ones

220
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,700
You notice an expansion of the arch of the foot

221
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,280
Almost resembling a duck

222
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,160
Really?

223
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,760
Yes, and in the second stage we notice more hirsutism

224
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,760
Hair growing not only out of the eyes and ears

225
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,720
But out of other unestablished parts

226
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,420
Yes, well, you can't

227
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,260
I mean, that is the tribute that one pays to time

228
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,720
The unpleasant symptoms of the male menopause

229
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,820
The hair growing from the ears

230
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:23,100
The bushy eyebrows like those characters in Dune

231
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,180
You know, it all happens

232
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,940
The indignities of time

233
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,940
One can crop back the beast flesh

234
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,320
But it will invariably show

235
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,560
But we must remember Luther and all our pursuits

236
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,220
We must think first of God, not of this...

237
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,280
Dobbs

238
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,400
We must think of the creator of all things

239
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,100
Think of the creator and not of Dobbs?

240
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:46,640
Yes

241
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,260
Think of Dobbs, then all is lost

242
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,480
Dobbs, cease it!

243
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,820
Oh, he's simply having a momentary lapse of recusal

244
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:00,520
It happens to the most brilliant subgenius sages and mages

245
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,080
Because of the intense strain of the constant correlation

246
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,140
Of the Dobbs position with every aspect of life

247
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,760
I wanted a smooth, shiny face when the exes came

248
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,380
I didn't want to look like the rest of my hearse

249
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,520
Of morphologically changed individuals

250
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,740
For friends

251
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,280
I wanted to be able to step on board that red carpet

252
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,540
With a shiny, smooth face

253
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,180
I was even going to have my scalp rubbed

254
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,840
And maybe shave my brain

255
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,160
It's too late now, isn't it?

256
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,700
Far too late

257
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,660
Ah, yes

258
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,400
It seems like that

259
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,340
That is the nightmare

260
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,560
There's a certain type of people

261
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,880
I'm one of them

262
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,860
You get stressed and obsessed

263
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,020
About missing trains

264
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,800
And planes

265
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,580
And appointments

266
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,560
You get all twisted

267
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,720
All bent out of shape

268
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,720
The thought that you just might miss a train or something

269
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,380
That's the most awful thing

270
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,980
How much more awful is it to miss that moment

271
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,880
When you step across the threshold

272
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,060
Onto that glowing, shining saucer?

273
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,060
I remember when they crucified the eyeball

274
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,280
And the saucers came

275
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,140
We were standing around in a circle

276
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,260
There was like maybe 30 or 40 people there

277
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,740
And their heads began to expand

278
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,580
Just like the elderly gentleman there

279
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,980
Who's expired in front of us

280
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,080
And the next thing we knew

281
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,080
It was far too late

282
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,800
Terrible, terrible

283
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,140
A terrible thing, ghastly

284
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,460
I had nothing to do with it

285
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,800
I heard you were the perpetrator

286
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,780
Well, you see

287
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:32,220
That just shows how these silly rumors spread

288
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,620
You know, I don't believe everything you read on the internet

289
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,300
Yes, that's all a tissue of malarkey and horseshit

290
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,680
You can take it from me

291
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:45,360
I, Dr. Howland, I'll deplore these excesses of

292
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,800
Shall we call them religious zeal?

293
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,720
Zeal when and if they occur

294
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,940
Remember, do not as I do in my fallible weakness

295
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,740
But as I say in my insufferable smarminess

296
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,000
But don't allow the dogs nearby

297
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,620
No, dogs delight to bark and bite

298
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,300
Yes, and we'll hold them right in front of your face

299
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,680
And pull down your panties

300
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,720
And we'll scream to high heaven

301
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,260
Well, you know, to a canine

302
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,380
Things that are considered in human terms

303
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,260
Uncouth or not suitable for the drawing room

304
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,900
Are just fine and dandy

305
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,120
Well, for the cyberdogs, things are doing much better now

306
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,780
Cyberdogs, eh?

307
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,840
Yes, the cyberdogs

308
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,180
The ones you implanted

309
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,100
Oh, well, I, you know

310
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,560
Always getting on the personal note here, you know

311
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,820
The phone companies planning to implant a chip

312
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,040
There's no reason to be in person now

313
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,360
The subgenius community doesn't ask even that much

314
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,740
Besides, if you haven't done anything

315
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,840
Why is there anything to be afraid of?

316
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,000
You should trust us

317
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,700
If you haven't been anywhere

318
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,980
Why feel like you've been somewhere?

319
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,980
If you don't want anything

320
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,860
Why are you upset that you don't get anything?

321
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,460
If you have no needs

322
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,360
Why are you bleeding on me?

323
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,120
If you have no pants

324
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,160
Why are you hesitating to sit down?

325
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,020
I, I, I, I, I can't sit down

326
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,700
I can't stand up

327
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,980
I'm waiting, I'm waiting

328
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,640
Who only sit and wait

329
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,060
And some of them will balloon up again

330
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,320
Throughout this entire area within the next few moments

331
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,260
Well, that's as it may be

332
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,140
That's an act of God or the devil

333
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,440
You know, humans are Brownian particles like everything else

334
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,480
Dashed around by the random processes of providence

335
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,680
I dream that strings theory

336
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,860
That's it, that strings theory?

337
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,000
Strings theory?

338
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,280
Was the strength to dream of string theory

339
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,020
Was like a bowl of spaghetti

340
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,260
Where each crudiment was

341
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,380
Or each bundle of spaghetti

342
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,520
Represent one of the many worlds we might be seeing perhaps

343
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,540
A writhing cauldron of slimy noodles

344
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,980
And yet each, each segment of the noodle

345
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,300
Represents only a minute portion of the duration

346
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,920
Of the time dimension

347
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,980
A meatball, as shown here

348
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,660
Wait, that's the wrong one

349
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,000
The meatball is a meatball

350
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,340
The meatball, shown here

351
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,180
There it is

352
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,400
The meatball, shown here

353
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,740
Represents one of the indivisible worlds

354
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,360
That creates the spaghetti around it

355
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,800
Or the many strings of reality

356
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,580
You see, when we look at the aggregate mass

357
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,380
Those tumbling tubes

358
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:35,500
We tend to look most closely at those odd effusions

359
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,760
Which appear articulated in the middle of the mass

360
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,620
The meatballs draw our eye

361
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,980
While the spaghetti becomes the ground for the figure of the meatball

362
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,720
The meatball

363
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,460
You're all fools

364
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,560
Silly old fools

365
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,040
Do you think you really know what this is all about?

366
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,300
Is it all cut and dry?

367
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,180
Is it all in black and white for you?

368
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,560
Do I have to spell it out?

369
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:15,960
Is it all in black and white for you?

370
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,000
Bulls, the everlast one of you

371
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,440
Do you think it's all about you?

372
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,640
The money's been paid

373
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,780
The deal's been made

374
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,920
And you're just a pawn in this lovely game

375
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,120
You're just a pawn in this lovely game

376
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,640
Buy the ticket

377
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,820
Ride the ride

378
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,340
$30

379
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,920
Ride the ride

380
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,820
Bulls, you silly little fools

381
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,900
Do you think it's about you?

382
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,500
It's about your slack

383
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,220
It's about your little trip

384
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,100
It's all about you

385
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,900
No, you're a real estate

386
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,780
You're a piece of the deal

387
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,680
That happened long ago

388
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,600
In a Waffle House

389
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,360
In Avondale Estates, Georgia

390
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,840
It's not about you

391
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,500
It's not about me

392
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,900
It's not about him

393
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,180
It's not about her

394
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,220
It's about the deal

395
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:38,260
The deal has gone down

396
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:42,820
The deal has gone down

397
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,660
The deal has gone down

398
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:47,600
And soon they're coming to collect the property

399
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,640
And if you're not out

400
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,900
There is no eviction notice, friends

401
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,160
There is no 30-day warning

402
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,560
There is no two weeks notice

403
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,300
They are coming to collect their property

404
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,560
And are you ready?

405
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,060
Because even...

406
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,820
When you're being sucked off the planet

407
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,300
There will be a little bit of a sting

408
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,260
It might hurt a bit

409
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,500
But just for a short while

410
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,760
It'll all be better

411
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,300
Once they begin the probing

412
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,780
The probing

413
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,120
The probing

414
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,900
The probing

415
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,520
They ask

416
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,640
But they don't know what they're doing

417
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,620
They don't want answers

418
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,660
They want results

419
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,940
They want results

420
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,900
That work

421
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,720
Dobbs has taken his 15% commission on this sale

422
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,660
He is our salesman of the year

423
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,560
They want results that work

424
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,480
They want you to work

425
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,000
They want you to work

426
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,000


427
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,480
Work harder

428
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,280
Work smarter

429
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,340
Work harder

430
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,120
Work smarter

431
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,700
Work harder

432
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,540
Work smarter

433
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,580
Work harder

434
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,620
Work smarter

435
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,500
And then what?

436
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:30,800
Shouldn't you be at work right now?

437
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,780
Isn't there something important you're supposed to be doing?

438
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,040
Didn't you leave the toaster on?

439
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,880
Did you feed the cat?

440
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:56,980
Did you sign your reports and fill them in the box?

441
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,320
Have you crossed your eyes and dotted your T's?

442
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,660
Are you minding your Q's and P's?

443
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,240
Did you sign your report and fill it in the box?

444
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:13,620
Have you crossed your eyes and dotted your T's?

445
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:19,740
When the great accounting comes, will you be ready?

446
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,920
Have you forgotten something?

447
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,100
Have you forgotten something?

448
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,460
What about me?

449
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:43,480
What about me?

450
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:43,600


451
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:43,600


452
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:43,600


453
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:43,600


454
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:43,600


455
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:43,600


456
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:43,600


457
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:43,600


458
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:43,600


459
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,440
Isn't it about time you called your mother?

460
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,740
She's probably wondering what you're doing right now.

461
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,860
You never call me, Bubba.

462
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,260
You never call me.

463
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,140
You never call me.

464
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:13,600
Isn't it about time you did your job?

465
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:13,600


466
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:13,600


467
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:13,600


468
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,420
You never did your taxes?

469
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,940
Isn't that paper due?

470
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,560
Weren't you supposed to pay that speeding ticket?

471
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Weren't you supposed to call her back?

472
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:42,000
Isn't it about time you got that new water heater, Mr. Dobbs?

473
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,580
You never called me.

474
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:43,580


475
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:43,580


476
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:43,580


477
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:43,580


478
00:22:43,580 --> 00:23:03,000
You never called me, 굳을 아 이래서

479
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,000


480
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,440
exhausting

481
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:03,560
it

482
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,280
so

483
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:04,520
in

484
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,240
5

485
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,880
6

486
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,780
7

487
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,320
8

488
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:08,340
8

489
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,080
6

490
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,460
7

491
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,440
enough, they'll hang themselves with it.

492
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,600
Isn't that a trapdoor underneath your feet?

493
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,660
Isn't that a man lurking in the shadows?

494
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:39,080
All these insecurities, these questions, these wondering, whatever happened to the love of

495
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:50,360
blind faith, the blind faith that tells us as we know that one day they will come.

496
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,400
One day they will come.

497
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,080
Whatever happened to Saturday night?

498
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,680
That was Reverend Carter LeBlanc and Priestess Pisces.

499
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,460
They're all in their high knees spouting their full high knees off with two beams of

500
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,220
space drum music in the background, but I can't help it.

501
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,480
We don't have any control over this.

502
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,420
We didn't know anything about the date of 1998 until we got that pamphlet back from

503
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,400
the printers in 1980.

504
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,880
I didn't type in a date.

505
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,920
It was there when we picked it up at the printers.

506
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,880
There, there, Ivan.

507
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,680
It's all right.

508
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,200
It's all right.

509
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,860
We don't know.

510
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,860
It's okay.

511
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,140
For all I know, a roach crawled across the printing press and got squished into just

512
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:38,580
such a...

513
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:38,940
It could have...

514
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,760
...shape that it formed the letters July 5th, 1998.

515
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,620
Could happen to anyone.

516
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,280
It could.

517
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,480
Well, I don't know that it could happen to anyone.

518
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,000
I think that we are the chosen.

519
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,640
Bob said so.

520
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,240
There is a point.

521
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,240
We paid our $30.

522
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,420
We must be the chosen.

523
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,280
Coincidence or conspiracy?

524
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,700
We wouldn't be stupid enough to waste $30 on some scam.

525
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,360
That's how we know we're subgenial.

526
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:05,760
That cockroach may have been more culpable than I thought, but even so, we have achieved

527
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,020
some success in our chosen field...

528
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,540
...and are here broadcasting right at the moment.

529
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,500
I'm going to sing this the way I first heard this song.

530
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,020
Wild thing.

531
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,220
Heart's sake.

532
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,320
You make everything a groovy.

533
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,000
You make everything a groovy.

534
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,000


535
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,000


536
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,000


537
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,420
Wild thing.

538
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,060
Wild thing.

539
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,400
I think I love you.

540
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,060
But, but, I want to know for sure.

541
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:05,660
Come on.

542
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,740
Hold me tight.

543
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,940
I love you.

544
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,260
Wild thing.

545
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,500
You make my heart sing.

546
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:32,100
You make everything groovy.

547
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,260
Wild thing.

548
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:43,040
Wild thing, I think I love you.

549
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,780
But I would really like to know for sure.

550
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,220
Come on, hold me tight.

551
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,680
You move me.

552
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:16,720
Wild thing, you make my heart sing.

553
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:22,720
You make everything groovy.

554
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,220
Wild thing.

555
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,200
Wild thing.

556
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,320
You're such a wild thing.

557
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,040
You crawl on the stage.

558
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,980
And you have sex with the monitors.

559
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,460
You are insane.

560
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,040
I can't stand it.

561
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,980
You're driving me insane.

562
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,220
It's unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.

563
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,660
I don't know what to do next.

564
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,080
Wild thing.

565
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,380
Wild thing.

566
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,420
Wild thing.

567
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,000
Wild thing.

568
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,060
Wild thing.

569
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,780
Wild thing.

570
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,260
Wild thing.

571
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:10,320
Wild thing.

572
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:10,320


573
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:10,320


574
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:10,320


575
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:16,880
The inimitable DJ Shaver in one of his many performances at 9X Day, this time singing

576
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,740
with backup from Five Fisted Tales of Connie, which is the name Reverend Angry Larry, the

577
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,660
guitar player, gave the spontaneous jam band afterwards.

578
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,180
And now Carter, the guitar player.

579
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:29,180


580
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:29,520
Let's hear it.

581
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:29,740
Let's hear the jam.

582
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,740
Let's hear it.

583
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:31,800
Let's hear it.

584
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,320
Let's hear it.

585
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,200
There ain't nothing.

586
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,760
There ain't nothing.

587
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,840
There ain't nothing.

588
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:54,560
There ain't nothing sweeter than probing oneself with the soft, smooth cranium of a round-headed

589
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,360
gray alien.

590
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,900
There ain't nothing sweeter.

591
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:16,300
There is something about the simple curves of their semi-fibrous skulls and the way in

592
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:33,420
which the skins, their gray, clammy, soft, pliable skin slips past whatever necessary

593
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:45,760
orifices one finds appropriate for such an act as that.

594
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:58,340
Because, when you get right down to it, humanity has been probed long enough.

595
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:16,140
Ain't it about time we probed ourselves with them instead of being probed by them?

596
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:29,920
The soft circumference of their smooth, spherical, skeletal formations.

597
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:37,080
The head bone, it's connected to the leg bone.

598
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:42,260
But when you put your dick bone in it, it feels really good.

599
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,620
Because it...

600
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,900
If it squiggles, you smash the fuck out of it.

601
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,120
I'm not going to do that.

602
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,120


603
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:47,960
I'm going to do it.

604
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,000
I'm going to do it.

605
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,820
Now, friends, you know, you've got to be kind to our pagan brothers and sisters.

606
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:59,280
They may be off on a slightly wrong path, not focused on Bob's pipe or pecker like they

607
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,600
should be, just wandering the world looking for answers.

608
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,920
I know how it is.

609
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,300
Like Satan, wandering the world like a roaring lion looking for one to devour.

610
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,060
They're all looking for slack.

611
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,380
And we've all learned that slack is...

612
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,620
We always had it all the time.

613
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,140
The sub-genius must have slack.

614
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,660
That doesn't mean slack is something you're going to get.

615
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,880
That means you must have it in order to be a sub-genius.

616
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,640
Of course, that's the nensletic interpretation.

617
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,020
But it makes as much sense as anything else.

618
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,540
Because you always already have the slack.

619
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:39,620
It's whether you have the enlightenment to be able to appreciate the slack of, say, for

620
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,220
instance, some unbuttered pancake sitting on a paper plate in front of you.

621
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,360
You see, because the sub-genius must have the slack, it's not just the fact that you've

622
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:44,360


623
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:44,620
got the slack.

624
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,340
You must have slack.

625
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:52,820
That does not imply that the sub-genius who must have slack does not have slack.

626
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:59,240
Those who do not have slack and desire it are not, by this definition, sub-geniuses,

627
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,560
even though they desire slack.

628
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,200
For sub-geniuses have slack.

629
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:03,760
Right.

630
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,540
That's how you know you're a sub-genius.

631
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,720
You know what you're...

632
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,100
Even if you feel like you don't have enough slack, at least you know something's missing.

633
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,360
You have slack and you're not accessing it.

634
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:14,360


635
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:14,500
Right.

636
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:19,040
But the pity of the poor normal who doesn't even know what it's missing.

637
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,900
Sacks and sacks, the green plastic garbage bags of slack.

638
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:29,960
You know, if we only could put it in green plastic garbage bags, we'd be as rich

639
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,020
as the Scientologists.

640
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:31,540
Well, it's volatile.

641
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,120
Because that's essentially what they did.

642
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,760
It won't keep in those bags.

643
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,900
You can put it there, but it won't stay there long.

644
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,640
It volatilizes into the atmosphere.

645
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,340
Slack is nothing to be hoarded, but to be enjoyed on the surface.

646
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:44,460
It's a spot.

647
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,300
Right.

648
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,920
You don't want to be a slack sponge.

649
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,340
You want to be a slack fount.

650
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:55,760
You want to be a slack surfer, skidding and slipping and slopping on the stream of slack

651
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,960
as it spurts forth.

652
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,920
If you're going to break your neck, do you want to break it on the job or do you

653
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,020
want to break it surfing that curl of slack?

654
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,860
Well, I guess you don't have to break your neck.

655
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,300
I sometimes get off into fantasies.

656
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:12,780
The main thing about all this twaddle is that you have to seize the slackful moment

657
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,340
at the time when it happens.

658
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,960
It occurs in the pulsating sinusoidal avenues of reality.

659
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,480
You can't sit back and stroke your goatee and decide whether or not you'll stick your

660
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,980
toe in the slack stream.

661
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:33,060
You must instantly leap into its rushing torrent and risk being borne away.

662
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,160
And friends, this can happen many, many times a day.

663
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,220
You can take slack in your hand.

664
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:43,040
Boys, when you go to that urinal, you take slack in your hand and feel that mighty time

665
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,420
of pee.

666
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,860
And the time before the time of pee, sure, there's pain.

667
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:51,940
But that just makes the time of pee that much more slackful.

668
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:57,140
And ladies, I know the same could be true for you, although with a different configuration.

669
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:03,460
And when you go into that extra meditation chamber, you know, that is a gift that Bob

670
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:09,360
and God and nature give you, well, hopefully every day.

671
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,120
Yes, they say Beethoven composed some of his most moving pieces.

672
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,860
If you eat prunes, you can certainly...

673
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:18,100
He composed the most moving music when behind that little door with the half moon on it.

674
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:18,580
Did he?

675
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,000
Really?

676
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,660
It's like singing in the shower.

677
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,060
You know, a lot of people get their ideas when they get in the shower.

678
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:28,640
When you go into extra meditation, suddenly that problem that seems so insurmountable,

679
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,860
you suddenly go, oh my God, I know exactly what to do about it.

680
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,920
And oftentimes that is to blow it off.

681
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,400
The Marburg Bowl Symphony, for example.

682
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:43,100
Well, it is important to remember that slack is to be seized and apprehended.

683
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,360
And apprehended wherever it is found.

684
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:49,680
And not allowed to go on its merry, feckless way.

685
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,480
Well it does that anyway.

686
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,240
Because it's slack.

687
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:55,880
Yeah.

688
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:01,100
And the thing is, you must fulfill your options.

689
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,040
Get your equity.

690
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:02,640
Right.

691
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,300
Get in on the ground floor now.

692
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,920
There's miserable people going, oh God, I almost got slack.

693
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,460
If only I got a raise.

694
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,540
If only I could get an extra week off for vacation.

695
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,160
I could get a job.

696
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:13,160


697
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:13,160


698
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:13,640
I could have slack.

699
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:19,440
And meanwhile, they're missing, they're missing the incredible slack of staring at the end

700
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:19,980
of their shoe.

701
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:20,980
That's right.

702
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,460
If they were in subgenius consciousness, that slack would be anywhere they wanted to

703
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:26,700
look.

704
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,380
They would be able to slide into the cosmic consciousness of meditation upon how good

705
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,380
it is that they can even see the tip of their shoe.

706
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:41,280
I say that one because it's, meditating on the end of your shoe is what junkies are said

707
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:41,820
to do.

708
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:47,380
Didn't old Walt Whitman say that a mouse was a miracle to stagger sextillions of infidels?

709
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,800
There you go.

710
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,000
I'll take your word for it.

711
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,980
And I don't even like mice.

712
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:57,700
So you see folks, it's all the succotash and sorghum that they feed you.

713
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:03,680
It's hard to sort it all out, but just don't worry about it here at X Day.

714
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,940
That is our job description.

715
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,880
Oh, you're going to help me worry?

716
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,140
That's great.

717
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,520
I've never had anybody worry.

718
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,480
I'm going to take some of the Atlantean burden from your shoulders.

719
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,280
Here, brother, let me carry your cross.

720
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,540
Okay, sure.

721
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,520
Hey, wait, stop.

722
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,220
Come back.

723
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:27,840
He just offered to take that thing off his back and he just shrugged.

724
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:11,500
We're just a bunch of plain crazy brats and little outlaws running errands and becoming

725
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:11,500


726
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:11,500


727
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,160
Oh, wasn't that the furniture coming out of the house?

728
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,900
I had heard my uncle speaking to spirits

729
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,020
who replied with one knock for yes and two knocks for no.

730
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:28,520
Of kind of demonica, purim and furim.

731
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,440
Don't tell me you believe all that spiritualistic nonsense,

732
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:36,620
mediumistic trash about knocks and bangs and trumpets blowing

733
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,520
and flutes tootling and strange shrieks

734
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,140
and groans and orgasmic cries.

735
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,940
Only an idiot would think this was not real.

736
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,180
Doesn't it feel real?

737
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,160
Just remember the spirit of a man is the candle of the Lord

738
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,200
searching all the inward parts of his belly.

739
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:01,060
Man is born under trouble as the sparks fly upward.

740
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:07,240
As the sparks fly downward, the holy act of pyroflatulation

741
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,080
keeps the fire burning.

742
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,680
What is the spirit of man that goeth on?

743
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:14,560
The spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth.

744
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,840
It's called the monkey song.

745
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,440
What you talkin' about?

746
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,260
Monkey see and monkey do.

747
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,440
But Americans shouldn't have to presume a fair count.

748
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,240
The mainstream media has, to all effects and purposes,

749
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,500
established to borrow the phrase of the great American novelist Joseph Heller

750
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,720
at Catch-22 for election investigation.

751
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,920
No investigation without proof.

752
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,620
But then what proof can be had without investigation?

753
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,540
That's a lot like the witch doctors.

754
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,560
The subgenius doctors.

755
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,580
Oh, those doctors.

756
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,860
There they are.

757
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,060
By God, they're great patriots.

758
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:56,540
Those subgenius doctors were there in America's darkest hour.

759
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,000
Now they're marching onward into a new America.

760
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,920
In fact, they're practicing mediums.

761
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,200
By rites and incantations, they are supposed to heal the sick.

762
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,600
And put curses on people.

763
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,580
I'm happy.

764
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,420
Hello, friends.

765
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,840
Yeah, don't you feel happier to see us?

766
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,640
This is Bob.

767
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,200
You have to be like the size of that platform.

768
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:20,200
They're the most dedicated doctors ever.

769
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,660
Hey, you know, we're saying doctors.

770
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,820
Nobody's said that for years.

771
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,460
Doctors.

772
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,240
Doctors.

773
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:29,280
Years and years ago, that was a title of honor in the subgenius church.

774
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,060
I have saved the earth.

775
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:35,320
Have you got a question for the subgenius doctors of the year?

776
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,540
Yes.

777
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,140
Do you know?

778
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:37,880
What would be?

779
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,140
Um, what ails you, doctor?

780
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,260
What ails me?

781
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,260
You mean physician heal thyself?

782
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,560
Medicaid, curate ipsum?

783
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,820
What's bugging you, doc?

784
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,240
Well, I'll tell you.

785
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,800
What's the bug up your butt?

786
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,080
It's the evils of this world.

787
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,240
And not simply man's greed and mendacity.

788
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:01,960
And graceful.

789
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,960
But also the unparalleled assaults of undecency.

790
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,700
Of the insect kingdom.

791
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,940
And furthermore.

792
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,620
Yes, bugs are bad.

793
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,720
He is in reality a wizard.

794
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,340
Well, they are when they bite you all weekend.

795
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,300
Bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs.

796
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:22,860
Every time you lift up your cup for that big draught of coffee, there's just dry bugs.

797
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:34,640
Well, I was trying to explain that what was significant about these chiggers floating in the coffee is the aperture of the coffee cup is about three and a half inches wide.

798
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,360
You know, the diameter.

799
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:42,820
And so that means that in this coffee cup, four or five, maybe seven chiggers have fallen overnight.

800
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:50,480
Think how many have fallen in the greater area out of the same tree outside the coffee cup.

801
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:57,080
This tree that overarches the humble trailer where the subgenius hives.

802
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,540
So these chiggers were in the tree?

803
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,120
Well, they must have.

804
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,160
They normally live in grass.

805
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,940
They look like an exploding head guy in a bad horror movie.

806
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:03,940


807
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,620
They have fallen.

808
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,540
They have fallen into this coffee cup, which was up on a...

809
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,100
They jump.

810
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,160
They're like fleas.

811
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:08,400
They jump.

812
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,980
They would have had to jump 12 feet up in the air, Jack.

813
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:11,800
Well, they're like a flea.

814
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,780
A flea can jump 12 feet.

815
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,820
They couldn't possibly.

816
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,320
They have little tiny brains and they jump like that.

817
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:16,740
They can jump 12 feet.

818
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:16,840
Come on.

819
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,440
Plus, chiggers have wings.

820
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,200
They can fly.

821
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,480
Some respect for reality here.

822
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,240
They can jump high and fly.

823
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,740
A chigger can jump like six feet.

824
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,760
And then it can fly like 30 or 40 feet.

825
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,640
They're little spastic spiders.

826
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,860
They can't do nothing.

827
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,220
Chiggers are the most...

828
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,820
Well, then why would you be so afraid and not care about it?

829
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:34,420
They are the craziest, wackiest animals in the world.

830
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:39,940
They're the most unusual new spider specimens with bulked up forearms like Popeye, which

831
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,120
we dubbed Popeye Arachne Gigantes.

832
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,440
I thought that was Popeye.

833
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,680
That's without an apostrophe.

834
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,160
And we took this spider to the outside world where we released it so that it could fraternize

835
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,080
with its sibling spiderlings.

836
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,620
But on a site...

837
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:02,620
I've seen my aunts and uncles put their stingers under the armpits of another person.

838
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,960
There were large ants there too.

839
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:04,260
All right.

840
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,160
Now we're calling the ambulance for you right now.

841
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,640
Digging their fingers into the pits.

842
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,020
Digging and digging and digging until they're just...

843
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,820
Yes, you're in reentry.

844
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:13,960
No, no, no.

845
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,400
But you've got my fingers under your pits.

846
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,300
Let go now.

847
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,920
Let go of my fingers.

848
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,560
Oh, that's what that was.

849
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,500
Start digging your sweaty pits.

850
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,200
I don't know about your intestines, but mine didn't swing from a tree.

851
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,820
Well, the amino acids played a good set.

852
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,380
Didn't they?

853
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,740
I always enjoy the amino acids performing.

854
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:37,520
Yeah.

855
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:37,680
And let...

856
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,400
Yeah.

857
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,340
I finally got to meet Angry Larry.

858
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,100
Angry Larry is the...

859
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:42,720
I finally got to meet him.

860
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,300
Never met him before.

861
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,680
That has got to be the most Three Stooges influenced band.

862
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,460
Well, they all kind of look like...

863
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:50,600
Although they deny that.

864
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,820
It wouldn't...

865
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,520
They all look like Curly with a...

866
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,700
If he had like a sperm tail coming off his head.

867
00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:02,440
Well, they behave like Curly and they really abused that Bob dummy this time.

868
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:03,800
And me.

869
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:03,800


870
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:03,800


871
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:03,800


872
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:03,800


873
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:03,800


874
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:03,800


875
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:03,800


876
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:03,800


877
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,040
And me.

878
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:07,020
Come to think of it, I was looking at the videos today.

879
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:12,520
It's like I blanked this out of my memory, but first the ambassador, that's the one that

880
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,300
plays theremin.

881
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,080
He jumps out into the audience and starts fights with them.

882
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:23,640
Yeah, he jumped out and he had his way with the Bob dummy and he wasn't even faking it.

883
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,360
And then just as I was thinking, oh, this is really photogenic and funny, he grabbed

884
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,580
me and believe me, it's not funny.

885
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,140
Yes.

886
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:38,000
Friends, we are going to have the Bulldada auction at some point.

887
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,660
We'll also do the Bobby Awards.

888
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:46,080
The calligrapher is on her way down and the bribes have mostly been delivered, I think.

889
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:53,180
But I heard something just a minute ago at the beginning of that ceremony that I haven't

890
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,660
heard much of this weekend.

891
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,980
It was just two simple words.

892
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,960
Those words were praise Bob!

893
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,840
Praise Bob!

894
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,120
Oh, God, that's like music to my ears.

895
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:03,120


896
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:03,120


897
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:03,120


898
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:10,640
Because you know, sometimes it's gotten to where it's just not cool to say praise Bob.

899
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:21,160
It's just not hip to announce proudly your complete and unquestioning devotion to that

900
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,540
so-called clip art head.

901
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:28,380
No, sometimes nowadays we think, oh, no, I don't want to look like a Bobby.

902
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,000
I don't want to look like an extremist.

903
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,100
You don't?

904
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,100
Oh, yes.

905
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,820
You do, as a matter of fact.

906
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,060
You are a subgenius.

907
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,600
You are an extremist.

908
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,620
You are a fanatic.

909
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:46,780
You do not, you should never, ever feel the slightest embarrassment about slavishly, slobberingly

910
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,980
devoting your every thought, spunk, and belief into that man.

911
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,720
Devote every bit of energy.

912
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,140
Forget your own life.

913
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,900
You are as nothing to Bob.

914
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,540
Yeah, you can't imagine how he ignores you.

915
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:11,060
And you cannot imagine how lucky you are not to have Bob notice you because his slack has

916
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:12,840
to come from somewhere now, doesn't it?

917
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,620
Nonetheless, friends, and it is because of that, because of that very reason that we

918
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:28,820
know that those dots, well, in the case of high contrast dots, those lines and those

919
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:33,760
shapes that form that face, that is what it is all about.

920
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:38,020
Oh, you can purty it up and you can say, oh, I read the book of the subgenius.

921
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,980
There are some very thoughtful things about slack.

922
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:45,220
Oh, yes, some of that stuff about the conspiracy, that's always been true of the human condition

923
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:46,300
is not poignant.

924
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:52,500
But that is all just a bunch of fluffery and rigmarole.

925
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:56,100
It's like the accessory kit that goes with Barbie.

926
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,800
But it's not the accessory.

927
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,260
It's the accessories that you care to.

928
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:05,220
But the important thing is Barbie, who happens to be based on Bob's daughter, Barbie Dobbs.

929
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:11,900
But it is the fat man Bob is all that counts and not even the man Bob.

930
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:16,760
Not even the concept of freedom and slack represented by Bob.

931
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:19,320
Just that face.

932
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,600
That is all you need.

933
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,500
If you can look at that face and know instantly how cool it is.

934
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,780
And that's what every one of you needs.

935
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:28,840
And that's what you did.

936
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:29,720
That's why you're here.

937
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:33,180
You saw that face and you went, yeah, I get it.

938
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,220
Because I understand there's nothing to get.

939
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,500
There's just Bob.

940
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,400
What else do you need?

941
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:47,880
Do you really need to make excuses and look intelligent?

942
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:54,380
No, I'm afraid this is not the religion where we impress others by looking intelligent.

943
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,020
No, sir.

944
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:58,420
This is the religion where we impress others.

945
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:58,760
No, sir.

946
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:00,380
This is the religion where we impress others by looking at Bob.

947
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:04,040
By being lucky enough to appreciate slack.

948
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,600
To know what we might be missing.

949
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:10,520
The poor normal doesn't even, that never even occurs to them.

950
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:16,620
Oh, they could pretend that they are going to bottle and sell some form of slack each year.

951
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:22,640
But no, there is no, you already have the slack.

952
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,080
We've been over this a million times.

953
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:27,780
Again, that's all just intellectual frippery.

954
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:35,160
You look at that, Dobbs, you get a bit of a little boner.

955
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,760
Maybe a mental boner.

956
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,060
Especially in the case of the ladies.

957
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:42,500
But you know, you get a tingling down there and up here.

958
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,700
That's the thing.

959
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,820
It happens in both places at the same time.

960
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,360
All over your body.

961
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,960
Like a hit of nicotine.

962
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:57,940
After you've been with Bob for a while, you just don't feel right unless you've got some Bob every now and then.

963
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:59,940
You've just got to see that head now and then.

964
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:04,760
And every now and then you have to pour yourself into seeing that head.

965
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,820
Just see nothing but that head.

966
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:07,560
What else do you need?

967
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:08,200
Well, food.

968
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:09,940
Health.

969
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:12,480
Shitting.

970
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,540
Actually, shitting is much more important than sex.

971
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,940
See how long you can go without sex.

972
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,820
And then see how long you can go without shitting.

973
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,840
Your back not hurting is the more rationalized...

974
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,340
There's nothing to be ashamed of when you pee or shit.

975
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,620
I tried to quit peeing.

976
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:31,480
I'm not ashamed to say I couldn't do it.

977
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,340
I just had that need.

978
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,440
I just couldn't.

979
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:36,460
It overcomes me.

980
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,300
But really, what's the most important things in life?

981
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:43,260
Money is only number eight or nine on the list.

982
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:46,680
Sex is not even in the top ten anymore.

983
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,060
Bob is not even in the top ten.

984
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:53,100
Because what you really need, number one, is you've got to remember to breathe.

985
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,300
You've got to remember to drink water.

986
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,080
That will be followed by peeing.

987
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,540
You will eat or die.

988
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,840
And that will be...

989
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,620
And shitting it better follow.

990
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,780
And that better be pretty soon in my case.

991
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:05,840
And...

992
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:08,560
What's up?

993
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,780
Your back not hurting.

994
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:14,720
Well, I can't remember the next five most important things in life.

995
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,280
Oh, your back not hurting.

996
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,260
Yeah, and frop.

997
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,340
Frop is in there.

998
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,700
Money is in the top ten.

999
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:25,200
It comes right after frop.

1000
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,060
Now, by frop, of course, we don't mean...

1001
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:37,560
Your street drugs, your marijuana, your cigarettes, your liquor, your pornography, your MTV.

1002
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:42,400
Actually, if you have any extra of those things, we would love to have them.

1003
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:48,660
Because, as G. Gordon Gordon said, false slack is better than no slack at all.

1004
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:56,840
But, as Reverend Carter LeBlanc added so wisely, false slack is no slack.

1005
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:57,840
No slack at all.

1006
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:02,300
The conspiracy can give you infinite amounts of false slack.

1007
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,120
And you can still have no slack at all.

1008
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,720
Just ask Jimi Hendrix.

1009
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,740
Ask Janis Joplin.

1010
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,440
Ask John Lennon.

1011
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,600
Ask anybody whose name starts with a J.

1012
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,840
And you'll find friends.

1013
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,060
Howard Hughes.

1014
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,180
Those guys all...

1015
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,500
Well, actually, Hughes and Elvis escaped.

1016
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:22,880
Bob helped them.

1017
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:25,360
Took their riches and their fame away.

1018
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,500
And they're happy now in some South American country.

1019
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,420
And I shouldn't say any more than that.

1020
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:32,740
But because I'm really stalling anyway.

1021
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,540
That's all this life is.

1022
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,400
We're just stalling until we meet Bob.

1023
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:40,600
Some people get impatient.

1024
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,060
They go, well, my life sucks so bad I'm going to kill myself.

1025
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:49,620
And I imagine that at some point or another, almost all of us have said, oh, man, I can't pay this bill.

1026
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,360
I'll just kill myself and then the electric company will be sorry.

1027
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,040
Well, friends...

1028
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,160
And then there's other people.

1029
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,860
Phineas Narco mentioned this.

1030
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:58,540
It's so sad.

1031
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:03,960
He goes, there's people who are so depressed that they go, I'd kill myself but I'm afraid it would kill my mom.

1032
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,320
So then they wish their mom would die.

1033
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,740
And then they feel guilty about wishing their mom would die and want to kill themselves.

1034
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:18,300
Well, friends, if you're thinking, oh, I want to kill myself but I can't because Bob would just die.

1035
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:19,800
Don't you worry about Bob.

1036
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,500
He does not care whether or not you kill yourself.

1037
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,180
He only cares about your slack.

1038
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,640
And here's the thing.

1039
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,440
Your Bob or God are going to get you anyway.

1040
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:34,040
They're professionals.

1041
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:37,040
By definition, you're an amateur at suicide.

1042
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:40,500
Everybody is an amateur at suicide.

1043
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,180
There are no professionals except for Bob and God.

1044
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:48,600
So, friends, don't do it yourself.

1045
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,120
Let Bob do it for you.

1046
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:54,480
It's the same thing we say about terrorism and murder upon our own.

1047
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:54,480


1048
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,660
Our enemies, the pinks and normals and humans.

1049
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,100
The exes are going to do it.

1050
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,520
Are you going to show how faithless you are?

1051
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,060
You thought it was all just a joke.

1052
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:10,440
Like, for instance, our former members in Washington, D.C., known as the Beltway Snipers.

1053
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:14,120
They took that a little bit too literally because they did not have faith in Bob.

1054
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:23,020
They didn't have faith that the exes would come and wipe clean and scour clean this benighted, this German planet.

1055
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:33,680
On which the virus known as the human race acts like a cancer on all the other wonderful life forms such as poison ivy and rattlesnakes.

1056
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,360
Friends, there's...

1057
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,220
Sure, the world's going to end sooner or later no matter what.

1058
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:48,840
For everybody, except the heat vent worms, those cracks, volcanic cracks seven miles down in the depths of the ocean.

1059
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:52,920
There are mindless, spineless, nerveless creatures.

1060
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:53,000
There are mindless, spineless, nerveless creatures.

1061
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:56,180
They are yet alive and they live on poison.

1062
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,660
There's no oxygen.

1063
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,360
They live on what could kill every other life form.

1064
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:03,520
Friends, they will be Bob's last customers.

1065
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:08,220
And because they will be able to buy from Bob when everything else is gone.

1066
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,540
Because of that, friends, there is hope.

1067
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,680
Someday the kingdom of the heat vent worm men and women will come.

1068
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,620
And there will be perfect, perfect slack.

1069
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:23,000
Sure, it may be more millions of years from now than we can even imagine.

1070
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:23,000


1071
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:23,000


1072
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,160
But so what if Bob keeps selling?

1073
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,300
If Bob's pipe keeps burning?

1074
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,520
That's all we need. That's all we care about.

1075
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:32,600
That's all we need to know.

1076
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,260
That's all you need to know.

1077
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,600
Thank you very much, my friends.

1078
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:38,260
Praise fucking God damn Bob!

1079
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:40,800
And praise damn God Bob!

1080
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:43,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1081
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,000
Woo!

1082
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:45,940
Praise Bob!

1083
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:47,200
Praise Bob!

1084
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,560
I've been staying, ladies and gentlemen.

1085
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:51,720
I've been staying.

1086

00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,120

00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:08,960
Won't have to worry about her for another day.

1102
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:20,120

That no good fucker.

1110
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,640

vengeance shall be yours.

1131
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:45,120
I get so excited thinking of their tortured screams.

1132
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:52,020
It kind of makes me want to cream my jeans.

1133
00:57:56,300 --> 00:58:01,500
And there's something about the smell of burning pink.

1134
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:10,900
It sort of makes it feel like the Amazon is right between your lips.
