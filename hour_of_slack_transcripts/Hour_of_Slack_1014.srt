1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,080
It's my nightmare, crawling, slithering, along the edge.

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:23,800
It's my nightmare, crawling, slithering, along the edge of a straight razor.

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:30,740
Just listen. Everyone be calm and just relax and be seated if you would please.

4
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,820
Because, you see, one of the things that...

5
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:43,260
Tell me why you make the pain if we are your children.

6
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,580
Ah, you see, you are my children, but law is necessary.

7
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:50,820
Tell me.

8
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,380
If there is no more pain,

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,240
then is there no more law?

10
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,800
There is always law.

11
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:19,740
I watched a snail crawl along the edge of a straight razor, crawling, slithering.

12
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:27,280
Along the edge of a straight razor.

13
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,500
And surviving.

14
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,060
Transmission 11, receive 68, December 30, 0500 hours.

15
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,560
Sector King, Zulu King.

16
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,560
Yes, and praise Bob.

17
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,080
Yes!

18
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,500
430.

19
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,020
430 in the morning.

20
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,960
Time for show.

21
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,520
Live show for you now.

22
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,560
Self is an infant.

23
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,560
How come always scary on show, says Doug Smith of Dallas, Texas?

24
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,620
Well, it's actually been some time since scary has been on the show.

25
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,820
We've tried to get him to come in, but he always has to go out smurfing through the solar system on his wind surfboard.

26
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,340
His solar wind surfer is 40 feet long.

27
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,000
Hey, strap in.

28
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,140
Show's about to take off.

29
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,720
About two and a half miles in wind.

30
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,220
Magnetic power.

31
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:21,940
Bob?

32
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,940
Oh, my God, the pilot's dead.

33
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,020
Gosh.

34
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:33,960
Welcome to the subgenius radio beast, Hour of Slap.

35
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,500
Rebound time.

36
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:45,440
This is actually Hour of Slap number 679 from April 1999.

37
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,560
Closing as Hour of Slap number 179.

38
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,740
2014 in the year of 2005 A.D.

39
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:02,080
As it says in Isaiah 28, 7, 8.

40
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:10,040
The priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink.

41
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,280
They are swallowed up with wine.

42
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,480
They're out of the way through strong drink.

43
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,220
They err in vision.

44
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,900
They stumble in judgment.

45
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,900
For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness.

46
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,120
And there is no place clean.

47
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,360
Yes.

48
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,160
We're being over.

49
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,300
Shut that baby up in there.

50
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,880
Babies, they get into all the subgenius shows.

51
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,180
But we will not let babies stop us.

52
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,660
We will continue the battle.

53
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,740
Let mortal combat begin.

54
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,080
Yes, praise Bob.

55
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,460
We're going to save the world.

56
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,580
A handful of people in a leaky boat are going to save the world.

57
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,880
And fuck me.

58
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,260
Uh, yes dear friends, we're back and oh, it's going to be a wonderful show now that we have

59
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,660
these departments and we have a format and everything.

60
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,620
Isn't that unbelievable?

61
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,360
All men and women defending your own world.

62
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,620
It's not about death.

63
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,400
It's about life.

64
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,260
Life.

65
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,560
Hey, life.

66
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,560
And in this new studio, friends, it's great because I don't feel guilty.

67
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,860
It's fun to do the show again.

68
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,680
Yes, it's fun, fun, fun.

69
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,040
And we have so many fun types and a fun format.

70
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,780
And we shall engage now and forever in mortal combat against God and all of the heavens

71
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,480
and all of the people in all of the worlds and all of the planets.

72
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,640
Praise Bob.

73
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,040
Yeah.

74
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,420
The conspiracy is no metaphor.

75
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,520
We talk about the conspiracy.

76
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,680
Are we discussing some literary poetic monster?

77
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,160
Say no.

78
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,900
Say no.

79
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,300
Say no.

80
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,260
No, we're not children.

81
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,680
We're talking about living, breathing, firing and giving us pain.

82
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,460
That wants to consume you.

83
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,440
That wants to take away your slack, children.

84
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,560
Are we going to let this go?

85
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,480
Take away your slack?

86
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,920
Say no.

87
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,600
Say no.

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,640
Say no.

89
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,400
Tell me something.

90
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,220
Who stands in the way of the conspiracy?

91
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,620
Who?

92
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:30,980
Who?

93
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,340
I can't hear you.

94
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:32,880
Tell me who.

95
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,340
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

96
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,420
Not me, not me.

97
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,520
Not, not, not me, not me.

98
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,700
Not me, not me.

99
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,660
Not, not, not me.

100
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,700
Not me, not me.

101
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,300
We see a flock of birds.

102
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,020
Think about.

103
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:48,980
Think about.

104
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,480
We need to just run.

105
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,480
Out of words.

106
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,120
Think about.

107
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,360
Think about.

108
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,560
When a ring goes round your car.

109
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,620
When you hear a given call.

110
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,700
When you ride chicks for a dollar.

111
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,480
Think about.

112
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,560
Think about.

113
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,580
When you ride to the subgenius.

114
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,640
Think about.

115
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,680
Think about.

116
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,000
B.O. Box 1403-06.

117
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,900
Think about.

118
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,540
When you cast your mojo hexes.

119
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,460
When you ride through Dallas, Texas.

120
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,080
When you.

121
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,200
Think about.

122
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,300
Think about.

123
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:18,420


124
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:19,760
Think about.

125
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:19,920
Think about.

126
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,360
1 dollar.

127
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,360
1 dollar.

128
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,420
1 dollar.

129
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,580
1 dollar.

130
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
1 dollar.

131
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,640
1 dollar.

132
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,780
1 dollar.

133
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,700
1 dollar.

134
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,720
1 dollar.

135
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,720
Now, next when you turn to the subgenius is.

136
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,860
You will pay to know, what you really think.

137
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,960
Flack can be bought

138
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,760
All the time i ride this.

139
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,300
.

140
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,520
You're gonna meditate for 5 years.

141
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:54,140
years. You've got to get baptized. You've got to do this. You've got to do that. You've got to

142
00:06:54,140 --> 00:07:05,260
forsake strong liquor. You've got to forsake sex. You don't need that to be happy. You don't need

143
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:12,540
that for slack. All you need is money. I don't care. I don't care what lengths I go to anymore.

144
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,380
All is fair and all that. Dr. Harris, you're a doctor. A doctor. Doesn't that mean anything to

145
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:23,980
you as a surgeon? I'm a doctor, but I'm a man also. You're under arrest! Something sick.

146
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:35,120
Something sordid, vicious, and depraved. Vagina. Vagina. V-A-G-I-N-A. It's a canal-like passage

147
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,940
between the uterus and an opening between the uterus legs. It is the place where sperm are

148
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:46,160
deposited by the father in the maiden. In the passage, the baby progresses into the

149
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,320
normal way of its birth.

150
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:54,600
Testicles. Testicles. Spelled T-E-S-T-E-L-O-U-K-A-N-E.

151
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:07,940
But we must kill them. We must incinerate them. Pig after pig. Cow after cow. Village after

152
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:17,240
village. Army after army. And they call me an assassin. What do you call it when the assassins

153
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,360
are killed? The assassins. The assassins. The assassins. The assassins. The assassins.

154
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:24,860
They accuse the assassins. They lie. They lie and we have to be merciful for those who

155
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:39,520
lie. Those nabobs. Nabobs. Nabobs. I hate them. I do hate them.

156
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,840
I love you. I love you.

157
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,820
Bye bye.

158
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,340
Bye bye.

159
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,420
Bye bye.

160
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,660
Bye bye.

161
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,580
Bye bye slurs.

162
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:12,260
casa cual

163
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:16,960

165
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:16,960


166
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:16,960

169
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,320
Oh, the lilting.

170
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,380
The benches are torn down.

171
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,540
This is a free concert.

172
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,840
The lilting sounds of Doc Stock number three.

173
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,060
Oh, friends.

174
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,240
Boy, is this a trip through memory lane.

175
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,140
There's some bad A going around.

176
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,340
Anybody's got any of this?

177
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,460
Give it to Jane.

178
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,460
Oh, listen to that lovely, typical doctor music in the old days.

179
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,640
They all learned how to play their instruments, unfortunately.

180
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,080
Then there was the more ascended music.

181
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,300
Mark Mothersbaugh did at one point.

182
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,940
It's a bucolic scene here at Doc Stock 93.

183
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:14,940
Jim.

184
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,260
Everybody's tired from driving.

185
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,760
They're all sitting around with needles hanging out of their arms.

186
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,940
And it's all free and you missed it.

187
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,980
Pretty soon all the stimulants will be here.

188
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,420
And then we'll all wake up and party all night.

189
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,760
And someone or maybe several people will be badly injured.

190
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,800
And the police will come.

191
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,620
And we'll be in the newspapers.

192
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,380
And it'll be another Doc Stock.

193
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,680
Another wonderful, lovely Doc Stock.

194
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,060
Oh.

195
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:50,780
.

196
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,300
Then it makes you tears well up in your eyes.

197
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:58,720
.

198
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,420
Things get confused out there.

199
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,860
Power, ideals, the old morality and practical military necessity.

200
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,060
.

201
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,640
But out there with these natives.

202
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,140
.

203
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:14,440
.

204
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,020
I think that it just goes on and on.

205
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,020


206
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,900
And while we're here, it must be a temptation to be guided.

207
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,360
seekers tendaco

208
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,080
We're asking to stop at this service.

209
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,400
We are not allowed to touchize

210
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,680
If you deliver this college, or convince another one of us not to put a 100 million

211
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,940
it is to Lord's community that may believe in us.

212
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,240
here to come in.

213
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,240


214
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,240


215
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,180
I have something wrong.

216
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,480
I couldn't.

217
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:39,720
Who's the farmer?

218
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:39,740
You.

219
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:40,960
Who attacked why?

220
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:40,960


221
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,160
Come a contest.

222
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,280
Who is that?

223
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,220
or, well, he was starting to do that.

224
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,380
She goes, no, you don't understand.

225
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,460
My son is mentally ill.

226
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,420
He's 40 years old and he lives at home.

227
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,580
And we're kind of like going,

228
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,080
well, I think church and subgenius

229
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,820
is the last thing you've got to worry about

230
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,520
with your son right now, man.

231
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,160
So, I don't know, maybe you're in the same boat.

232
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,740
I'll tell you what, though.

233
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,120
I do have the,

234
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,400
well, you don't look 40,

235
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,620
but I'll sneak you a membership pack.

236
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,480
I'll sneak you one.

237
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:19,140
Now, as the church was called by John Shirley,

238
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,040
I think the science fiction writer said,

239
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,440
the church of the subgenius

240
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,120
is the knife they smuggle in with the straitjacket

241
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,000
so you can cut yourself free when they're not looking.

242
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,800
But friends, you can't depend on anybody

243
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,420
to smuggle you that knife.

244
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,920
You have to learn how to escape

245
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,020
from the straitjacket yourself.

246
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,360
I actually,

247
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,920
I have an instructional video in Dallas

248
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,080
about how to do that.

249
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,740
I toured with a guy who escaped

250
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,540
from straitjackets every night

251
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,160
by dislocating his shoulder.

252
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,020
And it works.

253
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,900
But you know, to bust free of the conspiracy,

254
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,900
you sometimes have to bust free

255
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,140
of parts of your own body, I guess.

256
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,360
That's a grim way to look at it.

257
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,640
Easy for me to say.

258
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,820
You're a little leg-hold friend.

259
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:10,640
Huh?

260
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,380
A conspiracy.

261
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,660
He's a leg-hold friend.

262
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,120
You know, the sad thing about the conspiracy

263
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,280
is you see these human animals trapped in it.

264
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,420
And they'll have gnawed off all three legs

265
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,820
and that one leg's still in the damn trap.

266
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,720
That's why we call them humans, friends.

267
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,480
And another real basic thing that we've got down to,

268
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,640
you know, we've said for years,

269
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,020
church of the subgenius,

270
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,500
we're not harping on it.

271
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,140
We're talking about intelligence.

272
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,380
We certainly cannot afford to do that.

273
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,180
The only people that we disqualify from the church

274
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,240
are geniuses.

275
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,480
You know, anybody below that with 30 bucks

276
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,440
and even, you know, a genius can buy his way in.

277
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,420
Or brain damage his way in.

278
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,500
Or, like, usually, okay.

279
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,640
You know, it's not the intelligence that counts.

280
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,520
It's the sense.

281
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,220
Common sense, sense of humor, and dollars and cents.

282
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,580
One might call it something for nothing.

283
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,020
But the normals, the mediocratons,

284
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,180
the somnambulacks and pseudo-sumslans

285
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,600
have tried to make it something

286
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,880
which we've been led to believe we must work to buy.

287
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,460
It is this yearning for slackness

288
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,960
that separates us from them.

289
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,500
The human may live out his entire life

290
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,980
in a grinding cycle of slacklessness,

291
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,040
his hours consumed by meaningless toil,

292
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,660
interspersed with meaningless leisure.

293
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,180
Yet he never feels cheated.

294
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,660
He thinks it's natural.

295
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,480
Perhaps we should pity them.

296
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,880
But face it.

297
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,540
Most people are venal jerks.

298
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,440
Half-witted cattle racing each other

299
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,360
to be first to the slaughterhouse.

300
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,640
And stampeding you along with them.

301
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,640
What do you do?

302
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,220
To walk on a force.

303
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,740
That is the law.

304
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
To stand.

305
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,140
Slurp up our drink.

306
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,640
That is the law.

307
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,020
We are not men.

308
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,640
To eat flesh and fish anytime.

309
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,600
That is the law.

310
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,440
Yeah!

311
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,700
Now I am the law.

312
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,640
I shall escape.

313
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,540
That is the law.

314
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,040
No!

315
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,840
No!

316
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,200
No!

317
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:03,960
No!

318
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,280
No!

319
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:04,540
No!

320
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,800
No!

321
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:11,600


322
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:11,600


323
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:11,600


324
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:11,600


325
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:11,600


326
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:11,600


327
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:11,600


328
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:21,060
mailbox. Not to, not to shit in the house. Not to hump the master's leg. That is the

329
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:30,200
law. Not to lick one's own genitals in front of company. That is the law. Not to gnaw at

330
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:36,980
flea bites noisily while the master is trying to seduce a female. That is the law. We are

331
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:45,500
not men. Not to grovel and whine piteously for attention. That is the law. Not to fight

332
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:52,340
for mailman. Not to run out into the road in front of cars. That is the law. We are

333
00:16:52,340 --> 00:17:02,560
not men. The snake is long. The snake is old. The plan is unstopped. I had an operation.

334
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:19,540
They tampered with my brain some. It helped me see the reason for living in the system.

335
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:32,100
We've simply done away with unnecessary friction. If you act like a dumb shit, they will treat

336
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,960
you as an equal. Now do what I taught you. Now you do what I taught you. Now you do what

337
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:36,960


338
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,200
I taught you. Now you do what they taught you. Now you know what they taught you.

339
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:56,560
Oh, killing is the day, mom. Killing is the day, mom. Now you do what they told you. Now

340
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:03,340
you do what they told you. Now you do what they told you. Now you do what they told you.

341
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,960
Now you do what they told you.

342
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,980
And I can do what they told ya

343
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,960
You got the control

344
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,620
And I can do what they told ya

345
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,520
You got the control

346
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,220
And I can do what they told ya

347
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,340
Drones who died

348
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,360
Are justified

349
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,020
For wearing a bag

350
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,360
And your toes in white

351
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,360
You're justified

352
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,120
Drones who died

353
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,400
For wearing a bag

354
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,780
And your toes in white

355
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,140
Drones who died

356
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,160
Are justified

357
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,820
For wearing a bag

358
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,180
And your toes in white

359
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,220
You're justified

360
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,920
Drones who died

361
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,200
For wearing a bag

362
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,620
And your toes in white

363
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,240
Come on

364
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,460
Oh, no, you don't.

365
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,840
We have to work clean on this radio show.

366
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,100
The Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, friends.

367
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:28,160
And it's about time that I told you what you've been listening to for the last 20 soft minutes.

368
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,900
We've been playing a lot of, well, you know, friends, I'm sticking with this department's format.

369
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,160
Now that we have a format.

370
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:43,180
And we've heard a lot of the old-timey media barrage department.

371
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,820
In that we've been hearing some news.

372
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,320
Some tapes from the old Dockstock 3.

373
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:55,120
Back in the olden days, friends, before there was X-Day Drills, there was Dockstock.

374
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:01,120
And they were smaller, but a lot meaner and more wiry and uglier than X-Days.

375
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:06,860
And so they were like snails on a straight razor, if you know what I mean.

376
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,740
And we've heard some KPFA puzzling evidence of Dr. Howell.

377
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,600
That's the KPFA radio show, Subgenius show in Berkeley.

378
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:24,400
And it's the old media barrage from, it's just like, it's a barrage of media barrages.

379
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,880
Including Pope David Meyer preaching about the con somewhere.

380
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:35,280
And an old-timey Bob song, Onan Canobite doing Think a Bob.

381
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:41,680
We heard David Lynch ranting at X-Day about how Slack can be bought.

382
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,660
And we heard from the super intro sex barrage.

383
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,000
Media barrage number three.

384
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,800
Mark Mothersbaugh did the Babacato and Fugue in D minor.

385
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,800
And some of that other.

386
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:59,020
We heard yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang, ranting at Winterstar in 1999.

387
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:02,480
About the three legs and still in the trap.

388
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:06,580
And some outtakes from the Subgenius video arise.

389
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,100
The narration about humans, Slack and work.

390
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,420
We are not men from the island of Dr. Moreau.

391
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,700
And the law.

392
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,260
The Subgenius.

393
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,200
The Subgenius law.

394
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,100
Not to bite the mailman and so forth.

395
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,940
From the Einstein Secret Orchestra rehearsal last November 1998.

396
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,940
And in our rock song department, we heard Rage Against the Machine.

397
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,920
In an excerpt from Killing in the Name of on their first album.

398
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:41,340
In the background right now is Cypheria doing an instrumental called Gothic Disturbance.

399
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,420
You see.

400
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,720
And we'll play some new Bob songs.

401
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,900
Probably by Einstein Secret Orchestra.

402
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,760
And have our guest ranter department.

403
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,900
And our X Day Hymn department.

404
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,100
All the other departments.

405
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,640
Because, you know, as George Burns said.

406
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,060
With the collapse of vaudeville.

407
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,040
New talent has no place to stink.

408
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,880
He also said, George Burns.

409
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,800
The great George Burns said.

410
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,440
Too bad that all the people who know how to run this country.

411
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,440
Are busy driving taxis.

412
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,300
Cutting hair.

413
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,020
And posting to alt.slack.

414
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,740
And mixing radio shows.

415
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,360
Friends, it's true that with the collapse of vaudeville.

416
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,600
New talent has no place to stink.

417
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,260
Except for the church of the subgenius.

418
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,180
Friends, stinky new talent always can find, well, can find a home here.

419
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,920
If it's bad enough.

420
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,720
Because we run it through the committee.

421
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,700
And a committee is a group that keeps you up at night.

422
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:44,700


423
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,800
And keeps you up at night.

424
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,760
And it's a program that keeps you up at night.

425
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:47,760


426
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,880
And the radio does that because it keeps you up at night.

427
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,480
And it's a medium.

428
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,820
Because it is neither rare nor well done.

429
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,240
Well, the Hour of Slack is fairly rare.

430
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,700
Liberals, as Mort Sahl said.

431
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,900
Feel unworthy of their possessions.

432
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,000
Whereas, conservatives feel they deserve everything they've stolen.

433
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,660
Now, we the patrio-psychotic-anarcho-materialists.

434
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,120
just do what we can

435
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,180
that music was about to drive me nuts friends

436
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,740
and this probably will too

437
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,920
because I want to go on with some

438
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,540
these are some quotes that our friend Death Rocker X

439
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:34,000
on AOL.com sent to us

440
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,960
some quotes from the old but wise

441
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,580
including Henny Youngman who said

442
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,240
I wanted to become an atheist

443
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,040
but I gave up for they have no holidays

444
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,620
friends you can be an atheist and a subgenius

445
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,360
and we've got a lot of holidays

446
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,180
biggest one being July 5th 1999

447
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,040
well the last holiday actually

448
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,520
since the world ends that day this year

449
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,860
and you know

450
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:09,500
they call this the church of the subgenius

451
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,760
well you can imagine friends

452
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,220
we like to be an atheist

453
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:12,220


454
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,580
but we agree with Sam Levinson here

455
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,000
who said it's so simple to be wise

456
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,960
just think of something stupid to say

457
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,880
and then don't say it

458
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,040
and on that note I think I'll shut up

459
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,260
and play this song by Temple Beat called

460
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,880
this is an Italian band

461
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,360
and this is a song called

462
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,740
The Brain Cult of Macho Irony

463
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,400
where the king of all the old and the new

464
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,920
and his story is out on the air

465
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:49,920


466
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,720
and that's a world that grows

467
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,000
so above and beyond

468
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,220
itquiera

469
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,420
and it created this world

470
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,820
a search engine

471
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:08,820


472
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:08,820


473
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,160
Let's get to it.

474
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,100
The Morrigato

475
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,160
The reason Jesus

476
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,520
Seen her life, life, life, life

477
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,920
The sign

478
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,720
Of time

479
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,440
Where I

480
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,880
Speed up your compromise

481
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,680
The sign

The sign

523
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:19,880
boss. Not to cheat on taxes, that is the law. Not to dodge the track, that is the law. Not

524
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:27,520
to have extramarital affairs, that is the law. We are not men. Not to let your hair

525
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:34,340
grow long and shaggy. Not to go without makeup, that is the law. Not to go without a nice

526
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:42,400
suit. Not to curse in mixed company, that is the law. We are not men. Not to place the

527
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:49,760
fork on the right. Not to neglect sending out thank you notes after Christmas, that

528
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,460
is the law. We are not men.

529
00:27:54,340 --> 00:28:01,420
Thank you. Goodness gracious, what a simply horrible patchwork of noise that Church of

530
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,480
the Subgenius is.

531
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,080
I listen.

532
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:10,640
Every week to gather evidence and ammunition for the citizens for normalcy. Let me tell

533
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,960
you, we're not going to get those subgeniuses. We're going to get them right in the gonads.

534
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:22,840
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that. I don't use words like that. This tape, all

535
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:29,300
about Satanism, drugs, and rock and roll, is proof positive that this so-called church

536
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:33,320
is going to send the world to heck in a handbasket.

537
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:33,640
Yeah.

538
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,260
Yeah.

539
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:34,320


540
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:34,320


541
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:34,320


542
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:34,320


543
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:39,840
Those demented beelzebub kissing hop heads make me want to toss my Nestle stallhouse cookies

544
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:46,400
with their talk of buckets of pills from that low-life pusher J.R. Bob Dobbs, where they're

545
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:51,720
so high on drugs that they can't even keep any continuity in their tapes. Too many children

546
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:57,100
listen to these tapes and subscribe to the insane doctrines of the Subgenius Foundation.

547
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:04,320
They're led down a deceptive road to what these weirdos call slack, like that heathen

548
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:04,320


549
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:04,320


550
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:10,380
ist idea of nirvana. I say that slack should be taken up like the excess yarn in my knitting

551
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:15,580
and pulled until it sees the light of a normal day like the rest of us do. So what should

552
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:21,500
any decent-minded American do when faced with one of these zombies for Bob? Well, first

553
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:28,220
off, give them a bath in Pine Sol. They usually stink to high heaven. And then ship them off

554
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:33,980
to the nearest normally accredited deprogrammer while they get bombarded with enough people

555
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:39,580
magazines, arid extra-dry deodorant, and Regis Philbin fan club material so they won't be able

556
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:45,800
to think anymore the way it should be. Then they'll feed them real dogma about the glories

557
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:54,740
of the home shopping club, Wingo, Zingo, and the evils of Mandingo. We cannot stand by while our

558
00:29:54,740 --> 00:30:01,140
standards and principles are made light of by these possessed fools. Normals of the world unite.

559
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:17,640
Oh, that was Sister Chris, dear friends, from a long time ago, WFMU. I guess that would

560
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:27,260
be our guest rant. Sister Chris this time. What? Representing the citizens for normalcy.

561
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:33,360
Thank you. Wouldn't you like revenge on these mediocritans, these pink boys?

562
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:41,020
These box-dwelling Barbies and Kens? These normals who have made normality the norm?

563
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:09,820
Come on baby, let me tell you about the present in time. Here's a little bit of space to

564
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,360
answer all your problems.

565
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:23,360
You know I'm going to be so happy, so content. It's not a loss, it's more of a passing into

566
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:29,000
something wonderful and exciting for the whole rest of my life. So I want to say goodbye

567
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,280
and that I'm going to miss you all very much.

568
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:42,760
Because if you want to get out of those saunters, you can't be afraid of anything. You can't

569
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:48,100
be afraid of the pigs, you can't be afraid of the normals, and you definitely can't be

570
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:58,020
afraid of Bob. You go, what kind of pussy-pussing behavior is that? You might have some things,

571
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:02,980
but you can't, you can only get back to one place, and that is JR12.

572
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:04,540
Bob, stop!

573
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:12,120
You don't want to live is what you're saying! You don't want to live! You don't want to

574
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:12,800
pay Bob!

575
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:23,500
Because there's a conflict in every human heart between the rational and the irrational,

576
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:30,660
between good and evil. And good does not always triumph.

577
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:33,960
So, Bob, stop!

578
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:33,960


579
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:33,960


580
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:41,640
You know, sometimes the dark side overcomes what Lincoln called the better angels of

581
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:52,500
our nature. Every man has got a breaking point. You and I have. And very obviously,

582
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,620
he has gone insane.

583
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,860
Oh, yes, sir, sir!

584
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:03,960
Oh, yes, sir, sir!

585
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:03,960


586
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:03,960


587
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:03,960


588
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:03,960


589
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:03,960


590
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:03,960


591
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:03,960


592
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:03,960


593
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:10,180
And, uh, this is Reverend Ivan Stang with a live on-the-scene report here at Dockstock

594
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:17,560
No. 3. The drums you hear in the background are being played by two, it looks like three-year-old

595
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:22,500
girls. A couple of three-year-old little girls are playing the drums. They're not bad, actually.

596
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:27,460
It's a lot better than what some of the professional subgeniuses were capable of late last night.

597
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:33,960
We've got quite an amazing contingent of subgeniuses here. We, there's a, there's a, there's a,

598
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:40,500
uh, here's Jan Johnson from the, uh, Boston delegation. There are delegations from something

599
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,180
like 55, uh, states and 60 countries.

600
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,820
Countries, countries. Something like that.

601
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,580
Uh, we have these delegations from all over the country. There's Houston, uh, of course,

602
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:57,260
uh, Dallas, Little Rock, San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles, uh, Seattle. Pope Myers here

603
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:02,240
from Seattle. Uh, uh, we all come together for these, uh, yearly or bi-yearly meetings.

604
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,940
And the interesting thing is we don't have a lot of time. We don't have a lot of time.

605
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:11,720
We don't know why. We don't, there's no goal, no, uh, um, set plan at all. Uh, we just,

606
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:16,440
uh, we meet and then we try to figure out why. And usually we can't make the song stop.

607
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:23,120
I'm tired of one day. I'm sick of all this money. I want to play real music.

608
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:29,760
I haven't been here in weeks. I think I'm sick of all. I'm sick of all.

609
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,100
Yeah.

610
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:33,940
I think I'm sick of all.

611
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,220
I'm sick of all.

612
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,180
I'm sick of all.

613
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,540
I'm sick of all.

614
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:39,560


615
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,960
I'm sick of all.

616
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,500
I think I'm sick of all.

617
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:42,500


618
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,500
This infernal machine...

619
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:49,120
Is gonna win you to hell.

620
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,440
This infernal machine...

621
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,000
Gonna win you all to hell.

622
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:02,380
You will be looking through caverns of human flesh.

623
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,920
You think your eyes deceive you

624
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,240
But know what you are seeing is not a bizarre

625
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,920
But a real carnal sight

626
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,440
Men in wear and wailing

627
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,160
With their arms attached to the walls

628
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,120
Stapled there by cruel utterance of saucy methods

629
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,640
Nonsense and foolish ideals

630
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,680
These they utter until the dark hours of the morning

631
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,460
Until the sun once again relentlessly climbs up

632
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,400
And burns up, burns up, and burns

633
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,340
And where will you be, friend?

634
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,520
Will you be in a saucer full of milk and honey?

635
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,560
Will you be riding high off into the sky?

636
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,720
Will you see that silver lining on every cloud

637
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,520
As you whisk by on my infernal machine?

638
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:57,980
These machines don't work for you, friend

639
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,340
You

640
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,840
They don't work for nobody

641
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,900
Got their own criteria

642
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,300
Got their own agenda

643
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,800
Got their own suspenders

644
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,680
Goodbye

645
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,760
I'm done

646
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,480
Goodbye

647
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,600
That's true

648
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,420
We feel like the purpose of life is not happiness

649
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,440
Not happiness

650
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:29,720
Not knowledge

651
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,180
Or even truth

652
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,020
But merely to squirt

653
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,700
You can understand a church on a simple level of

654
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,380
Oh, some people think it's a

655
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:41,040
A Texas death and fertility cult

656
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,360
Some call it just another polygamous religion

657
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,040
Yeah, some think it's a great collaborative art project

658
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,400
Using the greatest anonymous artists in America today

659
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,360
And others just

660
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,560
Others just say it's my religion

661
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,000
Let me practice it

662
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,540
Remember, kids

663
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,420
Nothing is illegal at 100%

664
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,720
You had like 400 sub-genie businessmen decide to do it

665
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,220
That's right

666
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,920
And we had uh, we had that wonderful tape

667
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,920
Where you saw the young, naked, nubile maidens

668
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,840
Wrestling with Arnold Palmer's bloody head

669
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,240
Rolling in the mondo mondo hills of

670
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,960
Of Habba-frop-zipylat

671
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,240
You know, there is marijuana growing all over

672
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:18,760
Well

673
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,100
In these settings

674
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,220
Yes, it's true

675
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,320
There's a Habba-frop-zipylat

676
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,400
All over the Tibetan holy llama's grave

677
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,220
And it is one of the most maintainable

678
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:32,360
little shrubbers for landscaping around exterior office buildings.

679
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,060
Right.

680
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,060
Very tidy.

681
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,940
It's not a morbid situation at all.

682
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:36,680
No, it's happy.

683
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,320
It's like Bob is a Robot or The Attack of the Mutants.

684
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,420
It's like any movie of that sort that you've seen.

685
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,620
He's a cheery demigod.

686
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,180
That's right.

687
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,880
But the people that we're really concerned with are the artisans tonight.

688
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,040
We're talking about the small studios that support Bob's habit.

689
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:55,020
They crank out art in an amazing way, centralize it in Dallas.

690
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,560
The subgenius Air Force pickstep flies it to Dallas,

691
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,000
and the next thing you know, it's in the stark fifth.

692
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,860
And nobody gets paid for it except those who matter.

693
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:07,080
And others just say it's my religion.

694
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,420
Let me practice it.

695
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,820
You can't have sex without Bob.

696
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,140
You can't have money without Bob.

697
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:17,200
Girls, a dollar in the top two will come to you in the night.

698
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,760
Free pills!

699
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:27,440
Don't be left behind when the exits land.

700
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,080
You can't be left behind when the exits land.

701
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,020
You can't be left behind when the exits land.

702
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,600
You don't have to understand it.

703
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,900
You just have to buy it.

704
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,900
You have signed the application.

705
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,080
Welcome aboard.

706
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:46,900
And one doesn't listen long before a little warning signal goes off inside that says,

707
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,460
Watch out.

708
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,940
Sometimes it's hard to pinpoint the precise error.

709
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,420
But the language, the pure language of heaven is missing.

710
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,840
Something says, Look out.

711
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,920
This guy is fishing.

712
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,640
He's a cultist or someone with his theological wires crossed.

713
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,000
It's almost like listening to someone who knows only a few words of English,

714
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,500
but soon they're rattling off in a completely unknown language

715
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,260
when they haven't even been to kindergarten.

716
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,980
We eat more, drink more, play more, and do less to earn a good living

717
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,000
than any other people in history.

718
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,120
We have at our fingertips the world's greatest music.

719
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,620
And I might add a lot of its worst.

720
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,860
The cultists would have no following.

721
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,300
We are a people grasping nervously, sometimes almost hysterically for more.

722
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,000
I know that I know that I know that I know that I know

723
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,440
that I know that I know.

724
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,680
Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries,

725
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,500
the cruel and torturous executions,

726
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,700
it would be more consistent to call it the word of a demon.

727
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,360
There are little eyes upon you and they're watching night and day.

728
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,520
With a vocal and activist minority ready,

729
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,560
willing to burn the bomber's seal of fear for more.

730
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,300
And most, incidentally, are in their teens or their twenties.

731
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,180
And that's Washington, people, I'll tell you that.

732
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,820
They drove in caves, not high-rise apartments.

733
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,600
They may not have found a cheap affluence,

734
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:20,820
but they found an endless supply of dope,

735
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,320
uninhibited sex,

736
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,000
an endless supply of money.

737
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,920
Free access to a distillery,

738
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,440
I suppose.

739
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,760
Ah, yes, the harlot.

740
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,060
You can count on that.

741
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:36,880
Or kills.

742
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,200
Or more.

743
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,640
Why, friends, we could feed another nation with our garbage.

744
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,400
What more than a space hogger on Earth?

745
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,180
There's a church of geniuses.

746
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,300
I don't know.

747
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,140
But how many of you are really genuinely intelligent?

748
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,560
Bang.

749
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,840
Are you blaming God for atom bombs?

750
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,940
Or atomic bombs?

751
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:58,980


752
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:58,980


753
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:58,980


754
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:58,980


755
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:58,980


756
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:58,980


757
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:58,980


758
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:58,980


759
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:58,980


760
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:58,980


761
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:58,980


762
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,740
I don't know.

763
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:04,040
I only know that it will signal the end of time.

764
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:04,560
Why?

765
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,140
Bang.

766
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,120
Bang.

767
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,460
Bang.

768
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:12,060
The past blotted out, and the future assured.

769
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,040
Ah, yes, the harvest.

770
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:20,040
Laced with hundreds of beautiful, sexy broads.

771
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,860
A sex-stuffed gingerbread house.

772
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,980
Enter roommate's home.

773
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:28,980


774
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:28,980


775
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:28,980


776
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:28,980


777
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:29,800
It's Mitzi and Carol.

778
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,540
The party's now complete.

779
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,440
A time to strip down for action, and do as told.

780
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,780
Ready with the spell, sister?

781
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,340
Why that?

782
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,880
Ziggety zee, ziggety zing.

783
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,260
Demon of darkness, come on the wing.

784
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,660
Ziggety zee, ziggety zing.

785
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:54,720
And then, as the witches sing, the most horrible,

786
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,960
love-curdling howl filled the night air.

787
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:58,400
Ziggety zee, ziggety zing.

788
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:58,960
Demon of darkness, come on the wing.

789
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:03,640
And a gigantic bat-shaped, seemed to fill the sky,

790
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,520
blotting out the stars, blotting out the moon.

791
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,820
And in the velvet blackness, the ghostly trio,

792
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,980
and even the Halloween creatures, were terrified.

793
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,800
Get yourself a speculum.

794
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:21,020
Insert it, open it up, and take a look inside.

795
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,500
You can give yourself a basic gynecological exam.

796
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,580
Can you find your cervix?

797
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,160
Locate your goddess spot, otherwise known as the G spot.

798
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,960
If you really can't locate your goddess spot, beat it into submission.

799
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:48,400
She and her girls specialize in the sale of pleasure,

800
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:52,880
and the sins of the flesh.

801
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,160
Ah, subgenius women, oh.

802
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,720
At about this point, we think we've said all that there is to be said.

803
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,080
And certainly all that we're going to say.

804
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:07,820
Now, sit back, and enjoy.

805
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:17,740
So, Bob Dobbs, we meet again, for the first time.

806
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:21,540
Bob, I wept when you died.

807
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,340
Now I must kill you again, for my honor.

808
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,660
And for the honor of Connie.

809
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:44,780
It's pandemonium out there.

810
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:48,060
Things are floating, things are beginning to fly,

811
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:51,920
and you're inside the dome without an ounce of sense.

812
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,960
Don't look around for the nearest Evacogen.

813
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,620
Don't call the police.

814
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:01,840
Look inside yourself, and then wire up, hot wire and necks in,

815
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,480
to build a bog.

816
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,760
Cleaners and Maleficent mothers.

817
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:10,680
They're darker by the second, as the acrimony police begin to line the walls.

818
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:15,840
Now we see the Juniper-headed children, and thousands and thousands of the other rectal and young,

819
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:19,720
uh, uh, challenged children, trying to make their way up the slopes.

820
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:23,860
And the slopes are indeed high, for they've all been greased,

821
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:28,940
by the great Mumu himself, who blindly wandered throughout these caves,

822
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:34,080
back many thousands of years ago, hoping, praying, something like this would happen.

823
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:39,860
And especially not on a day like today, when the plutonium storms are literally raging,

824
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:44,020
and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of particles

825
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:49,080
are filling the nostrils and eyes and other oral cavities that they're carrying.

826
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,380
Some of them have been carrying them for weeks at a time.

827
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,620
They can hardly...

828
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:55,920
can hardly understand them.

829
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,080
Now I'm picking up... it seems to be a thermometer.

830
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,640
No, it's not. I... I'm picking up a...

831
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,260
Yes, I'm picking up a... a... a vision of children,

832
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,680
and these same small children, and handled by our moustaches.

833
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,800
And it's Christmas, and it's very sad.

834
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:16,340
There won't be any Christmas on Pluto this year.

835
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,160
They've all gone.

836
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:23,580
All the little sack-slack jocks,

837
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:27,060
all the butter-headed, pumpkin-headed boys are gone.

838
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:32,240
All the little tin-can-shaped girls with no eyes.

839
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,020
All of the doctors have...

840
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,240
All the doctors have left.

841
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,760
All the doctors have left.

842
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:42,240
And as we gaze upon this little pavilion,

843
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:45,520
surrounded by untold thousands,

844
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:49,320
as far as the eye can see, thousands of the shaved, bald-headed followers,

845
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:53,560
waiting for the doctors and the various delegations,

846
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:59,760
Dr. A.D. here is from the California delegation.

847
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,720
The promised land.

848
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,200
California's the promised land?

849
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,360
That's gonna be a desert in 20 years.

850
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,400
I know, but who... it's a promised land, but...

851
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,700
He didn't say who it was promised to, did we?

852
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,000
It's promised to the normals.

853
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,360
Well, so where will the subgeniuses migrate back to?

854
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:17,920
The South?

855
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:18,960
Camping.

856
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,100
Subgenius death camp.

857
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,560
But subgenius death is better than death.

858
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:24,440
It's better than normal life.

859
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,560
Bob Lowe.

860
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,060
Gravesball.

861
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:26,320
Whoo!

862
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,020
Charging a man with murder in this place

863
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,460
was like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500.

864
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,440
Keep going.

865
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:38,780
Keep going.

866
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,100
Yeah, that's right.

867
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,100
Next days are coming,

868
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,640
and the peaks are bummer.

869
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,360
Make sure we all think,

870
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,040
we're hips up, G-9.

871
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:58,460
We got us a window seat first class on the pleasure soffers, man.

872
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,520
You better work hard for your slap, Jack.

873
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,040
Bob will protect you.

874
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,620
Oh, come on, then.

875
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,820
He said they don't want to preach to people.

876
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,780
Yeah, the scalpers will be squabbling out there, man,

877
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:22,100
to sell you those over-insulated X-Day saucer tickets.

878
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,900
That all starts soon.

879
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,680
We're gonna be slamming down hard, man.

880
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,560
But let's just cut to the point.

881
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,020
I know most of you want slack,

882
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,680
but what you really want

883
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:39,920
is the alien orgies that really got us going, right?

884
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:40,720
Let's admit it.

885
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,300
Oh, I love to be an alien.

886
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,880
Many of you may have actually even heard

887
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:47,820
when I was abducted

888
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:51,460
on the way to score some growth cluster munchies years ago,

889
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:54,300
got abducted by the alien nymphoes

890
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,760
and actually had my little mini-deck there and recorded it.

891
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:01,880
The actual sounds of alien orgies in the pleasure soffers.

892
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:07,960
Oh, I love to be naked.

893
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:10,800
Morality, you know,

894
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,520
there ain't gonna be no morality in outer space.

895
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:14,960
You know, whatever comes and goes by, that's what's going on.

896
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,480
Well, another rule in the great morality

897
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,440
was that thou shalt steal a government,

898
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,000
issue rocket ship if possible.

899
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:24,420
Yeah.

900
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,140
Now, there's not a lot of them left,

901
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,760
and most of them are in museums,

902
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,760
and the last big one, the last Saturn V,

903
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,160
is actually, they moved it indoors now.

904
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,360
It's gonna be very difficult to get it now.

905
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,560
They have, like, guards around it and stuff.

906
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:44,020
Well, you know, there's gotta be another way to do it besides rockets.

907
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,060
What now?

908
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:50,400
Well, yeah, of course, there is, but, you know, to each our own.

909
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,260
Which is why the first commandment is,

910
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,340
thou shalt switch to flying saucers operated by gravity waves

911
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,560
as soon as is technically feasible.

912
00:48:58,900 --> 00:48:59,280
Right.

913
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,760
I think we maybe better go to a remote now.

914
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,800
It's like, oh, here they come.

915
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:07,080
Well, assembled here on the platform,

916
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,520
another paradigm about to be crunched

917
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,840
as the Tati crew gets ready to board their own homemade

918
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,140
midship rocket ship.

919
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,540
And then since the thing is approaching with a Bunsen burner,

920
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,160
they're going to try to ignite this flare that's on,

921
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,060
and it's gonna be a very, very hard, very hard,

922
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,800
solid rocket fuel with the Bunsen burner.

923
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,980
This is one dollar for a taxpayer,

924
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:31,300
but one billion dollars for the United States government.

925
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:32,580
My dollars.

926
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,100
It's one lung for...

927
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:34,560
What was that?

928
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,540
It's one lung for Bob

929
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:42,540
and one toothpick for, you know, the rest of it.

930
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,940
See, that's why this is always a psychic experience.

931
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:48,400
I was staring at a toothpick, wondering if I had a collapsible lung,

932
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,600
like Bob promised with them loboptomectomies

933
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,920
and all them other designs that he sends out.

934
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,840
How did you say that?

935
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,700
That's one lung for Bob...

936
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,440
One toothpick...

937
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:57,460
Loboptomectomy.

938
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,780
...and one toothpick for the rest of it.

939
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:03,400
What you do for the loboptomectomy is you go get yourself an Aerotec...

940
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,620
And it's all too cute.

941
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:06,780
G-engine.

942
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Stick it in your nose.

943
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,540
This is the triumph.

944
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:15,100
What I'm trying to prove here is what can happen...

945
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,380
I can't believe you made that.

946
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:22,180
...by eliminating all that is cute through disease.

947
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,920
Oh, that is a beautiful idea.

948
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,300
Caller, do you have gas music?

949
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:29,700
You know, I have... I'm afraid that we know this caller.

950
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,040
I'm afraid so, too.

951
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,720
I think he may have beat you to the scrotum so many times...

952
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:39,800
I have been ill, and through my illness, I have eliminated all of my inner cuteness.

953
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:41,700
Inner cuteness?

954
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:43,800
You're lying.

955
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,560
...with a gland problem.

956
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,360
Wait a minute. Is it still thirsty, or is it real?

957
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,000
It's Friday now.

958
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:53,280
No. No. No. It's not what you think.

959
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:56,080
No, I don't think this thing has anything to do with anything.

960
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:56,960
Maybe it's Tuesday.

961
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,080
No. See, Tuesday's in the background.

962
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,340
Friends, this is Bleepo.

963
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,280
That's what I was afraid of.

964
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,900
We thought you did. You were castrated. And, uh, somehow...

965
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,000
Bleepo, I felt a tremor in the force that...

966
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,340
I have.

967
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:12,440
...and I knew that you were very sick.

968
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,860
I definitely felt it.

969
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:15,520
I have an extra testicle now.

970
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,160
An extra?

971
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:17,500
Really?

972
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,040
Yes.

973
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,760
They found it, Stan.

974
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:25,500
Finally! Hey, listen, man. I've been looking for that thing for about 15 years now.

975
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:30,140
They grafted it to the front of my forehead. Right over my pineal gland.

976
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:34,920
Friday, your job is to retrieve the testicle from the old Bleepo.

977
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,440
I'm afraid of the cosmopolitan monkey and a...

978
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,740
I look really hot now.

979
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:42,000
I don't think that's Bleepo on the phone, even though he may have his nose pinched together.

980
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:45,900
As an expert of different, many different diamonds, I would say that this person...

981
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,480
Well, ever since the grafting, I've been asking...

982
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:47,840
I'm having...

983
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,720
It's just...

984
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,900
The women look at...

985
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,120
The women...

986
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,260
No, no, I am not hearing Westchester County.

987
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:54,560
...men, animals, people on the subway...

988
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:54,800
...people on the subway...

989
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,120
I'm hearing someplace a little further east.

990
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:58,960
I cannot not have sex at this point.

991
00:51:59,000 --> 00:51:59,200
What?

992
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,320
I always think that testicle was at Megan's Waddle somewhere.

993
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,200
It's not Bleepo.

994
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:03,980
He's from Yonkers.

995
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:04,460
This guy's from Yonkers.

996
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:07,380
Did you say you cannot not have sex right now?

997
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:07,500
Exactly.

998
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,880
I'm in a constant state of sex.

999
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,240
The nose never goes...

1000
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,820
I want that nut back, man!

1001
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,800
You're having sex with an imposter!

1002
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:17,340
This guy's a...

1003
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:17,460
Stan, I'm not...

1004
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:17,460


1005
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:17,460


1006
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:17,460


1007
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,920
He would give his nose nut.

1008
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,340
He told me it was okay to have.

1009
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:21,160
He would give his nose nut.

1010
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:21,160


1011
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,660
Yeah, well, I need it back now.

1012
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,060
Go ahead.

1013
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,680
Show some pink.

1014
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,580
And be sure you get paid.

1015
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,300
Who took these pictures?

1016
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:29,700
Did you...

1017
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:29,880
Bob?

1018
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:30,140
He did.

1019
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,100
Bye.

1020
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:31,680
Bye.

1021
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:32,900
Well, that's the way to tell...

1022
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,620
...rocket ship if thou gets the chance.

1023
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:46,460
Thou shalt switch from rockets to flying saucers propelled by gravity waves or the like as

1024
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:47,440
soon as you have the chance.

1025
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:48,880
As soon as it is technically feasible.

1026
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:55,060
Thou shalt not breach the seals nor compromise the airlock.

1027
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:03,300
Thou shalt retain optimal manual control over all ship functions no matter how supposedly

1028
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:07,280
trustworthy thine shipboard computer may be.

1029
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:12,620
Thou shalt keep clean and shipshape thine current spaceship.

1030
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:17,440
Thou shalt quarantine all alien viruses and viruses.

1031
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:22,100
No matter how good looking they might seem to be.

1032
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:31,180
Thou shalt not puke in thine own helmet nor befoul thine own moon hands.

1033
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:32,660
That's a good one.

1034
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:33,780
Those are strong commandments.

1035
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:41,020
Thou shalt not breach the seals nor compromise the airlock of the Akashic Aether.

1036
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,840
Thou shalt not die for the sins of the world.

1037
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:44,720
Those are very thoughtful.

1038
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,420
Here is another thing that we left out of our book.

1039
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:47,420


1040
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:47,420


1041
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:47,420


1042
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:51,820
We need to think about the spaceship propulsion and safety methods.

1043
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:53,480
Quarantine.

1044
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:55,760
Quarantine?

1045
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:56,560
Everyone needs quarantine.

1046
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,960
We need a quarantine chamber on the ship.

1047
00:53:59,200 --> 00:53:59,480
No kidding.

1048
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,720
I used to drink that stuff when I was a kid.

1049
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:01,280
Remember that?

1050
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:05,760
Think how stuffy it is after about 20 years on board an escape ship.

1051
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:11,940
Yeah, we'll have to go out and evacuate ourselves outside now and then in the void.

1052
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,480
What do you do about bugs?

1053
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,740
Alien bugs?

1054
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:15,560
Viruses?

1055
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,300
Fungus?

1056
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:16,300


1057
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:16,940
All this stuff?

1058
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:17,400
We're all in this together.

1059
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:17,400


1060
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:17,400


1061
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:17,400


1062
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:17,400


1063
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:17,400


1064
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:17,400


1065
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:17,400


1066
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:17,600
We're all in this together.

1067
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,400
I think about getting the ship perfectly sterile all the time.

1068
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:24,800
You just have to make sure that you get all the worst germs scrubbed out and put into Dave's

1069
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:24,980
room.

1070
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,380
Quarantine makes you sterile?

1071
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:29,220
Well, you know, if you do that, then that takes all the fun out of it.

1072
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:30,920
Well, I suppose everything makes you sterile, Dave.

1073
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:31,340
Well, no, no.

1074
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:33,000
That's why we put it into Dave's room.

1075
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:34,740
So that we can watch the germs in there.

1076
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:35,540
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1077
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:37,100
And then we sail to the other side of the air box.

1078
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:37,600
Right.

1079
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,200
Yeah, just funnel them all over the day.

1080
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,300
Do you think, you know, if a chocolatey, delicious chocolatey drink for children can give you

1081
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:45,780
a sterilization problem, what better are we than the Liebensraum Hitlers and all them

1082
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:46,040
guys?

1083
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:46,200
Oh, gosh.

1084
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,820
You know, we want to make room for germs.

1085
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,600
We've got prop!

1086
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:50,060
That's why we're fed.

1087
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:50,560
That's it.

1088
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,780
That's all there is to it.

1089
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,280
We've got prop and they don't?

1090
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:53,680
Yeah.

1091
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:55,720
That doesn't make any sense.

1092
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,960
Soon we'll have our own rocket ship.

1093
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,460
But this was the Princess Wee.

1094
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,420
If you doubt that for a second.

1095
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:01,420
But hell met the Weezing and the bumping in the background.

1096
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,320
Yeah, I better remember my origins.

1097
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,460
I think everybody should.

1098
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:06,040
Yeah.

1099
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,820
And here are the origins, friends.

1100
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:15,220
What we've been listening to, the tail end of side one there, we heard Sister Chris from

1101
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:16,020
WFAO.

1102
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:16,020


1103
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:16,020


1104
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:20,280
We heard the WFMU in the old days doing the Citizens for Normalcy rant.

1105
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:28,040
We heard Einstein's Secret Orchestra doing Let Me Tell You About a Place in Outer Space,

1106
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:33,660
Sister Decadence's X Day Farewell, and David Lynch preaching on X Day.

1107
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:40,420
Some Doc Stock number three report from the ancient days with the band that Dare Not Speak

1108
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,540
Its Name performing Sick a Bob.

1109
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:46,000
Einstein's Secret Orchestra doing this Infernal Rant.

1110
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:47,580
The

1111
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:53,680
various old KPFA with Glass Madness and Wellman on artists and frop.

1112
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:57,280
And Wellman's editor, you have signed the application.

1113
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:58,040
Ah, yes.

1114
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:58,980
The Harvest.

1115
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:04,040
Susie the Floozy did the Connie Collage and Annie Sprinkle's strip search.

1116
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:07,620
Friday Jones killed you for the honor of Connie.

1117
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:13,820
And of course Einstein's Secret Orchestra at Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Chaz, Bill T. Miller,

1118
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
X Days of Coming on Boston.

1119
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:19,240
1996 recording, and also check out this.

1120
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,320
I'm sorry Dave, I can't do that.

1121
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,080
Now his brain is growing.

1122
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:28,000
Five, four, three, two, ah, I can just smell that field coming.

1123
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:28,600
It's so wrong.

1124
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,400
July 5th in that big old field at Brushwood.

1125
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:34,440
Ah, ah, take it.

1126
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,460
First the little rockets go up, then the big rockets go up.

1127
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,980
And then the really big ones.

1128
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:39,020
And then the really big ones.

1129
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,120
Come on down.

1130
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:46,000
That's right, the rockets are our signal to let the saucers know that they're not ready.

1131
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,000


1132
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,000


1133
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,000


1134
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,000


1135
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,000


1136
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,000


1137
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,000


1138
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,000


1139
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,000


1140
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,000


1141
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,000


1142
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:46,920
It's time.

1143
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:50,960
We're ready for them to come down, to make that final step down.

1144
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:53,820
Put their little ladder down, their little rope ladder down.

1145
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:57,860
To let the saucers know there's still something down here on Earth worth saving.

1146
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:58,340
That's right.

1147
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,440
Step on up, baby, step on up.

1148
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,140
We've got a ride for you inside.

1149
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:03,140
Check it out here.

1150
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:06,560
We've got everything you could possibly need without a mind or imagination.

1151
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:11,160
You could go beyond what you've already thought because everything you can't believe is here.

1152
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,840
It's the Rocks in the Car.

1153
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:16,000
And all it takes, all it takes is a little bit of a ride.

1154
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:16,000


1155
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:16,000


1156
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:16,000


1157
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:16,000


1158
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:16,000


1159
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:16,000


1160
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:16,000


1161
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:16,000


1162
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:16,000


1163
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:16,000


1164
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,820
All it takes to experience all this is to be a member of the Church of the Subgenius.

1165
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:21,600
Praise Bob!

1166
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,080
Radio box, one four zero.

1167
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:29,320
Radio box, one eight one four one seven.

1168
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:33,520
Cleveland Heights, Ohio, four four one one eight.

1169
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:36,640
I can't do my cute husband voice now.

1170
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,420
I can't do my cute husband voice now.

1171
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:41,800
Can you just see everybody?

1172
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,760
I can just see the whole Brushwood people, the whole community there, the whole Ex-State

1173
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:45,940
community.

1174
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,100
And one big circle around the launch pad.

1175
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,160
And most of the girls aren't wearing shirts.

1176
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:54,220
No, and they're all, and everybody's just grooving and, and here, this is playing.

1177
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,560
Yeah, while we jam them out.

1178
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:57,060
Yeah, man.

1179
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:58,580
Yeah, all boogin' back and forth, man.

1180
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:00,040
Feel that love vibe.

1181
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,980
The love vibe.

1182
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,540
Jesus Christ himself will be there blessing and anointing the young.

1183
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,120
Yeah, I like that.

1184
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:12,880
Yes, Jesus must bless each one of those Rockets as they go up.

1185
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,920
And you can be there to witness.

1186
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:20,700
And the new Diablo, Satan himself, will be there to curse those Rockets as they go up.

1187
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,760
But who's gonna win?

1188
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,820
Jesus, Satan, or Bob?

1189
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:24,680
Well, you know.

1190
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,600
Well, Christ, Bob, Bob will be there.

1191
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:27,000
That's right.

1192
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:31,160
And you know, the Rockets do rise on a column of fire.

1193
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:35,020
But underneath the fire, it leaves behind a column of clouds.

1194
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,780
So you have hell and heaven all there.

1195
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:39,700
It's all a metaphor.

1196
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:44,820
The Rockets are a big metaphor for the cycle of the absurdity of life.

1197
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:45,040
And they connect us through the thin veil of fire.

1198
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:45,720
Weak behind the veil of fire.

1199
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:45,900
Weak behind the veil of fire.

1200
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:45,900


1201
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:45,900


1202
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,200
And they all end up on their heads.

1203
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,260
That's the miracle of it all.

1204
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:49,700
That's right.

1205
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:55,320
Sometimes the parachute pops out, and sometimes it don't.

1206
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:01,140
You wanna make your own rocket.

1207
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:03,560
You wanna keep your own ship-shite.

1208
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:05,080
Ship, ship-shite.

1209
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,240
What was that, Friday?

1210
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:09,760
For the launchings, you wanna make sure if you're taking your own rocket ships, make

1211
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:14,340
sure you have a good platform trunk or some kind of semi-rig on the New York State Highway

1212
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:14,700
Patrol.

1213
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:17,940
The patrol will be out looking out for those rocket ships on the top of Toyotas.

1214
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:24,360
Also make sure that if you're trying to fly there via Pyro-Fletchlance, the smoke bands

1215
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,360
aren't affecting most of Chautauqua County.

1216
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,900
Man, listen to Friday on that guitar.

1217
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,000
Oh, man.

1218
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:29,800
He bitchin'.

1219
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,960
That bitch be bitchin'.

1220
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,260
It's gonna be better than that when it's live, man.

1221
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,140
They're always better live, those people.

1222
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:41,040
Where can people get information on this, Reverend Stang?

1223
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,760
There's a little something just called Tom.

1224
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,340
Of course, the subjunius website.

1225
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:47,320
.

1226
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:48,560
.

1227
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:49,400
.

1228
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:49,400


1229
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:49,900

1230
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:50,180

1231

1233

1234

.

1235
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:50,360
.

1236
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:50,360


1237
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:50,480
.

1238
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:50,540
.

1239
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:50,580
.

1240
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:50,640
.

1241
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:50,700
.

1242
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:50,720
.

1243
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:50,780
.

1244
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:50,780


1245
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:50,800
.

1246
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:50,820
.

1247
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:50,820


1248
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:50,820


1249
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:50,860
.

1250
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:50,860


1251
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:51,100
.

1252
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:51,100
