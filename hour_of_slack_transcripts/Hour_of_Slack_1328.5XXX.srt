1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,180
Now, this one came on an unauthorized piece of paper.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,020
It looks like a political handbill.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,760
Yeah, a handbill of Tom Letson, your state representative Democrat.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,220
But on the back it says,

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,280
What?

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,560
Question mark, exclamation point, the fuck?

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,080
With an umlaut over the fuck.

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,940
So it's what?

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,000
With a question mark and an exclamation mark.

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,220
And the fuck?

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,500
W-T-F.

12
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,640
And on the other side, Tom Letson, your state representative Democrat.

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,000
Well, which one of those is the question?

14
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,860
Which one of those is the question?

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,440
You know, at least Tom lets on.

16
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,360
But this guy doesn't.

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,360
You know, he's keeping it close to the vest.

18
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,180
All I'm going to say is, if you don't ask questions,

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,860
you can't expect to receive an answer.

20
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,560
So in order to receive the fuck,

21
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,380
you must...

22
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,740
precede it with the what.

23
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,400
As you have done.

24
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,140
And I thank you for your emolument.

25
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,120
Impressive evidence.

26
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,480
You sex robot.

27
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,700
Freeze, douchebags!

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,980
Goddamn hotline!

29
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,500
This place is surrounded.

30
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,020
Art's got my back.

31
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,020
Don't move, assholes!

32
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,880
Matt's guarding the back door.

33
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,380
Yo!

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,380
And Bob's covering the harbor.

35
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,260
This is so stupid.

36
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,600
Asshole destroyed all of Zebulon.

37
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,020
Who would do such a terrible thing?

38
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,540
Yes, well, it's actually a funny story about that.

39
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,560
The subgenius power of...

40
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,760
Son.

41
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,960
Oh, son.

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,760
I was wrong about you.

43
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,420
There are so many definitions of a hero.

44
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,880
But for me,

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,300
someone lazy,

46
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,040
lifts you up,

47
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,200
and gives you hope

48
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,520
when some dickhead

49
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,100
throws your planet into the sun.

50
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,040
It's J.R. Bob Dobbs,

51
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,740
the living slack master

52
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,300
in his church of the subgenius.

53
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,500
With this two dollars

54
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,600
came this question,

55
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,160
and I bet you haven't gotten this one before.

56
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,360
That would be a relief.

57
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,960
Why does it hurt

58
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,160
when the other guy pees?

59
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,280
Because you are a noble being,

60
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,560
blessed with empathy,

61
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,380
and you can't help but wince a little bit

62
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,500
when you see some other brother

63
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,980
in a moment of pain.

64
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,580
You take that pain upon yourself,

65
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,780
because you are superior.

66
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,880
Yes, you are.

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,360
All false modesty aside,

68
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,500
most people peeing in there

69
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,380
don't give anything for the other person's sensations,

70
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,700
but you think even of that.

71
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,840
Perhaps even you think too much

72
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,260
of your brother's welfare,

73
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,140
and should think more about your own.

74
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,160
You're a lucky subgenius

75
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,060
to throw the match, so to speak,

76
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,560
and light the fire that consumes

77
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,380
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

78
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,240
And Bob will burn as a martyr to his cause.

79
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,940
There is a thirty dollar

80
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,960
minimum bid for this privilege.

81
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:42,760
We'll have an auto-da-fay

82
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,020
that you auto-attend.

83
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,160
We'll have the paperwork,

84
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,760
the De Camborendo Heretico.

85
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,320
And then you can be the one who

86
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,380
Get the civil arm to perform the execution.

87
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,360
Be the person who the shirt

88
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,900
that was heard around the world.

89
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,000
You could be the one whose

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,720
finger flicked the match

91
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,420
that lit the final fuse

92
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,100
that burnt J.R. Bob Dobbs.

93
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,640
Right, and it's a thirty dollar minimum bid,

94
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,820
so keep that in mind.

95
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,860
The ultimate revolutionary.

96
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,220
We're not doing that tonight,

97
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,780
because I want to wait.

98
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,220
After all, it's only money.

99
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,960
In all the future history books,

100
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,600
when they're showing the end of mankind,

101
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,360
and they're showing the final burning of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

102
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,360
it'll be your image.

103
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:22,840
Your hand.

104
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,880
That is in there.

105
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,340
Perhaps just your fingernail,

106
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,680
perhaps just your thumb,

107
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,880
and index finger,

108
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,640
but it will be your...

109
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,520
That will be enough to identify you.

110
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,460
You will be the person.

111
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,360
A minimum bid of thirty dollars.

112
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,960
We're not doing that on today's auction.

113
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,820
I want to allow everyone

114
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,280
their fine opportunity to do it,

115
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,600
but I wanted to preface it now,

116
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,020
so that you would consider

117
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,200
how cool it would be

118
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,900
to be the one.

119
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,300
Indeed.

120
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,200
Dear friends, this is an excellent opportunity

121
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,740
for us to sit down and try to purge from our minds

122
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,840
all those vestiges of conspiracy thought,

123
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,560
because it's just natural.

124
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,580
They've burned it into our brain,

125
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,900
so we hear things like this,

126
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,280
and we think,

127
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,820
well, why would I want to spend thirty dollars on a match

128
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,080
that I could have bought a similar match

129
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,260
for only a dime at Walmart or something?

130
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,080
No, no, it's not the value of the match

131
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,760
that establishes the thirty dollar minimum bid.

132
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,300
It is the story behind the match

133
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,520
that establishes the value of that match.

134
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,780
Here's another favorite.

135
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,520
It's called,

136
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,960
You're Ugly, But Your Tits Are Big.

137
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,240
Thanks, man.

138
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,560
You're Ugly, But Your Tits Are Big.

139
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,200
Get your face away from me!

140
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,560
You're gross like gas, that's why you're free!

141
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,520
Skip the preliminary shit!

142
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,180
Stop me, get my hands on your tiiiiiiiiiit!

143
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
You're ugly, but your tits are big.

144
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,080
You're ugly, but your tits are big.

145
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,740
You're ugly, but your tits are so big.

146
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,940
You're ugly, but your tits are so big.

147
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,720
Face like a frog, you're like,

148
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,340
hey, I'm the reason why!

149
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,380
Guys, serve me!

150
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,360
Don't try to kiss me at all!

151
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,780
All the rest, just let me get my hands on your briiiind!

152
00:05:59,340 --> 00:05:59,860
You're ugly!

153
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,660
But Your Tits Are Big!

154
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,900
You're ugly, but your tits are big!

155
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,300
You're ugly, but your tits are so big!!

156
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,460
Shhhhhiii...

157
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:06,460


158
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,600
We're the men,

159
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,540
We're the men,

160
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,040
We're the men,

161
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:14,940
I always realize,

162
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,000
I always realize,

163
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,960
I always realize, please stop judgein' me!

164
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,320
Please stop judgein' me! You're ugly, but your tits are big!

165
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,800
Just to let you know, this was not our big show.

166
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:53,580
Friends, that was Fat Free, the band Fat Free from Brooklyn.

167
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,980
You can find them on MySpace.com under Fat Free Music,

168
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:05,500
playing live at X Day, 14, 14 X Day Drill, whatever,

169
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,360
at Wisteria Campground.

170
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,280
A song called You're Ugly, But Your Tits Are Big.

171
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,540
Obviously, this is one of our triple X rated episodes of the Hour of Slack

172
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,360
and will not be on any of the broadcast stations.

173
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,280
The titles for the show were by,

174
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,300
Slander Bob, who does We Slack Radio,

175
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,260
which is like all subgenius radio of all the shows all the time.

176
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,160
You can find that under the radio section of subgenius.com.

177
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,500
And let's go back to the stage now at Caffeine's,

178
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:49,880
the cafe at Wisteria during 14 X Day Drill.

179
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,060
Of course, the subgenius says,

180
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,240
how many of them are going to go,

181
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,800
diving into the bonfire in order to retrieve that match

182
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,100
that actually lit the Bob's effigy?

183
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:04,020
We may have to pull out all the screws.

184
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,460
And then we'll have to have more clues

185
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,640
to stop other Bobbies from charging into the bonfire

186
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,500
to retrieve the ashes of the Bobbies

187
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,420
that charged into the bonfire to get the match that lit the effigy.

188
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,880
I see the way your mind works, Papa Joe.

189
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,720
I see into the bottom of your mind.

190
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,040
You want to form a chain of self-immolating,

191
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,820
emitting Bobbies who will burn like torches

192
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,460
for the edification of the rest of us on X Day.

193
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,320
If we're not careful,

194
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,720
we may not have anyone here for the saucers to pick up.

195
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,840
It'll just be a pile of smoldering ashes.

196
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,000
Well, that will help those saucers escape Earth's gravity well.

197
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,160
Besides, another thing that our alien friends can do

198
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,660
is reconstitute people from ashes.

199
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,700
It's a process called palinogenesis

200
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,360
that the ancient alchemist Borellus investigated, first of all.

201
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,560
Well, that's a good question.

202
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:53,560


203
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:53,560


204
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,440
Well, that's essential so that all the subgeniuses

205
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,160
who have lit themselves on fire and protested the conspiracy

206
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,120
You just have to collect all the ashes

207
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,000
and secondly, don't mix them up with other people's ashes

208
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,960
or the wrong kind of ashes

209
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,560
because then you get, in the words of the text,

210
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,180
the most lively awfulness that springs up

211
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,000
and is incapable of death.

212
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,700
Even though for liability reasons

213
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,400
we never want to encourage suicide in the subgenius cult,

214
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:21,660
we do suggest...

215
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,320
The problem with all these occult arts

216
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,540
is if you make even the smallest mistake,

217
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,580
you bring so much grief.

218
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,380
So, although we're not suggesting that,

219
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,320
we are saying that if you are to set yourself on fire,

220
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,260
please do not do it on a windy day.

221
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,820
Those ashes need to remain in the pile.

222
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,900
And also, let's get it straight.

223
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,780
No one here told you to set yourself on fire.

224
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,800
If you do that, that's your idea.

225
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,100
We're simply talking about this as a form of speculation.

226
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,740
And most importantly, if you do set yourself on fire,

227
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,380
be sure to close the matches.

228
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,160
Do not strike that match.

229
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,780
With the folder open,

230
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,720
terrible accidents occur when that happens.

231
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,560
As it says on all of your membership cards,

232
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,520
the subgenius foundation is not responsible for its actions.

233
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,000
He got that from Burning Man.

234
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,720
Meaning the owner of the car.

235
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,380
On the Burning Man ticket, it says that

236
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,100
by attending you acknowledge your...

237
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,680
the possibility of your being seriously,

238
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,500
permanently injured or killed, you know,

239
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,720
and we're not liable for your form of fun.

240
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,460
So, the same it is with us.

241
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,440
We don't want to tell you to pull your punches,

242
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,060
to ameliorate your fun,

243
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,120
have the most hardcore fun imaginable.

244
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,780
But if you do and regret it later,

245
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,300
it's not our fault.

246
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,260
We simply provide you the natural vector

247
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,740
for you to follow your inward inclinations.

248
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,460
It probably wouldn't be a bad idea though

249
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,760
for us to develop an actual release

250
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,640
that any subgenius who is about to...

251
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,280
It's in the thing, but...

252
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,300
It's in the thing, but...

253
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,260
Everybody has to sign it and send it in,

254
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,520
which no one has done.

255
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,540
Well, I'm just thinking of something

256
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,660
that we could put out on perhaps the internet,

257
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,840
so if they do something away from the campsite,

258
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,100
whether it's some sort of...

259
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,480
Oh, on the internet, they can virtually sign it.

260
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,460
They can virtually attend X-Day

261
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,960
and virtually leave on the saucers

262
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,380
and do everything at a fake remove

263
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,800
while masturbating with the other hand.

264
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,320
And it would be an official note saying,

265
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,600
I just want to make sure that the authorities

266
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,000
and my family know that what I'm doing here today

267
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,300
has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that I'm here.

268
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,760
has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that I'm here.

269
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,440
has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that I'm here.

270
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,160
Well, if you have to,

271
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,340
Well, if you have to,

272
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,260
follow every little niggling detail,

273
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,460
cross every T and dot every I,

274
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,060
every jot and tittle,

275
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,360
if that makes you feel better,

276
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,080
why, go ahead, Pilgrim.

277
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,380
And yet they probably get one of their blood-sucking lawyers

278
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,400
just to turn it right around on us and say,

279
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,540
see, that proves it.

280
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,080
Well, as I said the other day,

281
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,740
stay out of the legal system,

282
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,720
stay out of the medical system,

283
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,980
stay out of the religious system,

284
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,600
stay out of any system.

285
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,280
All the conspiracy is is a series of emails

286
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:53,280


287
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:59,980
interlocked systems which you want to avoid because it's so much easier that way which is

288
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,120
another thing that leads you directly to the church's subgenius being that it's the only

289
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,900
religion that is clearly not a religion in the religious way and an only system that isn't

290
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,600
really a system and the only organization which is completely disorganized

291
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,260
this is tranquility base the eagle has landed

292
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:35,540
jesus h christ houston we're on the fucking moon over

the fucking moon over

305

the fucking moon by the evolution control committee uh live at uh 14 x day drill it was uh an amazing

306
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,520
night really really amazing um and you can find the link in the description below if you want to

307
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,860
read all of it also there's a link to the evolution control newsletter as well if you're not

308
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:44,860


309
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:51,780
aday again the evolution control committee at evolution the background the international

310
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,540
evolution tad ville of buddha communication but i believe at times he makes the difference

311
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:02,880
of the life and more nuclear power what is really didn't get the right

312
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:02,940
special could you comment on that

313
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:02,940


314
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:02,940


315
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,500
yeah that's it

316
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,680
Megans should appreciate that.

317
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,800
It's part of their history.

318
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,680
Bob will be emulated.

319
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:18,820
Bob himself.

320
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,900
You know, we used to burn a cheap replica Bob.

321
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,100
Nowhere near as good as that clever robot there.

322
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,660
Just an icon.

323
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,500
A quickly thrown together wooden icon.

324
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,620
But this year, friends, we're promising you something very, very special.

325
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,880
If you ever saw that movie, The Wicker Man,

326
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,480
it's a little bit like that.

327
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:49,720
We don't have quite as large of a man to burn as Burning Man does.

328
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,380
But then Burning Man has been gradually growing smaller.

329
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,740
No, he hasn't.

330
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,420
The pedestal's been growing higher.

331
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,160
The what?

332
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,200
The pedestal's been growing higher.

333
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,000
Oh, I see.

334
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,620
Because I thought that they had let him grow.

335
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,840
No, every year it's more and more elaborate with more doodads,

336
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,960
and now the man is way up there.

337
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:11,740
Well.

338
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,920
Praise Burning Man, but I'm glad I don't run that festival.

339
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,260
I can tell you that running X-Day is tricky enough.

340
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,620
Running Starwood is ten times as tricky.

341
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,020
And Burning Man is like 10,000 Starwoods going off all at once.

342
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,760
Only without the spiritual stuff.

343
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,780
It's tricky and sticky and icky, too.

344
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:41,400
Yeah, it's real icky because of the body paint everywhere.

345
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,100
And the water.

346
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,020
Spilling on everybody.

347
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,700
And no water to wash.

348
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,980
Every time we breathe or we shit or we eat or we sing or we dance.

349
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,320
No.

350
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,360
Is it because he's so handsome?

351
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,420
Maybe.

352
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,880
But mostly it's because J.R. Bob Dobbs does not give a shit.

353
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,240
Now you might be saying to yourself, oh, Jehovah, Wan, and Buddha, and Brahma, and Krishna,

354
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,860
and all those other supernatural powers in the universe.

355
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:11,860


356
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,840
Don't give a shit either.

357
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,620
My S.O. left me and my dog died.

358
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,560
My job sucks and the rent's due.

359
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,540
But that's where you're wrong.

360
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,820
You see, the supernatural powers of the universe care.

361
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,080
They just don't like you.

362
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,620
Jehovah Wan cares.

363
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:36,340
He cares enough to watch your every infraction and write it down in his big ledger book in the sky.

364
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,000
He watches what you eat and when.

365
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,860
He watches what you eat and when.

366
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,280
He watches every time you polish the bishop or flick the bean.

367
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:50,760
He takes careful note of the positions in which you copulate, the speed at which you drive on the highway,

368
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:55,940
and how often you pack into a little stone building at ass o'clock in the morning and sing poorly.

369
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,780
And don't forget about the Buddha.

370
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,060
Oh no, he cares.

371
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:06,300
He cares enough about your soul that he wants you to wash away all of its flavor by sitting in one place for days on end humming.

372
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,680
And he won't even let you eat bacon.

373
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:12,860
Exactly.

374
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:19,780
And don't get me started on Ra and Freya and Osiris and Odin and all those other old school pantheoners.

375
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:28,180
Sure, they'll send you rain one day when you pray for it, but the next they'll burn your village down and the day after that they'll turn into a goat and fuck your mom.

376
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,060
Well, fuck those guys.

377
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,720
That's the kind of service you get when you put your faith in gods who care.

378
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,740
Well, maybe.

379
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,640
Well, I hear you say, maybe I'll just put all my faith in science.

380
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,320
Science is supposed to be objective. It won't put all that crap on me.

381
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,380
But that's where you're wrong again, friends.

382
00:18:51,560 --> 00:19:01,120
Because even the gods of science like Richard Dawkins and Charles Darwin will have you believe that we are related to homo-pinking sapiens.

383
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,440
Well, fuck those guys, too.

384
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,020
We don't need them!

385
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,760
We don't have to listen to them.

386
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,940
Hell, we're subgeniuses. We ain't gotta listen to nobody!

387
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:25,740
And when we crawl from this battlefield for the soul onto the perfectly manicured lawn of J.R. Bob Dobbs, what is it he asks of us?

388
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,360
Just thirty dollars.

389
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:32,840
And when we ask him what it is that we should do or how we should behave, he just says,

390
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,220
Do whatever the fuck you want. Now get off my lawn and go slack off.

391
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:43,040
If you want to eat a pound of bacon on the steps of a mosque every Friday morning, you eat the hell out of it.

392
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:50,660
If you want your enemies strucken down in a painful and hopefully embarrassing manner, you're gonna need to do it yourself, because Bob has got shit to do.

393
00:19:51,720 --> 00:20:05,260
And if you want to spend your week in the woods with a bunch of friends and strangers doing whatever the hell you feel like because you've got nothing better to do and it's better than the whole entire year that you've had so far put together, well, more power to you.

394
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,080
And that is why we Praise Bob.

395
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:24,020
Friends, that was Reverend Janice Blackseed ranting at 14X Day, and we'll hear a little bit more ranting and so forth from there coming up.

396
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:30,840
First, Reverend Pandemonium, followed by the great DJ Shafer. Praise Bob.

397
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,200
Reverend Pandemonium is a fire-threatening, dangerous, and dangerous act.

398
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:36,200


399
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:36,200


400
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:36,200


401
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:49,180
Do you, as an artist and a fine subgenius with a much better memory than mine, and Reverend Pandemonium, do you reject a conspiracy in all of its unpleasantness and crap and inconvenient, useless laws?

402
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:49,800
Fuck yes!

403
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,020
Okay, and it's Bob, and fuck Connie. That's good enough.

404
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:53,620
Yeah!

405
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:54,900
There you go!

406
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,820
Another saved one.

407
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,320
Is there a certain number of men that have to do it?

408
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:03,760
We need another.

409
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,440
We need another.

410
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:05,980
There's another op.

411
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,420
There's a decently clad gentleman.

412
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,720
Yes, decently clad at the request of my wife.

413
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:19,700
I don't blame you a bit. I'm decently clad because I know exactly what you're looking for, and it ain't there.

414
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,160
She's being smart. That's the insurance policy.

415
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,540
This is my 25th year, by the way.

416
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,000
Year 25! For this subgenius.

417
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,900
I would have thought you were a little older than that.

418
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,380
No, I said Bob, $30. I think...

419
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,160
25 for being reborn unto Bob.

420
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:42,720
The minute you guys changed it to $30 was, I think, the minute that I sent my $30 in. It was 1980.

421
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,780
His love of Bob was so great that he waited until the price went up.

422
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,500
Exactly.

423
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,340
That's what I call true slackable faith.

424
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:50,880
Indeed.

425
00:21:51,620 --> 00:22:00,160
Reverend DJ Shaver, do you reject the low-paying jobs and all the crappy wedding gigs?

426
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,080
Oh, yes.

427
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,840
The awful birthday parties?

428
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:03,760
Oh, no.

429
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,240
The family get-togethers?

430
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:05,480
Yeah.

431
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:10,940
And accept into your heart and mind the promise of X Day and the promise of Bob?

432
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,660
Sure.

433
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,260
Sure, whatever.

434
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,220
And the love of Bob is done.

435
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,160
Fuck the chicken dance!

436
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:28,720
This has actually been a wonderful X Day so far.

437
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,620
We're looking forward to burning the body of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

438
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,860
And dancing around his corpse.

439
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:44,000
That's kind of the whole idea around this religion is to deny it and believe it with all our hearts at the same time.

440
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,200
That's the way I feel about life, the universe, and everything, in fact.

441
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,400
Kind of depends on what mood you're in, I suppose.

442
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,920
I'm in a good mood right now.

443
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,300
Well, I'm looking at a naked Susie the floozy.

444
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,940
What's not to love?

445
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,160
Oh.

446
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,600
TNA is back.

447
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,400
It's better than DNA.

448
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,940
Well, thank you.

449
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,180
Thank you.

450
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:08,940
And thank you.

451
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,940
And praise Bob.

452
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,720
Praise Bob.

453
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,980
Praise Bob!

454
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,540
You want to give us a praise Bob?

455
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,460
Praise Bob!

456
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

457
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:18,780
Woo!

458
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:19,820
Woo!

459
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:20,560
Woo!

460
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,540
Woo!

461
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:21,900
Woo!

462
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,080
Woo!

463
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,200
Woo!

464
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:22,660
Wait.

465
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,680
Wait for it.

466
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,320
Cut.

467
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:24,620
Pray, moon.

468
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,000
Thank you, thank you.

469
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,840
A masterful cut at that.

470
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,580
Now, we should go get some film.

471
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:33,580


472
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:33,580


473
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,400
I'm going to do this all over again.

474
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,200
I'm going to have to buy one of those 3D TV sets now.

475
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,860
And now, a special message from Priestess Pisces.

476
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,120
Please stand by.

477
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,600
Just a reminder, for the auction today, we will be auctioning off a unique opportunity.

478
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:55,280
The opportunity is that we will be burning Bob, setting him on fire.

479
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,640
Setting him on fire.

480
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,680
And for a minimum bid, bids will start at $30.

481
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,580
You can be the one to...

482
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,640
To kill Bob yourself.

483
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:13,880
You can light Bob ablaze and be proud to know that you were the one who finally killed Bob.

484
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,280
His eternal light.

485
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,780
You can fry that high E-pop's damn ass.

486
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,600
Again, it's going to be a minimum bid of $30.

487
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,540
Minimum.

488
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,780
You alone will be free of Bob's baleful influence.

489
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,980
The important thing is there is no maximum bid.

490
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,240
No maximum bid.

491
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,080
And remember, you paid $30 to love Bob.

492
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:41,120
You should pay at least $30 to hate Bob.

493
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,040
And if you feel bad about it, you can always think of it as a sort of cremation ritual.

494
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,880
So you're liberating him from his mortal coils.

495
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,380
Exactly.

496
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:50,780
Exactly.

497
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,200
And that will be on today's Bulldada auction.

498
00:24:53,460 --> 00:25:00,620
The burning itself will take place obviously on the evening, late evening, of the 4th.

499
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,500
But we will...

500
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,680
You have your shot to do that today.

501
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,940
So spread that around.

502
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,560
Here's one with some nice artwork.

503
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,160
Oh, great.

504
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:10,900
Hieroglyphics.

505
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,480
Excellent.

506
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:11,820
Yeah.

507
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,600
Little Devo hat, a pipe, an axe, a bone.

508
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:22,700
Who ultimately decides the difference between, quote, avant-garde and, quote, kooky bullshit?

509
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:30,760
The question is who ultimately decides the difference between avant-garde and kooky bullshit?

510
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,340
The answer is the survivors.

511
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,080
The survivors write the accounts and make the decisions.

512
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:48,980
Survive the avant-garde with your kooky bullshit, and you find that not only were you the avant-garde, you were the derriere-garde.

513
00:25:50,340 --> 00:26:00,740
We've got two of them in a row that are printed on our Jenkum Chamber requests, which actually these should be being taped up inside the...

514
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:00,940
Yeah.

515
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:00,940


516
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,320
Sweat lodges.

517
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,840
And they may still be.

518
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:04,500
Yeah.

519
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:12,300
It's part of an experiment to see how quick it takes the staff to take them down, even though you can't actually flush a...

520
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,160
Is that the correct spell of Jenkum?

521
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,780
I believe so.

522
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,400
J-E-N-K-E-M.

523
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,780
I thought it was U-M, huh?

524
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,800
I guess I was wrong.

525
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,100
We'd have to check Wikipedia on that.

526
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,300
Anyway, the question is...

527
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:25,760
Let's have it.

528
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:26,740
How...

529
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,480
Oh, how many licks does it take to get through bed?

530
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:31,480


531
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:31,480


532
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,800
Bob's bullshit.

533
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,200
Actually, this is written in an odd grammar.

534
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:43,540
How many licks does it take to get through Bob's bullshit does it take?

535
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,860
Question mark combined with...

536
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,960
How many licks to get through Bob's bullshit does it take?

537
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,460
That's perfectly grammatical.

538
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:56,200
Well, you can lick Bob's bullshit all day and never get to the center.

539
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,260
I think we all know that.

540
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,120
If we could get it, we could go home and forget this.

541
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:00,600
But no.

542
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,300
The distance to the center infinitely expands.

543
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,140
There's a lot of licking left.

544
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:17,000
Here's one I think inspired by the folk tale that Dr. Leguim told at X Day last year.

545
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,520
Yes, that was a wise folk tale.

546
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,220
Ken has bear ripe?

547
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,540
Ken has bear ripe.

548
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,060
Oh, hi.

549
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,300
Oh, hi.

550
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,360
Oh, hi, oh.

551
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,100
Wisteria, Ohio.

552
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,500
Round on the ends, high in the middle.

553
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,460
Yeah, that's right.

554
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,800
Ken has bear rape.

555
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,940
Who can't?

556
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:47,960
You don't know whether you can bear rape, especially by a bear, until the moment occurs.

557
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:55,900
Otherwise, it's vainglorious vauntings and boastings that have no connection with any appreciable level of reality.

558
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,340
The best thing, as any sage would tell you, is not to be raped by a bear.

559
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:09,380
However, let us hope that we have martyrs who would be capable, even under those stressful circumstances.

560
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:21,860
You know, when heretics were burned at the stake, they often managed to make gestures indicating that they were still confirmed in their heresies, even though they were on fire.

561
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:30,020
If they can do that, some pre-epic bear isn't going to be the ultimate barrier against self-expression.

562
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:38,120
But stay away from its huge, glistening bear penis, dripping with gleet and seething with fleas.

563
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,780
That's a...

564
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,120
I'm quoting the classic story.

565
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,320
I'm getting turned on now.

566
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,100
You wrote those lines.

567
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:45,700
Yeah.

568
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,080
Here's another one.

569
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,780
We keep getting questions without money.

570
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,760
That is sad.

571
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:58,480
Why would anyone in their right mind want to stay away from the huge, glistening bear penis?

572
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,480
.

573
00:28:59,480 --> 00:28:59,480


574
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,620
Some folks are particular, I guess.

575
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,260
They have another preference in mind.

576
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:14,120
And remember, if you can actually actualize your own fantasies, you'll feel absurdly self-satisfied.

577
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:28,700
If your idea of yourself that is the most resonant to you and most congruent with your self-love or amour-propre involves being ravished from behind,

578
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:33,040
like by a giant bear, then that is what you should seek.

579
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,280
And don't let me keep you back.

580
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,180
This is a related question.

581
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:43,580
How much antidote pudding for the face-fucking-bats-with-barbed-dicks is available?

582
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,080
I'm not in charge of the commissary.

583
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:55,760
What this contains is a little bit of the face-fucking-bats sexual pheromones.

584
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,680
It's necessary to consume the pheromones.

585
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:58,680


586
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:58,680


587
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,600
Oh, thank you.

588
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,420
For that reason.

589
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,380
Otherwise, they won't come and land on your face.

590
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:10,540
In the Roman amphitheaters, in those jolly old spectacles in the Colosseum,

591
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:19,840
they used to get animals to rape their victims by smearing the animal's sexual sauce on the victim.

592
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:28,100
This was the secret of the animal trainers, which was guarded especially by the torturers' guilds in ancient Rome.

593
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,680
Right.

594
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,180
But now, but in the passage of time, all secrets come to light.

595
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,660
I'd say that suggests a new sport for next X Day.

596
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:40,960
Well, remember when you wouldn't bring the yellow jacket attractant?

597
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,260
Right.

598
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:47,840
I suppose you have a different mind now to spread this on certain troublesome people.

599
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:56,740
We're going to avoid legal entanglements, but then after the ceremony, of course, all things are wide open.

600
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:02,540
It says on the schedule that there will be a Bulldada auction after the...

601
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:05,820
The increasingly less popular Bulldada auction.

602
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,820
Well, do we have anything more to sell?

603
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:08,860
I don't think so.

604
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:16,480
I don't know what kind of a Bulldada auction that could be unless we auction IOUs or favors or something like that.

605
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:23,640
We already auctioned off the right to kill Bob tonight at the Icon Burning.

606
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,120
That was the last thing we sold.

607
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,360
We already sold.

608
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:36,860
I just spoke, by the way, to the fire master, St. Kenny, who said we can start it with the push of a button.

609
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,620
A button?

610
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,340
What's the fun of that?

611
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,340
Who was it that bought the right to kill Bob?

612
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,240
Ministry of Slack.

613
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,720
Oh, Ministry of Slack.

614
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:55,040
Ministry of Slack or one of their representatives will get to push the button and light the match.

615
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:01,200
Actually, several of them could light the match and make it look like they're setting this great fire off.

616
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:06,940
But it'll have to be up to the Ministry of Slack whether or not you are so designated.

617
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,360
I need everyone to come up to the stage.

618
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,880
Everyone come up.

619
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,740
There's a sacred ritual that is about to take place.

620
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,980
I'm going to start handing out...

621
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:22,640
Now, as we know, the Church of the Subgenius, one of our sacred things is sacred noise.

622
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:28,840
And a procession is about to begin for the burning of Bob.

623
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,340
So, I hope I have enough toys.

624
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:36,040
I've got whistles and little spinny things.

625
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,020
This one, by the way, is the one that annoys me the most.

626
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,300
Do we have any Juggalos?

627
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,440
No, seriously.

628
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,640
You're not a Juggalo.

629
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,860
No, not Jiggalo.

630
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,320
Juggalo?

631
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,240
Because I have magnets so you can figure out what the fuck they do.

632
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,320
Alright.

633
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,520
Those of you who do not have an instrument will just have to sing poorly.

634
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:14,060
If you will meet at the road directly behind the stage, the sound booth right now, please.

635
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:21,580
Can we all congregate at the road behind the sound booth at this moment, please?

636
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,100
Why don't we do it in the road?

637
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,100
Everybody meet at the road.

638
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,820
Do you endorse and authorize the burning of Bob?

639
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:35,860
I hereby endorse and authorize the burning.

640
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:46,940
I here indeed hereby authorize and endorse the burning of this excellent robot Bob, created by the great Wilhelm Stahlhelm.

641
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:51,440
Beautifully helmeted Wilhelm Stahlhelm, I must add.

642
00:33:52,640 --> 00:34:02,040
I see our fire experts, St. Kenny and St. Jason, are hard at work strapping Bob down so that he does not escape.

643
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,020
He's not struggling very hard, I know.

644
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,540
That's odd.

645
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:13,300
I'm amazed at how peaceful Bob looks.

646
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,000
He seems so at ease.

647
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,680
You see, for Bob there is no moment without slack.

648
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:26,480
He does not know the meaning of vampire slack.

649
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,580
Kill that motherfucker!

650
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,620
Yeah, slay that fucker!

651
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:34,040
Kill that motherfucker!

652
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:39,440
Kill that motherfucker!

653
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:47,000
Good lord, I could swear they're pouring gasoline upon Bob Dobbs himself.

654
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,640
Back up just a little, it's gonna shoot some flames.

655
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,620
St. Kenny is making the crowd scream.

656
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,380
Bob, stand back.

657
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:59,720
Because the slack emanating from Bob is so great, especially when he's turned on by pain.

658
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,040
And bondage.

659
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,820
He's into bondage, obviously, we can tell.

660
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,320
What an amazing spectacle.

661
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:21,720
All of these subgeniuses, all standing around ready to watch the man they love the most feel the most possible pain.

662
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,040
That could ever happen to a man.

663
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,380
And yet Bob himself seems so happy.

664
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,760
Ah, you see the power of Bob.

665
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:45,780
He is almost as if he is made of asplastics.

666
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,180
He's almost as if he is made of asplastics.

667
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,880
Even the power of this intense flame.

668
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,240
It's almost impossible to burn him.

669
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:03,540
There goes an arm, finally, one arm.

670
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,660
Oh my god, the face!

671
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,440
The hell of a horrible face!

672
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,400
Is that Mike Jones?

673
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,980
Good God, Mike!

674
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,220
How can this be?

675
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,760
How can this be?

676
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,280
Oh my God!

677
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:36,720
Dear Lord, God in heaven, what hast thou wrought?

678
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,000
Kill Bob! Kill Bob!

679
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:48,220
Strangely, he has a spot on his head, a lip-up.

680
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,400
A spot on the top of his head.

681
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,000
It appears to be where his soul is escaping.

682
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,540
Kill Bob! Kill Bob!

683
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,400
Oh my God!

684
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,000
No!

685
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,300
Kill Bob! Kill Bob!

686
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,140
What can this mean?

687
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,940
What can this portend?

688
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,520
Look at the...

689
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,180
It's on the map here.

690
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,100
He went so fast.

691
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:14,240
Did you look at the top of his head as his soul is escaping?

692
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:19,380
You can actually see the soul of Bob emitting from his head.

693
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,700
So that he can then join another body.

694
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,220
Claiming head good, extinguished head bad.

695
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,060
Claiming head good!

696
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:36,040
This is the most protest, horrible, monstrous thing I've ever seen.

697
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,440
Claiming head good, extinguished head bad.

698
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,240
You guys keep that hole open.

699
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:48,600
How can these people just be grinning with happiness as J.R. Bob Dobbs himself?

700
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,520
He's nothing but a pile of ash.

701
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,960
The soul is still attempting to escape from the head.

702
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,680
The center of the top of the head or the third eye.

703
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,180
His skeleton is revealed.

704
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:10,820
We can see a skeleton made of what appears to be wood.

705
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,720
Could Bob's bones be made from the same material as his pipe?

706
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,700
I don't know.

707
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,100


708
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,120


709
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,120


710
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,140
What a bizarre, bizarre and horrible sight this is to see.

711
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,080
He went so fast.

712
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,860
I think he wanted to go.

713
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,940
I think he wanted to go fast.

714
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:36,380
You know, most people scream when they're immolated.

715
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:40,160
Most are witches and others are burned.

716
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,940
But look at his skull.

717
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,600
The crown of his skull. There's smoke coming out.

718
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,880
Is that perhaps, that is the soul.

719
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,180
Could that be the soul of Bob escaping finally?

720
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,300
Are we hailing perhaps?

721
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,960
Are all of us?

722
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,940
But where do we put him?

723
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,420
Where do we put him?

724
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,260
There it is.

725
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:08,440
There it is.

726
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:08,560
There it is.

727
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:09,640
There it is.

728
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:09,700
There it is.

729
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,620
There it is.

730
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,800
Die, die, die, motherfucker!

731
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,640
Die, die, die, motherfucker!

732
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,360
Die, die, die, motherfucker!

733
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:20,380
Die, die, die, motherfucker!

734
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:24,900
They seem to believe that he has made love to his own mother at some point.

735
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,340
Perhaps that explains the origin of Dobbs himself.

736
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,940
Die, die, die, motherfucker!

737
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,620
Die, die, die, motherfucker!

738
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,620
I'll never understand the love-hate relationship that Dobbs has with his followers.

739
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,280
On the other hand, look at his followers.

740
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,540
I mean, he's a true surprise.

741
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,540
I don't want to do that.

742
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,620
Fuck her! Fuck her! Fuck her!

743
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,580
Not a whimper. Not a single whine.

744
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,260
He didn't even laugh or chuckle.

745
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:10,220
There's still a little bit of soul escaping from the crown of his soul.

746
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:10,640
That's what they call it.

747
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,360
They found that other things besides J.R. Bob Dobbs are a flamma.

748
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,560
This could be a big advance for so-called team Bob.

749
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:28,600
You know, so far we've never learned how to burn anything but Bob.

750
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,700
And now we've found that T-shirts can burn.

751
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:36,860
I wonder about Bobby's and stupid fucking dumbass followers.

752
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,980
Would it be possible for them to...

753
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:44,220
Raise his mattress!

754
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,860
Raise his mattress!

755
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,400
Raise his mattress!

756
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,460
Raise his mattress!

757
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,640
Raise his mattress!

758
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:51,880
Raise his mattress!

759
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:55,820
This is where we can follow the fire.

760
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:01,460
The horrible, horrible death of Bob.

761
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,660
And the naked human.

762
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,460
Our subtenuous lady.

763
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,380
Love this site.

764
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,200
Dying God. Naked women.

765
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,880
Oh, now I get it! That's what religion is all about!

766
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,600
Dying God. Naked women.

767
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,640
We figured it out! We finally figured out the...

768
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,960
The formula!

769
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,880
The perfect formula!

770
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:27,820
Watch, watch, watch, watch!

771
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:35,140
Well, now we can have a new subgenius calendar with, uh...

772
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:39,040
With a heart slowly frying J.R. Bob Dobbs' face.

773
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,080
It looks like something out of Indiana Jones.

774
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,940
A bloodthirsty French heartbreak.

775
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:52,200
You know what? For a whole week they've been worshipping that deceptive face, Bob.

776
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:56,820
And now, they seem to be so happy to free themselves from their...

777
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,880
Failful mind control.

778
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,160
Oh, they're burning me!

779
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:01,960
They're burning me too!

780
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,300
Bob!

781
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:08,020
I think our priorities can mix that.

782
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,740
They want to have intercourse with this skeleton or-

783
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,500
With a burn system.

784
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,780
Ne-I-I-I-I...

785
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,600
There's so many other things around here in this place, like...

786
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,340
Oh, I know a whole lot.

787
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,460
Bob a Q! Bob a Q!

788
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,060
Bob a Q! Bob a Q!

789
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,860
Bob a Q! Bob a Q!

790
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,200
Bob a Q! Bob a Q!

791
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:37,000
Baba Q! Baba Q! Baba Q! Baba Q!

792
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,380
You're really getting off on this, aren't you?

793
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,780
We send up, they send down, that's the deal.

794
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:49,400
We send up, they send down, that's the deal.

795
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,500
Yeah, so I guess this is what religion is all about.

796
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,420
Yeah, naked women dancing around a dying god.

797
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:05,840
A horribly dying sacrifice to God.

798
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,720
Boy, I sure hope the exodus comes tomorrow.

799
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,440
I hate to have to do this, it's really horrifying.

800
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,240
And yet, in a way, is it not inspiring?

801
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:24,480
Yeah.

802
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:33,940
I think it's inspiring, Reverend Ankara, to see the emotions, the feelings, the religious spirit finally built up.

803
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:44,940
They've been laughing and joking all day, but finally they go into that sort of cave person mode where they appreciate the spiritual things.

804
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:49,540
The more refined things, like a guy burning today.

805
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,300
Yeah!

806
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,740
I mean, this is like a

807
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,280
This is what congratulations means to a man.

808
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:05,200
This is what makes a man good.

809
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:05,200


810
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:05,400
In today's new life, we know that you don't have to live exactly as what the numbers of

811
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,560
Christians are saying for you to make a bag like this.

812
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:07,560


813
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:07,560


814
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,220
Pushes.

815
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,340
You know they have wings.

816
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:10,340

819
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:19,200
You need to look forward.

820
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:19,600
You do.

821
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,500
A horribly tortured man and women with no shirts on.

822
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,840
You know, there's...

823
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,080
Boredom for another year.

824
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:33,600
Well, that's the most movement I've seen out of subgeniuses in about ten years.

825
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,860
Usually it's hard to get them off their ass to do much of anything.

826
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:44,780
But you make a good enough replica of Bob and there they go.

827
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:49,020
It's winding down, I'm gonna gather them up.

828
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,300
Give folks an opportunity to fuck around on the stage.

829
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:55,440
Pisces has the ability to gather them up.

830
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:56,920
Yes, they go in my boobs.

831
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,420
They all go in my boobs.

832
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:00,940
She's the cute cat.

833
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:05,840
Dr. Legume, on the other hand, has the ability to brainwash Pisces into doing that.

834
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,480
God only knows what he brainwashed me into.

835
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,040
Huh?

836
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,120
It's a little poor brainwashed servant to brainwash the other four.

837
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,840
Personally, my brain doesn't feel washed at all.

838
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,900
It feels dirty and tainted.

839
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,820
I feel like I've seen something I wasn't used to.

840
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,440
Which can be kinky for some people.

841
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,720
That was a certain...

842
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,640
You know, I was just saying.

843
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,380
Usually you can't get the subgeniuses off their fucking asses to dance.

844
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,080
This is different.

845
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:44,760
I guess the big difference is the reality of the body.

846
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:48,240
How realistic the dog's corpse looks.

847
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,860
It could be in direct proportion to their enthusiasm.

848
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:52,380
Yeah.

849
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,720
Well, and they're in a new pipe.

850
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,420
That's called a penis, doctor.

851
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:03,260
No, the other thing that was hanging out of his neck.

852
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,740
What's that thing hanging out of Bob's neck?

853
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:08,260
Well, the pipe has roots that go all the way down.

854
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,880
Yeah, but there was stuff under his head that I didn't recognize.

855
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,760
Really? Yeah. It was just like...

856
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:18,700
I mean, normally with Bob, there's nothing hanging down from his neck.

857
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,480
But he had this like meat thing hanging down from his neck.

858
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,620
It was just in some kind of weird little...

859
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:23,980
A wobble?

860
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:24,640
...toskety.

861
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,680
I think they call it a body.

862
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,840
You know, I didn't even notice that.

863
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,480
I've been trained to notice just the head for so long that I...

864
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:36,580
That wasn't Bob at all.

865
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:37,940
It was an unrealistic Bob dog.

866
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:40,080
Maybe that's the thing.

867
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,120
A body, yeah.

868
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,780
We were missing a body all that time.

869
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,480
It could have been so simple.

870
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:51,000
We could have been bigger than Scientology or Church of All Worlds even.

871
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,480
What happens when you can't keep a straight face?

872
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,160
I'm bleeding.

873
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:56,940
I'm going for batteries. I'll be back.

874
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:58,980
Hey, I've got batteries in my pocket.

875
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,380
Ah, yeah.

876
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:05,280
Yes, friends.

877
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:10,580
The burning of Bob at 14X Day Drill.

878
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:16,640
Thanks to Reverend Ankara and Pisces for helping me record that.

879
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:21,460
And just absolutely amazing.

880
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:30,060
I want to put the video on YouTube, but obviously it's going to take some serious editing.

881
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:38,580
Friends, this is the Church of the Subgenius Radio Show called the Hour of Slack number 1328.5XXX.

882
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:40,560
Internet only.

883
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,060
Burning of Bob special.

884
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:46,980
And now from Cult of Zere.

885
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:49,580
A little piece called Kill Bob.

886
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,660
Kill Bob.

887
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,000
Kill Bob.

888
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:57,340


889
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:58,060


890
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:58,060


891
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:58,060


892
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:58,060


893
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:58,380
Kill Bob.

894
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,580
Kill Bob.

895
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,840
Kill Bob.

896
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,020
Kill Bob.

897
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,860
But it's not done every National Day.

898
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:08,200
It's involved throwosta...

899
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,900
Now there is no accusation Dalir did.

900
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:18,200
distinguishment of gunот?,

901
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:18,200


902
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,220
I won't deny it.

903
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,580
I got it all wrong.

904
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:25,140
There is a reason I did that.

905
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,200
I know.

906
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:27,320
But a quote from vampireкам involved there.

907
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:31,360
And howοι are going to claim their body were burned up and donated into a station,

908
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:31,620
who ethnic,

909
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,820
Miss petite"!

910
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:38,660
mother and father. I don't want to do anything specifically. What do you want? I don't want to

911
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:47,020
do. What do we do? We have a point. We say bring back Thor. You're dead. You're gone. You're out.

912
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:54,120
We put you to death quietly. Yes. Yes. This is outrageous. I wouldn't do anything. I keep

913
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:59,340
reiterating over and over and over again. I'm saying you should go out and kill people. You

914
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:03,000
should go out and stir up destruction. You can kill people. You should go out and contribute

915
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,120
to the thingy on the population. I wouldn't do anything. I would. I'm saying life overall,

916
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:13,500
the whole organism of the planet Earth. I'm saying people who are too stupid to die. Nature,

917
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:19,360
positive evolutionary impulse. I'm saying continued life on Earth. I'm saying my survival.

918
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:26,120
Sure. I'm saying eyes. I'm saying the industrial economy. I'm saying tribal situation. I'm saying

919
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:32,520
the planet. I'm saying the air, the trees, the water. Frank, yes. Who loves you? Who?

920
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:36,600
Bob. Bob. Who loves you? Bob. à.

921
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:36,980
.

922
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:37,340
Fall of nail,

923
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,320
lay in what.

924
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:39,320


925
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:39,680
A movie star with a

926
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,100
robot.

927
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:44,660
Crטýrlveft note then HollandACE hit the middle.

928
00:49:49,300 --> 00:50:02,500
But still ball. Chille Bea. parte. mem saurodom

929
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,840
Kill Bob.

930
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,960
Kill Bob.

931
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,800
Kill Bob.

932
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:10,840
Kill Bob.

933
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,240
Kill Bob.

934
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,920
Kill Bob.

935
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:27,300
Friends, that was Kill Bob chopped up by Cult of Zere,

936
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:30,780
who can be found at cultofzere.info.

937
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:34,240
Zere is spelled Z-I-R.

938
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,260
cultofzere.info.

939
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:39,580
If you want to know more about anything played on this show

940
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:44,740
or anything subgeniously, look at subgenius.com

941
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:47,040
and click the radio button.

942
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:53,140
It has logs of this show and links to everything we play

943
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:58,160
and every past show ever done by any subgenius anywhere.

944
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,320
I'm going to let this...

945
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,760
This extra long...

946
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,160
Since it's not for the radio or anything,

947
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,960
who cares how long it is?

948
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:10,940
Cult of Zere, at the end of his album,

949
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,460
which I can't remember the name of.

950
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,960
It's a subgenius album.

951
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:23,340
Did, as he and his partner, Reverend Todry Milk Toast,

952
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:28,140
were driving to X-Day from Portland, Oregon,

953
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:29,740
where they're from,

954
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,380
they had to go through Kansas.

955
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:36,560
And their description of driving through Kansas is 16 minutes long,

956
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,200
but I've driven through Kansas before,

957
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,400
and I must say,

958
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,180
for those who haven't,

959
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,280
this is the best way to see Kansas.

960
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:48,980
That's all I can say.

961
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:52,800
Price Cult of Zere and Reverend Todry Milk Toast.

962
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:57,600
Okay.

963
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:58,940
Okay.

964
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,720
We are driving through space.

965
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:09,080
Pilgrim of Fort, number 427129 or 1280129 or 2.

966
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:17,200
Indian Jackass 129 or 09 or 599 or 1 or 1 1 or 1 or 1 2.

967
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:19,780
It looks like it's fucking working now.

968
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:25,080
Goddamn, Kansas is a time vortex.

969
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:27,960
Never come here if you can help it.

970
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:30,160
It's not even funny.

971
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,760
They do have a what?

972
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:33,980
Taco John's?

973
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:34,560
Something like that?

974
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:38,040
The important thing to remember is that we're trapped in 1993,

975
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,380
and we can't get out.

976
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:42,620
These planes are butthurt.

977
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:44,940
These planes are butthurt.

978
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,580
This has been a state of nothing but butthurt.

979
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:48,900
It's been looping in time,

980
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,960
just looking at the same fucking dotted line the whole goddamn time.

981
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,940
I am so very...

982
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:57,300
You get the idea.

983
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,960
Oh, we were just...

984
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,800
What were we gonna talk about anyhow?

985
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,940
Well, I have to rant about Kansas.

986
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:11,580
Because I'm sitting in this seat, and we're locked in at 75 on cruise control,

987
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,220
which we've been doing for the past eight years.

988
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,640
And we still can't get out of Kansas.

989
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:22,820
We aged about ten years the last eight years, which is like three minutes Kansas time.

990
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:27,160
Which is why everybody looks so fucking old and pissed off all the time.

991
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,820
And no one has any teeth.

992
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,300
There's no dental work in Kansas.

993
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,720
It hasn't arrived yet.

994
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,400
I lost ten teeth.

995
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:36,780
Milk Toast had to put them back in.

996
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,720
And she put them in backwards.

997
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,340
And there's a lot of ants in Kansas.

998
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:45,680
That's one thing. That's one problem.

999
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:47,560
Yeah, too many ants.

1000
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,700
Milk Toast didn't like the ants.

1001
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,040
Oh, Kansas.

1002
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,780
Colorado, on the other hand, was not Kansas.

1003
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:56,980
Jesus!

1004
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:58,460
I was in...

1005
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,080
Where are we at? Wichita?

1006
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:00,360
Kentucky?

1007
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,600
We're in Jesusland.

1008
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:03,760
It's all Jesus.

1009
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,980
Every two seconds there's another...

1010
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,020
Jesus is real.

1011
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,840
...advertisement for Jesus.

1012
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,400
Jesus has a great marketing campaign in Kansas.

1013
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,620
I don't have a problem with Jesus at all.

1014
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:15,600
I like Jesus.

1015
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:18,160
The ass-kicking, fighting Jesus.

1016
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,440
He's cool by me.

1017
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,120
Even hippie pot-smoking Jesus.

1018
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,400
But the Jesus these guys seem to like...

1019
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,260
I don't know if he's real, like they say.

1020
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,020
Seriously.

1021
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:28,340
He's caps-locked Jesus.

1022
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:29,780
It's caps-locked Jesus.

1023
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:30,480
They say...

1024
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,080
What was the sign? Probably like 10 miles wide?

1025
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,220
It said, Jesus is real.

1026
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,020
And the real part was blinking.

1027
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,120
It was blink...

1028
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,300
I'm pretty sure it was blinking.

1029
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:42,760
Of course, we haven't slept much.

1030
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:47,240
And I've had six abortions in the eight years that we've been here.

1031
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,080
We went in...

1032
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:48,520
Out of spite.

1033
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,960
We went in pregnant...

1034
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,800
Pregnated Milk Toast twice.

1035
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,020
Since time, you know, is all fucked up here, we were able to do that.

1036
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:56,340
And we...

1037
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:59,700
We went and got 10 abortions just to spite them.

1038
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:00,860
Yeah.

1039
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:02,980
Hot damn.

1040
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,800
And I think we're still only maybe, you know...

1041
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:07,800
What's the next one?

1042
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,000
Topeka-ta?

1043
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,400
Chikawaltaki?

1044
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,380
We're in Abilene-ix.

1045
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:19,600
There's a big water tower with a cowboy hat on top of it.

1046
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,620
It's really screwing with my night vision.

1047
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:28,100
Moose-chaw, fairground, tucky.

1048
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:29,280
You know what?

1049
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,660
Moose-chaw was a pretty good place to eat, actually.

1050
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,140
I recommend it if you're ever...

1051
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:35,740
That was Colorado where we did Moose-chaw.

1052
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:39,540
Yeah, don't ever try to think you're gonna find that in a state like this place.

1053
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,580
Okay, that was the rant on Kansas.

1054
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:42,740
Okay.

1055
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:47,080
Now the rant on Kansas some more.

1056
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,280
I hate this shit so bad.

1057
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:54,840
Kansas...

1058
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,820
But I hopped.

1059
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,620
Let us go.

1060
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:59,340
Two pots of coffee and I hopped.

1061
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,860
It's not you, it's us.

1062
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:02,160
Actually, it's you.

1063
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:03,620
Let it go.

1064
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,480
Let it drop already, Kansas.

1065
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,840
We're recording in the car because...

1066
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:12,380
Let's not forget our hotel, which was also in Kansas.

1067
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:13,940
That was rad.

1068
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:18,680
They had a rodeo on the TV there.

1069
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:23,700
No, they had a tiara little kid freak out on the TV.

1070
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:28,080
They had little child brides or whatever that was.

1071
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,100
Pedophile channel.

1072
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,300
It wasn't full effect.

1073
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:35,880
Milk dosing and what's my name?

1074
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:37,100
Zeronius.

1075
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,820
I don't know who I am anymore.

1076
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,320
I want the hell out of this state.

1077
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:45,460
Bob, get me the hell out of this fucking state.

1078
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:49,200
We can leave our unnamed alter egos at the door.

1079
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:52,420
We're trying to get through this state however we can.

1080
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:58,980
And fill out the content on the CD, which is not getting done because...

1081
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:01,880
I'm not going to whine anymore.

1082
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:03,680
Yes, I am.

1083
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,180
I'm going to rage now.

1084
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:07,740
The next...

1085
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:10,120
Did you see that?

1086
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:11,460
What?

1087
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,900
It was nothing.

1088
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:19,280
It wasn't actually there at all.

1089
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:20,640
Oh, then again.

1090
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,280
By the way, our...

1091
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:23,240
The car is...

1092
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,420
The Rent-A-Car is actually a spaceship.

1093
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:29,360
It's actually a spaceship from space.

1094
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:32,000
You should see the CD player in this thing.

1095
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:34,000
It's actually a small computer.

1096
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:37,600
You can watch movies on it.

1097
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,420
You can...

1098
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:42,200
Not that we're doing that right now as we drive through Kansas or anything.

1099
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:45,320
We're listening to our slack over and over and over again.

1100
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,080
Maybe you can hear that.

1101
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:48,540
You guys might recognize this.

1102
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:49,720
Yeah.

1103
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,080
Three, two, one.

1104
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:52,680
Okay.

1105
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:52,800
Okay.

1106
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:53,500
There it is.

1107
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:54,920
After life diagnosis...

1108
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:55,260
Okay.

1109
00:57:55,260 --> 00:58:00,440
Now we've got Ivan staying in .com and loans a Gavi tape and then loans some capital.

1110
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:02,480
Well, half day, yeah.

1111
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,940
Because as we, I think, soon...

1112
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:10,380
We've heard this thing probably 16 times right now because Kansas is so big.

1113
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:12,860
It's not even that big.

1114
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:13,920
It's just slow.

1115
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,640
It's a slow town.

1116
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:18,580
Oh!

1117
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:19,220
Oh!

1118
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:23,040
Which reminds me, when we heard that part, we were in, what, U-Tucky?

1119
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,420
U-Tucky Hall.

1120
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:33,300
We were listening to our slack in that part where Doc Hal loses his complaints about losing

1121
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:36,220
his money in the Coke machine.

1122
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:41,580
We go and stop at a rest area and then this very same thing happens to milquetoast.

1123
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,940
It was like as if...

1124
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:44,460
as if that

1125
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:45,840
that

1126
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,260
I can't tell

1127
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:49,900
where the fuck are we?

1128
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:50,640
in Kansas?

1129
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:50,980
yeah

1130
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,140
last I checked

1131
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:52,820
we were in Kansas

1132
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,880
we're gonna die in Kansas

1133
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:55,620
this is like

1134
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:56,380
X-Day is happening

1135
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:57,820
in Kansas this year

1136
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:58,680
this is the

1137
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,740
personal purgatory

1138
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:02,280
X-Day started

1139
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,200
it's happening

1140
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,100
right now

1141
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:05,500
and we should be there

1142
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,240
but Kansas

1143
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:06,940
paid us

1144
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,420
I'm hearing my taxes

1145
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:12,080
in my head

1146
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:12,960
as I drive

1147
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,760
because that's actually

1148
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:15,680
more interesting

1149
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,420
than Kansas

1150
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:17,420
so you're gonna

1151
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:18,480
itemize Kansas?

1152
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:19,740
I'm definitely

1153
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:20,900
deducting Kansas

1154
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,120
from my taxes

1155
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,200
the entire state

1156
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:23,820
of Kansas

1157
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:23,840
I'm definitely

1158
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:24,720
deducting the entire

1159
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:25,660
state of Kansas

1160
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:26,560
from my taxes

1161
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,040
I'd like to see

1162
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:28,680
the entire state

1163
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:29,300
of Kansas

1164
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,340
deducted from

1165
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:30,940
the planet

1166
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,480
not to worry

1167
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,080
this will not

1168
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:34,720
be here

1169
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,160
come Tuesday

1170
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:36,600
morning

1171
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,180
but

1172
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:38,640
it's not

1173
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,760
Tuesday morning yet

1174
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:40,800
and I'm convinced

1175
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:41,140
that

1176
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:41,960
perhaps

1177
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,120
we're actually

1178
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,340
already at X-Day

1179
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:46,260
and we're just

1180
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:47,000
hallucinating

1181
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:47,740
that we're still

1182
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:48,300
in Kansas

1183
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:48,740
because

1184
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:50,560
it's the only thing

1185
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,580
that really makes sense

1186
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:52,620
even though we've been

1187
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:54,140
driving through this state

1188
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:55,260
for 600 hours

1189
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:55,840
barefoot

1190
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,440
what's going on

1191
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,200
is we had

1192
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,840
such a great time

1193
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:00,320
tonight

1194
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,700
at X-Day

1195
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:02,600
actually

1196
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:03,140
that

1197
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:04,260
we're dreaming

1198
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,120
and having

1199
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:06,720
a nightmare

1200
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:07,740
the eternal

1201
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:08,900
Kansas nightmare

1202
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:10,960
maybe we're in reverse

1203
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:11,920
maybe we're in reverse

1204
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:11,920


1205
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:11,920


1206
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:11,920


1207
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:11,920


1208
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:11,940
maybe we're in reverse

1209
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:12,920
I feel like we're in reverse

1210
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,200
time has been

1211
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:15,960
has been

1212
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,620
like the car is

1213
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:18,420
driving in reverse

1214
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:20,640
well the road looks like

1215
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:21,500
it's going forward

1216
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:22,440
or there could be

1217
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:22,740
like a

1218
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:24,040
a feature of the

1219
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:24,820
spaceship car

1220
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:25,460
is that like

1221
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:26,540
we push the wrong

1222
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:27,540
button and we put

1223
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,160
the loop

1224
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:28,560
Kansas

1225
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,140
LCD windshield

1226
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:31,080
function on

1227
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:31,720
by accident

1228
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,220
we're on the

1229
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:33,280
Kansas treadmill

1230
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:35,660
we're trapped in

1231
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:36,180
haze

1232
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:37,040
for all eternity

1233
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,200
that's why we keep

1234
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:38,840
seeing signs

1235
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,980
pointing that way

1236
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:40,740
but no matter

1237
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:41,700
how hard we run

1238
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:42,520
through the haze

1239
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:46,020
if I was told

1240
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:47,120
this was God's country

1241
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,220
I'm not convinced

1242
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:48,600
man

1243
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,460
I've been looking

1244
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:50,680
at

1245
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:51,860
I saw the same

1246
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,240
they're really not

1247
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:57,620
very

1248
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:58,320
their Jesus

1249
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:58,800
message

1250
01:00:58,800 --> 01:00:59,440
very much

1251
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,960
it's pretty much

1252
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:01,700
the same thing

1253
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:02,860
you suck

1254
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,040
Jesus kicks

1255
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:04,700
your ass

1256
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:05,520
it's like a

1257
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,500
hip-hop record

1258
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,000
except

1259
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:07,820
not

1260
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:09,680
I'm bitching

1261
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:10,880
I'm bitching

1262
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:11,340
I'm bitching

1263
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:11,680
you're the bitch

1264
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:12,340
you're shit

1265
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:12,920
you're shit

1266
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:13,420
you're shit

1267
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:14,500
you know

1268
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:15,720
I actually don't feel

1269
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:16,480
like I'm being

1270
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,740
beaten enough

1271
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:19,040
in the Jesus

1272
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:19,540
messages

1273
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:21,100
like there's not

1274
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:21,940
enough disappointment

1275
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:22,340
there

1276
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:24,460
there's a lot of

1277
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:25,700
like caps lock

1278
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,060
Jesus is real

1279
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:28,680
as in like

1280
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:29,680
statement of fact

1281
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:30,500
not an opinion

1282
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:31,600
but

1283
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,640
I don't feel

1284
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:34,700
the disappointment

1285
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:35,980
condescending

1286
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:36,960
not condescending

1287
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:37,560
quite at all

1288
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:37,800
actually

1289
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,240
there's a little bit

1290
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:39,640
of fear

1291
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:40,340
that like

1292
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:41,020
fear and facial

1293
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:41,540
expression

1294
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:42,000
has to be

1295
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:42,360
answered

1296
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:42,920
to that

1297
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:43,300
company

1298
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:44,580
there needs to be

1299
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:45,040
a big sign

1300
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:45,360
that says

1301
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:46,460
Jesus is so

1302
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:48,220
sick of your shit

1303
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:50,400
I would get to that

1304
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,820
Jesus wants to get

1305
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:52,920
the fuck out of Kansas

1306
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,300
I like Jesus

1307
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,080
hitchhiking

1308
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,120
on the side of the road

1309
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,540
that would be odd

1310
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,080
Jesus can't escape

1311
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,080
Kansas either

1312
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,960
if you see Jesus

1313
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:03,580
tell him

1314
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:04,880
we need him back

1315
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:10,580
maybe Jesus

1316
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:11,340
is an odd

1317
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,120
Jesus is an

1318
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:13,740
X day

1319
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,780
we're almost there

1320
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,640
from what I understand

1321
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,740
there is a reverend

1322
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:20,080
Jesus

1323
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:23,380
I've met the man

1324
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:23,740
but

1325
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,320
I bet he's way

1326
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:26,160
cooler than the

1327
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:26,960
Jesus they keep

1328
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:27,680
talking about

1329
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:28,560
okay

1330
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,280
this has been us

1331
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,440
signing off

1332
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:38,480
hi this is

1333
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,140
Doxy and Milk Toast

1334
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:41,160
reporting from

1335
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:43,040
the road

1336
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,400
Pilgrim's Log

1337
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:51,840
1-2-3-4-7-2-1-2-Z-Z-1-2-X-1-X-X-2-X-9-er

1338
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,680
yes we are still

1339
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,440
in Kansas

1340
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,340
20 years have gone by

1341
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,000
in reverse

1342
01:02:59,000 --> 01:02:59,860
I think we're about

1343
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,380
what happened was

1344
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:03,040
at some point

1345
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:03,420
we were

1346
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:05,320
back in 1978

1347
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:07,480
that was in Idaho

1348
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:08,760
Idaho

1349
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:09,820
yeah Idaho

1350
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:10,540
was in 1978

1351
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:11,220
yeah

1352
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:12,680
oh right

1353
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:13,760
the hotel in Idaho

1354
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:14,420
yeah

1355
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:15,540
that was awesome

1356
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:16,320
right so I think

1357
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,760
actually this old trip

1358
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,380
we kind of

1359
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:19,240
somehow

1360
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,160
stepped through

1361
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:20,800
a time vortex

1362
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:21,360
and

1363
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:24,760
and started

1364
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:25,200
the trip

1365
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:25,660
kind of

1366
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:27,400
in the 70s

1367
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,460
as evidenced

1368
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:28,960
by the

1369
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,200
hotel room

1370
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,620
by the time

1371
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:32,080
we got to

1372
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:32,640
what was it

1373
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:33,000
Birmingham

1374
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:33,640
Hamilton

1375
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:34,480
yeah

1376
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,380
Birmingham

1377
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:37,680
Gamblington

1378
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:38,340
yeah

1379
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:39,700
that was where

1380
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:40,800
1986 happened

1381
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:41,260
yeah

1382
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:42,400
by then we were

1383
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,100
in 1986

1384
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:44,020
as you can tell

1385
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:44,460
because it was

1386
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:45,100
that pastel

1387
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:46,020
kind of salmon

1388
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:46,420
pink

1389
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:47,920
zigzag

1390
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:48,820
pattern

1391
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:50,640
on the

1392
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:51,180
on the

1393
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:51,460
comfort

1394
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:53,340
rust colored

1395
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:53,780
carpet

1396
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:55,180
very

1397
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:56,320
very thin

1398
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:57,800
very tight

1399
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:58,480
thin

1400
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,880
weave

1401
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:00,740
to the carpet

1402
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:02,060
and it was

1403
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:02,480
sticky

1404
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,080
carpet

1405
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,220
so that's

1406
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:05,400
about

1407
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:06,120
1986

1408
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:08,840
I think

1409
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:09,460
we woke up

1410
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:09,660
in

1411
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:10,340
1993

1412
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:11,300
in

1413
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:41,340


1414
01:04:41,340 --> 01:05:11,340


1415
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:11,620
the car

1416
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:11,620


1417
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:11,620


1418
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:11,620


1419
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:11,700
want to

1420
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:11,920
get

1421
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:15,400
you guys

1422
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:15,860
are hiding

1423
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:16,160
out in

1424
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:16,940
that cornfield

1425
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:17,460
I can tell

1426
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:17,820
there's a

1427
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:18,460
blinky light

1428
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:19,060
over there

1429
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:21,900
oh

1430
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:22,520
I just

1431
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:22,700
want

1432
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:24,420
I smelled

1433
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:24,980
froth

1434
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:25,400
no wait

1435
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:25,720
that was

1436
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:26,360
a skunk

1437
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:30,120
Reverend

1438
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:30,640
Mokto's

1439
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:31,140
made me

1440
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:31,420
eat a

1441
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:31,860
skunk

1442
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:32,220
earlier

1443
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:32,560
and then

1444
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:33,060
she complained

1445
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:33,680
about the

1446
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:34,060
gas

1447
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:34,940
the whole

1448
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:35,580
way

1449
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:38,740
for what

1450
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:39,220
it's worth

1451
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:40,240
if you're

1452
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:40,400
going to

1453
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,140
force feed

1454
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:42,500
Eat a nigga, a skunk.

1455
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,420
Don't complain about the gas.

1456
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,700
Okay, that's the travel report.

1457
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,380
Signing off.

1458
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,040
If one beer comes in, we have to make a comment.

1459
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:54,720
We don't know.

1460
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:59,920
All right, this is Reverend Dr. Ronious and Reverend Milk Toast.

1461
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:02,180
You talk this long.

1462
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,920
I'm just fucking over it.

1463
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,180
We've resigned ourselves to dying in Kansas.

1464
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,060
I'm 906 years old now.

1465
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:13,600
It shows.

1466
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:14,920
It shows.

1467
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:19,920
Let me tell you, we've adopted a very Kansas-like physical appearance.

1468
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:22,600
Milk Toast is looking really long in the tooth.

1469
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,180
I'm looking long in the tooth.

1470
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:26,920
I've gained 300 pounds.

1471
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:29,760
It's very comfortable in these clothes.

1472
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,100
We're starting to look like we belong here.

1473
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,920
We now both work at Walmart, but only from the car.

1474
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:40,220
Because we actually can't leave it.

1475
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:48,240
We're telecommuting for our new jobs as cashiers at Walmart from the car.

1476
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:53,960
And Dr. Ronious is just shitting his pants now.

1477
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:58,300
He's elevated from farting constantly.

1478
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,180
Just shitting his pants.

1479
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:03,120
And it doesn't matter because I no longer care.

1480
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,160
As we are going to die in Kansas.

1481
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,720
This has been...

1482
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:12,520
...a street after I ram a Jesus sign.

1483
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,500
And drive us off the fucking road.

1484
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:17,140
Oh wait, here comes another exit.

1485
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:20,680
Oh wait, no, that was actually a mirage.

1486
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,040
It was an exit mirage.

1487
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:25,920
We keep seeing mirages of signs that say,

1488
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:28,740
Wisteria Campground next right.

1489
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:32,900
And then they disappear right as we get erections.

1490
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:37,180
I think Kansas has given me a backwards erection.

1491
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:42,160
Okay, that's all I got to say about Kansas.

1492
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,400
Till next time, this has been...

1493
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:49,460
...a really horrible Pilgrim's Log.

1494
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:51,500
Fuck. Bye.

1495
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:53,620
Yay!

1496
01:07:55,800 --> 01:08:01,360
Friends, that was Cult of Zere, or actually Dr. Zeronious, I should say.

1497
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:07,380
Dr. Zeronious and Reverend Todry Milquetoast describing their trip across Kansas.

1498
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:14,400
Which was required to get them from Portland, Oregon to Wisteria Campground in Southern Ohio.

1499
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:17,420
Where we hold the 14X Day Drill.

1500
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:22,560
We'll see you at subgenius.com.

1501
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:24,460
Hey, praise Bob.

1502
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:32,160
Oh, the music in the background was DJ 2 Beans live at 14X Day.
