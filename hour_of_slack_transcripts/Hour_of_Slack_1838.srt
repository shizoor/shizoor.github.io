1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
No one would have believed in the last years of the 19th century

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,000
that human affairs were being watched from the timeless worlds of space.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,760
No one could have dreamed we were being scrutinized

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,960
as some were the microscopic studies creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,000
Few men even considered the possibility of life on other planets.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,280
And yet, across the gulf of space,

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,500
minds immeasurably superior to ours

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,320
regarded this Earth with envious eyes.

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,420
And slowly and surely,

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,380
they drew their plans against us.

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,140
And now,

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,400
The Six amazing

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,340
Tower of Swag

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,920
Praise Bob!

15
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,400
This is it!

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,460
your last big chance to win back your soul.

17
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,720
X Day is coming.

18
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,440
Kiss all your calendars goodbye and prepare yourself

19
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,920
to greet the men from Planet X in power and glory

20
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,920
at the coolest campground in the United States.

21
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,500
With sideshow marvels,

22
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,360
spontaneous doctor band combustion,

23
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,920
trained prairie squid,

24
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,760
frop enhancement workshops,

25
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,460
acu-beating, psychic surgery,

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,420
human fights, live freaks of nature,

27
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,700
and acid casualties,

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,840
face-fucking, vet sperm, antidote pudding, cook-offs,

29
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,420
private adult sex-hurt seminars,

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,740
self-mutilating preachers and oddly normal-seeming people,

31
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,340
sex goddesses,

32
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:53,340


33
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,120
elder gods,

34
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,560
and exes.

35
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,300
X Day is coming.

36
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,140
Are you ready for the finals?

37
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,460
Which will it be?

38
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,140
Spaz Outlaw Holiday Forever or The Last Roundup?

39
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,880
Can you handle Judgment Day?

40
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:14,200
Will you simper while the world ends or will you get slapped?

41
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,780
Brought to you by J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius.

Subtitles by the Amara.org community

44
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:31,200
experience the anxiously awaited moment, the nail-biting suspense of July 5th, 7am.

45
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,040
Only $30!

46
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,680
None may stop us and none may escape once the gate closes.

47
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,360
Praise Bob!

48
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,960
Auf Wiedersehen!

49
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,280
Thanks, that's all.

50
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,160
Well, Rubik's Cube.

51
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,140
Oh, yes, dear friends.

52
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,760
Welcome to our Slack number 1838.

53
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,900
What we just heard was the band Rubik's Cube

54
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,940
recorded, performing live at 24X Day,

55
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:59,040
or what we should now call the 26th X Day Drill.

56
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,780
Our numbering is kind of strange.

57
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,340
The first Hypercube X Day Drill.

58
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,980
And, hey, sorry, don't blame me or Bob or even Hypercube

59
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,960
that the world didn't end on a human schedule.

60
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,420
I guess those old Xists from outer space

61
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:18,880
are degenerates.

62
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,160
They're determined to keep us guessing.

63
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,980
Gotta be ready any minute, friends.

64
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,380
But, yeah, we not only survived the first drill

65
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,880
held at Land of Id in Land O'Lakes, Florida,

66
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,600
owned by the spectacularly talented

67
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,660
Reverend Exanthia Octoshroom,

68
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,820
who's also a fellow junior scientist like me and Dr. Howell.

69
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,160
We not only survived, but we plan to do it all again

70
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,420
next year at Land of Id,

71
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,560
because that site is perfect, perfect for our size

72
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,100
and kind of attendance.

73
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,700
Everyone who was there and at previous drills

74
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,100
agrees that it was the best X Day ever.

75
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,080
But then, we always do.

76
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,540
Tropical storm Elsa hit Tampa in force

77
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,320
just after my plane back to Texas got out of there.

78
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,620
But it created some challenges,

79
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,760
details of which you'll hear soon enough.

80
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,600
But first,

81
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,640
the rat hole clench has their own drill,

82
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,760
or had their own drill,

83
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,840
and created their own media barrage

84
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,220
about the end of all reality, according to Bob.

85
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,440
12 minutes worth, and here it is.

86
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,900
From rat hole clench,

87
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,720
not to be confused with the rat cave of old.

88
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,360
Pray Bob.

89
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,120
He manipulates the necessary controls

90
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,220
to broadcast the message on the tape over the air.

91
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,440
The radio alert.

92
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,540
Normal broadcasting will be discontinued

93
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,680
for an indefinite period.

94
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,060
I've been asked to remind everyone that this briefing,

95
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,400
as well as this entire project, is classified.

96
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,960
And I'm going to just begin this program and tape

97
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,140
by showing you some terminology.

98
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,500
I'm going to be repetitive because I want it to sink in.

99
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,180
You'll learn about end time terminology,

100
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,740
end time numerology,

101
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,600
end time catastrophes,

102
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,780
end time organizations,

103
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,140
and end time leaders.

104
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,520
It's the marker we've been waiting for,

105
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,120
the spacecraft from the level above human

106
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,500
to take us home to the literal heavens.

107
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,500
For people that have a particularly strong case

108
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,600
of alienation,

109
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,460
this can become a very powerful segment of your life.

110
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,120
There is a vision,

111
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,120


112
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,120


113
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,120


114
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,320
a vision of another kind of world in which we could live a lot better,

115
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,300
and maybe the UFO can take us there.

116
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,500
And this is what happened, or could happen,

117
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,240
on a certain day called X.

118
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,240
Some people would look at it as the best moment of their life.

119
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,760
Or will it be, as many believe, the final judgment?

120
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,340
A lot of people have done extensive research into this

121
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,980
and have discovered that flying saucers have a tendency

122
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,680
to make a lot of appearances

123
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,960
around about a important event happening on Earth.

124
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,640
It's an amazing coincidence.

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,860
There are no coincidences.

126
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,540
This is way out of the realm of fiction or supposition

127
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,620
or conspiracy theory or speculation.

128
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,460
This is absolute documented fact.

129
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,060
On July 5th, 2019 at 7 a.m.,

130
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,700
the Xists shall make a mass landing on this planet.

131
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,900
The children of Bob shall be rewarded at this foretold rupture.

132
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,660
This day of judgment.

133
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,220
When all those who paid their church dues

134
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,580
will be lifted up in power and glory

135
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,400
to gain new homes and bodies aboard the pleasure saucers

136
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,680
of the sex goddesses.

137
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,500
All the while watching the hapless pigs twitch and bleat and wail

138
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,420
in the death throes of their world.

139
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,000
Not because some general or madman will push a button

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,120
and reduce our planet to ash,

141
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,580
but because, as the fundamentalists see it,

142
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,740
God has had it planned that way for at least 1900 years.

143
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,140
If there really were a day called X,

144
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,260
people have always had a fascination with the heavens.

145
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,340
UFO groups celebrate this connection to the stars.

146
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,160
Mainstream religion rarely, if ever,

147
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,380
recognizes biblical passages as describing extraterrestrial sightings.

148
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,440
New Agers look at the year 2000 as a time of rescue via,

149
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,380
listen to this, friendly spaceships.

150
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,100
Now I'm not saying that God did not do this,

151
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,520
but God worked through the UFOs to produce this.

152
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,340
A bizarre marriage of science fact, fiction, and hope.

153
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,220
Research suggests that 20% of Americans

154
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,780
believe in UFOs.

155
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,240
Is this why some of these people are joining UFO cults

156
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,780
instead of mainstream religions?

157
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,880
The best known group that started out in the grips of cult paranoia

158
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,860
and evolved into a major religion is...

159
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,780
J.R. Bob Dobbs, the living slack master

160
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,740
in his church of the subgenius.

161
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,200
A prophet with honor in his own land and in his own time.

162
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,380
Part circus style entertainment and part sales pitch.

163
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,840
At their recruitment meetings all across the country,

164
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,640
they were extremely persuasive with their sci-fi pitch

165
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,500
to potential members.

166
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,900
It's rumored that followers are under some type of mind control.

167
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,020
Praise God!

168
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,880
Praise God!

169
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,680
To me, he was a fabulous man.

170
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,400
I would say he was among the greatest of the great.

171
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,300
The energy that I felt from him

172
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,320
put me into a state of almost fear and awe.

173
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,880
He provides a way for people to have both the mystical experience

174
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,020
and the experience of sexual freedom

175
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,420
and letting go of everything.

176
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,140
He had this sense of apocalyptic doom.

177
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,400
There's no limit to what you can do.

178
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,060
You could destroy the Earth.

179
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,000
I don't know what that is.

180
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,800
But I know who the devil is and he hates you

181
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,980
and he has a plan for your life.

182
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,120
And it's to rip your family apart.

183
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,240
It's to destroy your kids.

184
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,940
It's to pull you out of church and make you not believe in God.

185
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,760
He's not politically correct.

186
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,180
And he's not part of the anti-Christ movement.

187
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,380
You see, some people have the idea

188
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,420
that the only people that care anything about E.T.

189
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,320
or extraterrestrials or UFOs and all that,

190
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,940
a bunch of pot-smoking hippies sitting around a campfire somewhere

191
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,040
and singing,

192
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,440
or whatever else they do.

193
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,760
And that's all they do.

194
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,500
And I mean, you know, nut jobs.

195
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,080
But the truth of the matter is,

196
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,340
some of the smartest people in this country

197
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,840
have their eyes focused on the heavens.

198
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,220
You get into the people that are in the business of making money,

199
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,200
and they are in the business of supporting

200
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,020
the knowledge of extraterrestrials.

201
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,360
Their unorthodox gospel began to take shape.

202
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,040
Once they realized the money in that,

203
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,260
the benefit to that,

204
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,000
the sheer joy and outrage and pleasure

205
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,020
for the public and themselves in all of that,

206
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,700
they turned their New Age and Christian ideologies

207
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,000
into a business and went searching for followers.

208
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,820
They brought a lot of color and excitement

209
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,500
to small towns of people who lived on farms

210
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,840
who didn't have a lot to do.

211
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,360
And people left with something.

212
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,120
They left sort of fascinated by it.

213
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,040
They were intrigued by the concept of,

214
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,120
could this actually be?

215
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,700
You're going to hear all kinds of stories

216
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,560
before you get there and afterwards,

217
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,060
and I'm going to make up a few after I come back.

218
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,860
We were out looking at the stars,

219
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,620
just enjoying the night,

220
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,520
and suddenly you look behind us,

221
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,100
and there hovering on the ground next to us was a UFO.

222
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,840
It was the most incredible light show it had

223
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,420
all the colors of the rainbow.

224
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,860
And they went around the perimeter of the craft,

225
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,360
and they were all just like scintillating,

226
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,400
dancing, just like vibrating.

227
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,140
It was just incredible.

228
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,800
They just hovered there and it was completely silent.

229
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,340
And they'd been coming around for a long time.

230
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,080
I'm just lucky I got to see them.

231
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,640
It cleared the minds.

232
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,980
It made you, your mind stronger.

233
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,320
It was the most unreal weekend I can ever remember.

234
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,180
Can't get any better than that for a testimony.

235
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,760
Who are these people?

236
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,780
What drives them to participate in acts

237
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,040
that society calls madness?

238
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,840
Let's look at the word subgenius.

239
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,240
It does not simply mean just below a genius.

240
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,620
Sub-G intelligence level can range far, far below genius.

241
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,060
I don't want to sound like a dummy here.

242
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,120
They're not smarter than me, but they're very smart.

243
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,000
You're only limited by the credulity of your audience

244
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,860
and your own imagination in making up these stories.

245
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,340
That there shall come in the last days

246
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,360
scoffers saying, where is the promise of his coming?

247
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,960
For the skeptic, for the agnostic, for the atheist,

248
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,900
I invite you, come, see, and believe.

249
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,820
All of you.

250
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,420
All these events happen right on the day.

251
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,180
Right on the day.

252
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,660
In the first four events.

253
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,760
Why wouldn't it be logical then to say

254
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,100
that the other events are going to happen right on the day?

255
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,700
The doomsday people would do well to study up.

256
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,360
On this day called X.

257
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,080
And that's why it is very important

258
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,640
that this information starts to get out now.

259
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,300
That man can prepare himself for a landing

260
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,320
that is really our future.

261
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,440
We're going to have an apocalyptic event.

262
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,660
We're going to have a convergence,

263
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,460
a spacecraft from various galaxies around the universe,

264
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,760
and they're going to bring us

265
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,820
women covered with hair,

266
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,280
standing eight feet tall.

267
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,640
It looks like a potato.

268
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,360
Deformed.

269
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,760
Disfigured.

270
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,740
Yet strangely irresistible to millions.

271
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,160
And it comes from Mars.

272
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:57,780
Impossible.

273
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:58,800
Unbelievable.

274
00:12:59,380 --> 00:12:59,820
Fantastic.

275
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,120
But I tell you, it could happen.

276
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,180
People are always afraid of what they don't understand.

277
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,140
But there will always be some fool who would pick up a lit bomb

278
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,620
and say, this is interesting, and it will go off in your hands.

279
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,580
Can we get beyond our primitive fears?

280
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,620
As the aliens come closer,

281
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,060
they're weeks away, they're hours away,

282
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,540
things start getting strange.

283
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,760
And so this day called X,

284
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,800
which began in such an ordinary way,

285
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,400
is no ordinary day.

286
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,060
And it's so hard to know in advance

287
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,920
how any man will react when that day comes.

288
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,440
It certainly occurs to you that,

289
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,700
well, what if this is the big one?

290
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,960
You know, because you're not expecting the big one

291
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,740
at that particular moment.

292
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,360
You'll never be expecting the big one when it happens.

293
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,180
And it's right on the verge of coming down.

294
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,960
And when it comes, it's going to spring forth just like that.

295
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,400
It's going to come all of a sudden.

296
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,220
It's all been building up to this point.

297
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,460
But now, somewhere, in the next few days,

298
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,800
few weeks, few months, few years,

299
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,140
the Lord's on when it knows when.

300
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,940
But this thing is going to bust loose,

301
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,800
and when it busts loose,

302
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,680
you know what it's going to do?

303
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,720
It's going to find the church asleep.

304
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,520
The church is going to be completely asleep.

305
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,740
The prosperity preachers are going to be up there

306
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,400
naming it, claiming it, blabbing it, and grabbing it.

307
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,320
That's all they know to preach.

308
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,460
And the people are going to be comfortable in their faith,

309
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,720
feel good about their religion,

310
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,760
and they're patriotic and love the country,

311
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,360
and everything's going to be hunky-dory, and on we go.

312
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,580
Now, oh, listen to this.

313
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,040
This really blessed my heart, friends.

314
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,260
Bum-dum.

315
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,320
Bums can never die.

316
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,980
He represents more than just a man with a pipe and a know-it-all grin.

317
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,900
He represents the quest of all mutants for freedom.

318
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,220
Check that out.

319
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,580
Check that out.

320
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,140
Put that in your satanic pipe and smoke it, punk.

321
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,160
Check that out.

322
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,080
Oh, and by the way,

323
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,520
he can smoke whatever he wants to in that psychotic, satanic pipe of his.

324
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,260
I don't care what he smokes.

325
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,800
I don't care how much he smokes.

326
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,720
He ain't never going to be the most high, okay?

327
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,440
So you can just put that in your psychotic pipe

328
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,380
and smoke it.

329
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,220
All day, all night, all month, or day,

330
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,980
and you will never be the most high.

331
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,620
He's got delusions of grandeur.

332
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,580
They want to imagine themselves as the forerunners of the future.

333
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,040
They want to imagine themselves being on the threshold of what is to come.

334
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,980
They say he is a false prophet.

335
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,980
The latest example of spiritual con men at work.

336
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,620
I don't think too much of that.

337
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,300
I wouldn't have it in my house.

338
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:01,940
I think it's filthy.

339
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,420
At best, they were wasting their money.

340
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,040
And yet his words are so powerful in their conviction

341
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,300
that millions have believed his ominous prediction.

342
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,100
I believed it.

343
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:11,980
I totally believed it.

344
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,320
I was like a walking robot.

345
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,400
I believed everything they said.

346
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,140
All too many people have uncritically bought into the story,

347
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,100
not because the evidence is there,

348
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,200
but they want to believe it's true.

349
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,360
To this day, the question of when this prophet of doom

350
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,300
believed the apocalypse would take place is still unanswered.

351
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,300
He did give us some milestones,

352
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,160
some dates for milestones to think around.

353
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,340
We just assume that the people that have gathered those dates

354
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,140
know what they're talking about.

355
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,300
But that's not the case.

356
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,220
I know how those dates are arrived at.

357
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:46,300
It had pursued the goal of having the people transported out of this world

358
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,120
into a better world that existed in another dimension.

359
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,280
The instrument of that transporting was to be some flying saucers.

360
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,560
Those flying saucers never came.

361
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,340
Even when J.R. Bob Dobbs' prediction proved wrong,

362
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,440
his followers continued to believe that the apocalypse was imminent.

363
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,960
If these spaceships don't land,

364
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:12,660
I'm not going to have any great anxiety and go in a dither.

365
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,160
There'll be a reason for it.

366
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,500
You see, everything comes down to it.

367
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,180
There's logic and reason in life.

368
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,260
There's great organization in the cosmos.

369
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,780
Because we're disorganized and have, you might say, gotten off the highway,

370
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,560
that doesn't mean that the highway doesn't exist.

371
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,280
You didn't pay attention to the traffic signals.

372
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,860
What can we now conclude from what's been presented?

373
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,880
I don't care who you are or where you come from.

374
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,720
If you haven't sent your $20 into Bob, you're going to burn.

375
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,480
Mother Teresa, I don't care how many people she's helped,

376
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,060
if she hasn't sent her $20 into J.R. Bob Dobbs, she's going to burn in hell.

377
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:24,840
I've really had to think for myself to learn how to save a female adult

378
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:24,840


379
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:24,840


380
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:29,220
BLUE SALT

381
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,600
dok

382
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,540
Thank you, Rat Hole Clench, for that hypnotic media barrage.

383
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,920
But now for one of the most powerful recordings from the Florida Ex Day Trill,

384
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,180
the second sermon of Father Joe Mama.

385
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,120
I missed the beginning of the first one,

386
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,600
and I hope for a recording of it from somebody somewhere.

387
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,640
But first, let me explain.

388
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,260
For this sermon, Papa Joe dressed all in black,

389
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,200
with a Dracula cape lined with red,

390
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,360
a skull and crossbones on his chest,

391
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,280
and he had his expert makeup artists

392
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,320
apply a perfect skull face makeup on his whole face

393
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,300
in black and white grease paint.

394
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,480
So keep that in mind.

395
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,920
Also, because this was the night of the Fourth of July,

396
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,500
you hear fireworks going off in the back.

397
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,280
And you hear the crowd constantly.

398
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,540
Explosions which perfectly punctuate

399
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,740
the bloody subject of this classic

400
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:43,200
and thoroughly post-woke retro-futuristic rant

401
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,160
by Father Joe Mama.

402
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,640
Hello friends, and welcome

403
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,520
to the real Ex Day 1998,

404
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,800
the final reckoning!

405
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,420
And we know it's the last Ex Day

406
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,160
because the conspiracy has shown their hand.

407
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,040
They're always lying to us, but now,

408
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,320
now they're not even trying to hide their deception.

409
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,820
It's obvious for all to see.

410
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,100
We've always had a crisis,

411
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,820
some sort of emergency to justify them

412
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,560
seizing our liberties and enforcing

413
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,700
their anti-democratic top-down dictatorships.

414
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,580
For two decades, it was the Islamic terror,

415
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:31,760
the terrorist,

416
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,900
but now they've been bought in the nicest of gardens.

417
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,180
We've swapped that out with a new threat

418
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,440
of domestic terrorists.

419
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,820
The angry white male.

420
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,920
Now I ask you,

421
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,760
do I look angry to you?

422
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,460
Do I sound angry to you?

423
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,000
And what in Bob's den could I possibly be angry about?

424
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:58,900
Yes.

425
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,040
Such a threat?

426
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,340
There's always out there, literally hundreds,

427
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,100
and yet even while this threat is precipitated

428
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:06,920
throughout the world,

429
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,040
hundreds of thousands of brown people

430
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,600
are fleeing across our border.

431
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,600
It'll be millions in just a few months.

432
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,600
Too bad they forgot to tell them

433
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,060
they're heading in the wrong direction.

434
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,080
But in case that threat isn't scary enough,

435
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,160
the conspiracy has another.

436
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,000
Even more frightening threat.

437
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,100
Mutating virus strains.

438
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,800
COVID was great while it lasted,

439
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,640
but now the guilt is off the flower.

440
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,560
People are starting to come out again

441
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,280
and resist their mandatory shutdowns

442
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,100
and mask mandates and digital passports,

443
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,680
so along comes COVID 2.0,

444
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,580
the never-ending story.

445
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,540
It changes, don't you see?

446
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,920
So you're never safe,

447
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,740
whether you're vaccinated or not.

448
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,900
And in the unlikely event that the other two threats

449
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,260
are not scary enough to beat you down into submission,

450
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,480
we have the ultimate endgame.

451
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,460
Climate change.

452
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,420
The world is going to die by 2032

453
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,760
unless you surrender all your power to the conspiracy

454
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,900
and do everything they want.

455
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,140
And if you express any doubts,

456
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,800
you're unscientific or lurite,

457
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,840
because the debate is over.

458
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,520
And how dare you even question it?

459
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,060
You see, it's not enough to have one doomsday scenario.

460
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,260
Oh, no.

461
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,000
You need all three simultaneously a trifecta of terror.

462
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,540
They want you to feel helpless

463
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,580
and that there's nothing you can do

464
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,380
to avoid your doomsday damnation.

465
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,460
We're all going to be blown up by white supremacists

466
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,440
while dying of a deadly virus variant

467
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,540
just as the world burns up from rising temperatures

468
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,600
and then drowns in rising sea levels.

469
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,960
If one doesn't get you, the other ones will.

470
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,120
Conspicuously absent, however,

471
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,800
from this list of life-threatening doomsday scenarios,

472
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,140
is the one threat that really is real.

473
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:09,660
And that will be here tomorrow, July 5th.

474
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,040
I'm talking about an all-out invasion by Exus Exterminators!

475
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,340
They're on their way here now!

476
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,540
Do I hear a praise bomb?

477
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,920
Praise bomb!

478
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,200
Yes, this planet is doomed.

479
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,080
And we can't change that.

480
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,180
We don't want to change that!

481
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:28,960
For the wages of subgenius sin and dobsian defiance are death!

482
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,660
But just because Earth is doomed doesn't mean we are.

483
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,380
No, no, no, no.

484
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,220
The Exus are coming and the pigs are bumming.

485
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,360
But as I look out amongst our subgenius audience here today,

486
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:46,360
the only bumming I see is of cigarettes.

487
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,320
And perhaps even a few other inhalable substances.

488
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,240
Praise bomb!

489
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,820
No, no, no.

490
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,480
We are not bumming because we're looking forward to the end times.

491
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,860
The planet may be condemned, the conspiracy may be condemned,

492
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,660
the Pains Anonymous may be condemned, but we aren't!

493
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,820
We've made our choice.

494
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,680
And once the shooting starts, we aren't going to run away from the fighting.

495
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,280
We're going to run to it!

496
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:21,380
Now, we're going to be joining the aliens, not only on their mopping up operations,

497
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:27,000
but also when it's all over, and going with them to Planet 10, the Exus promised world.

498
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:31,760
A new promised planet with no pains and normalcy.

499
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,080
It all sounds rather unbelievable, doesn't it?

500
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,900
But then again, what in the last few years was believable?

501
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,760
I mean, really.

502
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,980
If you have a dobsian doubt about whether Bob will fulfill his promised prophecy,

503
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:52,940
just look how the conspiracy itself is starting to prepare the public for the mere possibility of aliens.

504
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,980
They are showing aerial footage of military aircraft,

505
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,960
shooting UFOs, on TV!

506
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,200
They're showing this footage.

507
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:09,440
The very last order by the previous president was to release all information regarding UFOs within 180 days.

508
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,160
That was signed at the end of December, and by my math, let's see, that's six months, it comes out...

509
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,540
Well, what do you know?

510
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,280
It comes out right about July 5th. Here we are.

511
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,000
Now, why would they do that?

512
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,460
Maybe when people go bursting in and they say,

513
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,220
Oh, right to the hills!

514
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:26,960
The hills!

515
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:26,980


516
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,100
They're killing us, the UFOs!

517
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,220
All the conspiracy ties will blow their eyes and go,

518
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:32,800
Oh, please.

519
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,740
They've been planning that now for months.

520
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,340
They're just releasing the footage.

521
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:44,200
Once again, the truth is the precise opposite of what our leaders and the media are telling us.

522
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,760
There is a reason for us to be excited,

523
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,300
and his name is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

524
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,280
Do I hear a praise Bob?

525
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,440
Praise Bob!

526
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:54,740
Yes.

527
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:59,240
His pipe has been hiding in plain sight for all these years.

528
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,520
Right beneath the conspiracy's nose.

529
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,040
Right beneath his nose!

530
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,840
We didn't expect them to ever admit it.

531
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:13,840
To paraphrase the 007 movie, Goldfinger,

532
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,160
No, Mr. Bondage, we expect you to die!

533
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,920
And die they will.

534
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,160
Die they must!

535
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:22,940
For...

536
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:27,720
If this planet is to be purged of its conspiracy, contamination and torments,

537
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,720
it must be completely cleansed.

538
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,960
And we cannot allow this sickness to be spread throughout the solar system,

539
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,140
nay, through the universe,

540
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,420
through all sorts of other hitchhiking spacecraft.

541
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,180
The only race that can be trusted to be,

542
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,500
well, how should you say, allowed to continue to exist,

543
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,960
would be the subgeniuses,

544
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,380
for they have a lifelong history of fighting the conspiracy.

545
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,820
They won't carry that.

546
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,680
That terrible virus with them to Planet X.

547
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,760
So have confidence, dear friends,

548
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,880
that this conspiracy will go all out like this.

549
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,120
That they wouldn't reveal their hand unless they knew the gig was up.

550
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,000
This is going to be the final X-Day.

551
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,840
All the real subgeniuses can feel it in their bones.

552
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,800
Do I hear an amen?

553
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,020
Amen!

554
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:15,960
Amen!

555
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,520
That feeling is a good feeling, friends.

556
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,360
The opposite of what the pinks and normals

557
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,800
are going to be feeling in their bones

558
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,880
as they are fed through the conspiracy pink people-shredders.

559
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,600
But hey, you can't make an offer without breaking a few eggs, right?

560
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,440
Well, breaking a few heads come X-Day,

561
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,480
as we assist with the bop-bop operations

562
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,740
and enjoy the biggest fireworks of all time.

563
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,340
So if you ever had any wonders,

564
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,540
just ask yourself this,

565
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,520
if it were a real X-Day,

566
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,440
would it be crowded?

567
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,000
No.

568
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,100
It would only have a select few.

569
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,700
We are that precious few.

570
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,280
After all, weight is very expensive on a flying saucer

571
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,340
going in all sorts of directions in outer space.

572
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,620
So you expect it to be small and potent.

573
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,560
And that's what we shall be tomorrow.

574
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,720
So prepare for the real Independence Day,

575
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,580
July 5th, tomorrow morning at 7am,

576
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,180
as we finally leave this cursed conspiracy world

577
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,820
sailing to the rest of the world.

578
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:21,980
Amen.

579
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:22,440
Yay!

580
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,360
Ladies and gentlemen,

581
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:32,480
Papa,

582
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:33,680
Joe Mama.

583
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,100
Another round of applause.

584
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,700
The hard mold ramming mechanism.

585
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,540
If jolting were possible during the squeeze.

586
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,060
From this.

587
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,720
To this.

588
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,780
And now,

589
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:22,340
the real

590
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,900
Everything was recorded with cushioned equipment.

591
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,260
Ram, jolt, squeeze, pin lift molding machine.

592
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:42,200
The real

593
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,980
Ram noise controlled jolt.

594
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:47,880
Two model 719 RJW Osborne machines

595
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,260
was standard equipment.

596
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,540
.

597
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,500
Oil control pattern draw stroke.

598
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:02,000
A third man sets cores and assists with the closing of the cope and drag.

599
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,920
.

600
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,180
.

601
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:12,180


602
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,040
We forgot in the 20th century.

603
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,300
I don't believe in picture windows.

604
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,380
.

605
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,780
Which allows people to inspect my house from outside.

606
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,020
Bye!

607
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:26,580
Oh, my God!

608
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:52,360
Oh, my God!

609
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,700
Oh, my God!

610
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,920
Oh, my God!

611
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,720
Oh, my God!

612
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,100
Oh, my God!

613
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,560
Oh, my God!

614
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,760
Oh, my God!

615
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,020
Oh, my God!

616
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:50,120
The Rudy Schwartz Project Horsebrain Endocasts

617
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:54,340
from their latest album adjacent to the Latex Gerbil.

618
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,460
And now back to X-Day Drill number 24 or 26, depending,

619
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,800
wherein I was unexpectedly called upon by

620
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,680
Peace

621
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:06,120
to do a heartfelt rant right off the top of my head

622
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,680
with no preparation.

623
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,260
But after 26 years of X-Day Drills,

624
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,560
that's not a problem for me.

625
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,420
I wasn't expecting that, but that's okay,

626
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,800
because I have something to say.

627
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,880
This is the best X-Day ever.

628
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:20,980
For me.

629
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:25,180
Maybe not, I mean, it's also the least attended

630
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,500
as far as I can tell.

631
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,860
No skin off my teeth since they weren't charging

632
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,140
any money for it anyway.

633
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,520
And I'm just glad somebody was doing it.

634
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,220
I'm glad somebody came.

635
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,340
Did you come?

636
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,280
Well, you might.

637
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,460
We'll see.

638
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:42,920
Anyway.

639
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,260
Excuse me.

640
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,540
I'm not sure we can get more later.

641
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,960
Anyway, it's the best X-Day ever for me

642
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,700
because I didn't have to do jack shit unless I wanted to.

643
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,900
At some points, I wanted to do jack shit and did.

644
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:02,120
But, oh, it's so much better now.

645
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,120


646
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,120


647
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,120


648
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,120


649
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,120


650
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,580
It's so much easier.

651
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:07,820
I'm used to doing the work of those four stooges there.

652
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,760
I didn't have to, but for the last several years,

653
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,460
I actually physically did all of the setup

654
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:18,520
and technical shit myself just because I learned that

655
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:24,020
if you depend on helpers who aren't being paid,

656
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,820
it just ain't going to...

657
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,180
Sooner or later, you're going to end up going,

658
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,960
I could have done that faster myself.

659
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,260
You don't want them to see you get upset like that,

660
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:38,160
so you have to go hide when you get worked up.

661
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:42,980
I have nightmares about running X-Days and D-Vivals.

662
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:47,560
They basically consist of me wandering through some strange house

663
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,340
that keeps changing.

664
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,800
I can't even find the way out.

665
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:56,100
And all these ninnies and hippie weirdos and geeks and dorks

666
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:00,780
are laughing inanely and making stupid pop culture references,

667
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,100
and none of them are helping me.

668
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,960
They're trying to help me find my car keys or my kids or my dog.

669
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,500
And that's my X-Day nightmare.

670
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,000
But I won't have one this time!

671
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,240
I'm cured!

672
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,640
Praise Bob!

673
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:20,580
And praise Reverend Fox and Fred Cheneley and Pease

674
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:24,720
and Cosmac and everybody who busted their asses.

675
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,060
Lord Ferg, my God.

676
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,840
I don't know what I'd do without Lord Ferg.

677
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,880
He's taken such good care of everyone.

678
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:35,520
And Mom, Asper, Mom, really,

679
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:40,000
I should get her name tattooed on my arm.

680
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,320
Like Pease did.

681
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,520
His name is Blondie and he's a pig!

682
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,500
I'm a pig.

683
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:51,360
But my favorite thing of this whole X-Day

684
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:57,220
was when I was sitting in Reverend Exanthea's house with Dr. Howe.

685
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,860
I'm always going to think of this one.

686
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,020
This is Exanthea Day.

687
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,460
Her name starts with an X.

688
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,880
And they went, oh, there's a walking catfish.

689
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,880
I thought she was kidding.

690
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:15,640
I couldn't see it because my mind couldn't envision such a thing.

691
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:20,160
And her boyfriend ran down there and started taking pictures

692
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,840
and pushing something around with his foot.

693
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,240
And I thought they were going to see what this is about.

694
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,420
Oh my God, there was a dozen walking catfish!

695
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,020
Squibbling around, dragging themselves.

696
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,540
Very deliberately around on the smooth concrete.

697
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,540
When they got to something like a rug,

698
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:39,240
they'd pop up on their little fins and pull themselves along like they were feet!

699
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,120
And they had whisked long whiskers and antennae like a catfish.

700
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,200
I was flabbergasted.

701
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:52,660
I probably saw some news or National Geographic thing about them in the past,

702
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,340
but I forgot.

703
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,660
I live in a dry land.

704
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,400
Real dry.

705
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,160
And I've got...

706
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:04,180
My first thought was, some people here are tripping.

707
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,000
Am I?

708
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,760
But they will...

709
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,520
Zanthia said they're going to be all over the place pretty soon.

710
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,540
For about an hour, they'll just be flopping around everywhere.

711
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,780
Sometimes we'd come out with buckets,

712
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,800
because they get as far as the road and then get exhausted.

713
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,820
And they put them in buckets and bring them back.

714
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,480
You don't want to touch them with your bare hands because they stink!

715
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,760
And they're vicious little creatures.

716
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,740
If you poke them with your foot, they'll whip around and hit you with their razor-sharp tail.

717
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,480
God created such wonderful monsters.

718
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,540
To me, they were monsters, and I loved them.

719
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:51,000
In fact, they kind of reminded me of a certain creature in Monster Hunter that you fight.

720
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:55,960
But that was my favorite part of X-Day.

721
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,620
That's why we don't do it in motels.

722
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:01,260
Like science fiction conventions.

723
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,180
Or your Comic Cons.

724
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,800
Those are really fun.

725
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,160
And they're great for the Bibles, too.

726
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,520
But they're not an adventure.

727
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:15,680
Not like this, when suddenly walking fish rain from the sky!

728
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:20,100
In real life, right in front of your face, and you're not even tripping yet!

729
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,860
So, that's a wonder of X-Day.

730
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,780
In Ohio, we had different miracles.

731
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:32,780
Tornadoes, lightning strikes, deadly tarantula bites and things.

732
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,820
Derechos that put out the power everywhere all over Ohio.

733
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Except that one obscure campground.

734
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,660
We had to keep it secret that we still had ice.

735
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,200
Or it would have been...

736
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,780
They would have gone all Mad Max Thunderdome on us.

737
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,340
Anyway, X-Day is always an adventure, and that's the cool thing about it.

738
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,440
That's why you remember it.

739
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,320
I don't have to camp in a tent anymore.

740
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,920
But I did for many years.

741
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,060
And I didn't have to drive from Texas to Ohio.

742
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,720
But I did 30 times!

743
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,820
And it was worth it!

744
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,640
Because this time I didn't have to.

745
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,580
I didn't even have to drive to the airport.

746
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,340
These guys took such good care of me.

747
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,700
And Dr. Howell.

748
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,180
That Philo...

749
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,760
Philo, you listening?

750
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,560
You fucked up, man!

751
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,500
You fucked up again, Philo!

752
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,140
He could have...

753
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,780
He... he... he fucked up.

754
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:35,620
I've gotten lots of tapes from Philo reminding me that it was me that fucked up.

755
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,840
So don't fuck up, friend!

756
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,980
You didn't fuck up!

757
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,080
You came to X-Day!

758
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,540
No matter the cost.

759
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,100
No matter the inconvenience.

760
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,820
The oppressive heat and unbelievable humidity.

761
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,540
Remember to drink lots of water.

762
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,560
Like Burning Man.

763
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,220
Which also is...

764
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,840
By the end of which you're just screaming at everybody around you.

765
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,940
It's just been such torture.

766
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,580
But it's so wonderful.

767
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,920
I'd go back to that every year if I could.

768
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,500
I really would.

769
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,540
But it's too close to X-Day and too expensive.

770
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,080
And...

771
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,800
My friends all...

772
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,500
Who were part of it in the old days say it's sold out.

773
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,500
But I would still go.

774
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,440
I just can't afford it.

775
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,800
Too sold out, I suppose.

776
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,060
These festival things are great.

777
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,020
And the best thing...

778
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,320
The show...

779
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,280
Everybody knows it.

780
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:30,400
You probably see recordings of it or whatever later if there was anything good.

781
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:33,440
The main thing is standing in the middle of the road talking.

782
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,920
My feet always get real tired.

783
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,000
I forget to sit down.

784
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:42,880
But sitting around a campground and just the talking between the people.

785
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,960
It's amazing how that works.

786
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:49,000
Some of us can be basically anti-social.

787
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,220
But for some reason...

788
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,120
It sometimes changes the next day.

789
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,440
Next thing you know somebody's pregnant and has to get married.

790
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,620
And you've got them christening some red-headed stepchild.

791
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:04,500
And they grow up and end up playing on the stage.

792
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,100
So there you go.

793
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,700
Starwood is similar.

794
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,360
Bigger and with a somewhat more gullible general customership.

795
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,860
But there's a lot of crossover.

796
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,720
I'm married to that also.

797
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,320
But...

798
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,900
Price Bob, we found a new home.

799
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,720
Ex Day or Exanthea Day, whatever.

800
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:32,760
And her dad.

801
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,580
Her dad actually started this place.

802
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,680
And she's been here since she was 11.

803
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,040
She was the subgenius.

804
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,460
I've met her dad.

805
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,040
I can't wait to see his museum.

806
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,980
And this is a wonderful place.

807
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,000
Cool vibes.

808
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:50,300
The residential part reminds me of Trailer Park Boys hippie style.

809
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,200
And I told that to a couple of the workers here.

810
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,840
And they said, that's exactly it.

811
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,000
So...

812
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,920
And that's lately my favorite show.

813
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,100
So there you go.

814
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:05,400
I'm going to get back to playing Trailer Park Boys dirty money on my video game later tonight.

815
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,680
But thanks for coming everybody.

816
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:11,360
And that was a hell of a Papa Joe Mama rant.

817
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,220
Praise Bob!

818
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:13,220


819
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,400
Praise Bob!

820
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,820
Well I'm sorry to get so straight with you and everything.

821
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,000
But you know, that was...

822
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,240
He asked for it.

823
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,300
His name is Blondie and he's a pig!

824
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,220
I'm a pig!

825
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,600
Hijo de un gran puta!

826
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,220
Reverend Ivan Stang.

827
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,160
Let's give a nice round of applause.

828
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,520
What makes Bob holler?

829
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,180
What makes Bob holler?

830
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,060
When I asked Bob he explained this way.

831
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,080
And he said...

832
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:56,440
Well when a little sweety pie in a miniskirt twirls by and rolls those big blue eyes.

833
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,880
Oh, I holler.

834
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:03,920
And when some pretty chick says she loves my fiddle legs.

835
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,400
Well now then, that can do the trick.

836
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,760
Oh, I holler.

837
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,160
Slack makes Bob holler.

838
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:17,040
You can find pictures and videos of X Day at the Facebook page called X Day YouTube.

839
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,240
And you can find pictures and videos of X Day 2021.

840
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:27,600
One of the first events was an impromptu jam which had Reverend Pease and Reverend Fid Chooley on vocals.

841
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:32,900
They were also co-organizing the festivities with Dr. Fox of Hypercube.

842
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,500
And Ruttenberg on bass and I forget on drums.

843
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,460
I may have to edit this for the broadcast radio version.

844
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:40,600
Hi!

845
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,240
But it was nice of you to offer.

846
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:42,680
My name's Bill.

847
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,260
I'd like to be a subgenius too.

848
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,760
Here's my 35.

849
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,120
Can you tell me what to do?

850
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,320
Tell me what to do, Bob!

851
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,140
Tell me, tell me, tell me, Bob.

852
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,840
Tell me, tell me, tell me now.

853
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:01,720
Bob!

854
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:05,260
How come nobody thinks I'm funny and cool yet?

855
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,920
I paid my 35 dollars.

856
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:11,260
I thought everybody was gonna think I was funny and cool.

857
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,640
This isn't fair.

858
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,140
They're all laughing at me.

859
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,960
They're all laughing at me.

860
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,840
What the fuck?

861
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,380
What did I do, Pease?

862
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:21,120
Well?

863
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,040
What did I do?

864
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,400
The first thing you did was try to join the church.

865
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,580
It's a big fucking thing.

866
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:26,780
We don't know what's good.

867
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,580
If you didn't know, you can't be funny.

868
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,060
It doesn't matter anyway.

869
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,000
None of us are.

870
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:33,760
No.

871
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,180
That's not fair.

872
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,040
I paid my 35 dollars.

873
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,000
All of you.

874
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,660
You literally have to be my friends.

875
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:40,860
Is he funny now?

876
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,440
I paid you.

877
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,740
Is he funny now?

878
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:44,220
You.

879
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:44,400
You.

880
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,940
You all have to be my friends and you all have to think he's super funny.

881
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,680
You have to think I'm funny.

882
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,760
I paid for it.

883
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,200
I have a card in my wallet.

884
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,620
I think he's funny.

885
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,900
I don't know.

886
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:56,800
Yeah we got money.

887
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,640
All of a sudden your fucking people really feel lets us out.

888
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,960
Yeah we get in trouble.

889
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,320
No, we just do it for fun.

890
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:07,760
It's the same thing as me.

891
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,660
We don't how much money they put us in, we don't pay their tuition

892
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:12,660


893
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,740
Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me!

894
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:20,840
Time control! Time control! Time control! Time control!

895
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,100
Bob never asks you to meet on the square.

896
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,540
Bob never says that it's level here.

897
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,440
Bob always knows what's going down.

898
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:37,000
Bob is a friend and he's coming around!

899
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,740
Do not fit! He'll be here!

900
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,600
Fuck the X's, but he'll be clear!

901
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,540
Fuck gumes! Fuck gumes!

902
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:52,640
Fuck peeeench! Fuck peeeench!

903
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,580
Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me time!

904
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:04,340
Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me time!

905
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,020
Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me time!

906
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,740
Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me time!

907
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:10,180
Timecap!

908
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:49,340
Gimme gimme bob, gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme bbob

909
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:54,460
In my butt, In my butt, In my butt, Put it put it put it!

910
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:05,860
Get some consent, get some consent, Don't do it without that consent!

911
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:11,460
Get something said, get something said! Then you'll be super content!

912
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:21,940
Fuck peace! Fuck peace! Fuck peace! Fuck peace! Fuck peace! Fuck peace!

913
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:33,200
Fuck peace! Fuck peace, fuck peace! Fuck peace!

914
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,300
So I sent my $35 to Ivan's day.

915
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,740
I thought I'd be funny, but I wasn't.

916
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:44,800
X day!

917
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,120
I left my whiskey in El Segundo.

918
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,620
El Segundo left his whiskey in you.

919
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:53,300
Oh.

920
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,440
Genius has the hat of all things.

921
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,940
One's other humans, and we are content to call them pinks,

922
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,720
can be satisfied by other things,

923
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:09,680
by games of power or accumulation of wealth,

924
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:15,860
or simply by feeling that they got the best of everyone else.

925
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:20,240
The art of the deal, after all, is the art of the steal.

926
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:26,560
The art of getting more of the other person's stuff than you should.

927
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,420
This is all...

928
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,940
This is also called making a profit.

929
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:34,120
And to twisted minds, this is their idea of slack.

930
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,840
But like all false slack,

931
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,920
they keep jonesing and thirsting after more of it

932
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,120
because it does not really satisfy.

933
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:48,340
Not like being able to tell a good joke and get a good laugh.

934
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,720
Hey, Reverend Stang, would you agree with that?

935
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,260
Oh, I would never disagree with that.

936
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,780
Whatever you said.

937
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:02,980
We may not be funny, but we're trying to be funny,

938
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,700
and even the failure can provide humor,

939
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:09,560
and the humor exudes slack into the atmosphere.

940
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:16,340
Well, one time when Philo and I were researching rival cults,

941
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:19,440
before we put together the pamphlet for Bob,

942
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:26,540
we went to the trouble of, well, we studied the direct mail advertising of the Scientologists, the Masons,

943
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,060
the...

944
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,000
and all kinds of more obscure cults.

945
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,680
Hell, there it is!

946
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,380
And we went to an Eckhankar meeting in Dallas,

947
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,440
and they're a fairly typical...

948
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,680
They worship Eckhankar.

949
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:43,880
...New Age theosophy-derived descendant of the Alice Bailey teachings and so forth.

950
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,600
Bunch of looney tunes and wooly stuff.

951
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:48,000
Not Johnny Eckhankar.

952
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:48,420
They...

953
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:53,440
And their meeting was pretty solemn.

954
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:55,860
The Dallas Eckhankar people were...

955
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:57,420
It was probably about 30 people.

956
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:01,400
There were some ladies that were kind of running things,

957
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:04,480
and they were speaking worshipfully of their leader,

958
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,800
Ceri Darwin Gross.

959
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:11,480
He was the main guy at that time.

960
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,500
Ceri Darwin Gross.

961
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:17,940
They had a picture of him on their pulpit, their lectern-type thing.

962
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:21,460
And just at the moment that she was going,

963
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:27,340
and then there is him, he, who needs not be named, but yet, he is...

964
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:27,400
...and then there is him, he, who needs not be named, but yet, he is...

965
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:27,400


966
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,500
Ceri Darwin Gross.

967
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,880
The picture fell off the damn lectern.

968
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,420
That was funny.

969
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,600
Did it reveal another picture underneath it?

970
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:35,980
If only.

971
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:36,940
Oh, yeah.

972
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,480
Philo and I could barely contain ourselves.

973
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:45,840
And that did improve the Eckhankar lecture for us.

974
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,660
However, it happened to me one time.

975
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,280
I started getting a little bit too serious about Bob.

976
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:54,480
It was one of those times when...

977
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:57,060
Oh, somebody gave me...

978
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:57,380
Somebody gave me...

979
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:57,380


980
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,840
...some drug or something before I went on stage.

981
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,600
Coffee or beer or something.

982
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,280
I got...

983
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,280
I wasn't...

984
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,800
I didn't do my usual thing.

985
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,300
I got a little too serious about...

986
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:11,400
Ecology, we could destroy the planet and all this.

987
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:17,660
And the picture of Bob, it was a really big one right behind me, fell to the ground.

988
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:21,540
And I realized I'd let Bob down.

989
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,460
It was me letting Bob down because it wasn't funny.

990
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:25,380
God damn it.

991
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,380
Well, Bob heard you when he wanted to.

992
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:27,380


993
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:32,600
He wanted to jump down and be the first thing to be destroyed with the rest of the planet.

994
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,080
Yeah, I'm lucky the whole stage didn't collapse on me.

995
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,160
That has happened to some Bobbies.

996
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,200
It is strange how that works out.

997
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:43,440
As if there's some master ironist at work.

998
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:50,140
The imminent will that stirs and urges everything and plays mean pranks.

999
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,200
Yeah, in case anyone in your bosses are listening, you guys are really cool.

1000
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,040
Thanks.

1001
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,500
My mom tunes in regularly.

1002
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,200
People, yeah.

1003
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:03,620
Preaching hellfire and damnation.

1004
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,200
Will you guys say hello to Andy Goodman for me?

1005
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,180
I really miss him.

1006
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:09,980
When we see her, we'll say hello to her for you.

1007
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,080
Okay, thank you very much.

1008
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,460
And don't forget, some people come to the show and just watch TV.

1009
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:20,000
And then they say, all three of my brains are somewhat disconnected.

1010
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:21,780
Then they say, phew.

1011
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:24,800
They have three brains and they watch TV.

1012
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:24,840
And then they go slap, attack.

1013
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:25,960
Right, they have their emotions.

1014
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:26,180
They're like, I'm going to die.

1015
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:26,180


1016
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:26,180


1017
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:26,180


1018
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:26,180


1019
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:26,180


1020
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:26,180


1021
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:26,180


1022
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:26,780
They're emotional brains.

1023
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:27,880
They're intellectual brains.

1024
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:28,800
Attacks on Slack.

1025
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:30,000
There we go.

1026
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,660
Okay, now what is he saying?

1027
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:32,300
Attack on Slack?

1028
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,900
He wants an attack on Slack.

1029
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:34,860
No, no, no, no.

1030
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:39,460
The practice administration is trying to develop a new tack on Slack.

1031
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,040
Oh, a new tack on Slack.

1032
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:41,600
I get it.

1033
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:41,960
Wait a minute.

1034
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:42,540
Are you talking about the business industry?

1035
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:45,600
Yeah, he's talking about Slack is just overused, overused.

1036
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,380
He wants to have a new tack on Slack itself.

1037
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:49,460
I thought he was saying attacks.

1038
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:53,760
I'd like a tax break on Slack myself because we never get enough Slack.

1039
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,160
Well, sir, I'll tell you right now, the church is going to be a little bit more

1040
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:56,160


1041
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:56,160


1042
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:56,160


1043
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:56,460
of a mess.

1044
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:59,140
I'm going to tell you right now, the church of the subgenius does not tax any of its members.

1045
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:01,040
We don't believe in tax.

1046
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:02,560
Tax is anti-Slack.

1047
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:04,980
Very good, very good.

1048
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,040
I'll have to buy more brochures and hand them out.

1049
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,040
All you need is your $30 donation.

1050
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,920
I am a member.

1051
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:11,740
Thank you very much.

1052
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,340
Oh, good, good.

1053
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:22,440
I promise you going forward in this administration, we will, read my lips, have no taxes in the

1054
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,780
church of the subgenius.

1055
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,140
I'm going to tell you right now, the church of the subgenius does not tax any of its

1056
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:26,140


1057
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:26,400
members.

1058
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:26,980
I've been telling you, I'm going to call it off.

1059
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:27,360
I'm going to call it off.

1060
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,700
He's doing some liquid Slack right now.

1061
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:34,100
That's a promise, and I can keep that promise.

1062
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:39,300
It's one I'll not break like I normally or sometimes have been known to have to be.

1063
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,580
Right now it's 720 in the morning in Knoxville.

1064
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,520
College of hard knocks.

1065
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:55,300
So, yes, we will be, I think I'm going to put out my platform on my website very shortly,

1066
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,120
and I'm going to put out the link.

1067
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:56,120


1068
00:52:56,140 --> 00:53:03,480
My platform for administration of the Church of the Subgenius into the next 100 years.

1069
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,540
Wow, that'll be cool.

1070
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:14,080
And you can rest assured that in this church, your taxes will only go down below zero.

1071
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:19,800
We may even pay you money to join this church in the future.

1072
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:23,080
A slack tax rebate.

1073
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,180
Thank you.

1074
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:24,900
Thank you very much.

1075
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:32,340
An anti-slack tax rebate that gives you a hedge against the future slack attacks against you.

1076
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,640
I can see it now.

1077
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:37,600
You don't know when they're going to be coming, those slack vampires.

1078
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,380
It'll be coming around each corner.

1079
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:44,240
You'll be slurking and lurking along and there when you least expect it.

1080
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,320
Slack attack.

1081
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:46,440
Slack attack.

1082
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:54,880
And now you'll be with your special secret anti-slack tax rebate from the Church of the Subgenius.

1083
00:53:54,900 --> 00:54:09,920
You can flash that anti-slack tax rebate and defer that horrible attack against your slack in such a way as to cause the monstrous intrusion to completely dissipate.

1084
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:15,860
Many flacks are wary of enacting the anti-slack attack tax.

1085
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:19,360
And yet...

1086
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:24,200
Yes, we're going to try to be an example for all administrations.

1087
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,900
And what is this whole thing about gay marriage?

1088
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:41,960
In the Church of the Subgenius, we believe that any kind of creature should be able to marry any other type of creature without state sanction.

1089
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,640
Ah, creature comfort.

1090
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:45,800
I could be married to you right now.

1091
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:49,080
We're over the airwaves and we don't even know it.

1092
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,180
And who do we need the state to sanction that anyway?

1093
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,680
Certain things bite.

1094
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:54,820
Also...

1095
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,620
Was that a steak sanctioned?

1096
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:58,400
Like a teabag?

1097
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,600
Subgenius ministers have been marrying people for years.

1098
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:04,560
We've married groups of people to each other.

1099
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,400
We've married things to each other.

1100
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,360
With short duration marriages.

1101
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:10,500
Right, through the Universal Life Church.

1102
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,880
No, through the Church of the Subgenius.

1103
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,800
Yeah, you don't need to have any...

1104
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:22,120
When I got my kids from the Church of the Subgenius, it says I was an affiliated minister for the Universal Life Church.

1105
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:24,380
We just say that to make people feel good.

1106
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:31,440
But, you know, we've been given up our own ordinations for thousands of millennia.

1107
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:32,740
Oh, I love it.

1108
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:40,500
Is it true that Bob is neither coming nor going, but he's like somewhere in between, like in quantum physics or something?

1109
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,900
In a state of indeterminacy.

1110
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,900
Well, it is true and not true at the same time, believe it or not.

1111
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,080
That's kind of a hard concept to address.

1112
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:49,620
No, it is.

1113
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,040
That's actually very...

1114
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,360
I mean, from what else I've read, it seems like it makes sense.

1115
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:54,360


1116
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:54,360


1117
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:54,360


1118
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,780
He's sort of in between.

1119
00:55:55,820 --> 00:56:04,640
He balances on the interstitial range between the two counterclockwise vortices of slack.

1120
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:18,080
Those are counterclockwise opposite turning vortices separated only by a small interstitial range of slack.

1121
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,420
On top of which, Dobbs dances.

1122
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:22,880
For your pleasure.

1123
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,700
That little place called Dobbs.

1124
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:30,860
Come along with me down to subgenius land.

1125
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:48,040
Yes, in the secret language of subgenius symbology, we speak to the lesser creatures living close to nature that the ancients felt all things to be interconnected in an intricate web of being.

1126
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:53,920
And there the 60 cycle hogs.

1127
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:54,340
Oh, my God.

1128
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:54,340


1129
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:55,360
Oh, my God.

1130
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:04,740
We're going to finish this work in just a little bit, and then we'll give you your regular programming back.

1131
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:07,060
I'm shaving Hal's pelt right now.

1132
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,600
Ooh, it feels so good.

1133
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,020
How much yeti is Hal?

1134
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:15,300
Hal, are you at least 80, 90% yeti, right?

1135
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,340
I'm afraid so.

1136
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,980
I could celebrate your yeti heritage.

1137
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,260
The physical tropisms are unmistakable.

1138
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,020
Do you ever wax your pelt?

1139
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:24,340
No, not yet.

1140
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,480
that would be excruciatingly painful.

1141
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,840
I've whacked my pelvis a few times.

1142
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,960
Mental state which lets you meditate better.

1143
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:32,880
California.

1144
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:38,500
The Puzzling Evidence Show from KPFA Berkeley,

1145
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:42,000
long ago but still fresher than tomorrow's headlines.

1146
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,880
This is the Hour of Slack from Church of the Subgenius.

1147
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,000
See subgenius.com for details.

1148
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,540
That's subgenius.com.

1149
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:54,860
And now, recorded live at 24X Day,

1150
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,860
the band called Rubik's Pube.

1151
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,600
That's Rubik's with an X, Pube.

1152
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:05,320
They drove to Florida all the way from Pennsylvania.

1153
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:06,540
Praise Bob!

1154
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:39,460
I can't live by myself anymore.

1155
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,440
I need some help from my new brother.

1156
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,740
His old is listening and he's awful good at watching me.

1157
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:50,880
And I think he'll watch me forever.

1158
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:09,500
I don't want to be a zombie anymore.

1159
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,700
I don't want to be a zombie anymore.

1160
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:18,640
I can't live by myself anymore.

1161
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,880
I can't live by myself anymore.

1162
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:02,040
I can't live by myself anymore.

1163
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:06,580
I can't live by myself anymore.

1164
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:12,660
I don't want to be a zombie anymore.

1165
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:12,660


1166
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:12,660


1167
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:12,660


1168
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:12,660


1169
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:12,660


1170
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:12,660


1171
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:14,040
Bob Bob, Bob Bob, Bob Dog.

1172
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:25,200
Does it mean I do the things that you can't do?

1173
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,440
Giving me an excite and a check?

1174
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:32,240
I don't wanna be part of the man

1175
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,460
Said he's doing me no harm

1176
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:39,600
But the things that he does takes a fuckin' like

1177
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:40,960
And a fuckin' arm

1178
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:45,040
I wake up callin' in alarm

1179
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:48,640
Like J.J. Allen at the Christmas Eve song

1180
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:53,520
I wake up callin' in alarm

1181
01:00:53,520 --> 01:01:03,780
And a fuckin' man

1182
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:07,140
Said he's doing me no harm

1183
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:07,820
But the things that he does takes a fuckin' arm

1184
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:07,820


1185
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:08,960
Said he's doing me no harm

1186
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:15,600
But the things that he does takes a fuckin' arm

1187
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,720
And a fuckin' arm

1188
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:24,660
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1189
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:29,860
Ah!

1190
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:45,720
Wait, I'm getting a no-go signal.

1191
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,820
Now I'm losing one of the craft.

1192
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:49,620
Hey Bermuda, you getting it?

1193
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:50,740
I don't know what's the contact.

1194
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:53,040
A lot of dust blowing up there.

1195
01:01:55,240 --> 01:02:01,340
Okay, they're calling those two little kiwi dogs, or the pumpkin birds, I think they're calling them now.

1196
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:02,220
Can anybody hear?

1197
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:02,960
Okay.

1198
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:03,940
Come in.

1199
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:07,200
No, I'm sorry, the Red Seed is...we lost the Red Seed.
