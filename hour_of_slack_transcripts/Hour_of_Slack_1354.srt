1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:09,400
Through the darkness of future pasts, the magician longs to see.

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,200
One chance out between two worlds.

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,500
Fire, walk with me.

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,220
We lived among the people.

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,680
I think you say convenience store.

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,280
We lived above it.

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,380
I mean it like it is, but it sounds.

8
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,940
I, too, have been touched by the devilish one.

9
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,960
Tattoo on the left shoulder.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,300
But when I saw the faces of the dolls, I was changed.

11
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,600
I took the entire arm off.

12
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,820
Mine.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,380
His name is Mike.

14
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,760
His name is Bob.

15
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,220
This is your off-camera announcer reminding you that at this very moment,

16
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,680
I never miss the Power of Squash show.

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,180
You like the Church of the Subgenius and stuff like that?

18
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,480
I do, too.

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,560
I can hardly wait.

20
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,360
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba.

21
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,100
And the Subgenius Power of Squash.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,740
It's the weirdest.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,380
It just scares me to death.

24
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:33,460
Shazam!

25
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,900
We're in the dressing room at the Cal Neva Lodge at the North Shore of Lake Tahoe.

26
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,160
I've just seen a tremendous show with one of the real pros in show business.

27
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,680
This is Ron Lyons, your off-camera announcer, reminding you that I was

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,300
earlier this evening.

29
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,740
Mr. Fontaine, you've seen Bob's

30
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,620
Subgenius Power.

31
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,980
And I was wondering what you think about the

32
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,360
that he plays.

33
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:13,020
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

34
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,880
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

35
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,080
When you say Bob,

36
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,920
you've said a lot of things nobody else can say.

37
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,380
When you say Bob,

38
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,920
you've gone as far as you can go to get the very best.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,080
When you say Vah, you say the word that means you like to do it all.

40
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:42,040
When you say Vah, it means you want the slack, that's number one.

41
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:48,420
When you say Vah, you tell the world you know what makes it all the way.

42
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:56,040
When you say Vah, you say you care enough to only want the king of slack.

43
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:04,900
There is no other one, there's only something less, because the king of slack is leading all the rest.

44
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,360
When you say Vah, you've said it all.

45
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,360
Why did you call me Bob?

46
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,260
I'm sorry if that hurts your feelings, it just seems simpler to tell them what they wanted to hear.

47
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,340
I'm not Bob.

48
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,020
I know.

49
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,360
We have to-

50
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,980
Not on this show.

51
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,260
I'm telling you I can-

52
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,940
You need a doctor for that.

53
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,700
Uh, oh, Rita.

54
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,580
Oh, Rita, you really know how to do it, right?

55
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,720
Ten million years of this is as far as the species has evolved?

56
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,540
I'm not Bob.

57
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,360
I know. You're something special, something different.

58
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,320
You do not know him.

59
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:04,560
Bob.

60
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,740
No, but I want to know you.

61
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,020
Bob.

62
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,780
Help us.

63
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,280
Help.

64
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,480
Help us.

65
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,080
In the eyes of war, we seek your aid, oh lord.

66
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:23,600
Hey.

67
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,520
We can do a better show this time, Posling, because the show has crutches now.

68
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,680
We have show crutches.

69
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,920
Turn in your crutches and walk in the light of the lord.

70
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,400
Throw your crutches away and step forth.

71
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,680
Clean a chosen lamb of god.

72
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,880
Posling, Posling.

73
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,380
Have you healed yet?

74
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,940
Posling evidence.

75
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,300
I had-

76
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,580
I came in and I tried to put my head in the water.

77
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,360
I tried to put my headphones on, but my hat was on, and they wouldn't go on.

78
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:03,360
And I had to pull my hat off, and then the velcro on my fingers went, got stuck to my

79
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:03,860
headphones.

80
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,160
Did you get your hat off?

81
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,360
I couldn't get my finger off my headphones.

82
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,240
Did you get your hat off, though?

83
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,120
Is your hat off now?

84
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,920
I got my hat off and my headphones on, but then my crutches-

85
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,160
So take your hat off.

86
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,460
Get that hat off your head, boy.

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,960
I have a-

88
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
A crutch.

89
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,100
A crutch.

90
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:23,560
I'm a peep.

91
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:23,560


92
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:23,560


93
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:23,560


94
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:23,560


95
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:23,560


96
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:23,560


97
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:23,560


98
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:23,560


99
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,420
It's like switches everywhere.

100
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,480
I'm a cripple.

101
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,840
Billy, Billy, what that?

102
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,080
Billy, Billy.

103
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,100
I'll beat you with this crutch, old lady.

104
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,620
Here, there's just about none of that.

105
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,520
All right, come on.

106
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,260
Hey, hey, calm down.

107
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,660
All right, don't worry.

108
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,880
I have this situation completely under control.

109
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:52,960
That's why.

110
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,960
Aunt Bertha.

111
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,760
Now, she didn't mean anything by it.

112
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,660
Did you, Aunt Bertha?

113
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,700
Did you?

114
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,240
Aunt Bertha, turn that off.

115
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:02,780
Aunt Bertha.

116
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,820
Aunt Bertha.

117
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,880
It's no use.

118
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,800
She has, well, essentially, we call it senile dementia.

119
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,320
Her hour is nearly up, pal.

120
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,440
We will move on to the next exhibit.

121
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,260
I mean, patience.

122
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,720
We don't say senile anymore.

123
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,800
Well, here at Brunndlewood Arms, we do.

124
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,860
We believe in compassion.

125
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,760
We believe in confronting reality.

126
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,240
It is part of the therapy all our patients undergo.

127
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,080
You see, these are the ones cast aside.

128
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,560
They fell by the wayside.

129
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:36,860
Because they couldn't follow the full course in success and science and reinstate.

130
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,640
Oh, no, no, no, no.

131
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,220
The Brunndlewood Institute of Therapeutic Science.

132
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,900
So, so, Stang broke something, that third thing?

133
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,760
He broke his word to the Indians.

134
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,100
Oh.

135
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,860
Jumping off the pleasure saucer?

136
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,600
Oh, that's it.

137
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,620
He broke his third leg.

138
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,580
I know.

139
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:59,720
Colonel Stang, in 1836, broke his word to the Indians, and because of that, there's

140
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,120
been a drought in Texas for 15 years.

141
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,280
I thought it had something to do with ghost torture or something.

142
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,360
Yeah, the GTOs.

143
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,340
Ghost torturers together.

144
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,080
No, only.

145
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,520
Ghost torture only.

146
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,080
Ghost torturers only.

147
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,360
Yeah, GTOs.

148
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,280
That's how you...

149
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:16,800
GTO.

150
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,900
Another, three, better acronym.

151
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,240
That's a good video game.

152
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,360
Ghost torture.

153
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,580
Now, I'm going to go to the next exhibit.

154
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:22,580


155
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,500
I know it's a lot of fun.

156
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,680
Go, ghost torture.

157
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,380
Go, ghost torture.

158
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,720
I'm looking at some dead aircraft from Canada that's been seen in the scorching Arizona

159
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,120
sun forever and ever and ever.

160
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,540
Tanda?

161
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,600
And they're written on the...

162
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,240
Forever and ever and ever.

163
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,200
...on the Wheelwell cover.

164
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,140
Are they from Tanda?

165
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,860
It's a bunch of nonsense.

166
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,460
On the Wheelwell, eh?

167
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,820
It's like three and four and five letter fake words.

168
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,980
Ask for volunteers.

169
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:42,980
Then suddenly it says, Stang sleep.

170
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,200
From Tanda?

171
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,340
Are they from Tanda?

172
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,260
Stang sleep.

173
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,700
Don't fall into Stang sleep.

174
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:49,820
Lighten my eyes.

175
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:49,940
I'll show you.

176
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,320
During the show, I will show you.

177
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,140
Lest I sleep the sleep of the night.

178
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,560
So, you're going to be in the show.

179
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,180
Will you be here for the Ask Dr. Howell live show?

180
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,480
If the Lord is willing.

181
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,580
If I can be here.

182
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,040
Oh, I see.

183
00:07:59,340 --> 00:07:59,820
Wheeling.

184
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,920
By Nurse Philo.

185
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,340
Yes.

186
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:07,160
If Nurse Philo will wheel me there because although I can drive, I can only but hobble.

187
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:07,700
Yes.

188
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,420
I can either drive or hobble, but I can't walk.

189
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,460
You can hobble all the way back to Hobbiton.

190
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,980
I can hobble like nobody's business.

191
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,500
Well, you can play hob with everyone's business.

192
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,120
What happened was I was a little bit...

193
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,040
I outsmarted myself.

194
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,400
I walked out on the rocks at Capitola Beach.

195
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:24,960
Doyle.

196
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,000
For my health.

197
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:26,840
Crackatola?

198
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,920
Exercise, of course, is for your health.

199
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,260
Is that Crackatola?

200
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,160
Yeah, Crackatola Beach.

201
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:35,340
I went out there on the rocks and I saw at the farthest end, there was a broken sign

202
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,800
floating in the water.

203
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,080
Oh.

204
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,520
I wanted to get a photograph of it.

205
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,220
That's so sad.

206
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,760
It said, broken in half, it said, do not walk on slippery rocks.

207
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,360
I was about to take a picture of that sign.

208
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,260
I slipped on the slippery rocks.

209
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,840
Fell down and broke my hand.

210
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,320
I had a hand bone and my ankle bone and now I'm in crutches and they gave me a bunch of

211
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:55,760
these pills.

212
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,980
I just took one and a half of them to see what happens by the end of the show.

213
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,740
So if I start sounding a little bit funny by the end of the show, it's because then

214
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,120
Bob Bones did that.

215
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,920
I see.

216
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,960
Not the radio station, the Bone.

217
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,000
Now, get this.

218
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:16,180
While we were in the ER the next day, which by the way, in Los Gatos is much more pleasant

219
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,540
of a Wednesday than the ER in East Cleveland on a Saturday.

220
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:20,820
Listen to this guy.

221
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,100
I'm going to tell you what I heard last night.

222
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,240
Princess Wee overheard a woman being told that her husband had just died.

223
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:27,940
Oh no.

224
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,000
And get this.

225
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,400
How sad.

226
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,500
He died while exercising.

227
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,360
All right.

228
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:33,940
Exercising demons?

229
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,940
I've been trying to tell people for years.

230
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,720
The last of that stuff I'm going to do.

231
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,080
It'll kill you.

232
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,060
Was he exercising demons?

233
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,660
Exercising will kill you.

234
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,960
Not exorcising, my lad, but exercising.

235
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,520
Oh, okay.

236
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,660
It makes your muscles hurt.

237
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,620
Have you ever noticed that?

238
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,060
I've noticed I get tired when I exercise.

239
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,040
I prescribe to a doctor.

240
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,800
Whenever I exercise, I get tired.

241
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:50,800


242
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:50,800


243
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:50,800


244
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:50,800


245
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:50,800


246
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,860
Whenever I exercise, it makes me tired and sweaty.

247
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,380
You must run seven times around the seven hills of Rome and the curse will be lifted

248
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:58,960
from thee.

249
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:04,480
I notice that this liquid comes seeping out of my pores when I exercise too much.

250
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,160
Unclean, unclean.

251
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,880
And then I have to take a shower.

252
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,660
Shower off that sweaty, sweaty stare.

253
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,000
We use ultrasonic showers now.

254
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,240
No more water in California.

255
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,900
No more water.

256
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,760
Just step into the ultrasonic closet and the dirt fuzzes off.

257
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,380
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

258
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:20,660
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

259
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:20,660


260
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,480
All right.

261
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:22,520


262
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,220
This one's taking a little bit longer than it should but, uh.

263
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,040
This is a most exciting story so sit up close.

264
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,320
Our story begins on a sheep ranch in rugged, beautiful Wyoming where young David Archer

265
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,640
was killed by a wolf.

266
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,640
As our story begins, Dave is sitting in the kitchen talking to his mother who was killed

267
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,380
by a wolf.

268
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,200
Well, tomorrow's the big day of the sale.

269
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,700
How many of our flock is Dad going to sell?

270
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,200
Oh, I don't know for sure. He hasn't decided.

271
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,280
But he's bringing them all in from Mountain Meadow tonight.

272
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,500
He won't sell s***, will he?

273
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,280
Of course. Selling s*** would be like selling one of the family.

274
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,960
Swell, Mom. I'll go down and get them now.

275
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,340
Never saw a boy so crazy after a dumb s***.

276
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,980
And why don't you take a shine to scallop s***?

277
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,520
Because I like home-priced s*** best.

278
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,880
There's your answer.

279
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,620
This long, yellow fangs-beared, Dave raised the rifle.

280
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,220
The rifle roared.

281
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,640
I, Mom, fell dead.

282
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,320
Let me wash the blood off your face and your hands.

283
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,580
Dave, I'm afraid those cuts will leave a scar.

284
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,980
It doesn't hurt a bit, Mom.

285
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,960
Honest. Just so I fell dead.

286
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,520
That's all that counts with me.

287
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,520
Operating simultaneously from all the alpine regions of the earth,

288
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,860
they began to dry up the great rivers at their sources.

289
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,780
And venturing further along,

290
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,400
they spread over the field, they spread over jungle and agricultural land,

291
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,680
and stripped off every leaf.

292
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,740
Valley after valley was devastated as though by endless swarms of locusts,

293
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,260
so that in whole countries there was not a green blade left.

294
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,360
The booty was carried off to Mars.

295
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,540
Myriads of the sub-vital units specialized for transport of water and food materials

296
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,300
were loaded, each with a few molecules of the treasure,

297
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,000
and dispatched to the home planet.

298
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,160
The traffic continued indefinitely.

299
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,680
Meanwhile, the main body of the Martians proceeded to explore,

300
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,580
they were unstoppable.

301
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,160
For the absorption of water and leafage,

302
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,800
they spread over the countryside as an impalpable mist,

303
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,680
which man had no means to dispel.

304
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,440
For the destruction of civilization,

305
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,380
they became armies of gigantic cloud jellies,

306
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,280
far bigger than the brute which had formed itself during the earlier invasion.

307
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,720
Cities were knocked down and flattened,

308
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,780
human beings masticated into pulp.

309
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,560
Man tried weapon after weapon, in vain.

310
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,220
I'm glad I wasn't gonna go this year...

311
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,060
Why?

312
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:51,840
To X Day?

313
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,380
He's talking about X Day.

314
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,900
There's only like 30% of the people who try to get tickets haven't so far.

315
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:58,500
That's true.

316
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,460
Huh, 30% of all people total are males.

317
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,500
Yeah, anybody's ever heard.

318
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:03,820
Which is what?

319
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,220
That's 4,000 people right there.

320
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,440
You're talking about Starwood, right?

321
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:08,840
Yeah.

322
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,000
Talking about X Day.

323
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,480
No, X Day.

324
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,400
X Day.

325
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,940
Yeah, sleep now, X Day.

326
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,520
I've never gone to X Day.

327
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:14,940
I mean.

328
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,540
Why would Drummond do it over there?

329
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,500
How do you get tickets to X Day?

330
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,580
Do you have to like send in a pinky finger or something?

331
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,100
Yeah, basically.

332
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,960
You have to be a sub-G mission in this.

333
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,560
You have to get all the way across.

334
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,240
And you have to pay the ticket.

335
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,820
And you have to get this across the universe.

336
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,740
You're extremely, extremely rural Southern Ohio.

337
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,920
What are we going to do?

338
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,540
Because here in the 70s, you'll be all those giggling, gaggles.

339
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,580
What are you going to do?

340
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,760
You will do anything you want to do.

341
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,180
Anything.

342
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,360
Giggling, gaggles, and gowls.

343
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,440
I don't have anarchy, though.

344
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,820
Of naked gowls.

345
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,660
I don't know.

346
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,740
Cavorting and running, scampering.

347
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,040
There's a lot of cavorting and running and scampering.

348
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,740
Little nymphs.

349
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,880
There's a lot of puking and diarrhea.

350
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,420
Hurling and scampering.

351
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,340
Skiddling.

352
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,560
There's diddling and skiddling and branding, scampering around the town.

353
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:15,320
I heard the worst cover of Mongoloid ever at X Day last year.

354
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,060
Oh, really?

355
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,680
Yeah, the absolute worst.

356
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:17,900
Excellent.

357
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,480
That should be out on the internet.

358
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:18,480


359
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:18,480


360
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:18,480


361
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:18,480


362
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:18,480


363
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:18,480


364
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:18,480


365
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:18,480


366
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:18,480


367
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,600
CD next year.

368
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,260
Maybe we should go for a contest where we try to do a worse version.

369
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,920
No, if you try it.

370
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,580
Yeah, if you try it.

371
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,000
That's the worst.

372
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,540
Because then everybody gets up with their idea.

373
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,440
This is the real thing.

374
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,100
You just have to wait for that thing to fall on your lap.

375
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:37,040
Also, the very worst version of All Along the Watchtower I've ever heard was played

376
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,880
by the same bunch at X Day, including myself.

377
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,440
Was that Lloyd's band, Mongoloid?

378
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,360
No.

379
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,220
No.

380
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,120
It was a jam band that formed spontaneously.

381
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:56,280
And sometimes was really good, but not when they tried to do Mongoloid and All Along the

382
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,760
Watchtower.

383
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,960
Something went very, very, very wrong.

384
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,840
As it were.

385
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,040
Mongoloid.

386
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,740
He was a Mongoloid.

387
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:15,900
You know, that kind of puts in the mind the idea of possibly recruiting some Mongoloid

388
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,940
and, you know.

389
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,020
I think it's been done.

390
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,900
That's a bad idea.

391
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,340
I'm sorry.

392
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,000
It's been done.

393
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,140
There it goes.

394
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:27,600
It's been done.

395
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,200
You said it on the radio.

396
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:29,620
It was done.

397
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,080
It's done.

398
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,040
It happens.

399
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,480
And it's been helicoptered off to the government headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland.

400
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,340
Under lock and key.

401
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,120
Under chain.

402
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,300
Under DOS.

403
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,200
Agreed?

404
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:45,760
Yeah.

405
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,680
Put them in that.

406
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,140
Yeah.

407
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:48,740
Yeah.

408
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,240
I hear that strange, strange.

409
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,020
Yeah.

410
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,160
Strange modulation.

411
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,240
It's come down one point.

412
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,180
It's stridulating and it's modulating.

413
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,220
Yeah.

414
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:01,780
What's the deal?

415
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,600
I'm going to have my own private place.

416
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,800
It kind of seemed like I just heard it on the phone line.

417
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,820
It keeps coming over.

418
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,900
Connect to the monitor in Fort Meade.

419
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,840
It keeps coming over.

420
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,880
And he.

421
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,920
It keeps coming over.

422
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,340
It keeps coming over.

423
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,020
And he.

424
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,200
He said something about.

425
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,540
Next time I'm dispatched.

426
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:25,920
Come in.

427
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,340
Over.

428
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,620
Come on over.

429
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,620
I'm just going to pack them into the radio show.

430
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,920
Well, that's what 60% of all of us do.

431
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,920
We just pack it in.

432
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:36,980
Yeah.

433
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,980
Dispatch them right in.

434
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,840
Something like that.

435
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,180
Yeah.

436
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,480
I figured I could do something like that.

437
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,260
60%.

438
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,720
60% of people don't understand statistics.

439
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,780
And the other.

440
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,840
Other half of them don't know how to use them.

441
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:50,840
Yeah.

442
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,620
Yeah.

443
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,560
Yeah.

444
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:56,640
Yeah.

445
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:56,640


446
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,820
I'm sick of this red white.

447
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,560
You be true to me.

448
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,440
Let me not to you.

449
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,200
Crap.

450
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,240
I always talk about.

451
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:02,720
They did.

452
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,780
They did that.

453
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,720
Just fed up with it.

454
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,200
Can't feed my kids.

455
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,720
Talking about money.

456
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,140
Money.

457
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:12,680
Money.

458
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,180
Talking about money.

459
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,340
Where it's at.

460
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,640
Talking about money.

461
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,200
Money.

462
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:17,520
Yeah.

463
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:17,900
Money.

464
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,360
Money.

465
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:18,360


466
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,200
About money.

467
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,460
Yeah.

468
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:19,620
Yeah.

469
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:19,860
Yeah.

470
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:19,880
Money.

471
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,280
Yeah.

472
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:20,480
Yeah.

473
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:20,480


474
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:20,480


475
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:20,480


476
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:20,480


477
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:20,480


478
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:20,480


479
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:20,480


480
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,840
The streets all cracked up.

481
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,180
Babies getting hacked up.

482
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,100
Mommy turning tricks.

483
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,520
And her arms all tracked up.

484
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,740
Then he got the gears back.

485
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,860
The truck has got the hell up.

486
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,720
Is that any way to make a buck?

487
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,960
In this place we call the land of the free.

488
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,000
And the home of the brave.

489
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,840
It's the home of the slave.

490
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,300
Slave.

491
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,900
It's the home of the slave.

492
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,480
Come on.

493
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,280
Slave.

494
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,400
The rich building silos.

495
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,800
Talking about high and lows, got me some pharmaceuticals, fooled and diabolical

496
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:58,040
The way we be in play, slayed and betrayed, thought you had a degree, ah, thought you had it made, J

497
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,860
Hey, we're talkin' bout money, money, money, we're talkin' bout money, but where it's at?

498
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:22,520
Land of the Penitentiary, home of the slavs, politician buyouts, hobnobbing tryouts

499
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:27,320
F.E.A approving drugs that make me die out? I guess you wonderin' how you're gonna escape it

500
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,020
Gini Piggy, Mr. Piggy, Mr. Piggy, Mr. Piggy, Mr. Piggy, Mr. Piggy, Mr. Piggy, Mr. Piggy, Mr. Piggy

501
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,040
Thank you.

502
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,360
Thank you.

503
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,680
Thank you.

504
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,460
It's the home of the slave.

505
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,100
Come on.

506
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:01,940
Slave.

507
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:17,520
Friends, and this is the home of slack.

508
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,040
Now, the song, however, that's kind of a mystery tune.

509
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,080
It's actually called Home of the Slave.

510
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,600
And it was on a CD.

511
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,840
It was left in my station mailbox.

512
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,080
Kind of anonymously.

513
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,660
It just had handwritten on it.

514
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,080
Home of the Slack.

515
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,420
Copyright SC77.

516
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,340
So, thanks to SC77.

517
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,880
Let's see who else is out there waiting.

518
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,360
Hello.

519
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,840
Oh, it's Dave again.

520
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:51,780
Dave.

521
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,900
With no buzz.

522
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:53,560
Dave.

523
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,960
The buzzless Dave.

524
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,120
The only buzzing is in my ears.

525
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,500
No buzz, Dave.

526
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,620
It's a beautiful product.

527
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,200
And a whole product line, indeed.

528
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,660
No buzz, Dave.

529
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,140
Seems I'm a buzz killer, so to speak.

530
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,840
It's all three of us together.

531
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,080
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

532
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,220
Peepy Longstocking over here.

533
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,840
And me, doo-doo short socks.

534
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,500
Huh?

535
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,820
And, uh, yeah.

536
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,280
We grabbed some new handles for the show tonight.

537
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,360
Yeah, love handles, baby.

538
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,220
Oh, let's see.

539
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:35,180
Before Home of the Slave, which truly was, that is a mystery.

540
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,600
If anybody knows who did that or why it was in my box, I'd love to hear about it.

541
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,780
Stang at subgenius.com.

542
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,300
Before that, puzzling evidence, talking about X-Day, which is coming up.

543
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:52,600
The world ends July 5th, 1998, if this year is actually 1998.

544
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,700
Anyway, it's going to end that year.

545
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,020
It might actually be.

546
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,120
The Firesign Theater, actually David Osman of the Firesign Theater, talking about the Martian invasion.

547
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:15,080
And aside from some puzzling evidence there, which happened to have not only Philo Drummond, but Chaos McBobcat, who's like Mrs. Drummond, and Phineas Narco.

548
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:15,740
Hot stuff.

549
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:26,780
All of the collage stuff this time was by Ministry of Slack, which is yet another subgenius radio show that is entirely podcast and not broadcast.

550
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,160
Except on pirate FM type stations.

551
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,460
Over the Pooper Hooper.

552
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,380
Super cool.

553
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,680
Yeah, that was like Reverend Exister and Reverend Sweetness McGee, I think, did most of that.

554
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:47,180
And oh, in the background here is Balsara and his singing sitars doing Guantanamera.

555
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,540
It reminds me of my days on the island of Pines, sipping coconut milk and drooling on my ears.

556
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,520
That was quite a days you were in, those days.

557
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,220
That's not the same dimension, though, so to speak.

558
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,920
As it were.

559
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,100
As it were.

560
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,300
As it might be spoke.

561
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,800
Except for the dimension where your prostrate exploded on the floor the other night.

562
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,220
Ew.

563
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,760
Now, that's not funny, Dave.

564
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,180
You know, people have had health problems lately.

565
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,400
I don't think any of it's funny, if you ask me.

566
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:26,420
I think it's all a ludicrous example of how not only banal and unexciting people can be,

567
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:26,880
but how...

568
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,100
How...

569
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:27,100


570
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:27,100


571
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,360
Exciting in a strange way people can be.

572
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,220
Mm-hmm.

573
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:38,520
That reminds me of a joke my dad told me on the way over here on the phone, but I'm not going to go into that.

574
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,900
Well, some of these people are just full of hatred.

575
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,880
Well...

576
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,480
I don't know what they...

577
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,700
Speaking of that and sickness, I have put on this Art of the Theremin music here.

578
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,720
Clara Rockmore, thanks to Mr. Sister.

579
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,040
Should all the queens be forgotten?

580
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:55,360
Mr. Sister.

581
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,700
It's suitably...

582
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,980
Grim, because I have some...

583
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,460
Some bad personal news to announce, friends.

584
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,480
No.

585
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:05,820
We're...

586
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:11,760
Tonight, we're going to show you how easy it is to pull one over on subgenius haters

587
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:17,820
just by letting them use the internet and their own wishful thinking to dig their own graves.

588
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,460
And it's going on right now.

589
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:21,980
Across the land.

590
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,420
Well, sort...

591
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:23,820
Not really.

592
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,120
Just a handful of...

593
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,940
Subgenius haters on a news group that we abandoned a long time ago.

594
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,060
But, Dave, have you also been reading about my cancer and liver disease?

595
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:42,120
Yes, that's what I was commenting on earlier about the explosion of your prostate gland.

596
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:42,920
Yeah.

597
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,580
Which I heard was rather messy, but then I heard, by the same token, that if you were a Viking, perhaps,

598
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:56,240
or some sort of drunken Nordic person, it would make you closer to God.

599
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,680
Well, I...

600
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,800
Only if it dies fighting.

601
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:06,900
If my prostate gland dies in battle, consciously in battle, against an enemy, then it goes to Valhalla.

602
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,660
Mm-hmm.

603
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,040
But it's, of course, the Norse god, you know, it's Wotan and all that stuff.

604
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,680
Right, right, right.

605
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,360
Wotan, Wotan, frozen go to the Northland, Halley.

606
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,600
We all know that old song.

607
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,240
Anyway, yeah, I have actually been...

608
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,480
For the last few days, I've been reading about how I have terminal cancer.

609
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,660
And before that, about a month ago...

610
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,000
A month ago, I read that I had liver disease and was in the hospital.

611
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,160
Well, you know...

612
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:35,020
It's actually mountain climbing at the time that that was being said, but...

613
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:40,020
I did then end up in the hospital because of the mountain climbing.

614
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,440
That was referred to earlier in that puzzling evidence thing.

615
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,400
And I'm...

616
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,740
My ankle healed up, and then I stubbed my toe.

617
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,460
So now I've got a broken toe.

618
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,940
It turned out it wasn't your toe, after all.

619
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,400
It was...

620
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,660
It was...

621
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,080
The person next to you in the X space.

622
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:06,360
It was a toe-headed little rascal, what it was, that happens to be at the end of my left foot.

623
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:14,480
Everything on my left side is weak and stringy, but my right side is like Machiste, son of Hercules.

624
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,160
Goliath.

625
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,640
Hercules.

626
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,820
All them damn file cabinets.

627
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,600
But, yeah, it starts...

628
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,960
Here's the funny thing is...

629
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,380
Did I just say that?

630
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,000
Here's the funny thing is...

631
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,520
There's nothing funny about the eruption of bile or posterior fluids in any direction.

632
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,160
Well, sometimes there is.

633
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,960
And we made it funny.

634
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,120
We made this funny.

635
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:48,840
First, I have to give the listening audience, the ones who don't read any subgenius stuff on the Internet, a quick history.

636
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,020
For decades, since the middle 80s, around the time that...

637
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,360
The primitive Internet...

638
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:03,300
The primitive Internet, known as Usenet, was invented, the subgenius forum began, called alt.slack.

639
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,020
And for years, it was great.

640
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:08,720
The best of it is archived on subgenius.com.

641
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,080
But it was, by nature, uncontrollable.

642
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,400
It couldn't be moderated.

643
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,560
It was set up that way.

644
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:19,920
And for a long time, that was good because it attracted kooks and we could make fun of each other.

645
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:24,720
Well, after a while, it filled up with the wrong kind of kooks.

646
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,260
The kind that made it hard to read.

647
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:34,180
Because they would post offensive racialist language every 30 seconds as headlines.

648
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,700
So that the whole news group filled up with just junk.

649
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,400
But we had a solution.

650
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,140
We simply moved to a moderated group.

651
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:49,360
The scrub genius group on Google Groups, which still has you locked out, right, Dave?

652
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,820
As far as I know.

653
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,880
That's because you're nose-picking.

654
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,040
See?

655
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,600
As far as your nose.

656
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,900
Anyway, we'll work all that out.

657
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,760
But we did leave alt slack to the kooks and started a new news group that's got several hundred people in it now.

658
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,540
But here's the fun thing.

659
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:15,140
The people who remained on alt slack, who are all what we might call the differently-signed.

660
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,460
The loyal.

661
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,520
And not in a good way.

662
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,120
They're subgenius haters.

663
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,540
They're in with large breasts.

664
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,680
They're all stuck in a little room together, you might say.

665
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:33,460
And they've learned a lot about what else they have in common besides hating Bob and me and you and the church.

666
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:34,880
They hate each other.

667
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,300
Anyway, they can't see us in scrub genius, our group.

668
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:50,060
But we, the true dues-paying subgeniuses, can see the subgenius haters in their group that we left to them for that purpose.

669
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,800
Now, the other day, I discovered on...

670
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,240
I... I...

671
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,100
don't look at it very often.

672
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,180
In fact, somebody else brought my attention to it.

673
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,060
They said, you ought to check out Alt Slack

674
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,700
because they're talking about how you're dying.

675
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,940
And I said, oh boy, I love it when that happens.

676
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:10,120
And sure enough, this guy from, of all places, Dallas,

677
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:17,400
who goes by the names Ina Quandary or Bob Robertson,

678
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,480
he posted a thing called announcing,

679
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,880
this is not the official news group of the Church of the Subgenius.

680
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,480
Well, duh.

681
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,880
But underneath it said, quote,

682
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:33,060
do not listen to the lies of people who would pull your legs.

683
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,460
I should use a Texas accent.

684
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,320
Wait, how can I not?

685
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:40,060
You should, do not listen to the lies of people

686
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,820
who would pull your legs out from under you.

687
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:47,020
The bleep, coward, satanic, subgenius scum

688
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,380
were driven from this news group many months ago.

689
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,740
Like the beep, beep, beep, slimy cretins they are

690
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,860
they couldn't take the honest criticisms

691
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:01,380
pointing out how hateful they are towards Christians and Christianity.

692
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,040
It's actually not true.

693
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,700
They are the most vile bigots on Usenet

694
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,420
and like the human cockroaches they are

695
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:16,980
they scurried away from the light of reason and decency shown upon them.

696
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,120
Good riddance as they rot in their own collective spew.

697
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,680
Spew.

698
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,800
In their little private, degenerate Google groups

699
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:32,560
while membership in their hateful, satanic, so-called joke

700
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,580
falls to practically zero.

701
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:40,860
Doug Smith, the main, quote, founder of this vile bull, beep,

702
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,420
is reportedly dying of cancer.

703
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,420
It couldn't happen to a nicer Satanist.

704
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,900
Die, you cursed mother, beep, beep, beep.

705
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,160
Die, die, die.

706
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,620
Really, I kid you.

707
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:53,820
Do not.

708
00:30:54,160 --> 00:31:01,040
He likes to, going by Wikipedia, you know, my street human name is Doug Smith.

709
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,720
Nobody calls me that.

710
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,980
And I'm not the founder.

711
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,540
You don't know any humans.

712
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,120
Bob is the founder.

713
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,340
Dr. Philodrumon and I are co-sub-founders.

714
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,720
And doo-doo short socks help.

715
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,300
And pee-pee long stocking.

716
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,280
Anyway, there's other stang and sub-genius haters.

717
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,660
One of the main ones being this person.

718
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,100
This person who posts under the title Mangler.

719
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,860
But he started out as Michael Alcandor.

720
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,000
And we continue to refer to him by the name Alcandor.

721
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:38,120
He's really, well, he's the one where I found out that not only was I Jewish,

722
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,700
but I was also a Muslim Satanist Mason.

723
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,860
And so is my dad.

724
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,780
A lot of Smiths, you know, in that really, anyway.

725
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,280
Alcandor fell for it.

726
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,660
I mean, he wanted to believe that I had,

727
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,040
he had cancer.

728
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,440
So he goes, someone posted earlier, Stang had cancer.

729
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,180
Is that true?

730
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:01,300
How can this man portray himself as a Christian and every other word is God.

731
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:05,780
And I hope he prays on his knees to God and so on and so forth.

732
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,420
And then say these things about wishing someone to have prostate cancer.

733
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,620
This is what confused me for a while.

734
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,200
I stuck my head in the toilet, flushed, stood up, combed my hair.

735
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,080
So that's what number three is.

736
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,200
And sang a little song.

737
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:23,300
And finally, it occurred to me that this person,

738
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:30,660
has literally dug his or owner graver by using such sputage.

739
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,020
Well, the here's the funny thing.

740
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,360
On the Google air.

741
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:33,860
Okay.

742
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,780
Here's the funny thing.

743
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,160
We've been just literally tonight.

744
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,280
We've been actively leading them on, on scrub genius,

745
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,020
Susie, the floozy and me and other people, Dr.

746
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:45,980
Dark and so forth.

747
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,460
A plot.

748
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,320
How can we,

749
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,720
how can we keep these guys believing that Stang is sick and dying of cancer?

750
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,620
I actually do have a little tummy.

751
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,460
Cause we got eight too much last night at a friend's dinner.

752
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,040
Yeah.

753
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,740
You're not supposed to eat the kebab stick.

754
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,840
Just the kebab.

755
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,580
Let's see.

756
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,200
I'll skip past our,

757
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,480
our Norwegian friend who,

758
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,580
who said,

759
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,120
I know,

760
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,460
I know the state nag personally.

761
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,540
They call me St.

762
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,460
Nag for fun.

763
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,520
I know the St.

764
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,320
Nag personally,

765
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:20,460
having presided as a blood spatterer over his knoll ceremony and would never

766
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,180
confirm such a thing to you.

767
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,480
You being a known,

768
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,160
kook of the ninth water.

769
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,100
However,

770
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:32,140
I am as my habit heroically drunk and have contemplated the matter on my

771
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:36,560
beautiful walk home from my regular place of libations where the people all

772
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,620
provided the input of one mind.

773
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,320
All things considered.

774
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,140
My conclusion is this leap.

775
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,680
You lemming boy.

776
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,120
If you gloat over this,

777
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,020
your beep will black and drop off.

778
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,200
I have the folks and the deadly,

779
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,380
deadly chemicals to make sure the curse comes through.

780
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,580
Shut up and go away.

781
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:55,900
Alc,

782
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,100
Alcandor who hates me took that as a yes.

783
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,280
Stang must be sick in a quandary.

784
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,780
The Dallas guy said,

785
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,140
Douglas Smith has prostate cancer brought on in part.

786
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:09,580
Oh,

787
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,460
he's the Texan.

788
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,280
Douglas Smith had prostate cancer brought on in part from many years of illegal

789
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,100
drug abuse.

790
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,320
He's getting exactly what he deserves.

791
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,960
The best thing about this,

792
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,460
of course,

793
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,500
is the knowledge that he will be on his knees,

794
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,120
begging,

795
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,220
begging to God for forgiveness before this is over.

796
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,400
Then his,

797
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:33,660
his sorry ass dies and go straight to hell like the evil degenerate Satanist

798
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,420
that he is and always will be.

799
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,520
Of course,

800
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,460
all his inner satanic circle,

801
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,500
Pisces,

802
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,300
Susie,

803
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,520
Zapanaz,

804
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,220
et cetera,

805
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,180
will deny he has anything wrong with him at all.

806
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:45,960
That's to be expected.

807
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,480
Of course,

808
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:51,820
take a trip to Cleveland Heights to his home and pound on his door,

809
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,100
demanding that he be forgiven.

810
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,560
And if he does,

811
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,140
he'll be in jail for the rest of his life.

812
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,640
Now,

813
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:56,640


814
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:56,640


815
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:56,640


816
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:56,640


817
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:56,640


818
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:56,640


819
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,580
and his saving grace,

820
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,560
and how towards the end of his pathetic life,

821
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,000
who Jesus or me,

822
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:06,580
he is having second thoughts on his stupid little joke against God.

823
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,020
God has no sense of humor,

824
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,340
forsakenness,

825
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,480
as Stang will find out.

826
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:14,940
Now,

827
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,260
them some warning words,

828
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,040
compadre.

829
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,620
If I were you,

830
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,700
I'd stay away from that guy.

831
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,640
Sounds like he needs a restraining order slapped on his hiney.

832
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,260
Well,

833
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:23,460
oh,

834
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:23,820
no,

835
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,680
I don't care about that.

836
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,080
There's,

837
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:25,500
there's,

838
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:25,700
um,

839
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,120
then the other Stang haters joined in.

840
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,560
Someone who calls himself JJ Baby said,

841
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,880
you have rotten brain disease.

842
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:38,820
Why are you so concerned about the health of some old Jew who used to post here?

843
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,040
Is he one of your gay Jewish boyfriends?

844
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,420
And,

845
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:42,640
uh,

846
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,080
see,

847
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,960
what are you?

848
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,260
A Jewish,

849
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,560
a Pope hater or something?

850
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:47,940
Right.

851
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,500
Did Stang steal your girlfriend?

852
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,180
That's the first thing people usually think.

853
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:52,500
Anyway,

854
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,340
this other guy,

855
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,020
C.

856
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,140
Wallard,

857
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:55,980
said,

858
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,580
completely mistakenly,

859
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,000
he thought,

860
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,140
he thought that the,

861
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:00,620
the,

862
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:00,920
the,

863
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,020
uh,

864
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:04,440
you have rotten brain disease guy was somebody else.

865
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,140
So he goes,

866
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:05,900
Joe,

867
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,340
I liked you better when you were a passive,

868
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:08,820
aggressive,

869
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,500
concerned troll.

870
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:18,600
It worked better with your writing style and given everybody's self-esteem issues was quite a bit more effective.

871
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:19,900
Unfortunately,

872
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,140
this guy happens to be,

873
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,400
be,

874
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,200
being clever to somebody he thinks is somebody else.

875
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,200
And he's a man who wears a shawl.

876
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,260
Just when you,

877
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,400
you know,

878
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,300
just when you're trying to be the smartest,

879
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,560
that's when you find out you just proved you were the dumbest.

880
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,400
And I shouldn't have even said that.

881
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,340
Well,

882
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:38,660
like,

883
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,520
and Adam's climbing a mole heap.

884
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,120
Um,

885
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,640
as the news of your death travels around the globe,

886
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,920
there's going to be thousands of these file benefit dish dish disinfectors,

887
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:49,840
um,

888
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,060
from,

889
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:51,880
from every corner.

890
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,480
They're just going to,

891
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,340
they're going to be surrounding you.

892
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:53,700
Well,

893
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,740
it proves we're doing it right.

894
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,120
Actually,

895
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,240
they would be surrounding Bob Dobbs,

896
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:58,580
but,

897
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,620
uh,

898
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,300
he was smart or luckier rather than I was.

899
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,280
And he hired me to be his little scarecrow.

900
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:08,540
Uh,

901
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:08,960
well,

902
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,100
you might,

903
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,140
you might want to get one of them,

904
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:11,380
uh,

905
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,160
nuclear powered hockey sticks or something.

906
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,320
Keep her on the house.

907
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,280
Um,

908
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:15,940
anyway,

909
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,140
so,

910
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,020
so we got,

911
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,460
we got to seeing,

912
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,240
uh,

913
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,460
somebody drew our attention to this.

914
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:28,900
This whole routine where these people on alt slack were gloating that Stan was dying horribly of cancer.

915
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,140
And,

916
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:30,360
uh,

917
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,100
Reverend Susie,

918
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:32,740
the floozy.

919
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,120
I'll do her voice.

920
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:34,380
Love it.

921
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:34,920
She,

922
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,660
she brought,

923
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,100
uh,

924
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,300
our attention to it.

925
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:37,620
Princess.

926
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:37,920
We,

927
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:38,340
you said,

928
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:38,860
Oh,

929
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,640
he's laughing at that one.

930
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:44,100
Like a P freak slobbering over a truck stop men's room floor.

931
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,100
This could be the time for some major mind rape shenanigans.

932
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:52,160
It's been a while since we went bait fishing over there.

933
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,640
I mean,

934
00:37:53,660 --> 00:38:04,760
it's hard to hide the fact that staying was just out West where there's that secret Bohemian Grove cancer research Institute full of sorta ex Nazi doctors who cure it.

935
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:13,460
Sinister cult leaders while they work on infecting everyone like Alcantara was squamous cell carcinomas through microwaves beamed into their skulls.

936
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:19,360
Staying takes a little vacation and then suddenly had to spend a quite a bit of time out there.

937
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,120
And,

938
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:21,440
uh,

939
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:21,900
I,

940
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,460
as I said,

941
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:22,460


942
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:22,460


943
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:22,460


944
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:22,460


945
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:22,460


946
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:22,460


947
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:22,460


948
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:22,460


949
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:22,460


950
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,120
it's true that my toe hurts.

951
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,220
And the doc,

952
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:26,720
the doc,

953
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,040
Dave,

954
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:31,840
the doc said that I've got maybe three weeks tops and then my foot will fall off.

955
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,340
Then my legs and arms,

956
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,560
then my body will fall off.

957
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,440
Then my neck will fall off.

958
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,600
And finally my head will fall off and there won't be anything left.

959
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,000
Susie came back and she said,

960
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:42,180
see,

961
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:42,920
see,

962
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:43,540
it's true.

963
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,420
Stanks got a bad case of cancerous fragmentation.

964
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,120
I hate it.

965
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,180
When Alcantara proves,

966
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:50,680
right?

967
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,040
Hey,

968
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:52,860
did it ever happen?

969
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,440
Has it?

970
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,460
Man,

971
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,360
that was arrow deity.

972
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,940
She nailed it right on the head.

973
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,580
Your body was malfunctioning so badly that the different parts were disassembly.

974
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,780
That could be a problem with the master producer cylinder,

975
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,440
uh,

976
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:04,920
creator,

977
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,080
the actual brain link itself might,

978
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,940
you might be telling yourself to release your arms because you know,

979
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,300
you're just tired of having them wagon around when you're trying to go somewhere.

980
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,340
Do you ever cut the head off of GI Joe?

981
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,220
Oh,

982
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:18,840
of course he did.

983
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,980
Many times the arms and legs pop off.

984
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:29,280
that caused me quite a bit of trouble during a certain Devo music video stop-motion shoot.

985
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:34,680
Well, did you ever take apart a G.I. Joe and stuff like that with a bunch of other kids around

986
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,020
and put lighter fluid on it?

987
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:40,400
I wasn't in the military. I was 4F. I missed Vietnam.

988
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,620
Bless those flat, flat feet.

989
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:51,480
Anyway, we decided, okay, what happens if we lead these guys on?

990
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:55,840
In fact, Dr. Dark posted to Alt Slack.

991
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:01,320
Dr. Dark, who lives in Cleveland, is known as someone who knows us personally.

992
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:07,440
By the way, he's not a transvestite, nor has he ever used aluminum sulfide as a hair conditioner.

993
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,520
That's besides the point.

994
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,340
Dr. Dark said, yeah.

995
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,300
Disclaimer.

996
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,080
To help these people believe this story, he said, yeah.

997
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:19,980
If Stang makes it to X-Day, it'll be a miracle, which, of course, sets us up for a miracle.

998
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,420
But, yeah, it's true.

999
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:28,220
These guys are so—facts will not get in the way for these people.

1000
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,300
For five years straight, that Alcindor guy insisted I was Jewish,

1001
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,180
and then suddenly, I guess after reading Wikipedia or something,

1002
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,960
he insisted that he had never once claimed I was Jewish.

1003
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,840
The crazy 11-11 guy, Jalon,

1004
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,140
and the fake Canadian Bob, Bob Dean,

1005
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,960
have both had such vivid visions of me

1006
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,480
that they've told me where to find lost objects in my house,

1007
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,240
objects that never existed to begin with,

1008
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,400
and the areas they told me to look likewise exist only in their visions.

1009
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,780
So, in other words, they flunked the Stangian psychic powers test

1010
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:09,540
without even discerning psychically that it was a test.

1011
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,880
Well, that's the first thing they do when they see you're getting ready to seize power.

1012
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,940
They've heard about your—

1013
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:15,080


1014
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,640
—up-and-cumbering plans to join the erection,

1015
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,700
maybe you're in November or May, whichever time you can get in there.

1016
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,400
And that's what they'll do.

1017
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,280
They usually—they collect all the information.

1018
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,420
They get a huge database together, and they slip out a little profile.

1019
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,520
And that's how they attack you for, you know, in times—

1020
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,760
the early vetting stages haven't even begun yet,

1021
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:41,560
and they're already proving that Stang is a transvestite who has prostate and lung cancer,

1022
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,380
and cerebral cortex.

1023
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,220
There's something wrong with it that's making your brain shrink,

1024
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,700
which we knew was happening anyway, and now your thumbs are falling off.

1025
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,240
Now, aren't you going to call me judgmental?

1026
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,540
Because usually when we go into all that stuff they throw in that I'm really judgmental.

1027
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,680
Well, you appeared before judgmental many times,

1028
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:06,600
and he deemed you a non-compost mintage, as they used to say.

1029
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:11,700
Well, anyway, I told this to the scrub geniuses, all right?

1030
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,980
I said, I'd love to watch the alt-slot.

1031
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,540
It's alt-slack.

1032
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:22,540
Ant-bed were some trustworthy subgenius to accidentally reveal, yeah, it's true,

1033
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:28,440
Stang's dying very slowly of a terribly painful anus cancer, but won't admit it,

1034
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,740
and he's secretly trying every kind of quack alternative medicine cure,

1035
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,520
like sweat lodges, praying, cupping, ear candling, and so forth,

1036
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:41,820
but going into debt to pay for it, wiping out his kid's inheritance,

1037
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,760
and thus being ostracized from his family.

1038
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,900
And, Princess, we.

1039
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:50,020
I said, so, you know, go ahead and get these guys to believe this.

1040
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,140
And Susie noticed...

1041
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,240
Dr. Dark!

1042
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,040
Well, they did the same thing to Santorum.

1043
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,340
They noticed that he was mentally ill.

1044
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:01,780
Like the time he took a fetus home with him and stuff and tried to get a priest to bury it,

1045
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:05,640
which put him in a stranger camp that he was already in,

1046
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,900
and he was kind of told that it can't be done.

1047
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:13,840
As long as you remember your PR team is behind you,

1048
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:14,880
you can counter any of that.

1049
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:20,440
And you don't have to disclose how, you know, you have five bazillion...

1050
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,280
Your assets are over five bazillion, whatever that is.

1051
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,560
Well, eventually the conspiracy will do this to everyone.

1052
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,820
But Susie noticed that Dr. Dark had...

1053
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:37,840
Just dropped a couple of convincing steamers over there to feed the poo eaters.

1054
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,640
Oh, shenanigans.

1055
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:45,060
Well, so that encouraged Dr. Dark, and he decided to get preachy on it.

1056
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:45,640
He said...

1057
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,660
They had said, you know, I hope he dies soon.

1058
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,900
And Dr. Dark said, easy for you to say.

1059
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,060
It's spread from the prostate.

1060
00:43:53,420 --> 00:44:01,220
All real Christians should pray for Stang rather than pray on him in these trying end times for him as well as us.

1061
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,180
Christ forgave as well as healed the sick.

1062
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:10,520
If Christians' prayers heal him when there's no hope now due to metastasis,

1063
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,460
I'll bet he denounces his own church and becomes a Christian himself.

1064
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:14,900
So here's your chance.

1065
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,480
Christians should practice what you preach as well as get the results that you want.

1066
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,580
But our other friend, General Public,

1067
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:29,760
who, by the way, has started a subgenius wiki that's full of cool disinformation.

1068
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:35,860
It's called subgenius.wikia.com or subgenius wikia clench.

1069
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,900
It's a whole world unto itself.

1070
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:43,220
Anyway, he said to the alt-slack people, okay, who still believe this is all true.

1071
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,240
He goes...

1072
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:44,940
I wish...

1073
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:45,060
I wish...

1074
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,160
It weren't true, but it is.

1075
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:54,280
There's a big thread at Scrub Genius right now from Stang about how all the doctors told him he hasn't got much longer to live from the cancer.

1076
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:04,220
That it's metastasized and he's trying all sorts of alternative holistic medicine now because Western medicine has nothing left to offer him.

1077
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:10,200
Everyone's wishing him the best and hoping he somehow makes it through the cancer and survives.

1078
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,200
I can't believe people are gloating about his cancer so gleefully.

1079
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,760
This man is sick and he's slowly dying.

1080
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,340
I thought Christians were supposed to have compassion.

1081
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,720
You should all pray for him to get better.

1082
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,900
It's the least all of you so-called Christians could do.

1083
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:32,600
And yes, Stang did get down on his hands and knees and beg God for forgiveness and offer himself to Jesus Christ.

1084
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,900
But he also prayed and submitted himself to every other deity and every other religion he's ever heard of.

1085
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,140
Just in case anyone's listening up there.

1086
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,520
He's really desperate now.

1087
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:41,900
Very sad.

1088
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,080
He's barely strong enough to type.

1089
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,700
We does most of his typing for him now.

1090
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,360
This is upsetting me.

1091
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:55,440
Now the Church of the Subgenius is mostly turned into a support group to help make him feel better.

1092
00:45:56,180 --> 00:46:01,600
Everybody's always telling him how the subgenius stuff saved their lives when they were deeply depressed or things like that.

1093
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,920
But I'm sure he can tell people are just making all those stories up to make him feel better.

1094
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:11,200
Honestly, if you really are Christians, you should be praying for this man's salvation.

1095
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,080
He hasn't got much longer to live.

1096
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,200
To which Inner Quandary said,

1097
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,840
That's the best laugh I've had all week.

1098
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:19,540
Thanks.

1099
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,180
Woo-hoo.

1100
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,520
And J.G. Baby said,

1101
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:26,660
I don't wish cancer on anybody, but this guy sounds like a real dip.

1102
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,740
And then Susie says,

1103
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:37,020
General public, you understand that what happens on scrub stays on scrub.

1104
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,160
Or we'll take away your secret decoder ring.

1105
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,300
Lol, lol, lol.

1106
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,140
Pathetic.

1107
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:42,820
Wipes.

1108
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:43,540
So.

1109
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,660
See, Susie dropped that in there just to make the whole thing look more realistic.

1110
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:52,180
Like, hey, you know, don't spread word to these alt-slack haters about our problems.

1111
00:46:52,800 --> 00:47:01,440
Whereas in actuality, now, here I am on the live radio explaining that we're pulling this trick on these,

1112
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:08,540
what would you call them, cast-offs from the losers group?

1113
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,540
Wee, the voice is not working, right?

1114
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:12,820
Stan keeps repeating himself.

1115
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,000
Could you, like, roll it back?

1116
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:14,460
A little bit?

1117
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:19,640
They could call it peanut gallery, but that's kind of an old-fashioned term.

1118
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:27,720
You know, Dave, I just wanted to mention that you were talking about not eating the sticks of the kebabs last night.

1119
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,680
And I just wanted you to know that we did have bobs.

1120
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,520
We had bubba rum.

1121
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:39,520
I knew you were going to have to get in that inside joke stuff about our dinner last night.

1122
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,280
I knew it.

1123
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,520
I knew it when we were on our way over here.

1124
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,860
That's what gave you prostate?

1125
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,940
The cancer right there is bubba rum.

1126
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:46,300
That's right.

1127
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,300
You're only supposed to eat a portion of one of those unless you've consumed three gallons of whiskey.

1128
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:51,920
Right.

1129
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,320
Well, we did.

1130
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:53,700
Which you did, too.

1131
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:54,360
Yeah.

1132
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:59,060
We did actually wake up feeling a little right mind left behind.

1133
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,960
I say let your organs hang out, Stang.

1134
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,180
There's no use keeping it off the internet.

1135
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:10,220
All you got to do is just go up there and take a picture of it and show everybody where the scars are and what the heck's going on.

1136
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:13,320
Actually, I got a new microscope I should post.

1137
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:21,480
It's pictures of rotifers squirming against each other and say that this is the X-ray of my prostate.

1138
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,020
The state of my prostate.

1139
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,320
The rotifers are really pretty gross, too.

1140
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:31,500
I got a new microscope that takes the kind of pictures men like.

1141
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,300
You know what I mean?

1142
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:33,600
I think you should do that.

1143
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:38,720
We should even discuss it fully on the air because, as you said, none of the lunatics listen to the show anyway.

1144
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:39,860
Well, that's the thing.

1145
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,480
Two weeks from now, this show will go online.

1146
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,760
I mean, people are listening.

1147
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:50,760
Listen on WCSB.org right now at this moment in time, which is the past time for most people hearing it.

1148
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,500
Of course, we're all in on it.

1149
00:48:53,620 --> 00:49:08,680
These guys get to hear it when it's three weeks old and they've caught on that they made up a story and wanted to believe it so badly that in all of their minds it was true.

1150
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,340
They could very easily.

1151
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,960
If they really wanted to know.

1152
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,180
If they really wanted to know the truth, listen to last week's Hour of Slug.

1153
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:24,420
Obviously, we and I are out traveling around the country doing things, not what a guy with terminal cancer would be doing.

1154
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:29,960
But knowing what's really happening is not what they want.

1155
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,260
Don't bother with the facts, man.

1156
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:38,160
What they want is to believe what they want to believe, so they're not going to be listening to us tonight.

1157
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:42,580
We'll wait until they get really, really gloatful about it.

1158
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:53,620
And then we'll spring them the link on this show of me reading their words in character voices, which they won't be able to respond to.

1159
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:56,160
Who those people really were, so to speak.

1160
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:06,760
Well, anyway, Dave, didn't our mutual literary agent, Reverend Haidt, do a hate song?

1161
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,020
Yes, he did.

1162
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,300
He has a band.

1163
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:10,060
This is true.

1164
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,160
Dave and I and Reverend Susie.

1165
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:20,180
Susie, for that matter, have been agented for book purposes by Reverend Haidt, Gary Haidt in New York.

1166
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:24,320
And he has a band called Fist of Kindness.

1167
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:31,220
And he did this song, which we're going to kind of close the show out with some tunes, I think.

1168
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:33,020
Yes, it's thematic.

1169
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,720
I'll leave you on, and we might check in between these.

1170
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:42,500
Fist of Kindness doing a song called I Want to Kill You.

1171
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:53,100
I Want to Kill You, which you could interpret as the subgenius haters wanting to kill Bob and Dave and me and Princess Wee and themselves.

1172
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:58,280
It's actually, if you listen to the lyrics, it's really about the Iraq War.

1173
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:05,280
Then I'll play The Death Bellies, the true name of the band that Sister Decadence turned us on to.

1174
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,280
And they're doing a, well, you'll see.

1175
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,100
So let me play this.

1176
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,300
We'll pull the theremin out.

1177
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,640
Or put it away, rather.

1178
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,500
Slowly pull the wool over my own eyes.

1179
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,040
And play the Dave.

1180
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,340
It's the Dave.

1181
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:27,620
Stuff my nostril with olives, ripe telematas from the neighbor's backyard garden.

1182
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:31,540
And then we strung the olives, and they vibrate.

1183
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,000
Okay.

1184
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,680
Fist of Kindness, I Want to Kill You.

1185
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,780
I Want to Kill You.

1186
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:52,620
Oh, man, I do not want to kill you.

1187
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,340
Oh, I want you dead.

1188
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,220
But I don't choppy choppy head.

1189
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:58,500
No.

1190
00:51:58,660 --> 00:51:59,120
Whoa.

1191
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,300
Whoa.

1192
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,320
Whoa.

1193
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:03,340
Whoa.

1194
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:05,780
Whoa.

1195
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:06,360
Whoa.

1196
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,260
Whoa.

1197
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:08,000
Whoa.

1198
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:08,500
Whoa.

1199
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:09,240
Whoa.

1200
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:09,800
Whoa.

1201
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:11,780
Whoa.

1202
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:11,780


1203
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:12,120
Whoa.

1204
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:12,120


1205
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:12,280
Whoa.

1206
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:16,640
Cryptocracy cannot steal that much from me

1207
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,500
Cryptocracy has no secret that I cannot see

1208
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:27,920
I wanna kill you, but I do not want to kill you

1209
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:33,860
I want you dead, but I don't chop your choppy head, no

1210
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,060
When the planes flew overhead

1211
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:40,320
And all the fluffy chickens ended up dead

1212
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:43,200
I know that would change a thing or two

1213
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,520
About the way you run your chicken coop

1214
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,460
I know a decade passed and yet

1215
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:52,520
You start a war that never ends

1216
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,400
You call a chicken a broiler and pretend

1217
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,580
And you don't mean the message it sends

1218
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:03,860
I wanna kill you, but I do not want to kill you

1219
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:06,640
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I want you dead

1220
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,220
But I don't choppy, I don't choppy choppy head

1221
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,160
But I don't mean the message it sends

1222
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:23,160


1223
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,440
I am no cowboy

1224
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,940
I am no fellow

1225
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,760
But I don't know what you're trying to do

1226
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:38,980
I want to kill you, but I don't like you

1227
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:39,380
I wanna kill you

1228
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I want you dead.

1229
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,780
But I know chubby, I know chubby, chubby hair.

1230
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:48,760
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1231
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,660
I know chubby, I know chubby hair.

1232
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,960
I know chubby, I know chubby, I know chubby, I know chubby hair.

1233
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,060
Ha, ha, yeah!

1234
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,900
Fist of kindness.

1235
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,540
I want to kill you.

1236
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,520
And you're listening to The Hour of Slack

1237
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,040
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

1238
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,820
yours truly, Reverend Stang and Princess Wee,

1239
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,240
and the haters of alt.slack.

1240
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:19,360
You can learn everything at subgenius.com if you want to.

1241
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,020
And to all of them we say,

1242
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,520
we're not going to die.

1243
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,960
At least we're going to try.

1244
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,900
Well, as Dr. LeGime put it,

1245
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:33,860
nobody's biography has a happy ending.

1246
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,980
But I suppose some are happier than others.

1247
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:38,340
Anyway.

1248
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,800
You know what the next step is.

1249
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,880
It's shaving the entire skull,

1250
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,380
looking for the implant,

1251
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,220
pulling it gently out,

1252
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,620
then putting it back in again,

1253
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,560
and it takes too much time.

1254
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,280
And you hate the procedure.

1255
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,720
So, it's a good thing you did that.

1256
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:55,900
It's in your teeth, Bob!

1257
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,880
That's where the transmitter is.

1258
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:58,900
It's in your teeth!

1259
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:02,220
You gotta pull them all out like I did.

1260
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,360
Ooh, see?

1261
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,680
That's what I done, too.

1262
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:06,880
A cross-pecker, you see, was confused,

1263
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,660
and therefore I...

1264
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,580
I grabbed a wrench first,

1265
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:14,240
and then I decided just to take a hammer and remove them.

1266
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:14,700


1267
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:15,520
Mwah.

1268
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:19,460
Well, and so now it is time to close.

1269
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:22,960
Toothless, argumentative, full of cheese,

1270
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:27,920
yet willing to sit back and sting ourselves with a thousand beads.

1271
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,060
Hey, speaking of which, don't you have a book,

1272
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:33,480
an e-book out now called Dorkus?

1273
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,640
And the Affairs of Lord Willing.

1274
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,180
That's really the name.

1275
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:38,600
It's a good book.

1276
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:39,840
I'm kidding, by the way, friends.

1277
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:45,580
There really is a book out by Dave, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, and his friend Wes,

1278
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:51,000
called Dorkus and the Lords of Willing.

1279
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:53,860
And The Affairs of Lord Willing.

1280
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:55,620
Oh, The Affairs of Lord Willing.

1281
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:56,100
No wonder I...

1282
00:55:56,100 --> 00:56:02,100
It is a steampunk kind of satire, making fun of the genre and yet employing the genre.

1283
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:03,460
Uh-huh.

1284
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,260
Uh-huh.

1285
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:07,060
And having some funny advertisements in there,

1286
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,060
like an old...

1287
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:13,880
Tape any horror you would take on the train to London or Boston or something to read as you...

1288
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:19,040
Well, we have to go now because lonesome radio synesthesia just came in,

1289
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:24,060
so I'm going to fade you out and I'm going to play the death billies, speaking of genre bashing.

1290
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:26,160
Well, I'm going to try burp for half an hour and you can catch that fade.

1291
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:26,900
I'm getting ready.

1292
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:28,320
Okay, here it goes.

1293
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:28,780
We're failing.

1294
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:30,240
Burp fade.

1295
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:32,580
Burp fade.

1296
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:33,400
Burp fade.

1297
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:33,600
Burp fade.

1298
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:33,900
Burp fade.

1299
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:35,940
Burp fade.

1300
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:36,520
Burp fade.

1301
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:38,020
Burp fade.

1302
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,880
Burp fade.

1303
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,720
Burp fade.

1304
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:50,920
Burp fade.

1305
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,200
Burp fade.

1306
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,580
Burp fade.

1307
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:54,960
Burp fade.

1308
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:55,160
Burp fade.

1309
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:56,260
Burp fade.

1310
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:56,960
Burp fade.

1311
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:57,980
Burp fade.

1312
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:59,120
Burp fade.

1313
00:56:59,120 --> 00:56:59,120


1314
00:56:59,120 --> 00:56:59,120


1315
00:56:59,120 --> 00:56:59,120


1316
00:56:59,120 --> 00:56:59,120


1317
00:56:59,120 --> 00:56:59,120


1318
00:56:59,120 --> 00:56:59,400
Burp fade.

1319
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:01,560
Burp fade.

1320
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,020
Burp fade.

1321
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:03,120
I don't understand.

1322
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:03,120


1323
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:03,120


1324
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:03,120


1325
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:03,180
This will do it actually.

1326
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:03,180


1327
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:03,180


1328
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:03,180


1329
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:03,180


1330
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:03,220
If you were to ask Trev this first question...

1331
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:03,220


1332
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:16,880
Crazy, crazy for feeling so lonely

1333
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:24,020
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue

1334
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:30,760
I knew you'd be as long as you wanted

1335
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:37,380
And then someday you'd be there for somebody new

1336
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,800
Worry, why do I let myself worry

1337
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,760
Wondering what in the world did I do

1338
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:58,740
Crazy, thinking that my love could hold you

1339
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:04,340
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying

1340
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,280
Crazy for loving

1341
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,360
Crazy for loving

1342
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:23,640
Worry

1343
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:23,740
Worry

1344
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:23,780
Worry

1345
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,360
Worry

1346
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:36,660
We'll see you next time.

1347
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:43,140
We're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1348
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:48,160
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1349
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:55,220
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1350
00:59:55,360 --> 01:00:02,720
you should go to subgenius.com front page or especially the radio page or the catalog store pages

1351
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:06,060
and help out financially as best you can.

1352
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:10,420
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty

1353
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:14,080
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1354
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:17,060
But some of you still have jobs.

1355
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:23,920
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1356
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,300
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1357
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:35,140
All we're saying is that blowjobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1358
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:40,600
We also take checks and money orders to subgenius foundation.

1359
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:53,060
P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1360
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:58,300
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1361
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:10,140
We know what it's like to be on aflight free.

1362

We know what it's like to be on a flight free.
