1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,580
This here's Tater Gumfries reminding you that X-Day's a-comin' July 5th,

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,860
and ain't nothin' you can do to slow it down nor stop it,

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,460
so you might as well get yourself down to the Brushwood Folklore Center in Sherman, New York,

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,700
and get ready to rupture.

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,760
Friends, we're at X-Day, or off-planet or something,

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,900
and therefore this hour of slack is not the one you were expecting,

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:33,060
but a rerun of number 951 from 7X-Day 2005.

8
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,000
We interrupt this program to activate the emergency...

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,600
Some genius hour of slack!

10
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,140
What?

11
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,900
Yarr!

12
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,280
Yarr!

13
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:57,400
Yarr!

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:57,980
Yarr!

15
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,280
Yarr!

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:58,540
Yarr!

17
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:58,580
Yarr!

18
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:58,580


19
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:58,780
Yarr!

20
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,240
Yarr!

21
00:00:59,240 --> 00:00:59,900
Yarr!

22
00:00:59,900 --> 00:00:59,900


23
00:00:59,900 --> 00:00:59,900


24
00:00:59,900 --> 00:00:59,900


25
00:00:59,900 --> 00:00:59,900


26
00:00:59,900 --> 00:00:59,900


27
00:00:59,900 --> 00:00:59,900


28
00:00:59,900 --> 00:00:59,900


29
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,860
Yes, friends.

30
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,240
Well, you know, according to subgenius prophecy,

31
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,120
the space monster, Jehovah One,

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,160
told mystic salesman J.R. Bob Dobbs

33
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:19,060
that the world would end for everybody except subgenius cult members

34
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:25,520
at 7 a.m. on July 5th.

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,820
Well, my friends, we still aren't really home yet

36
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:36,980
from the New York celebrations of X-Day.

37
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,960
Our minds aren't home yet.

38
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,340
So you might as well consider this a live X-Day show,

39
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,980
even though the event itself, July 5th, was weeks ago.

40
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,180
Friends, we're always behind after X-Day

41
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:56,880
because we've been doing a lot of work.

42
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,900
We're going to blow everything off,

43
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,080
assuming that our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

44
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,660
is going to be right this time.

45
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,380
We weren't harvested,

46
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,600
but yet we harvested lots of recordings,

47
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,860
such as this of Acid Corpse performing at Brushwood,

48
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,080
and we harvested many subgenius' radio shows,

49
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,720
such as the KPFA Berkeley show,

50
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,180
the WREK show in Atlanta,

51
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,380
Bob's Lifetime Funhouse,

52
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,360
and, uh,

53
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,300
the WCSB show in Cleveland,

54
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,360
and Dr. Sinister's.

55
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,380
And we'll start with the KPFA Puzzling Evidence show, friends,

56
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,380
with Dr. Howell at Puzzling Evidence

57
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:42,880
and Philo Drummond's X-Day Report.

58
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,900
Yes, everyone's somewhat world-weary here.

59
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,740
Because you know what?

60
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,680
These fine young folks have just returned from X-Day

61
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,980
and they're coming back in their triumphant post-X-Day parade now.

62
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,680
Yeah.

63
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:56,800
Yeah.

64
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:56,860
Yeah.

65
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:56,860


66
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:56,860


67
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:56,860


68
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:56,860


69
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:56,860


70
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:56,860


71
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:56,860


72
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:56,860


73
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,180
Yeah.

74
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,900
We had pictures.

75
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:16,900


76
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,700
because all we do is advance straightforwardly.

77
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,520
We're going to have an X-Day parade from this little Tuesday,

78
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:23,520


79
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:23,520


80
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:26,860
Somewhat bedraggled and debauched,

81
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:26,860


82
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,780
what marvelous sights one sees at X Day.

83
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,440
But one thing we did see, of course,

84
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,060
is when we assembled at 7 o'clock a.m.

85
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,620
We're trying to talk to Philodrumon down on the field.

86
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,160
He is there, and we will be connecting with Philodrumon momentarily.

87
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:53,160
It was at X Day that we gathered at 7 a.m.

88
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,420
on July 5th, 2004.

89
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,280
And as we waited in the shade of the main pavilion,

90
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:12,040
a band played, and then all eyes went to the zenith of the sky

91
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,980
where a huge, round, glittering shape rapidly lowered down,

92
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,640
expanding in size and blotting out the light

93
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:26,480
with an enormous metallic humming like the ringing of a glass.

94
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,400
Or the buzzing of innumerable bees.

95
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,340
Long, telescoping legs extended and...

96
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,820
Hear that bee in the background? He was just buzzing, buzzing.

97
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,040
Well, you know, the main theme now is for the whole of the audience

98
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,640
is they want to know what happened at X Day.

99
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,880
Well, I'm telling you.

100
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:51,400
Well, a lot of people want to know what happened at X Day.

101
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,740
They keep asking that question.

102
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,840
Now, next up on Monday, July 5th,

103
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,000
at 7 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time,

104
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,360
our Earth will be at athelion,

105
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,940
which means that it will be at its farthest point away from our sun for the entire year.

106
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,380
Almost 3 million miles farther away

107
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:16,140
than it was when it was at perihelion, its closest, last January 4th.

108
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,120
And then, get ready for a super goodie.

109
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,400
All right, Atlanta.

110
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,960
Perhaps we have something for you here.

111
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,420
Yes, perhaps. Who knows?

112
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,800
It's one of those things that, like this church, it's wild and unpredictable.

113
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,920
We are going to attempt to...

114
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,620
We are going to attempt to get a live update from X Day.

115
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,120
From Brushwood, from Ground Zero.

116
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,440
Ground Zero, 7 a.m., July 5th.

117
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,880
That's where the smoking's going to start.

118
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,740
It'll spread outward from there.

119
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,920
All right, well, let's try to punch them in.

120
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,160
Let's see if this thing's working.

121
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,220
Hello, do we have Brushwood?

122
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,020
Atlanta to Brushwood, over.

123
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,020
I think we're being jammed at the source.

124
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:17,900
Uh-oh.

125
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,780
Oh, my God.

126
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,360
You don't think they did it at Jonestown already?

127
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,280
There's something.

128
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,340
Oh, my God.

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,300
Suzy, I don't know if you can hear me, but here at X Day number 7, it is a complete catastrophe.

130
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,820
I am watching the fire eat away at the very heavens right now.

131
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:49,320
It was a terrible tragedy, the pipe of fog that we had in the fire circle whenever the burning cross finally fell.

132
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,760
Oh, what the fuck?

133
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,100
It disgorged a little gift for all of humanity.

134
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,820
And it's currently burning.

135
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,560
It's burning down everything that we ever loved.

136
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,980
I knew it was going to be good.

137
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,340
And yet we somehow feel much more cleansed for it.

138
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,740
And now, with more details, is the Reverend Ivan Singh on site.

139
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,320
Oh, no, that crummy bitch.

140
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,900
It's a perfect success if death and destruction is...

141
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,280
Suzy, are you there?

142
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,860
Yes, yes, I'm here, but you can't hear me.

143
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,640
It's a nightmare, and yet it's like heaven.

144
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,420
It's like a Jack Chick comic come to life.

145
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,600
It's what every X Day is supposed to be.

146
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,920
Surely the saucers will be here.

147
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,140
Oh, damn it!

148
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:30,660
Damn it!

149
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:30,740
What?

150
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,820
Oh, my God, it's silent.

151
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,460
The police are coming.

152
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,160
We're going to have to...

153
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,900
We may not be able to be on for long.

154
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:38,580
Hold it!

155
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:38,980
Hold on.

156
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:39,540
What?

157
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,940
Suzy, hold on just one second.

158
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,920
No, don't get away from me!

159
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,220
You goddamn...

160
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:47,260
I don't know!

161
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:47,860
I don't know!

162
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,360
I don't know!

163
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,200
I don't know!

164
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:50,640
I don't know!

165
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,280
I don't know what to do!

166
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,800
You can't stop!

167
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,260
Ow!

168
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,220
Ow!

169
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:55,400
Oh!

170
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,940
Oh, well, there goes our connection.

171
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,100
I'm afraid we've lost them.

172
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,540
Have we lost them?

173
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,320
Hello? Hello?

174
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,400
Uh-oh.

175
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,300
Okay, so that's what's going on at Brushwood.

176
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,480
I knew they'd be having a great time without me there.

177
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,800
Damn it, it sounded like they were all bleeding pretty good.

178
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,660
I think that term would be hemorrhaging.

179
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,200
They were hemorrhaging slack.

180
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,360
They were hemorrhaging slack.

181
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:32,380
And it was such a hemorrhage of slack that they couldn't hear our unslacked voices.

182
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,000
And, man, I really need that sort of stuff to bathe in.

183
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,860
I can't find virgins anymore.

184
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,280
Oh, no, you can't find a good virgin these days.

185
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,980
Well, virgin on the ridiculous, but they don't go for the technical virgins.

186
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,720
Ah, it's starting.

187
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,580
The floppy boot.

188
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,040
Okay, now we started.

189
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,680
Then the X-Day Parade kicked off.

190
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,440
This is inspirational.

191
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,020
To be here at the X-Day Parade.

192
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,100
At the 2000.

193
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,700
2004 X-Day Celebration.

194
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,760
While we wait for the saucer to descend.

195
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,280
And we also are on our...

196
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,660
Clear sky.

197
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,020
No sign of a saucer yet, but we're all hoping and waiting.

198
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,660
Except, of course, for Philo Drummond, who decided to stay at home in his bed,

199
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,300
reading the National Review.

200
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,860
But the rest of us are...

201
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,460
Wait a minute.

202
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,400
Is that something that we see up there in the sky?

203
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,760
A glittering brown?

204
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,220
It is.

205
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,260
It's the saucer.

206
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,140
It's coming down.

207
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,700
Oh, this is just great.

208
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,080
The crowd is really reacting.

209
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,060
Look at there.

210
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,780
The enthusiasm.

211
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:31,500
And the saucer now makes its way through the float parade.

212
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:39,120
Look at those great little cutout characters of space aliens on top of the saucer.

213
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,760
Those aren't cutouts.

214
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,560
I believe they're made out of roses.

215
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,900
They're actually razor-thin aliens.

216
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,800
Razor-thin and razor-sharp, I might add.

217
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,160
That's right.

218
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,620
You wouldn't want them to make a...

219
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,140
You don't want to stroke those aliens on the edge.

220
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,160
You don't want to cut your hands.

221
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,320
I don't want to stroke those aliens at all, Philo,

222
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,520
but it may be that I'll have to.

223
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,640
It may be that we'll all have to.

224
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:00,720
You'll have to.

225
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,500
We all have to stroke the aliens.

226
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,880
Since it's going to be a new day and a new world

227
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,520
since we've been visited by our visitors from afar.

228
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,380
You have to stroke the aliens sometime.

229
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,780
You can depend on me, darling.

230
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,260
Well, I better the aliens have a stroke.

231
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,580
I do depend on you to help me stroke the alien.

232
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,600
All right.

233
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,960
I think we've stroked this alien thing for all it's worth.

234
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,300
Isn't that a dance like Shock the Monkey that somebody did?

235
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,480
Stroke the alien.

236
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,040
Okay, if you say so.

237
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,260
Wasn't it Cha-Cha-Cha?

238
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,120
I hope they have nice cities.

239
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,240
No, it wasn't.

240
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,960
Yeah, well, they do have nice cities.

241
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,960
It's hard enough to do these dance moves.

242
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,240
They're half underground, half above ground.

243
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,820
Yeah, this is when the saucers show up over you guys' heads.

244
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,920
I was strolling through the park one night

245
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,840
And oh, I felt so blue

246
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,440
When I heard a little voice say

247
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,920
I'm so lonely

248
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,820
Then I turned around to look

249
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,760
And to my surprise

250
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,660
A little space girl said

251
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,380
They're crying right before my eyes

252
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,880
Stepping up a little closer

253
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,340
To see what I could see

254
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,220
She said

255
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,940
Mr. Earthman, will you please marry me?

256
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,920
I said, why, no, I couldn't do that

257
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,180
Well, that just wouldn't happen

258
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,180


259
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,180


260
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,180


261
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,180


262
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,180


263
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,940
Couldn't be right

264
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,940
Cause you and me

265
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,380
And me and you

266
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,240
We don't even look alike

267
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,780
Cause you've got four arms

268
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,380
The better to hold you

269
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,420
Three lips

270
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,140
The better to kiss you

271
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,380
Three eyes

272
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,320
All the better to see

273
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,120
I can really rock and swing

274
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,520
Cause I've got more of everything

275
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,340
Oh, Mr. Earthman, will you marry me?

276
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,220
Then I said, what will people think

277
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,280
When we go strolling by?

278
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,880
Why, they not only laughed at us

279
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,020
They lay right down and died

280
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,500
Then they'd put you and me in jail

281
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,540
There we would be

282
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,940
And the people, they'd come from miles around

283
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,120
Just to look at you and me

284
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,460
Cause you've got four arms

285
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,100
The better to hold you

286
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,200
Three lips

287
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,320
The better to kiss you

288
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:22,320


289
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,340
Three eyes

290
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,100
All the better to see

291
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,920
I can really rock and swing

292
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,400
Cause I've got more of everything

293
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,080
Oh, Mr. Earthman, will you marry me?

294
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,900
I said, this ain't gone far enough

295
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,120
I've had enough of it

296
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,060
She said, please, Mr. Earthman

297
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,160
Just one little kiss

298
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,320
I said, okay, okay

299
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,320


300
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,320


301
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,320


302
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,320


303
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,320


304
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,320


305
00:12:52,340 --> 00:13:11,080
Okay, okay, but then you go away. But when I finished kissing her, I had this to say. Oh, you've got four arms. The better to hold you. Three lips. The better to kiss you. Three eyes. Oh, the better to see.

306
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:22,120
I can really rock and swing. Cause I've got more of everything. Oh, Mr. Earthman, will you marry me?

307
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,000
Why, sure.

308
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:37,920
A thanks to Artemia Salina for sending that one in. And now, Reverend Carter LeBlanc, live at Brushwood.

309
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:54,760
So, it's X Day. It's almost X Day. It's, uh, let's see, how far are we? Anybody got a countdown calendar going?

310
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:00,700
How many more minutes till the end of the world? No, I didn't think so.

311
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:11,000
Nobody really even seems to be paying attention. I think everybody is kind of suspecting the same things that I'm kind of expecting.

312
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:21,000
Which is, uh, we got sold out, you know? I mean, we really, we really kind of got screwed, you know?

313
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:31,260
We were told saucers 1998. They make up all these excuses that seem to justify, you know, the absence of saucers.

314
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:39,240
But the simple truth is, the saucers seem to have passed us by.

315
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:39,520
Okay.

316
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,880
There were people after 1998 that came to Stang, and they were, I think, really upset about that.

317
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:52,040
And, uh, and a lot of those people, a lot of people didn't come back, actually.

318
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,420
Which is fine, because really, maybe those are the people that got ruptured.

319
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,420
They got, uh, you know, they got taken away.

320
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:08,640
Because if there's one thing that we really don't need here in the Church of the Subgenius, it's a true believer.

321
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:18,120
I mean, you know, we don't really need any, uh, I mean, we don't really need any true unbelievers either.

322
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,540
Because, I mean, belief and disbelief both mean pretty much the same thing.

323
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,540
You no longer are accepting new ideas about a certain issue.

324
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:38,580
And, uh, so, so what I'm seeing here is that something special has been given to those people that lost faith.

325
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:38,740


326
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,940
You know, those people have been given.

327
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,500
A gift.

328
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,700
A gift called suspicion and disbelief.

329
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:50,620
You know, anytime any of those people that have walked away from the Church of the Subgenius,

330
00:15:50,680 --> 00:16:02,160
anytime they go to another, another religion, or another spirituality, or another, another form of self-indulgent, uh, you know, self-gratification,

331
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,440
that, that we, we like to think of as religion, but it's just really justification for our actions.

332
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,060
Anytime somebody goes somewhere else to find...

333
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:16,020
something else somewhere inside their mind, they're gonna be thinking, they're gonna be thinking,

334
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,620
Is this just another scam?

335
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,120
Is this just somebody else making money off of me?

336
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,520
Is somebody else getting rich off of me?

337
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:33,120
Just like, just like when I gave all that money to the Church of the Subgenius?

338
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,840
Those people have been given a gift.

339
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,220
It's called disbelief.

340
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,800
You know, the conspiracy pays you.

341
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,040
What?

342
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,040
Well, probably.

343
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,780
I mean, compared to how well the Church of the Subgenius pays you.

344
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:52,340
Uh, I've, I have worked for both, and I can tell you that the conspiracy pays you real well

345
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:56,160
to do work that is guaranteed to be forgettable.

346
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,940
That's what it's all about.

347
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,260
And so you, you're faced with the problem of do you want the pay,

348
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,460
or do you want to do the work that is useful and will be remembered?

349
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,560
And, uh, uh, friends,

350
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,020
what we'd really like to do,

351
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,380
is, you know, neither one.

352
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,380
Why, why, why do we have to do either one?

353
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:21,220
Bob said we should be rich without, equally rich, without working.

354
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,260
Boy, that would be fair, wouldn't it?

355
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,760
Wouldn't that be so fair if everybody was equally rich without working?

356
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,580
Well, friends, you have to make that choice.

357
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:38,520
Are you enough of a subgenius to, to, to declare July 5th, Monday, normally a working day,

358
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,640
as your religious holiday?

359
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,020
As your religious holiday?

360
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,100
Earned by the blood of Bob on that stage as he bled for it.

361
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,480
Well, he didn't bleed for you, actually.

362
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,160
He bled for the insurance money.

363
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,280
We must get off Earth.

364
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,340
We must get off Earth.

365
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,420
We must get off Earth.

366
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,400
We must get off Earth.

367
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,340
We must get off Earth.

368
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,140
We must get off...

369
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,600
No, Bob.

370
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,720
I'm bleeding.

371
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,720
Please gotta get off Bob.

372
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:13,680
Bob.

373
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,580
Oh, man.

374
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:22,520
Oh, it ain't X Day yet, but it looks like I'm just ahead of the clock radio.

375
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,680
Okay, this is it.

376
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,400
This is it.

377
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:25,840
Okay.

378
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,580
10...

379
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,720
9...

380
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,040
7...

381
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,360
8...

382
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,180
5...

383
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,040
3...

384
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,640
4...

385
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,060
3...

386
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,460
2...

387
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:39,900
1...

388
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:47,980
Oh, man, Bob, not again!

389
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,220
Ah!

390
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,820
Ah, hell.

391
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,340
Oh, at least I'm getting used to it by now.

392
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:00,880
Okay.

393
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:10,080
Well, I guess the next step is the inevitable vicious taunting at the hands of evil Susie.

394
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,600
Yeah, that's the way it always plays out.

395
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:23,500
Ah, jeez, Louise, I can actually hear that heartless bitch warming up that abrasive cackle-roos.

396
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,020
All right, you cow, come on, let me have it.

397
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,460
No, no, no!

398
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,360
You're in my pill stash!

399
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,560
You're in this right, Louise.

400
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,700
Why do you have to stash them under the toilet?

401
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,080
They're all tangy.

402
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,340
Spit them out!

403
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,960
Come on, some of that's for an actual emergency.

404
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,000
Let me go.

405
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,120
I don't want to live anymore.

406
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,920
Oh, God, get your head out of my damn mouth.

407
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,100
Oh, God.

408
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,400
Oh, God.

409
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,380
Oh, God.

410
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,880
Oh, man.

411
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,220
Oh, what gives?

412
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,020
Does Freaky Friday fall on a Monday this year?

413
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,840
This post-X-Day Suicide Blues thing is my shit, dude.

414
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,660
Bite me.

415
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:26,900
What fools we were to think that we would get to go on some divine killing spree and

416
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,500
crush all the pink boys with our alien powers.

417
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,400
Well, we believed Stang.

418
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,960
We did believe Stang.

419
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,500
That's what he said.

420
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,760
I bought into it.

421
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,540
I bought into it.

422
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,540
I sent in my money.

423
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,120
Well, so you really bought into it.

424
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,220
Like, literally.

425
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,560
The only kind of bot that counts, baby.

426
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,340
All right, baby.

427
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,000
Not to Bob.

428
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,360
We were young, dumb, and full of...

429
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,160
Fun.

430
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,900
Yeah, that's what we were.

431
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,800
We were bright-eyed, and I can't spoil the end.

432
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,980
You all know what happened.

433
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,220
What do you think?

434
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,860
But about, just listen in, in about 10 minutes, we'll be back.

435
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:00,860


436
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:00,860


437
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:00,860


438
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:00,860


439
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:00,860


440
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:00,860


441
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:00,860


442
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:00,860


443
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,520
10 minutes before X-Day, we actually started alibi-ing.

444
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,460
All right, fine.

445
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,800
Yes, I'm a little bitter.

446
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:11,080
Yes, I understand that the conspiracy made the calendar, and it's not 2003.

447
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,820
Who knows what year it is?

448
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,140
It could be 1005.

449
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,140
Well, how do we know they got July 5th right?

450
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,400
And X-Day could be at any second.

451
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,340
I'm aware of that.

452
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,300
Does Ted Man make an appearance on the telephone during the show?

453
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:22,780
Of course he does.

454
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:22,880
Of course he does.

455
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,300
Oh, that's wonderful.

456
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,680
I don't think you people have enough Ted Man in your lives.

457
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,340
He has a...

458
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,580
He's calling us from the observatory.

459
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,060
Right.

460
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,340
Oh, he sees the alien who wants to be his friend, and I think they have sex.

461
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,320
I believe they do.

462
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,020
Oh, that's wonderful.

463
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,260
And there's some people who got some science guys, but hey, you're going to hear it.

464
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,580
This show has been Stalinized for quality.

465
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:41,900
WCSB, you're on the air.

466
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,940
I got lost on the way to the station.

467
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,800
You got lost on the way to the station?

468
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,940
Oh, no, that's right.

469
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,040
We already did that show.

470
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,260
Yeah, you already did that show, man.

471
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,980
Only we didn't get to do that show, but we did that other show.

472
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,880
We need help on the next airport, because I'll be tumbling.

473
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,580
We got lost in the station.

474
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,040
We got lost in the station.

475
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,040


476
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,860
We got lost on the way to Planet X, man.

477
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,180
Yeah.

478
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,300
Tables, they will turn around.

479
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,500
Planet X will soon be found.

480
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,380
How could you get in a place...

481
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,620
How could you get lost in a place so plainly and so clearly formatted, right in front of

482
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:10,720
you?

483
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,280
The holograms are everywhere.

484
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,180
If you get lost, all you have to do is wave your fingers in front of your eyes.

485
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,540
Bobbies know they're yeti pests.

486
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,060
Pink boys, they're all guests.

487
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,040
I think basically we meant that right.

488
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,040


489
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,180
He's the slack man.

490
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,860
That's why their armpits are so hot.

491
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,840
It's so sad that when you...

492
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,620
You expect to be...

493
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:33,680
To be ruptured and evaporated up into the escape vessels, but it doesn't happen for

494
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,180
another year.

495
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:42,400
So you go home, and in spite, you start up your lawnmower and rupture your grass.

496
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:50,100
If I had a million little grass souls that my excess pleasure saucer played by my lawnmower,

497
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,700
I'd spend all morning sucking those little souls up so that they're...

498
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,700
Into that escape vessel.

499
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,060
Hold for a second.

500
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:01,320
Now they're on their way to the city dump, which will double as Planet X for them.

501
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,020
Pink boys, listen, we gotta take a break here.

502
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,620
I hope you guys hold the line for just a moment.

503
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,680
The wind break.

504
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,560
All right.

505
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,680
This isn't over the edge.

506
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,740
No, but it's over the line.

507
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,440
You crossed that line.

508
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,860
Man, can't we just go back to have things like they used to be?

509
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,260
Can't we all just get along?

510
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,100
That was cool back then.

511
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,040
Yeah, no, we can't, man, because the world's gone.

512
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,040


513
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,600
The world ended, man.

514
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,500
Like I heard last week, the world ended, man.

515
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,960
And you died, man.

516
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,600
Yeah.

517
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,240
Well, it didn't actually end.

518
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,580
We thought it was going to.

519
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:34,720
The big UFOs came.

520
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,780
We thought it would, but something happened and prevented it from ending.

521
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,240
No, it actually did.

522
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:46,500
We all received a mental block later, a piece of forced conditioning, which we all took.

523
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,000
Whenever you see this picture.

524
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,020
Ah, yes.

525
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:55,040
You see this particular picture, it brings one out of the trance of oblivion.

526
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,060
What picture is that?

527
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,520
I can't see the monitor from over here.

528
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:58,840
Show it.

529
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,680
Is that the X Day picture?

530
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,340
It's a stereoscopic picture of what happened.

531
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,560
I already made a CD that made a million bucks off what you guys were doing last week.

532
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,760
Wow, invasion.

533
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,220
Invasion of Earth.

534
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:19,980
But it's really too late to do anything about it, so I don't even really want to get in trouble by talking about it.

535
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:24,600
Now, what was the other highlight of your experience at X Day, Dr. Howell?

536
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,820
The other highlight?

537
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,900
Other than, you know, the beautiful naked women.

538
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,520
Come on, man, don't step on the Rice Krispies.

539
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,040
That was just one of the many highlights, of course.

540
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,360
Don't step on the Rice Krispies thing!

541
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,840
Oh, God, they hurt.

542
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,140
Here it comes.

543
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,140
Actually, I enjoyed the easy camaraderie of my comrades in arms in the barracks.

544
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,100
That was just Al getting into the hot water.

545
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,140
Blah, blah, blah.

546
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,580
The man must know that he hath broken his code.

547
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:54,580


548
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:54,860
The other one's pretty sure they're the God of the Covenant.

549
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,280
And ye shall soil thy loincloth with the fear of Jehovah.

550
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,860
For Jehovah is the God of wrath!

551
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,660
Step away then from the bowling ball.

552
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:11,320
I think I saw the staying person light the fuse for the end of the world.

553
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,460
Light the fuse.

554
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,040
I think I saw it.

555
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,180
A mulberry.

556
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,080
That's what you say you saw?

557
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,720
Well, he bent over...

558
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,080
and something came out of him.

559
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:29,360
And then everything started shaking

560
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,480
and he was running past me away from this area.

561
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,800
That was just his psyche that came out of him.

562
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,160
Why would anyone want to leave beautiful...

563
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:45,380
Uh-oh, he's releasing foul gases.

564
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,500
Yeah, something like that.

565
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,580
And then we were running.

566
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:53,340
Apparently, Bob came and did something to all of us.

567
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,260
There's Reverend Stang.

568
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,820
Something did come out of him.

569
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,480
He changed us somehow.

570
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,580
I don't know what he did.

571
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,560
What are you doing up so early, Reverend Stang?

572
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:07,120
Oh, somebody burned the whole campground down.

573
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,540
Oh, no.

574
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,700
Yeah, I tried to...

575
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:10,960
Jesus!

576
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,460
But we were already gone, so what difference does it make?

577
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,300
Well, I was trying to go back there.

578
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,320
For the love and peace that happens at Brushwood.

579
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:26,540
And the whole campground had been burned down by the subgeniuses who dropped glass.

580
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,520
All the trees were denuded and blackened ash.

581
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,760
Once again, the subgenius bobbies have ruined everything else.

582
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,140
Well, you know what that was?

583
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,180
You guys didn't listen to me years ago.

584
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,460
That's what we would have called prop wash from the UFOs.

585
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,800
Those landing brakes they have just scorch everything, including the little non-normals.

586
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,820
Right, and they don't care.

587
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,200
They're just aliens, you know.

588
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,360
They don't even...

589
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,900
I'm not wearing any pants.

590
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,920
Well, why would you have to?

591
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:53,580
Exactly.

592
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:57,180
In these modern times, no one needs to call themselves a scepter in strange ideas.

593
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:57,980
Especially not on the radio.

594
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,700
Oh, tell that to my sunburn, Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

595
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,600
Yeah, I got a little sunburned at X-Day, too, actually.

596
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,580
I don't think it was the sunburn.

597
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,480
I think it was the...

598
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,020
It wasn't the sun.

599
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,440
It was the saucers hovering overhead.

600
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,580
And when you get in the path of that afterburner of theirs, which is a special...

601
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,060
It's a special...

602
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,340
Graviton emission...

603
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,440
There's protons and stuff.

604
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:24,780
Well, it's got a couple different principles working in the saucer, the things that keep the saucers aloft.

605
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,240
One, of course, is the graviton emission.

606
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:27,720
Right.

607
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,880
You can get a sunburn.

608
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,580
Why is there a lot of pain in the buttocks?

609
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,360
The other one, of course, is the...

610
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,100
You also got a multiple contusion going on in your skin.

611
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,720
Pastor Pressure was showing off a sunburn in the shape of Jesus.

612
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,760
It was an anti-sunburn.

613
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:46,060
It was like the Jesus was formed by little spots that weren't burned.

614
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,460
It was a...

615
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:47,560
It was a...

616
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:47,560


617
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,120
It was a reverse Jesus sunburn.

618
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:56,680
I think it had gone to a body cursing parlor, a biker place, before he attended the festivities.

619
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,800
And that's about it, Stang.

620
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,720
I think you're kind of ruminating over what might have been.

621
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:04,540
There were a lot of people who had actual saucer burn on the buttocks.

622
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,660
I mean, not...

623
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:07,840
Maybe 700.

624
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:08,980
That's a lot, right?

625
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:15,280
Well, we had a little bucket of hell and a little bucket of heaven, so you could put your feet in either one at the same time.

626
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,980
Get a bucket of heaven.

627
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,980
But, yes, after the drag...

628
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,320
What did we do after the drag king, queen...

629
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,600
The drag queen and king balls.

630
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,260
Weren't there a million psych-a-freak-a rock-and-roll rock-out rock bands?

631
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,200
That's right.

632
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,400
We had a great...

633
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,500
It was the Acid Corpse played...

634
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,380
I guess that was the first night of band nights.

635
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,480
But what about the Swinging Louve Corpse?

636
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,360
Well, that's their name.

637
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,280
That was their name.

638
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,880
We had the Swinging Love Corpses.

639
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,220
Three members of the Swinging Love Corpses.

640
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:52,500
It was melded with four members of the Amino Acids.

641
00:28:52,820 --> 00:29:00,940
So the Amino Acids provided the bass and the drums and the tenor.

642
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,240
I don't forget what kind of...

643
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,900
It wasn't a tenor, but it was maybe a baritone guitar that that one guy had.

644
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:16,400
And then we played sax and guitar and trumpet and violent things.

645
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:17,360
Yeah.

646
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,960
Ooh.

647
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:37,760
Ooh.

648
00:29:47,240 --> 00:30:17,200
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58, 59, 52, 56, 57, 58, 59, 59, 60.

649
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,100
You said oh baby

650
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:33,340
And then I said oh baby

651
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,380
And then ever so gently

652
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:45,000
Ever so gently

653
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,280
And then...

654
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,580
You had so many sexual overtones

655
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,920
You looked over at me and you said

656
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,400
Baby

657
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,080
And I do right there

658
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,500
That's when I knew

659
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,660
This is the way you said baby

660
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,940
This is the way you said fade

661
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,760
Not so much the B-part but the B-part

662
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,540
It's the way you say, baby.

663
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,100
Bye bye.

664
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,460
You couldn't just say baby, you had to say bye bye.

665
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,080
What is that? What's that, bye bye?

666
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,580
I'm sorry.

667
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,580
Here is the power.

668
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:01,860
Power.

669
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,720
Here is the power.

670
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,280
Here is the power.

671
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,260
Here is the power.

672
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,640
That's a little number we've been working on called Bye Bye.

673
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,060
We was on drugs.

674
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,380
It felt good.

675
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,340
So then after the Acid Corpse played,

676
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:58,180
and we played for an hour and 45 minutes which only seemed like 20 minutes to me.

677
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,480
It was just like being in heaven.

678
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:11,880
It was such great anti-music and wonderful mystery jazz and great sort of like space bug surf jam stuff.

679
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,440
Space.

680
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,200
Space.

681
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,280
Surf jam.

682
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,620
Everybody, it's gonna be a surf jam.

683
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:31,520
So after that, let's see, I guess after that we just partied till like it was 1999 till about, you know, 2 or 3.30 in the morning.

684
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,060
4.30 maybe and then we'd go to bed.

685
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,380
And then we would toss and turn fitfully as the three most thunderous snorers.

686
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,120
Suicide man wants to know something.

687
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:50,720
Oh, I just wanted to know if the show was still on.

688
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,560
No, we're not on the air anymore.

689
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,340
Hey, what happened to you, suicide man?

690
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,680
Are you on drugs or something?

691
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,600
I feel a little strange.

692
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,220
You feel a little slowed down to me.

693
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,400
Okay, concentrate on the reality we're throwing out to you.

694
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,680
Look out!

695
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,040
Hey man, get out of the way!

696
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,180
You gotta get out of the way.

697
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:10,940
Come on.

698
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,680
The reality will run you down.

699
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,760
It's like a tank.

700
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,020
Let me dust you off.

701
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,020
It's like a fast tank.

702
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,660
It's a fast tank with wheels instead of tracks.

703
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,780
Listen up, buddy, I'm just gonna tell you what.

704
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,340
Straighten up or fly right.

705
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,600
You can lead a horse to water.

706
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,560
You can't make him drink.

707
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,660
So what's your point, dude?

708
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,240
You're sitting on your point, right?

709
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,040
You're sitting on it right now.

710
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,300
Admit it.

711
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:43,100
We were just discussing a strange fellow who claimed to have died but is still alive

712
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,520
to plague us today.

713
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:49,440
You have never seen such sights.

714
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:59,280
Your heart has never felt such emotion, such sorrow, such joy.

715
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,180
You will be uplifted.

716
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:06,160
And never have you seen such freaks of nature.

717
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:15,200
One look at them will tell you more than a thousand words of mine.

718
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:23,780
Come and see, see little Theodore and...

719
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,620
...Habaluska!

720
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,820
I just sit here watching squirrels.

721
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,620
They have much more fun than me.

722
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,220
Sometimes they run around all day in circles.

723
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,480
They fight and squabble, then they lick their wounds.

724
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,860
At least they seem to have a purpose.

725
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,480
My mind's always clogged with leaves.

726
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:05,040
Like silly, stupid advertising jingles.

727
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,740
And themes on TV shows I do not like.

728
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,540
I must not go out the front door.

729
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:34,760
I could get hit by a car.

730
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,320
Just like the squirrels when a dog is growling.

731
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:43,440
There's perfect safety high up in the tree.

732
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,440
I know I'm bad to just sit here.

733
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,320
I should not be so afraid.

734
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,860
But once outside I'd have to choose a direction.

735
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,420
It might be the wrong one so I'll stay here.

736
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:20,820
I'm not afraid of the squirrels.

737
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:20,820


738
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:20,820


739
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,800
They tell me of self-improvement.

740
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:28,300
And someday could even have a job.

741
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,160
Then I would have become just like the squirrels.

742
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,140
I don't see how I could accomplish that.

743
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,340
First I'd have to choose a direction.

744
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,920
Like which tree I should start to climb.

745
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,540
They all seem to be up to the challenge.

746
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,760
I just take whatever's given me.

747
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,140
I'm not afraid of the squirrels.

748
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:14,140


749
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:17,960
So I'm okay here just watching squirrels.

750
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,940
Though the soundtrack could be much improved.

751
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,920
Those silly, stupid advertising jingles.

752
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,400
And themes on TV shows I do not like.

753
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,900
And...

754
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:44,520
I kind of regain some easily of the role of a squirrel.

755
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:44,560
I don't see the sense of propriety There's no respite in that.

756
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:44,760


757
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,400
A bit trashy, a lot of Dog resting up towards the sun.

758
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:47,400


759
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:47,640
And aific okay price really better.

760
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,020
I kind of think my voice may have scale where I live.

761
00:38:50,020 --> 00:39:00,380
But all the truth isucha disc a life adjust and poetry stick.

762
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:00,380


763
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:18,480
Weil-w

764
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,000
You know, I like him.

765
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,220
He's silly.

766
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,240
The audience doesn't think that's very funny.

767
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,080
I mean, they do think that's very funny.

768
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,880
They're laughing their heads off.

769
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,220
Look, they love it.

770
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:42,960
Old rape-a-man.

771
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,860
Old rape-a-man.

772
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:56,820
See, I know people that say it's impossible and completely antithetical to the concept to think that a man could be raped.

773
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,780
That he wouldn't do it willingly and enjoyingly.

774
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,940
Joyfully celebrating the conubial...

775
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,540
This is the effect of X-Day, folks.

776
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,000
This is what happens to the mind once it's brainwashed.

777
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,860
Yes, thank you, thank you.

778
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:15,140
You want to spend your entire time in the bachelor's cabin with the conubial.

779
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,680
That's not my job.

780
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:22,140
We did manage to spend some time at the Frop...

781
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,500
At Dr. Frop's...

782
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,020
We used to just call it...

783
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,460
Oh, so yeah, what was the entertainment like?

784
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,220
We just called it Frop's Place.

785
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,180
What about all the bands that play?

786
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,600
All the bands were excellent.

787
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,340
Well, there was the amino...

788
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,120
The amino...

789
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,140
The amino...

790
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,340
Amino acids.

791
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:35,980
Zuck.

792
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:00,540
benovaance.com

793
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:00,540


794
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:02,940
Where are you?

795
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,240
Ahahaaaa!

796
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,140
guitar solo

797
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,960
guitar solo

798
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,960
guitar solo

799
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,020
guitar solo

800
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,560
guitar solo

801
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:07,820
guitar solo

802
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:08,440
guitar solo

803
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,840
guitar solo

804
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,160
guitar solo

805
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,300
But the amino acids were actually

806
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,720
almost shut

807
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,980
you know, not shut down, but

808
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:27,860
And there was little

809
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,140
Theodore. The first act. Really? Oh, great.

810
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,060
Yeah, little Theodore was there.

811
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,980
So why were they almost shut down?

812
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,600
Why were they pretend shut down?

813
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,800
Oh, I was just saying they were almost blown away

814
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,420
by the band the previous night.

815
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,740
They were blown away!

816
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,460
The jam band kicked

817
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,300
literally kicked the posteriors

818
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,840
of all the individual

819
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,240
subs in their family.

820
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,880
Boy, were they sore. Was it with a big leather boot?

821
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,640
With a big leather boot

822
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,500
with red straps.

823
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,540
Big leather

824
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,940
hobnail boot with red straps.

825
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,240
Well, now, would you like to say

826
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,780
for our listening audience

827
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,100
just who were some of the famous

828
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,100
subgeniuses present at this

829
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,220
earth-shaking event?

830
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,900
Well, let's see.

831
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,380
We did have

832
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:15,120
well, we had you. You were there.

833
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,880
Well, you're right. I was there.

834
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,440
And not only that, I think I saw

835
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,340
Reverend Two Beans there.

836
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,720
Yeah, Two Beans was there.

837
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,760
Let's see who else was there. There was

838
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,400
Doc Frop and Sister Dexter.

839
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:27,940
And Dr. Pissed.

840
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,080
Dr. Pissed.

841
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,660
Dr. Pissed.

842
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,580
Sister Decadence.

843
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,240
Magdalene and Jesus, of course.

844
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,120
Yes, and thousands

845
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,500
of other famous

846
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,400
and semi-famous.

847
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,520
Where did all these bobbies come from?

848
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,400
And yet to be famous.

849
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,860
Bob Toberfest.

850
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,240
What they do is they cut their hair

851
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,820
and then dye their heads purple.

852
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,540
Having something to do with attracting the sun for Bob.

853
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,240
Hey, I think that's a good idea,

854
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,100
Reverend Howell.

855
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,080
Maybe we should have a

856
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,300
Bob Toberfest.

857
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,780
Oh, yeah.

858
00:43:59,280 --> 00:43:59,960
I get it.

859
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:00,880
Bob Toberfest.

860
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,060
Would you come, Caller?

861
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:02,600
That'd be awesome.

862
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,160
Can we have some beer there?

863
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,020
Would you come, Caller?

864
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,040
We could find...

865
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,520
Could you bring some women?

866
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:09,600
Yeah.

867
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:10,780
Okay, good.

868
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,840
Sounds like you have a lot there.

869
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,640
You know, they're like smaller versions of us.

870
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,880
What notes do we play on this song?

871
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,080
Okay, this is Betty Blows.

872
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:24,940
Betty Blows, part one.

873
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:30,040
This is a little symphony we've been working on for a while.

874
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,060
Well...

875

guitar solo

898
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,140
guitar solo

899
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,580
guitar solo

900
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,600
blah blah blah

901
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,520
and they bringeth the

902
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,320
light stone, blam

903
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,700
the whore virgin brain

904
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:09,080
the guilt finder and smiter

905
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,740
the very mark of the

906
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,880
covenant and she is the eye

907
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,640
of the father, she shall

908
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,720
will thee and overcome the mark

909
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,720
of the beast and shall give thee

910
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,880
fornication and the true

911
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,660
sons of Israel shall be

912
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,520
snatched up, behold

913
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,460
my servant shall prosper

914
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,560
he shall be exalted and

915
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,640
lifted up and shall be very

916
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,920
high, he who knoweth

917
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,480
the fools who prophesy

918
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,560
from me shall be made over men

919
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,620
many will be astonished

920
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:40,580
at him for his appearance is

921
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,480
so marred, non-human

922
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,500
semblance and his form

923
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,600
beyond that of the sons of man

924
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,540
those who are over

925
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,560
men who have followed my

926
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,300
almighty word shall

927
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,540
be the minister of the angelic

928
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,040
host, they shall speak

929
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,440
for them and my prophet

930
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,200
who smiles shall be

931
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,380
among them and shall advise

932
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,300
them. Well I'm sorry

933
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,520
to have to call you on a normal phone

934
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,160
from somewhere else on earth

935
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,260
and I'm sorry that you're there on earth

936
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,260
to call. Yeah, how does it look from up there?

937
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,080
I'm sorry Bob

938
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,200
let us down. I'm

939
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,660
sorry, okay, I'm sorry!

940
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,280
Yeah, but you get to be on the ship. You don't have to

941
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,280
be sorry, we're going to do it again next year.

942
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,500
Hey by the way, were you number one in line?

943
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,380
Like your ticket says every year

944
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:26,880
at the gate?

945
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,360
I'm number one in line.

946
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,000
We use a double because

947
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,740
I'm the one filming the line.

948
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,420
There's always a sacred

949
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:38,360
filmer and they always think

950
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,240
that the sacred filmer is not really an artist.

951
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:41,940
That's right.

952
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,520
It's both a blessing and a liability.

953
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,440
Have you looked at any of the footage yet?

954
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,260
Yes. Yes

955
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,440
and the bashing

956
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,160
of the Christ, not to be

957
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,000
confused with the mashing of the Christ

958
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,940
by negative plan, but

959
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,580
our competition

960
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,520
for their short subject

961
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,240
should be, should really

962
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,100
look good. We got plenty of footage. We

963
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,300
really hurt Jesus bad.

964
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:07,840
Did you kill him like

965
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,040
a little George? He's still alive being a

966
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,500
Merovingian and we

967
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,840
so basically everything

968
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,180
that way is great for next year we'll have another

969
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:18,120
Jesus, the campground will

970
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,880
grow back, the

971
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,040
pagans will recuperate

972
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,140
and the subgeniuses will return everything

973
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:25,500
they've stolen once again.

974
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,340
Wow, is the little fake Bob okay?

975
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,000
Yeah, that's the funny thing.

976
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,420
This was the X day when

977
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:34,220
the thieves returned what they

978
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:35,900
had stolen. Great.

979
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,220
And asked me to thank them

980
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,300
expecting me to go, oh thank you for

981
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,400
doing that for three years.

982
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,200
That is a strange phenomenon.

983
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,200
But the thing is back where you are on that

984
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,100
planet, they return them. Here they

985
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,140
just keep them forever and gloat

986
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:51,960
in their living rooms with their two friends.

987
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,420
Yes, yes.

988
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,520
We all know about that.

989
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,440
Ghosts and ghouls

990
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,560
and wearing

991
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:06,600
black.

992
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,240
The crows are

993
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,780
nowhere there to

994
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,060
come back.

995
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,600
Eternal

996
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:17,040
global

997
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,600
drifting slack.

998
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,120
I've

999
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:23,100
looked at death

1000
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:24,880
this way.

1001
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,420
But now it's

1002
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:29,720
just a

1003
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,620
boring pain.

1004
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,480
You get

1005
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,720
all stiff.

1006
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,000
You've lost the game.

1007
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,020
And to think

1008
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:40,780
it's your

1009
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:44,140
best chance for fame.

1010
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,820
When it does you no damn

1011
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:48,480
good.

1012
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:52,800
I've looked at death

1013
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,600
from both sides now.

1014
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,620
From cool and blue.

1015
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:02,040
And still somehow

1016
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,800
it's death's illusions

1017
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,640
I recall.

1018
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:08,520
Hah!

1019
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,260
I really don't know

1020
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:11,980
death!

1021
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,920
Oh yes,

1022
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,240
little fear

1023
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:18,460
does not

1024
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:18,460


1025
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:18,460


1026
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:18,900
matter.

1027
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:19,080
I've

1028
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,300
got a

1029
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:23,300


1030
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:23,500
bit of

1031
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,360
fear

1032
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:30,460
in me.

1033
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,400
I've

1034
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,040
got

1035
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:34,060
a

1036
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:34,060


1037
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,760
fear

1038
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:43,520
in me.

1039
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,420
I've

1040
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:45,380
got a

1041
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:45,740
fear in me.

1042
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,120
I've

1043
00:51:59,120 --> 00:51:59,220
got a

1044
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:01,140
fear

1045
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:02,320
in me.

1046
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,100
I've

1047
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:04,960
got

1048
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:05,240
a

1049
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,120
fear

1050
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:06,300
in me.

1051
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,100
I've

1052
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:12,300
got

1053
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:12,300


1054
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:12,700
fear

1055
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:15,060
in me.

1056
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,600
I've

1057
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,160
got

1058
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,560
fear

1059
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,360
in me.

1060
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:33,160
I've

1061
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:33,220
got

1062
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:33,580
fear

1063
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:34,120
in me.

1064
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,300
I've

1065
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:42,820
got

1066
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:42,980
fear

1067
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:43,820
in me.

1068
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:44,360
I've

1069
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:44,440
got

1070
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,600
fear

1071
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:45,600


1072
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,760
I've

1073
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:47,760


1074
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:47,760


1075
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,980
in me.

1076
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:51,800
And

1077
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,680
I've

1078
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:10,420
lost

1079
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,040
all

1080
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:12,120
my

1081
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:12,140
desire

1082
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:12,140


1083
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:12,140


1084
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:19,300
You can download copies of the Puzzling Evidence Show from this address.

1085
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,360
Get that pencil tape recorder ready.

1086
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:37,160
That's matrix.c-s-u-s-t-a-n.e-d-u slash negative without the e.

1087
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:53,260
Oh, again, friends, this is the Hour of Slack Radio Ministry, Church of the Subgenius, episode number 951.

1088
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:05,500
This show has been done more to educate the denizens of Northern California and the world

1089
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:06,800
on the Puzzling Evidence Show.

1090
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:10,560
Dozens of myths that have pervaded Masonic lore.

1091
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:13,880
It's about saying what's got to be said.

1092
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,280
Fascinating. Fascinating.

1093
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,040
Horrible, but fascinating.

1094
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,180
Sit down, relax.

1095
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:24,100
So, are you glad to be home now, Reverend Stagg?

1096
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:30,800
Well, I'd rather be on my, you know, my home in outer space, my own escape vessel planet.

1097
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,460
In your special space ranch.

1098
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:34,940
In your special yacht with Elrond.

1099
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:36,560
The yacht catisma.

1100
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:37,180
Yeah.

1101
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:44,620
Actually, I was more looking forward to seeing Herf Applewhite, previously known as Doe,

1102
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:47,680
and David Koresh.

1103
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:51,340
Yes, they'll be there in the afterlife waiting with open eyes.

1104
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:52,400
And all those young eunuchs.

1105
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:52,880
And Robert Kelton.

1106
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:59,000
All the great famous Texas evangelists are waiting for me aboard the escape vessel.

1107
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:01,400
And what about the Nike-wearing eunuchs?

1108
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:02,500
The Nike-wearing eunuchs.

1109
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,340
The Nike-wearing eunuchs.

1110
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,900
The Dobbshead shirt-wearing eunuchs.

1111
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:06,300
Yep.

1112
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,140
The swinging lorries.

1113
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,660
The Love Corp. fanboy eunuchs.

1114
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:13,900
Yeah, that's what happened is the people who did the first Dobbs shooting parody also talked

1115
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:16,380
about the various heavens that famous people would go to.

1116
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:17,600
And there they are.

1117
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:18,300
All the famous people.

1118
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,660
And each person gets to go to his kind of famous person heaven.

1119
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,400
But then you're stuck there with people of your own gener.

1120
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,880
There's Lon Chaney Janer.

1121
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,060
There's Lon Chaney Senior.

1122
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,760
Lon Chaney Janer.

1123
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,000
There's Della Lugosi.

1124
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,820
Lon Chaney Janer.

1125
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:38,040
There's all the great celebrities.

1126
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,360
Ed Wood.

1127
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,060
I got a telephone.

1128
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:47,000
They're all there on board the escape vessel.

1129
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,980
Which is what we cover with this radio program, Coast to Coast AM.

1130
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:50,820
I'm Art Bells.

1131
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:52,980
All right.

1132
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,420
The saucer last weekend.

1133
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:56,860
The saucer.

1134
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:57,340
Remember that?

1135
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,520
Too good to be true.

1136
00:55:58,580 --> 00:55:59,580
I said so at the time.

1137
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:00,340
Well, sure enough.

1138
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,480
The good news is it's there.

1139
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,800
It really is exactly there.

1140
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:05,800


1141
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,320
It's exactly where the photograph said it was.

1142
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:08,800
The bad news?

1143
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:18,800
It seems to be an elaborate construction by a member of the Church of the Subgenius.

1144
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:25,400
A gag mail order crossy religion that worships a clip art face named J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1145
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:26,840
For lack of a better explanation.

1146
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:32,320
The old abandoned saucer home also known as a pleasure saucer.

1147
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:36,440
Where many a subgenius divival has no doubt been held.

1148
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,920
Can be seen in detail and it gives a fine URL.

1149
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,960
But it's the same photograph we have.

1150
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,200
So it really is there.

1151
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:45,360
I knew it.

1152
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:49,160
They'll pay to know what they really think.

1153
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:52,060
Well, Mr. Zhang, it was an almost foolproof plan.

1154
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,320
They'll pay to know what they really think.

1155
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:59,180
Well, Mr. Zhang, it was an almost foolproof plan.

1156
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,720
Because I love Bob and I'm happy.

1157
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,300
Because I love Bob and I'm happy.

1158
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:02,780
Because I love Bob and I'm happy.

1159
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,660
Because I love Bob and I'm happy.

1160
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:06,740
Well, Mr. Zhang, it was an almost foolproof plan.

1161
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:09,400
Because I love Bob and I'm happy.

1162
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:10,140
Because I love Bob and I'm happy.

1163
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:13,660
Why don't you Dugs go over to Pirate Cat Radio and do your show over there?

1164
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,600
We're zero listeners.

1165
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:16,480
Yeah.

1166
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,420
Yeah, man.

1167
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:22,940
Uh-oh, I didn't realize what time it was.

1168
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:23,860
Uh-oh.

1169
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:25,860
I did. I could tell.

1170
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:28,980
But the show is getting so foggy and hard to hear.

1171
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,220
I figured it must be ending.

1172
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:30,960
It's murky.

1173
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:35,620
We'd like to add the murkiness at the end to help murkify it a little bit.

1174
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:41,260
It seemed like it has about a fog of fog at set at about six and the murk is moving up.

1175
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,740
It's weird.

1176
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:43,640
It's almost ten.

1177
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:50,580
Well, the murk is moving in and as you know, it's getting closer to that time in the schedule

1178
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:54,920
when puzzling evidence has to shut the special Captain Fox and say,

1179
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,420
How does America handle a headache?

1180
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,940
I'm proud to be on a murkin' place.

1181
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:01,600
Well, that's true.

1182
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:02,980
And so are we all.

1183
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:09,840
As we stand on that spotty flag after our long history and our climb up from the primordial

1184
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:14,040
ooze to our present eminence as prominent American subgeniuses.

1185
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,740
Yeah, I'm going back to the ooze, man.

1186
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,160
You should go back to bed.

1187
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,440
You're gonna go up to your special chamber and say,

1188
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,280
My oozing bag.

1189
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,680
The subgenius.

1190
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:23,900
Ew.

1191
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:27,340
I'm gonna climb back in my oozing bag and go back to sleep.

1192
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:28,800
Good night, Dr. Stang.

1193
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:30,860
Kill them all.

1194
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:32,260
I'll let Bob sort them out.

1195
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:36,960
For in his sorting is not the high E-polly.

1196
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,860
That's the most arbitrary of judges.

1197
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:45,140
Oh, my.

1198
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,920
So here are the engines of the oncoming ships.

1199
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:49,780
Finally, they're landing.

1200
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:50,520
No.

1201
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,060
Oh, no.

1202
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,380
That was another, another drill.

1203
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:54,160
Damn.

1204
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:56,340
Well, we'll certainly have one.

1205
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:57,100
You know the drill.

1206
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,140
I only got here.

1207
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:01,080
Okay.

1208
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,160
It's the guy.

1209
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:02,160


1210
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:02,160


1211
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:02,160


1212
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:02,160


1213
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:02,160


1214
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:02,160


1215
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:02,160


1216
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:02,200
Christ, Bob.

1217
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:02,820
Hello?

1218
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:04,860
Is Bob Dobbs there?

1219
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,820
I'm the little guy who lives in the corner.

1220
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,820
Bob Dobbs, you there?

1221
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:11,920
Hello?

1222
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,000
Oh, you bastard.

1223
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,920
I'm gonna kill you one day.

1224
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:18,120
Beep.

1225
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:31,840
We'll be right back.

1226
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,240
We'll be right back.

1227
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:42,380
We'll be right back.
