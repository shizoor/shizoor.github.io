00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,860
Friends, I have to tell you about Crime Fighters on the Net.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,800
To catch a thief, follow the money.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,520
That idea has served as a guide for crime fighters throughout the years.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,960
Today, crime fighters also follow the money on the Internet.

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,940
As business transactions on the Internet have grown, so have the number of scams and schemes.

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:32,780
That's why the U.S. Postal Inspectors have joined the effort to stamp out Internet fraud.

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:43,980

8
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:52,960
Friends, you're listening to WCSB.

9
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:54,740
WC.

10
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,780
99.3 FM.

11
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:56,620
WC.

12
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,900
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

13
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,100
And it's pledge, pledgey.

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,540
What the hell do you think you're doing?

15
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,620
Pledgey drive time.

16
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,240
Repent.

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,320
Quit your job.

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,080
The world ends tomorrow.

19
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,740
When you may die.

20
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,960
Well, no, probably not, but whatever you do, just keep listening.

21
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,360
The Church of the Subgenius could save your sanity with...

22
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,620
Are we controlled by secret forces?

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,900
Do you ever get that?

24
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,760
The feeling that free will is a joke?

25
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,220
Do people think you're strange?

26
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,000
Do you?

27
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,100
Now, at last, the step-by-step process is revealed.

28
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:32,860
This is it.

29
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,400
The only faith that promises action, thrill, success in sex and business.

30
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,520
Get all your slack and more.

31
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,620
The Subgenius.

32
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,000
The Subgenius.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,900
The Subgenius.

34
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,040
The Subgenius.

35
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,480
The Subgenius.

36
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,140
The Subgenius.

37
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,320
The Subgenius.

38
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:01,560
The Subgenius.

39
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:01,560


40
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,260
And this is it.

41
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,000
This is.

42
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,920
This is.

43
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,360
Let's talk a little bit about Ivan.

44
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,720
Again, right smack dab in the center.

45
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,560
And very, very healthy looking.

46
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,760
Again, you can see very symmetric, good outflow here.

47
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,700
The center of circulation very evident.

48
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,020
Ivan pummeled Grenade.

49
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,780
Flattening homes and cutting power.

50
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,560
At least 15 deaths are being blamed.

51
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,120
Lamed on Ivan.

52
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,020
We need you to watch it along with us.

53
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,160
Right now, Ivan is headed for Jamaica and then Cuba with the latest details.

54
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,140
Hi, Dr. Joe.

55
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,500
Hi.

56
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,920
So Ivan is indeed a monster.

57
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,840
Suddenly, oh, well, there's not enough bandwidth.

58
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,460
We have a new concern.

59
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,560
It is a wet mess in Cleveland, Ohio, thanks to Ivan.

60
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,780
There's the area of uncertainty right there.

61
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:44,820
Vivian?

62
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,600
And, of course, by then, Carl will be watching Ivan.

63
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,840
But here's a closer view of Ivan.

64
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,500
And you can see right here, and you notice it is in the middle of the central dense.

65
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,420
That's an indication that this is a very, very organized Ivan.

66
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:06,740
And they know that our one-world religion is the only antidote for the one-world advertiser.

67
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,160
Ivan, here is Ivan right now.

68
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:16,420
Down with the quote-less Bob and up with Bob and up with Bob.

69
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,680
We'll be watching Ivan.

70
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,680
No, we're here.

71
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,100
And we'll keep you posted every day on the progress of Ivan.

72
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,300
Ivan struck the Windward Islands with deadly force yesterday.

73
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,920
Ivan tore off roofs, knocked trees into power lines, and blew down streetlights.

74
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,740
At this point in time, is it more likely than not that Ivan will affect the U.S.?

75
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,780
Actually, what time is it?

76
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,420
But at that point, Ivan affected the U.S.

77
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,300
Well, this was the original master tape.

78
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,280
No, that's Doug Wellman.

79
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,680
It's a tape.

80
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,440
It is a tape.

81
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,380
It was a tape.

82
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:48,580
It's a tapeworm.

83
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,780
It's a tapeworm.

84
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,460
It's a tapeworm reminding people of things.

85
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,340
It reminds me of the days when we made shows with tape.

86
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,620
Uh, yes.

87
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,280
What about the days before tape?

88
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:04,880
When we made shows with little tin cans wrapped with rubber bands and little pinky fingers from the children we hated.

89
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,000
I don't remember those days.

90
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,560
Well, we never had to pledge ourselves or...

91
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,920
We never had to.

92
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,360
We never had to.

93
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,560
We never had to.

94
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,220
We...

95
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:14,740
Oh, sorry.

96
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,560
I never pledged to my daddy.

97
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,540
I pledged to my daddy.

98
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,320
And I pledged to WCSB four times in the last, uh, what was it?

99
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,620
Three and a half hours?

100
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,480
But anyway, this is pledge week here at, uh, at Nostril Basement.

101
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,540
It sounds very nostril here, doesn't it?

102
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,500
Yeah.

103
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,160
Yeah.

104
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,900
Well, that's because the background music isn't on.

105
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,280
I think it's because the nasal tones of the...

106
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:39,640
Oh, here it is.

107
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,920
...the cadences and so forth.

108
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,240
No, no, except with...

109
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,500
I have to mix this.

110
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,760
I'll mix it in this little hollow skull.

111
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Now, we feel the power.

112
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:53,760
Yes.

113
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,080
The power of the station.

114
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,860
Ah, the skull is smoking.

115
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,460
And the pills.

116
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,640
Well, it's trying to cut down, but it's still smoking.

117
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,160
And the gods.

118
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,720
And the bobs.

119
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,420
And...

120
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,340
And the girls.

121
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,920
And the archons with large memories.

122
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,500
And large vagaries.

123
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,900
And large ovulants.

124
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,360
And the gun.

125
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,940
And the map.

126
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,480
Now, um, yes, it is, in fact, pledge drive time, my friends.

127
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,880
And I've got the option of, uh...

128
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,720
Uh...

129
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,340
Of, uh, playing this real nice and easy.

130
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,340
Friendly.

131
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:24,700
Yeah.

132
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,960
We can do this the easy way.

133
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:26,940
We can do it the hard way.

134
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,020
We can do it the tough way.

135
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:28,620
And, uh...

136
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:28,980
Wait a minute.

137
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,460
Who's gonna be...

138
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,120
The way would be for you to go ahead and start calling.

139
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,660
And what are those, uh, numbers?

140
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,080
I'm probably the least...

141
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,340
Wait a minute.

142
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,020
Who's gonna be good...

143
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,860
Prepared, um...

144
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,800
Who's gonna be good frop and who's gonna be bad frop in this, uh, you know, pledge shakedown?

145
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,200
Well, that depends on what the background music is doing.

146
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,300
Oh, you mean that I might just be, like, bad frop immediately?

147
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,240
You know, like, threaten your life and so forth?

148
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,400
And you go, hey, man, I'll get you off easy.

149
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,060
See?

150
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,160
Your dad knows my dad who knows somebody who knows somebody, you see?

151
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,100
And then you can, uh, well, you know...

152
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,400
Hey, what is the number to call?

153
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,100
687.

154
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,300
687.

155
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,360
6900.

156
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,260
6900.

157
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,080
Yes, that's...

158
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,100
That's the pledge line.

159
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,760
Yeah, Dave, how could you forget?

160
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,360
Because I can always forget.

161
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,560
Um...

162
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,580
Because memory is so painful.

163
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,300
Oh, there we go.

164
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,000
There we go.

165
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,060
Not today.

166
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,080
I'm emotional loss.

167
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:14,540
But it's...

168
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,160
Just painful to me.

169
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,600
Who do we have to thank there?

170
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,600
Are you manning the phones?

171
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,800
Or is Princess Wee helping you?

172
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,600
Princess Wee's manning the phones.

173
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,420
I've done my duty for the day.

174
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,020
All right.

175
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:26,720
Yeah.

176
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,660
The duty has been done.

177
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,740
There's more duty to do.

178
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,260
687.

179
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,260
Friends, you have the chance to talk to...

180
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,500
The duty is still being needed.

181
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,660
I mean, it's still being needed.

182
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:36,780
A real...

183
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,580
The duty is...

184
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,600
Princess.

185
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,920
A bass.

186
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,500
Listen.

187
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,280
And do as I do.

188
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:47,560
By calling in the Cleveland area code, 216-687-6900 to call.

189
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,120
And why should you do a thing like that?

190
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,540
Of course, I'm going to be...

191
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,760
You could ask me, Reverend Stingy.

192
00:06:53,800 --> 00:07:01,160
We'll be talking about all the wonderful WCSB Radiothon extras that you get.

193
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,480
As if you really needed to be bribed with those.

194
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,580
And I suppose they help.

195
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,760
And, you know, I have...

196
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,060
Don't be subgenius if you pledge to this show.

197
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,980
This shirt looks cool as hell, too, by the way.

198
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,560
You might as well add in your adenoidal voice.

199
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,280
It looks cool as hell.

200
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:17,900
Well, I mean, it's...

201
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,740
Cool as heaven.

202
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,840
And for these unradical times, look.

203
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,080
It's an old poster of some radical thing.

204
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:28,160
You know, some, you know, trouncing the imperialist type thing.

205
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:28,600
Yes, friends.

206
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,800
The new WCSB t-shirt does have a sort of a...

207
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,480
The little guy beating Goliath.

208
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:42,580
The working stiff paper boy planting his flag in the gut of the capitalist with his top hat.

209
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,740
And his big fat gut.

210
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,240
Yes, imperialism.

211
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,560
And his money belt.

212
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,120
And his...

213
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,140
And the flag he is planting in that fat man's gut is the WCSB flag.

214
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,240
That's right.

215
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,960
Revolutionary flag.

216
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,200
For a revolutionary time such a thing emerge.

217
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:00,940
I don't know.

218
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,140
It could possibly happen.

219
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:09,600
Do you think that if WCSB manages to get the money, the funds, and the funding it needs,

220
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,740
that we can continue our underground activities?

221
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:13,860
Could we...

222
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,260
We could at least continue to try...

223
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,120
To defeat the conspiracy.

224
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,520
To at least perhaps tie the shoelaces of the colossus together.

225
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,260
But we only have lowly basement with no fax machine, no computer.

226
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,940
We have no phone lines.

227
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,300
We only have one cell phone.

228
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,020
That's true, comrade.

229
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,840
What can we do?

230
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,260
It's double plus on good here in the times of now.

231
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,640
We have rickety old typewriter.

232
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,080
It's manual and it's long, very long keys and so forth.

233
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:41,880
It's...

234
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,360
We...

235
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,920
The station is done.

236
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,240
We've worked hard.

237
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,240


238
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,240


239
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,240


240
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,240


241
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,040
And we've come a long way over the years.

242
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,440
But it's still overrun with monsters.

243
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,560
Wind blows through the window.

244
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,820
The cold Arctic air from Siberia blowing through the windows.

245
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,640
And friends, it just costs.

246
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,540
I mean, just to keep broadcasting.

247
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,280
Now, you may think to yourself,

248
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,980
Well, isn't that a university station?

249
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,260
Don't those rich parents of those state school students...

250
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,440
Don't the puppets of the state of Ohio take care of this puppet show?

251
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,420
Actually, friends,

252
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,360
if that was true,

253
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,480
you wouldn't be listening to a couple of old codgers

254
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,900
like Lonesome Cowboy Dave

255
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,740
and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stanton.

256
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,800
No, you wouldn't be listening to some ignorant students.

257
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,400
But this radio station...

258
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,740
They're never ignorant if they go to Cleveland State.

259
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,180
Even if they are.

260
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,340
I mean, come on.

261
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,120
We can't pledge our loyalty in our feet.

262
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,760
Maybe I should put something besides this Wolfman music on.

263
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,060
It sounds like the Wolfman is trying to eat the pledge people

264
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,320
that are trying to call or something.

265
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,740
Yeah, that's going to scare them.

266
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,860
And I wouldn't...

267
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,280
Since that's 687-6900.

268
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,260
And that's not a joke.

269
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,000
A number.

270
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,460
I know some of you young fellas are going,

271
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,640
Oh, yeah, 69.

272
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,860
Doesn't that mean something nasty?

273
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,800
Isn't that something cool or bad?

274
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,980
But if you pledge $69...

275
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,580
That I'm supposed to know about?

276
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,260
I'll try the amino acids new album.

277
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,500
You won't hear this anymore.

278
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,760
If you were to pledge $69,

279
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,000
you'd get a green hooded sweatshirt with a...

280
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:15,780
Zipper.

281
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:16,920
You know what I'm saying?

282
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,820
Actually, friends,

283
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,920
if you pledge over...

284
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,640
If you pledge, like, say, the $60,

285
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,720
not only would you get the green hooded sweatshirt with a zipper,

286
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,640
but I'm going to throw in a subgenius premium,

287
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,640
which is the Arise DVD video.

288
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,000
Yes, the video.

289
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,720
We have several videos that we've done,

290
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,220
but I figure I could throw in the new

291
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,060
Dobs of Deliastis music videos,

292
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,760
or perhaps the old As They See Bob,

293
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,400
which is the...

294
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,640
The Conspiracy News Reports on Church of the Subgenius

295
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,860
over the last 25 years.

296
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,600
But I think Arise, our hit video

297
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,000
that they film threat called,

298
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,020
one of the 10 must-have underground films,

299
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,660
Arise, the subgenius recruitment film,

300
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,460
the video,

301
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,520
is yours when you pledge.

302
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,040
So call that number and pledge that $60 pledge.

303
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,340
That's 687-6900.

304
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,660
Now, this is not some joke.

305
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,640
This is not part of your subgenius silly joke

306
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,300
underground humor.

307
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,840
This is for real.

308
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,540
This is not only not a joke,

309
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,580
but if you act now,

310
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,660
you have only from 9 o'clock right now,

311
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,380
it's 9.15 right now,

312
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,140
but if you must act now before 10 o'clock,

313
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,960
if you want to get the subgenius materials

314
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,340
along with your logo-headed sweatshipper

315
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:39,380
and your black or blue logo grease shirt,

316
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,200
also the four shot and red-eye glasses...

317
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,140
I better write down what I'm...

318
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,940
promising these pledgers.

319
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,960
Now, with a $60 pledge,

320
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,200
a $69 pledge,

321
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,580
a sexual pledge,

322
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,540
you get a green-hooded sweatshirt with a zipper.

323
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,680
The sex pledge.

324
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,240
I don't know if they come separately

325
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,920
or if the zipper is on the green-hooded sweatshirt,

326
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,440
but it's green, man,

327
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,620
and that's all you gotta know.

328
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,320
That's proper special, man.

329
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,400
For six more bucks than this $69.99,

330
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,980
you get a $75 pledge,

331
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,640
which gets you a black-hooded sweatshirt with zipper,

332
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:13,760
plus...

333
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,120
I don't know.

334
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,320
I think some other stuff.

335
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,680
Now, for $25, friends,

336
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,980
not only would you get that baseball cap,

337
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:26,820
that knitwear hat,

338
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,100
that four shot glasses,

339
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,760
the 2004 design shirt,

340
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,520
or the 2004 design tote bag,

341
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,960
which, friends,

342
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,160
that's a mighty scrote of a tote bag.

343
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,020
You can carry heads in there,

344
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,760
chopped off,

345
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,840
human peak heads.

346
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,460
You can carry bowling balls and laptops

347
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,760
at the same time,

348
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,900
and that scrote bag,

349
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,060
that WCSB perfect scrote bag,

350
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,060
similar to the subgenius scrote bag

351
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,480
that you can get on Cafe Press also, I bet.

352
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,860
I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't the same thing.

353
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,040
But you remember, you have to act

354
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,560
before the hour of 10 o'clock

355
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,720
because everything reverts back to Radiothon original time,

356
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,780
which means that you can,

357
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,000
for one $15 pledge,

358
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,700
you could get a glass ashtray,

359
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,660
a mugged coffee maker,

360
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,300
or a black-and-white 2001 shirt.

361
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,820
Now, I don't really know

362
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,740
what some of these things are,

363
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,140
I'm kind of new on the job here at WPSZ,

364
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,720
or WCS, at WCSB,

365
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,020
but that is, sounds like a health of a bargaining.

366
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,120
It is a health of a bargaining, friends,

367
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,120
and we will throw in,

368
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,700
if you pledge to this show,

369
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,400
the Hour of Slack,

370
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,940
specific, be quiet, Dave,

371
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,740
if you pledge specifically

372
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,180
to the Hour of Slack,

373
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:36,800
friends,

374
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,360
the triple X rated

375
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,280
special internet only

376
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,740
Hour of Slack CD

377
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,720
will be available.

378
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,020
It will be yours.

379
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,660
That's right.

380
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,020
You pledge $25 to this show.

381
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,540
To this show, call 687-6900

382
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,200
and you will get that subgenius

383
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,740
triple X rated Hour of Slack.

384
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,000
It's a special Hour of Slack

385
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,720
that only the internet people get to hear

386
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,640
because it's so filthy and raunchy

387
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,520
and has such wonderful prank calls

388
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,440
from our collections.

389
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,960
That's, well, friends,

390
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,080
that's what you get.

391
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,220
And for your $15 pledge, friends,

392
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,440
I will throw in the Bob sticker.

393
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,000
The J.R. Bob Dobbs authorized,

394
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,680
the portrait that you've seen tattooed

395
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,480
onto people's faces and backs

396
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,400
and scarred into their arms.

397
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,160
And it's the coolest

398
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,280
upcoming world religion.

399
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,300
Take mind control cult

400
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,520
that you will ever get your brain

401
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,520
and hands on or your ears wrapped around.

402
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,300
So have at it, man.

403
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:30,900
This is the tops.

404
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,840
This is the very tops of a mind control cult.

405
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,980
If you want to join now,

406
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,180
that's a different story.

407
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,180
But what we're saying here is

408
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,720
we want you to support

409
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,320
with your tiny little emaciated fingers

410
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,780
and your strange looking mouth

411
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,540
that has like only,

412
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,380
only four teeth left

413
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,040
and those big chunks of brain

414
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,020
hanging out of your eye.

415
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,040
We want you still to support WCSB

416
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,480
because no one else is going to.

417
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,400
You think our government's going to take it?

418
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,420
You think your family cares about it?

419
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,040
No, they don't care about you or the state.

420
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,200
You wouldn't be listening to this

421
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,040
if you weren't a loser.

422
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,240
The first thing you want to lose

423
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,500
is $15 for an Anthony Ask Glass tray,

424
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,720
a coffee mug,

425
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,020
or a black and white shirt.

426
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,740
And don't forget the Bob sticker.

427
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,520
The J.R. Bob.

428
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,740
And this isn't just a paper sticker.

429
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,940
This is a vinyl sticker.

430
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:12,800
You cannot.

431
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,020
You cannot remove this

432
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,300
once it's on, friend.

433
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,800
Now what kind of pledge now

434
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,620
was it for the X-rated tape staying?

435
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,240
I forget now.

436
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,220
Was that a $25?

437
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,840
That's the $25 pledge.

438
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,820
You get the X-rated Hour of Slack special

439
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,380
that you'll never hear on this

440
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,820
or any of the other stations

441
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,640
that broadcast Hour of Slack.

442
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,640
Praise those stations.

443
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,440
And you also get either your choice

444
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,020
of a regal baseball cap

445
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,860
with the things on it,

446
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,400
a knit winter hat

447
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,000
with a small person under it

448
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,140
that you have to pop out

449
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,020
and remove his head,

450
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,620
four shot glasses,

451
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,120
and after four shots, you're dead.

452
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,220
A 2004 design shirt.

453
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,880
There's no going to be any designs

454
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,060
for the rest of this year,

455
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
but this is the one.

456
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,700
And it looks like a proletarian

457
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,540
disc jockey guy

458
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,420
kicking somebody in the belly button,

459
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,520
but we won't talk about that.

460
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,860
And also a 2004 toker bag

461
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,460
for all you sleepers

462
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,780
and hambones

463
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,260
that like to prepare

464
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,100
for the children.

465
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,500
But what's in that

466
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,840
for $25 X-rated tape?

467
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,540
I mean, that is an extra bargain

468
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,000
that goes beyond an extra bargain.

469
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,400
What kind of salacious,

470
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,720
stuff is in there?

471
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,620
Prank calls.

472
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,700
Pranks.

473
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,560
Pranksters.

474
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,340
Some genius doctrine

475
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,820
about sexual matters

476
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,920
that can't be covered

477
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,780
on the public airwaves.

478
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,860
I think you might know

479
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,880
what we're talking about.

480
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,800
We get right into it.

481
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,340
I mean, we actually discussed...

482
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,460
We don't pussyfoot around

483
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,980
when we're footing on those things.

484
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,140
It's real.

485
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,060
Friends, this is real.

486
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,480
And this radio station

487
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,100
brings you real...

488
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,760
Well, you know the difference

489
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,660
between this

490
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,620
and maybe one or two other colleges.

491
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,160
There's a lot of legislations

492
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:43,600
here and there

493
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,800
scattered around the country.

494
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,620
And all the other corporate crap!

495
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,980
My God!

496
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,000
You know the difference.

497
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,040
I don't have to explain.

498
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,860
That's why you're listening.

499
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,080
Even though I'm doing this.

500
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,640
Even though this is a pledge drive,

501
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,320
you're still listening.

502
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,800
Even though you're not going

503
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,040
to spend a penny.

504
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,920
But yet, but yet,

505
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,240
I'm in discernment now.

506
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm in the spirit.

507
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,260
And I can feel,

508
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,220
I can hear the whispering

509
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:05,940
from afar

510
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,640
inside the mind

511
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,540
of somebody who's saying,

512
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,100
maybe this is the time

513
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,840
when I'm gonna...

514
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,180
I mean, George Bush,

515
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:12,580
what?

516
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,060
One.

517
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:13,940
Kind of.

518
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,900
The conspiracy is rolling

519
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,440
over the world

520
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,240
like a giant steamroller.

521
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,280
Maybe, maybe, maybe

522
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,100
I could feel a little better

523
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,020
if I just made

524
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,160
the slightest effort

525
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,360
of making that phone call.

526
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,380
Heck, I could talk

527
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,640
to Princess We Are Doe.

528
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,720
She is, after all,

529
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,240
the queen of all the UFOs

530
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,460
who has lowered herself

531
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,520
to taking calls from mortals

532
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,200
at 687-6900.

533
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,180
You could do that

534
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,640
or you could just go on

535
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,560
with your hopelessness.

536
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,320
Your sad, pathetic,

537
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,440
go, oh, well,

538
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,420
I don't want to...

539
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,080
What can I do?

540
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,280
I'm just a little person.

541
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,900
I need that $15 for beer.

542
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:52,760
Yeah.

543
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,140
I need that $15

544
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,100
for my pornography download.

545
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,940
I need me another

546
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,040
quick jerky-darky, you know?

547
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,720
Oh, I need that $15.

548
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,860
I don't need that Bobhead sticker,

549
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,160
but I need that

550
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,340
Hootie and the Blowfish album.

551
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,240
They're my favorite band.

552
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,080
I don't need to support

553
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,940
this station

554
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,500
because I can spend

555
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,060
that $60 instead

556
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,500
on...

557
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,240
On spreading my feces

558
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,000
all over my...

559
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,700
On a Rolling Stones concert.

560
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,080
Right.

561
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:22,540
Right.

562
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,760
One of those balcony seats.

563
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:25,800
Sure.

564
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,600
I don't need...

565
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,280
Friends,

566
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,180
I'm not hearing the calls.

567
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,920
I'm calling for them,

568
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,740
but I ain't hearing them.

569
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,980
I ain't hearing nothing

570
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,020
out of you people.

571
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,480
Now, if that continues,

572
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,140
what do you think

573
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:36,660
you're going to hear

574
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,200
about a bus?

575
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:37,940
Nothing.

576
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,900
Nothing, but the constant...

577
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,120
Nothing.

578
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,620
Oh, yeah, nothing.

579
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,340
No, nothing.

580
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,420
They won't hear nothing.

581
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:43,940
Ready, ship.

582
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,180
Hey, you know how many...

583
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,440
How long the hour of slack

584
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,200
has been on,

585
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,040
and if it went off,

586
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,000
it would be your fault.

587
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:50,660
It's probably...

588
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:50,940
We've been on the air, friends.

589
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,120
It always is your fault

590
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,840
we're off on.

591
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,980
Since 1985.

592
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,160
And we've been on the air

593
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,700
at 9 o'clock Sunday nights

594
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,960
in WCSB Cleveland

595
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,620
for over 10 years.

596
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,940
10 decibels, too.

597
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:03,780
Each time,

598
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,440
with a zipper

599
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,740
and a hooded snot shirt.

600
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,200
And if we're not on anymore,

601
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,540
whose fault's it going to be?

602
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,500
It's going to be yours,

603
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:09,980
my friend.

604
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,860
It's going to be yours, snotty.

605
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,840
Now, here's some...

606
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,340
Here's a...

607
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,220
I'm going to play

608
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,640
some old Pledge Drive tapes.

609
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,400
This is the way

610
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:15,940
we used to do it

611
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,660
back in the old days.

612
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,140
We had...

613
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:18,740
Fire engines?

614
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,340
Lonesome Cowboy Dave...

615
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,100
We had fire engines?

616
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,200
...was too famous for us then.

617
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:23,800
It was before

618
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,300
he became a has-been.

619
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:25,900
But we had...

620
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,680
Here's somebody

621
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,760
who was once famous.

622
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,200
I'm going to play a tape now

623
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,700
of Pope Robert Anton Wilson.

624
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,360
Now, he's a famous philosopher.

625
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,140
Some of you might be impressed

626
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:36,720
by the fact

627
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,200
that I have this tape here.

628
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,180
But let's just hear this.

629
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,400
We're going to save

630
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,140
the universe.

631
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,140
My friends,

632
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,500
whether you help or not,

633
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,160
this time...

634
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,060
This time...

635
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,700
I don't see a single line

636
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,400
lighting up, friends.

637
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,460
Okay, look.

638
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,300
Last time...

639
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,940
Last time,

640
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,520
we only came in number nine

641
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,400
on the Pledge Drive,

642
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,260
and that's the truth.

643
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,680
We bragged too much.

644
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,460
We had pride.

645
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,040
But too much pride.

646
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,200
The giant fell.

647
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,640
Tricked and fell

648
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,780
on its clay feet.

649
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,140
So,

650
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,040
our one-time

651
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,380
naked glory has passed.

652
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,600
We don't expect y'all

653
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,020
to support us anymore.

654
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,580
We'll probably just fade out

655
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,020
into obscurity

656
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,900
eventually here.

657
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,340
It's worse than that.

658
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,080
Bob re-arrested again today.

659
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:25,740
No!

660
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,520
Yes?

661
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,420
It always happens to you.

662
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,020
How come...

663
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,940
I always miss these things!

664
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,120
He re-arrested

665
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,380
and he started channeling

666
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:33,920
through me.

667
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,420
And Bob himself,

668
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,620
that's J.R. Bob Dobbs,

669
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,520
for the benefit of those

670
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,600
who may have just tuned in,

671
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,820
Bob himself,

672
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,320
he told me,

673
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,340
that if you don't raise

674
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,880
$8 million this evening,

675
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,140
he's going to die again.

676
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:47,680
$8 million?

677
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,720
The listeners of this station

678
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,820
are so cold-hearted,

679
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,780
so merciless,

680
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,620
so lacking in religious feelings,

681
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,580
they're going to let Bob

682
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,800
die a second time?

683
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,300
I certainly hope not.

684
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,080
Hey, Fred,

685
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,040
you don't know our listeners,

686
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:58,720
Pope Bob.

687
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,540
I mean, to tell the truth,

688
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,480
these people would pay

689
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,380
to watch Bob

690
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,420
thrown to the Christians

691
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,800
while the lions watched

692
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,340
in the Coliseum.

693
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,280
Oh, yeah.

694
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,240
They just soon see blood.

695
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,200
They want to see blood.

696
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,020
They don't want to call

697
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,100
82374.

698
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:11,660
I mean,

699
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,320
688-788-7888.

700
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,160
82374-7-6900.

701
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,160
You can call

702
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,020
82374-7-6900.

703
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:16,880
Quit hesitating.

704
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,840
Quit waiting.

705
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,920
Quit waiting to see

706
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,680
how we're doing.

707
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,380
We're doing great,

708
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,340
but we still need

709
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,260
every penny

710
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,540
because we want to

711
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,580
equip this station

712
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,960
with those same things.

713
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,300
Tell them what we can do

714
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:27,980
for this station,

715
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,520
IDNAX.

716
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,660
We can add

717
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,500
the Nebulon

718
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,980
super-powered radars.

719
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,300
That's right.

720
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,220
With your pledge money,

721
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:38,520
friends,

722
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,800
we could equip this station

723
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,140
and it can go into

724
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:41,420
a bad,

725
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,080
it will be able to

726
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,360
transform into battle mode

727
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,880
in 5.6 seconds.

728
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,820
And it can transform

729
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,160
into a battle station

730
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,260
that has plenty of places

731
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,100
to get gas.

732
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,320
And it'll be for free,

733
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,460
so you better pledge.

734
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,480
That's right, friends.

735
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,220
That's the thing.

736
00:21:59,280 --> 00:21:59,840
You're getting this,

737
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,740
you've been getting this

738
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,820
for free most of the year.

739
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,760
That kid you're hearing

740
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,980
that you just heard

741
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,940
on that old tape,

742
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,580
that kid just got married

743
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,560
this last summer.

744
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,240
Last time,

745
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:08,940
only about...

746
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,220
Friends,

747
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,660
it's 687-6900.

748
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,740
Don't reduce us

749
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,180
to playing

750
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,620
ancient pledge drive tapes.

751
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,700
Because otherwise,

752
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,300
well,

753
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,140
you'll be hearing

754
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,680
just more of this.

755
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,520
And over the airwaves,

756
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,100
the pressure to buy,

757
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,760
to give,

758
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,520
to pledge

759
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,520
was relentless.

760
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,160
And although we've got

761
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,100
hundreds and thousands

762
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,060
that are so faithful

763
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,160
with God bless you,

764
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,360
God bless you

765
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,480
for your faithfulness.

766
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,400
Still there are

767
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,100
hundreds and hundreds,

768
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:38,940
maybe thousands,

769
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,820
who are not faithful,

770
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,620
who made the pledge,

771
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,520
who for some reason

772
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,820
or another haven't sent it in.

773
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,220
And if we count on that,

774
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,460
and it doesn't come in everything,

775
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,040
everything suffers.

776
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,000
We are even having a hard time

777
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,560
meeting the payroll right now,

778
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,880
and the people that we have

779
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,020
working for PTL

780
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,480
have families too.

781
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,940
They have bills too.

782
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,260
Jim Baker's running costs

783
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,120
exceeded $2 million a week.

784
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,220
That's nothing compared

785
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,100
to ours, friends.

786
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,820
This baby

787
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,700
that I'm holding in my hands,

788
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,460
this nag,

789
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,800
is one of the first babies

790
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
that has been saved.

791
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,140
His brain is constructed

792
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,120
in a strange way.

793
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,860
8-2-3-6-8-7-6-9-100.

794
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,960
Now listen to this,

795
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,020
dear friends.

796
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,520
8-2-3-7-4-9-0-6-8-7-6-9-100.

797
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,760
They call it

798
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,680
the buckle on the Bible Belt.

799
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,300
That's us.

800
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,500
It has the largest quota

801
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,120
of millionaires,

802
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,080
the worst crime rate,

803
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,680
and one of the severest

804
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,560
poverty rates,

805
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,940
in any American city.

806
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,840
Great spot.

807
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,400
Like Dallas could also

808
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,500
be described as...

809
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:45,880
Who understands

810
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,920
what this generous gift

811
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,860
means to me?

812
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,960
I've been a student

813
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,180
here at Cleveland

814
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,880
State University

815
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,160
for the last 73 and a half years.

816
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,240
I can believe that, actually.

817
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,100
And as a member of the...

818
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,900
What was I talking about?

819
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,100
I believe

820
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,680
that you're about

821
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,260
yours.

822
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,080
But not just for

823
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,500
this.

824
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,980
What were you saying, Dave?

825
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,080
I was saying that I was

826
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,120
checking in the basement

827
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,080
just about 25 minutes ago

828
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,820
and it looks like

829
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,660
there are a lot of people

830
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,220
down there trying to break doors,

831
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,800
smashing windows,

832
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,840
and trying to get in

833
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,220
to give this beautiful

834
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,780
little edifice we call

835
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:37,080
W-S-E-S-B.

836
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,220
Our homeland,

837
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,280
our homeland,

838
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:40,920
our homeland.

839
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,180
It's true, friends.

840
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,000
There have been some

841
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
who've called in.

842
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:44,180
Our homeland.

843
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,000
There are those who called in

844
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,100
and have pledged.

845
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:47,680
We've heard from

846
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,200
three people already.

847
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,040
Three?

848
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,480
Oh, I guess the station's

849
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:51,960
going to be...

850
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,860
We're going to have to

851
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,400
go to jail for avoiding

852
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,500
paying taxes

853
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,780
because we're going to be

854
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,560
taxed so much.

855
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,840
We're making so much money.

856
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,800
Oh, dearie me.

857
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,240
Reverend, I'm in staying good.

858
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,000
I'll just make one thing

859
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,700
perfectly dismally unclear

860
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,280
right now.

861
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:04,900
Can I just say,

862
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,900
without any form of

863
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,820
reservation or any other place

864
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,660
you could keep people

865
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,460
for a long time,

866
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,460
that I, nor the members,

867
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,160
and I'm not a member,

868
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,400
I'm just kind of dismembered

869
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:14,980
at this moment in time,

870
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,540
but we do not

871
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,420
ensure your safety.

872
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,280
If you perhaps send in

873
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,920
a $20,

874
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,620
a check for $20

875
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,860
for a baby doll shirt,

876
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:24,340
you know,

877
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,120
and you decide you want

878
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,800
to look like

879
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,120
one of those baby dolls

880
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,080
one night and something,

881
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:28,320
you know,

882
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,320
RTA bus actually

883
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,640
takes you out

884
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,060
for a date

885
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,600
or just squishes you,

886
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,140
it doesn't matter

887
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,300
because we don't

888
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,280
guarantee your safety.

889
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,820
We don't guarantee

890
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,500
your happiness,

891
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,680
but we do guarantee

892
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,940
your increased

893
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,140
listed...

894
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:48,180
I remember

895
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,140
they were a collector's item,

896
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,020
but I guess

897
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,920
they're the next thing.

898
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,100
We don't want you

899
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,220
to pledge your...

900
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,160
Friends,

901
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,500
you can hear Princess Wee

902
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,380
singing in the background

903
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,260
because nobody's

904
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:21,960
pledging right now.

905
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,220
We have had some pledgers.

906
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,760
We've had pledgers

907
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,100
for Rossich,

908
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,620
the Pope of all Cleveland,

909
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,360
Rossich,

910
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,600
and Bob.

911
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:32,980
Praise Bob.

912
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,100
And there's another one

913
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:35,320
there.

914
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,500
Some man has bailed us out

915
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,300
out there.

916
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:38,900
We've been bailed.

917
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,420
And the bells are ringing.

918
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,220
Look at the lights

919
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:40,680
of all the...

920
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,520
The little lights

921
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,460
are lighting up

922
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,340
all over the place.

923
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,160
Praise Bob.

924
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,060
Stop.

925
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,900
Whatever his name is.

926
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,840
Dick wants the X-rated hour.

927
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,180
It's like,

928
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,080
praise Dick,

929
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:51,740
praise Bob.

930
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,300
Praise Dick.

931
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,940
Dick and Bob

932
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,260
and Bev have

933
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:54,500
the best

934
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,860
trade night

935
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,980
here in Cleveland.

936
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,720
I'm so happy, Jim.

937
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,260
Could you please

938
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,000
hand me the envelope?

939
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,820
Oh, here's another one

940
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,520
for...

941
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,700
Why, it's a bag of...

942
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,320
Why, it's a bag of...

943
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,760
It's not...

944
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,320
It's a bag of...

945
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,580
823-7490.

946
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,680
Oh, yeah.

947
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,420
That number.

948
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,460
A prayer.

949
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,840
And you'd better pray.

950
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,120
Dreamers.

951
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,300
Screamers.

952
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,840
When I fall asleep

953
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,040
you dream

954
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,180
I am screaming

955
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,520
your dreamers.

956
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,540
My dream is to be a dad.

957
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,380
You need extra

958
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,920
in your life.

959
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,620
We are going to save

960
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,020
the universe, dear friends.

961
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,100
We are going to save

962
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:40,520
the universe

963
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,480
during this pledge drive.

964
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,440
We have got to.

965
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,740
This is your and my

966
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,940
and everyone else's

967
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,600
last chance

968
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,080
to actually save

969
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,260
this universe.

970
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,100
I...

971
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,200
I want...

972
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,260
I want...

973
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,380
I want to send

974
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,280
my money,

975
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,020
but I have so little.

976
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,140
Will they accept

977
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,500
the cash

978
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,980
or check

979
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,880
or money

980
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,560
or the...

981
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,720
from a man like me?

982
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,800
There are so few

983
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,620
of us left.

984
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,980
It takes...

985
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,500
so little

986
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,480
to be a man

987
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,020
to separate oneself

988
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,260
from the apes,

989
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,740
the beasts of the field.

990
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,720
And yet,

991
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,140
how many do it?

992
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:20,560
How many

993
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,560
make that tiny effort?

994
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,400
You know,

995
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,180
you can have it

996
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,380
taken out of your...

997
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,460
your bank,

998
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,160
I'm sure,

999
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,620
for a little bit a month,

1000
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,060
five bucks a month.

1001
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:32,760
I bet they have

1002
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,560
a set up for that.

1003
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:33,980
You can...

1004
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,660
you can talk.

1005
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,420
You can give

1006
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,380
all your numbers

1007
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,780
and all your love

1008
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,940
to Princess Wee,

1009
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,260
Princess Wee Ardo,

1010
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,420
Queen of all the UFOs.

1011
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:42,760
She loves you, too.

1012
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,160
When you call...

1013
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,220
She likes your head

1014
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,400
on the part of your brain

1015
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,360
that is showing.

1016
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,500
She loves you.

1017
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,500
Friends,

1018
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,660
you could do it.

1019
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:53,700
Please,

1020
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,880
687-6800,

1021
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,900
don't make us

1022
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,900
play the old tapes

1023
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,640
over and over and over.

1024
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,240
Are they...

1025
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,980
Will they become

1026
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,100
empowered by this?

1027
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,220
823-7490,

1028
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,420
and it is serious.

1029
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,140
It is serious, friends.

1030
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:04,440
Mighty serious

1031
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:04,900
this time, friends.

1032
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,820
687-6800.

1033
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,240
I've got one hour

1034
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,060
to convince you

1035
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:08,820
how badly

1036
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,880
we have the station.

1037
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,720
We need your support.

1038
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,180
Become.

1039
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,200
We have a special,

1040
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,300
special form

1041
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:14,820
of slack

1042
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,900
in store tonight.

1043
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,360
Instead of us

1044
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,520
giving you slack

1045
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,340
for once,

1046
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,380
you're going to

1047
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,800
finally give some

1048
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,580
back to us

1049
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,320
for some of you

1050
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,400
have been doing so

1051
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,220
all along.

1052
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,380
Praise Bob.

1053
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,560
But for the rest of you,

1054
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,620
oh, this could be

1055
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,700
the moment of truth,

1056
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,180
the moment at hand.

1057
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,820
And once again,

1058
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,280
that's 823-7490.

1059
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,840
No, it's 687-6800,

1060
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,600
but that's okay.

1061
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:39,960
687-6800.

1062
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,200
He loves you, Bob.

1063
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,160
967-6900.

1064
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,800
He has to love Bob.

1065
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,280
6900.

1066
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,000
He loves you, Bob.

1067
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:44,240
No.

1068
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,300
You love Bob.

1069
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,680
You have to.

1070
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,540
Or else what happens

1071
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,540
if you don't love Bob?

1072
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,600
He'll kill you.

1073
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,400
So Bob, you out.

1074
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,060
You have Bob, you out.

1075
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,640
She's 23 now.

1076
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,020
You heard it here first.

1077
00:29:59,360 --> 00:29:59,820
You heard it.

1078
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,560
You don't love Bob,

1079
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,180
you heard it here first.

1080
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,200
Bob, you out.

1081
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,020
You have a baby.

1082
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:03,820
It's dear friends.

1083
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,580
It's dear friends.

1084
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,760
Only if, you know,

1085
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,080
if it's...

1086
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,780
You know, there's going to be

1087
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,720
so many reverend states,

1088
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,860
there's going to be more

1089
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,600
than one.

1090
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:09,820
There's going to be more

1091
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,720
and more reverend states.

1092
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,080
Get rid of them.

1093
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,120
Get rid of them.

1094
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,180
How many stangs

1095
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,660
can there be in a pledge, friends?

1096
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,540
We need that money.

1097
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,360
I want them all gone.

1098
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,920
687-6800.

1099
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:20,540
6900.

1100
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,240
Look at those phones.

1101
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,920
All the stangs must be gone.

1102
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:24,980
Oh, yeah.

1103
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,240
All right.

1104
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,020
Yes, they...

1105
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,020
Oh, friend.

1106
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,360
Shake it off.

1107
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,660
Can you imagine a world

1108
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,600
without Slack?

1109
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,020
A world without WCSB?

1110
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,720
A world without scrumptious

1111
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,300
and the likes of idiotic

1112
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,340
entertainment that you

1113
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:39,580
can imagine.

1114
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:39,580


1115
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:39,580


1116
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:39,580


1117
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,620
You can barely understand.

1118
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,520
Well, you can't stand it

1119
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,040
any longer

1120
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,480
if you don't want to put up

1121
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,660
where you can shut up.

1122
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,820
Now it's time to put your money

1123
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,580
where your mouth

1124
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,560
and other organs

1125
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,720
that open up are.

1126
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,480
For more info available

1127
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,900

00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,300
you can find out

1129
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,220
all you don't

1130
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,380
and do need to know.

1131
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,100
WCSB Radiothon.

1132
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,740
Oh, we got beautiful items here.

1133
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,860
I don't know why the hell

1134
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,780
they call them items.

1135
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,120

00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,460
You can't hack that

1146
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,480

1147
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,460

1148
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,820

1152
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,560

1153
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,580
drizzled...

1154
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,620
You know, one of those people

1155
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,760
that like to put things off.

1156
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,020
I know you can do it, man.

1157
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,860
We know.

1158
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,600
We know.

1159
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,620
We're all procrastinationals,

1160
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,600
but this is the time.

1161
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,060

1163
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,780

1164
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,840
it's 687-6900.

1165
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,680
I don't love her.

1166
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,000
687-6900.

1167
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,700

1168
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,140
Call in and feel Bob

1169
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,560
moving in your heart, baby.

1170
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,000
Bob loves you.

1171
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,060
May you show him

1172
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:06,940
some love back.

1173
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,520
I want you to...

1174
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,100
Get on that phone

1175
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,060
and call that man, Bob.

1176
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,040
Or that girl, princess.

1177
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,960
We are doing 687-6900.

1178
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,900
I don't have any men in my case.

1179
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,660
Any other things,

1180
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,000
items like that.

1181
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,740
We do have a beautiful,

1182
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,860
beautiful owl with a...

1183
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,560
No, we don't have

1184
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,040
a beautiful owl, do we?

1185
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,420
We have a gray or black

1186
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,060
small logo sweatshirt,

1187
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,400
which will be the envy

1188
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,840
of all the zip zappers

1189
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,860
and the local Freon smokers

1190
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,400

1191
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:38,780

1193
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,000
of a portrayal.

1194
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,880
I mean of a pledge,

1195
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,740
not a portrayal.

1196
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,700
You can portray yourself

1197
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,440
any way you want.

1198
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,060
And I'll be reading

1199
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,760

00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,660
We'll take Visa.

00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,540
We'll take MasterCard.

1202
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,440
We'll take American Express.

1203
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,500
We'll take bank drafts.

1204
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,840
By which monthly payments

1205
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,680
are automatically withdrawn

1206
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,440
from your bank account.

1210
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:56,900
again.

1211
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,160
And of course,

1212
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,520
a check or money order

1213
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,720

00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,320
we should thank

the callers

1306
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,000
who've actually

1307
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,500

1308
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,120

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,640
it doesn't work that way.

1318
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,480
We don't know.

1319
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,960
We don't pledge to you

1320
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,240

00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:00,980
No,

1325
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:01,900
that's not the way

1326
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,560
the pledge works.

1327
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,440
You pledge to us

1328
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,040
and then you give us

1329
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,720
the money,

1330
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,560
the station,

1331
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,060
that is.

1332
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,400
Then we give you

1333
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,060
the swag.

1334
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:10,840
See?

1335
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:11,300
Yeah,

1336
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,180
that's how it works.

1337
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,320
So don't try and

1338
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,260
mess with the game,

1339
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,000
shorty or fat pants

1340
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,580
or any other

1341
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,020
denominical names

1342
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,300
I might lay on you

1343
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,640
in the next half an hour.

1344
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,440
just think,

1345
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,120
you have half an hour

1346
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,700
to get right with Bob,

1347
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,880
to get your soul right.

1348
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,380
I am right.

1349
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:27,800
You know,

1350
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,300
you may have committed

1351
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,700
the unpardonable sin.

1352
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,340
You know,

1353
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,020
what is the one

1354
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,020
unpardonable sin?

1355
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,060
Pull the lever,

1356
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:34,740
down you go.

1357
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,600
The sin that can

1358
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,040
never,

1359
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,440
ever,

1360
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:37,760
ever,

1361
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,200
ever,

1362
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:38,880
uh,

1363
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:39,780
be forgiven.

1364
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,360
Well,

1365
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:40,820
friends,

1366
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,080
have you committed

1367
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,520
that sin?

1368
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,360
You know,

1369
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:43,980
there's one way

1370
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,560
to erase that sin

1371
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,840
from the book of life

1372
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,940
so that you can still

1373
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,180
get into the escape vessel

1374
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,220
of sex goddesses

1375
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:50,940
on judgment day

1376
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,620
and that's to

1377
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,680
call this station

1378
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,040
and pledge that money

1379
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,080
right now!

1380
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,260
Uh,

Yeah,

1384
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,000
you hear that sound,

1385
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:03,400
baby?

1386
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,320
That's what you're

1387
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:05,960
going to sound like

1388
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,560
if you pledge

1389
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:06,940
for a,

1390
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,600

00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,420
or a $2,000

1393
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:11,540
sweatshirt.

1394
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:12,840
Yeah,

1396
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,040
I can see it

1397
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,460
in your eyes.

1398
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,740
You're going crazy

Yeah,

1417
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,820
I can see it

1418
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,140
in your eyes,

1419
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:30,380

00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,200
matter

1424
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,940
slash,

1425
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,780
stained eyes.

1426
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,440
You know,

1427
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:39,980
I could play

1428
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,020
some good music

1429
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:41,540
or something

1430
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,280
if we could get

1431
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,200
one more caller.

1432
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,440
Somebody just call in

1433
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:44,640
and say,

1434
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:44,860
look,

1435
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:45,180

00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,680
I'll pledge you

1437
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,220
my money,

1438
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,280
I'll give you

1439
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,540
my credit card numbers,

1440
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,320
I'll tell you everything

1441
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,340
if you'll just

1442
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,240
shut up and place

1443
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:53,960
just one call,

1444
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,220
687-6900,

1445
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,100
that's all we want.

1446
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:56,500
We really get to

1447
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,340
torch from this

1448
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,400
during pledge week.

1449
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,180
Yeah.

1450
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,000
We really get to,

1451
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:00,460
you know,

1452
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,660
we don't have to sit back

1453
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,680
and listen to cool music

1454
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,440
or somebody who actually

1455
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,120
makes sense,

1456
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:04,400
you know,

1457
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,060
as a cutaway

1458
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:05,960
or something like that.

1459
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,760
We can just

1460
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,460
continue to

1461
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,760
grate their nubs down.

1462
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,420
If they can't take a joke,

1463
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,200
I think we know

1464
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,000
how to handle that.

1465
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,320
Yeah.

1466
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,820
We know your

00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:14,800

1468
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,100
zip,

1469
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:15,100


1470
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:15,660
I think we know

1471
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:15,940
what to do

1472
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,600
if somebody can't

1473
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,900
take a bit of a joke.

1474
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,660
large logo sweatshirt.

1475
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:18,900

6900.

1496
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,080
There ain't no reason

1497
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,900
you can't do that.

1498
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,060

They're listening

and they're talking

1507
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,060

1508
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,260

1513
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,740
That old Stan,

00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,340

one time,

1518
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,980
so he must be rich.

1519
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,180
That lonesome cowboy

1520
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:04,540
Dave,

1521
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,780
he's a famous rock star.

1522
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,380
He's rich.

1523
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:07,600
Friends,

1524
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,140
that may be so,

1525
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,160
but we're not going

1526
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:10,820
to give our money

1527
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,540
to this station

1528
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,620
because you don't want

1529
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,460
a stupid preacher.

1530
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,240
Friends,

1531
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,380
we gave our lives

1532
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,440
to this station,

1533
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:17,820
the least,

1534
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,080
and think of the hours

1535
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:19,820
we've put in.

1536
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,680
You know,

1537
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,820
Dave has to drive here

1538
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,380
from Ashtabula?

1539
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,080
Wisconsin.

1540
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,180
Wisconsin?

1541
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:26,580
Ashtabula,

1542
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,860
Wisconsin is not

1543
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,600
exactly over the border,

1544
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,440
Cuyahoga border.

1545
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:30,760
You know what I'm saying?

1546
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,180
That's right.

1547
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:31,680
That's right,

1548
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,080
my friend.

1549
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:32,560
So,

1550
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,360
why don't you,

1551
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,640
can you not give

1552
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,220
Reverend Stan

1553
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,300
and Lonesome Cowboy Dave

1554
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,060
Princess Wee

1555
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:37,500
a little tip?

1556
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,220
Call up Princess Wee.

1557
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,260
You don't have to talk to me.

1558
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,440
You don't have to talk to Dave.

1559
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,760
You talk to her.

1560
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,560
And she's waiting

1561
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,600
by the phone right now.

1562
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,200
But Dr. Sinister's

1563
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:47,860
in there with her

1564
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,580
waiting for you to call.

1565
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:50,860
687-6900.

1566
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,900
Their knuckles are crossed.

1567
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:52,980
Their fingers are crossed.

1568
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:53,880
Their legs are crossed.

1569
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,720
Their eyes are crossed.

1570
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,140
They're just,

1571
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,180
we're hoping and praying.

1572
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,120
And in fact,

1573
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,500
we are having a vigil

1574
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,460
right at this moment

1575
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,860
out in the hallway.

1576
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,780
There are thousands

1577
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,760
of young people

1578
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:05,760
with,

1579
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,720
with candles.

1580
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,980
There are thousands

1581
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:08,780
of young people

1582
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,460
with candles.

1583
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,420
Look at them out there.

1584
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,380
Part of a quest.

1585
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:11,680
Some of them are saying

1586
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,760
the Holy Hosiery

1587
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,620
and others are just like

1588
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,780
singing to Hosanna

1589
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,700
and the other guys.

1590
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,460
And others are taking out

1591
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,200
their tiny little

1592
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,640
plastic swords

1593
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,740
that invert themselves

1594
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,520
as you think

1595
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,480
the wrong thoughts.

1596
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,680
And plenty of you

1597
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,600
tonight are thinking

1598
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,280
the wrong thoughts

1599
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,480
if you're not sending in

1600
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,780
your glass ashtray,

1601
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,660
coffee mug,

1602
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,340
black or white,

1603
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,660
2001 t-shirt,

1604
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,860
$15 minimum pledge.

1605
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,260
And that doesn't mean

1606
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:35,740
you're going to be

1607
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,100
thought of as a minimum person.

1608
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,500
So what if you're

1609
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,660
a show-off type horse

1610
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,980
who likes to send in

1611
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,100
$75 and gets a bunch

1612
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,100
of subgenius stuff

1613
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,060
plus a black hooded

1614
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,180
sweatshirt with a zip-up?

1615
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:47,760
I mean,

1616
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,420
this is not a sale here, man.

1617
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,860
We're not pitching goods.

1618
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,340
But you're helping

1619
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,020
to support

1620
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,980
a community institution

1621
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,340
which has more value

1622
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,920
than all the sweat

1623
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,660
and porous

1624
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,100
hooded bus seats

1625
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,560
driven sweatshirts

1626
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,220
in the rain

1627
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,140
you've never known.

1628
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,740
I'm out of here.

1629
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,100
I've got to lay down.

1630
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,520
In my walk.

1631
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:08,980
I know.

1632
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,900
Dave, in my walk.

1633
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,100
When I'm out in Cleveland

1634
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,020
and I'm walking

1635
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,060
and I'm seeing the people,

1636
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:15,780
they say to me,

1637
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,120
they say,

1638
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,700
I recognize your voice.

1639
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:17,960
Why?

1640
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,440
Are you that one of those

1641
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,840
lonesome cowboy Dave people?

1642
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,180
Why?

1643
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,860
Why I've been listening to you

1644
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,220
since I was in high school.

1645
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,760
Since pterodactyls

1646
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,720
walked around here.

1647
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,940
And of course,

1648
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,140
that's when I always want to say,

1649
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,480
well, we're still on.

1650
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,480
And friends,

1651
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,500
we are still on,

1652
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,100
but only,

1653
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,580
only because

1654
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,600
of the support

1655
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,660
of the listeners.

1656
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,100
And so far,

1657
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,300
to tell the honest truth,

1658
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,020
we've only had

1659
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,300
300 people called.

1660
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,540
We need more like

1661
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,900
3,000.

1662
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,280
3,000 is the goal.

1663
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,140
So let's keep

1664
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,540
those phones lit up, man.

1665
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:48,980
Jerry.

1666
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,700
Put Princess Wee

1667
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,760
and Dr. Sinister

1668
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,120
to work, baby.

1669
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,260
This little,

1670
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,180
this little small

1671
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,440
emotionally and physically,

1672
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,400
or not physically,

1673
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,300
but I suppose

1674
00:40:59,300 --> 00:40:59,880
that would be a problem.

1675
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,680
This small,

1676
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,760
emotionally handicraft child

1677
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,560
has been so abused

1678
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,400
over the years.

1679
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:05,740
He's been abused

1680
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,160
and yet,

1681
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,320
and still,

1682
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,180
if you just send

1683
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,400
a small pledge now,

1684
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,060
this there may be

1685
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:11,920
research done

1686
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,900
on how to clean out

1687
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,580
this little baby man's ears

1688
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,480
so he can hear cool music.

1689
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,740
Someone can tap

1690
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,340
a little thing on his skull

1691
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,520
so he can actually think

1692
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:20,980
when he hears

1693
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,860
interesting,

1694
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:22,420
interesting,

1695
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,060
interesting,

1696
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,160
interesting conversation.

1697
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:26,980
And when,

1698
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,620
what about the days

1699
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,020
when we go

1700
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,460
digging into the past?

1701
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,060
I mean,

1702
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,560
who does all this stuff?

1703
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,140
I don't.

1704
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:33,800
Who does this stuff?

1705
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,400
Rush Limbaugh.

1706
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,100
No.

1707
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:35,420
No.

1708
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,400
It's not him.

1709
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,420
It's WCSB.

1710
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,220
Home of lightning and sweat.

1711
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:42,760
Vinegar,

1712
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,120
pie,

1713
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:44,740
onions,

1714
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,520
and ointment.

1715
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,680
Your favorite things

1716
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,840
are right here

1717
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,880
where you're not.

1718
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,040
Unless you pledge now,

1719
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:52,500
of course.

1720
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,260
687-6900.

1721
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,380
687-6900.

1722
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,080
Get with the cool

1723
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,540
where it's happening scene, baby.

1724
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,560
You don't have to believe in Bob.

1725
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,160
You don't even have to be

1726
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,560
in the process of killing.

1727
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,540
Bob right now.

1728
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,300
Not exactly.

1729
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,360
You could be waiting

1730
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,040
for this show

1731
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,720
to get over with.

1732
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:10,920
Well,

1733
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,940
why don't you hurry it along

1734
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,420
by calling 687-6900-Price-Bob.

1735
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,260
Hey, look, Linda,

1736
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,860
take those rubber bands

1737
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,540
off your penis

1738
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,600
and get on down

1739
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,600
to the foam booth.

1740
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,220
That's right.

1741
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,080
And call us at 687-6900.

1742
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,560
It's got nothing to do

1743
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,100
with that money

1744
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:25,860
and it's got nothing

1745
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,520
to do with you.

1746
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,520
It could be worse.

1747
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,940
It could be a national

1748
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,580
public radio pledge driver

1749
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,380
or one of those channel.

1750
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,860
What is it?

1751
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,720
Pledge drive.

1752
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,360
Button goes.

1753
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,780
Something like this.

1754
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,500
Are we going to do that one now?

1755
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,460
Are you ready to do the NPR?

1756
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,760
I don't know how to do them

1757
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,220
because I haven't watched.

1758
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,000
You said we're going to do

1759
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,960
the NPR pledge guy.

1760
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,820
No, you can do that.

1761
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,700
I can't because I'm under contract.

1762
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:50,180
Okay.

1763
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,300
Well, you know,

1764
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,580
that was a really, really great

1765
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,460
recording of Yo-Yo Ma.

1766
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,760
I don't think I've ever heard

1767
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,000
anything like that in my life

1768
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,740
and it was recorded

1769
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,660
at the Massachusetts

1770
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,580
Institute of Technology

1771
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:04,900
Technological Basement.

1772
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,880
I can't do the NPR bit.

1773
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,280
That's pink.

1774
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,700
That's crap.

1775
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,120
That's pink crap

1776
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,380
and that's all you're going to hear

1777
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,980
if you don't support

1778
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,140
your college radio stations.

1779
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,320
by Smell-O-Smelt Bar

1780
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,560
of Georgetown University

1781
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,700
about how we're all growing

1782
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,940
a little fatter and smaller

1783
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,180
and bigger nowadays.

1784
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,180
That was quite a story

1785
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,900
and how about this one?

1786
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,420
Economic progress for me report.

1787
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,420
Well, as people make more money

1788
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,280
and most people make less money,

1789
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,340
the people making more money

1790
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,460
want to send their money

1791
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,680
to make less money

1792
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,280
for the people making more money.

1793
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:45,260
And we want you to spend your money

1794
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,980
in the wisest way possible.

1795
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:48,720
Money.

1796
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,240
Filthy lucre.

1797
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,400
What do you need it for?

1798
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,220
Well, actually,

1799
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,520
you need it for almost everything

1800
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,680
except true slack.

1801
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,280
pieces of fragments of lack.

1802
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,600
Actually, you probably do need it

1803
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,780
for true slack too,

1804
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,040
I'm afraid,

1805
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,340
in this world,

1806
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:02,960
in this flesh,

1807
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:03,720
in this devil.

1808
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,040
But you must support

1809
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:05,540
the station

1810
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,120
which has given you

1811
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,540
the little light shining

1812
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,740
for all these times.

1813
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,980
You don't run 89.3,

1814
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,800
everything's like nothing to you.

1815
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,480
You don't think about it.

1816
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:16,480
You reach down,

1817
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,140
you turn around,

1818
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,140
you listen to him.

1819
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,100
You don't say,

1820
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:19,620
hey man,

1821
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,680
where does it come from?

1822
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,020
In this money,

1823
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,140
where does it come from?

1824
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,760
Man, I've had one time

1825
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,160
the head of the Devo fan club

1826
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:28,760
said to me,

1827
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,520
Reverend Stang,

1828
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,620
did I ever tell you

1829
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,620
the first time I ever heard Devo

1830
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,020
that has changed my life

1831
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:34,940
was on the hour?

1832
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:37,100
And the person who runs

1833
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,980
the Firesign Theater fan club

1834
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:39,780
said, Reverend Stang,

1835
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,040
you know,

1836
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,680
I was just thinking about it.

1837
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:42,560
I hate you

1838
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,680
and think you're a jerk,

1839
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,140
but yet,

1840
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,920
it was your show

1841
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,640
was where I first,

1842
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:47,920
the only place I never would have heard

1843
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,000
of the Firesign Theater

1844
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:49,780
and that's the only thing

1845
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:50,700
keeps me alive now.

1846
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,020
And I'm alive because of you,

1847
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,200
Reverend Stang.

1848
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:54,520
Now friends,

1849
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,620
aren't you going to pay me

1850
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,420
for keeping those

1851
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:58,560
lame losers and jerks alive?

1852
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,460
One of them might be you.

1853
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,760
You might be one of the

1854
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,120
lame losers and jerks

1855
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:04,920
that you're not.

1856
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:05,960
Church of the Subgenius

1857
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,360
has helped keep going

1858
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,000
when times get rough.

1859
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,800
You with a golden eye

1860
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,680
might be one of the people

1861
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,860
to come down from the volcano.

1862
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,680
And a time for some payback, man.

1863
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:18,840
Do not throw flowers

1864
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,020
into the volcano.

1865
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,900
Send your checks for

1866
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:29,680
$50, $20, $25, $30, $40, $60, or $70

1867
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,400
to pledge for items.

1868
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,820
Rip it out.

1869
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,060
I can't.

1870
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:36,440
I can't.

1871
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,320
I can't.

1872
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,940
Whip it out.

1873
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,340
Now what happened

1874
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,480
in the olden days?

1875
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,440
Now the same thing

1876
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,340
is happening every day.

1877
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:44,260
Bob days and Bob days

1878
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,460
and K-N-O-N

1879
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,080
Oh, it's not K-N-O-N anymore.

1880
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:51,560
And W-C-S-B

1881
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,440
The Bob days

1882
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,880
and K-N-O-N

1883
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,780
The Bob days and W-C-S-B

1884
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,520
Today.

1885
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:02,540
Today.

1886
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:02,960
Today.

1887
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:03,280


1888
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:04,700
Bob, Bob, Bob.

1889
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,120
Bob, Bob, Bob.

1890
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,960
Bob loves you, friends.

1891
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,460
He loves you with the most perverse,

1892
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:13,860
juicy lashes.

1893
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,320
Bob, Bob, Bob.

1894
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:18,340
Bob, Bob, Bob.

1895
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:18,580
Bob.

1896
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,140
You must not fear.

1897
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:19,940
Fear is the mind killer.

1898
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:20,940
Fear is the little death

1899
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:21,620
which brings me.

1900
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,540
Mis amigos queridos,

1901
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,840
¿Qué quiere en su vida?

1902
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:27,940
¿Ripeza grande?

1903
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:28,840
Bob, Bob, Bob.

1904
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,200
Bob.

1905
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,580
¿Conoce usted a Bob Dobbs?

1906
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,260
It's a Bob.

1907
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:34,620
Well,

1908
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,080
after all.

1909
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,500
It's a Bob world.

1910
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,740
After all.

1911
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:41,920
It's a Bob world.

1912
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,660
There's the float right now

1913
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,220
and the children are singing

1914
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,020
to the giant Bob float.

1915
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,320
W-C-S-O-N

1916
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,400
Underneath of the giant Bob head float

1917
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,380
there's a huge W-C-S-B logo

1918
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,260
stating very clearly

1919
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,120
Fighting Corporate Radio

1920
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,380
since, um,

1921
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,620
what was this last week?

1922
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:03,520
Oh, is that what we're doing?

1923
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,900
Fighting Corporate Radio?

1924
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:05,880
We are the enemies

1925
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,620
of the Corporate Radio.

1926
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:08,920
No.

1927
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,740
We are the arms and legs

1928
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:11,420
of the people

1929
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:12,580
of the Corporate Radio.

1930
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:13,800
Of the pobresitos.

1931
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:15,560
Of the campesinos.

1932
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,840
Of the people who have been

1933
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,440
left without anything

1934
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,640
but their eardrums.

1935
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:20,660
Actually, you know,

1936
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,680
I was bitching about how

1937
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,280
we don't get paid for doing this

1938
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,420
and blah, blah, woof, woof.

1939
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,720
And somebody else said,

1940
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,760
oh, those Corporate Radio guys,

1941
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,440
they can't do what we do.

1942
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,500
And they've been Dr. Sinister

1943
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,140
that said that.

1944
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,780
They can't do what we do.

1945
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:35,860
They can't.

1946
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,580
They can't do what we do.

1947
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:38,480
What is it that we do

1948
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,940
that can or cannot be done?

1949
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:40,520
But friends,

1950
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:41,740
you can't hear it either

1951
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,360
unless the station is doing it.

1952
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:46,020
So call 687-6900

1953
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,560
in the 216 area code vicinity.

1954
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,900
Oblige point, but well made.

1955
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,760
Friends, there is passion

1956
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,400
left in this life.

1957
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:59,380
There is reason to crawl on

1958
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:03,660
up that endlessly steep hillside.

1959
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,760
There is reason to crawl on up that

1960
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,800
even though your fingernails

1961
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,680
are breaking off.

1962
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,660
Keep crawling and crawling

1963
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,060
and crawling and crawling

1964
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:10,060


1965
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:10,600
And we told the way

1966
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,640
to the post office.

1967
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:12,220
They're closed.

1968
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,780
But I didn't have a check

1969
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:15,460
in my hand.

1970
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,940
And I have the address.

1971
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:19,120
Mail the check or money order.

1972
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:19,820
That is after you.

1973
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:20,480
Pledge, of course,

1974
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,420
to WCSB

1975
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,540
slash CSU Foundation

1976
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,500
21, 21 Euclid Avenue,

1977
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,440
comma,

1978
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,700
MM number 209,

1979
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,740
Cleveland, Ohio,

1980
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:33,520
44115.

1981
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:34,740
Thank you.

1982
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:34,740


1983
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:34,740


1984
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:34,740


1985
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:34,740


1986
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:34,740


1987
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:34,740


1988
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:34,740


1989
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:34,740


1990
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:34,740


1991
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:34,740


1992
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:35,480
Take out your check

1993
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,220
to WCSB slash CSU Foundation.

1994
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,320
Call now.

1995
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,800
687-6900.

1996
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:46,340
What was that mailing address again, Dave?

1997
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,900
Oh, okay.

1998
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:51,580
Now you ask me the mailing address again.

1999
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,740
Okay, the mailing address is

2000
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,960
WCSB slash CSU Foundation

2001
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,280
21, 21 Euclid Avenue,

2002
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,500
and I know it's a comma,

2003
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:04,600
MM number 209.

2004
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,340
You can use the number sign

2005
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:07,880
like on your phone

2006
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,820
or digital rectal dismember.

2007
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:10,840
Cleveland, Ohio.

2008
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,900
Cleveland, Ohio, 44115.

2009
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,220
And don't forget to make out your checks

2010
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,600
to WCSB slash CSU Foundation.

2011
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,540
Don't be fooled, friends.

2012
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,140
It is not the foundation

2013
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:28,520
you are worried about.

2014
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,440
It is the people like Reverend Stang.

2015
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,040
Some say he may take your money

2016
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:34,740
and use it for your money.

2017
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:34,960
Others say he may use it

2018
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,980
for his bowling junkets.

2019
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,120
Others say he may use it

2020
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,600
for his strange Samoan headlock jokes.

2021
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,240
I think he will give it back

2022
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,720
to the coughing coffers

2023
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,640
of the paralyzed students

2024
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,740
here at beautiful WCSB.

2025
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,400
Yes, friends.

2026
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,660
Every week we must haul

2027
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,160
huge mounds and sacks

2028
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,480
and bowling ball trucks

2029
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:01,680
full of tapes and CDs

2030
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,940
up that mountain

2031
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,260
and edit them.

2032
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:04,720
We must do it.

2033
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:04,720


2034
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:04,720


2035
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:04,720


2036
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:04,720


2037
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:05,780
Long into the night

2038
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:07,320
with the crappiest equipment

2039
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,200
you ever saw.

2040
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,460
Little razor blades

2041
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,400
and scotch tape

2042
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,920
and Radio Shack cassette decks.

2043
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,500
And finally, finally,

2044
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,960
we bring it all up here.

2045
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,580
We have to climb the exterior

2046
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:18,820
of the building to get in.

2047
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:23,400
And we put the show on, finally.

2048
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,820
And friends, after that,

2049
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:27,920
after all of that,

2050
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,120
and don't we deserve something?

2051
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,480
Well, no, you say.

2052
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,160
No, it's a crappy show.

2053
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:34,720
No, we don't.

2054
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:34,960
We don't care.

2055
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:36,120
No one cares.

2056
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:37,140
Oh, but yes.

2057
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,560
You might as well just jump out.

2058
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:39,840
Oh, but they do care.

2059
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:40,560
What?

2060
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,380
They do care.

2061
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:41,660
They do?

2062
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,620
Yes, they've been sending money

2063
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:44,740
right and left.

2064
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,220
It's Princess We Are Doe.

2065
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,520
There are hordes and hordes

2066
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,780
of subgeniuses out there

2067
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:50,460
just calling.

2068
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:51,180
There are?

2069
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:51,780
Oh, the phones are just

2070
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,080
bouncing off the phone.

2071
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,200
The phones are bouncing

2072
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,280
off the phones, my friend.

2073
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,040
The phones are bouncing

2074
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:57,820
off the phones.

2075
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,800
There's so many phone calls

2076
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,340
coming in.

2077
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:01,880
Is the phone ringing now?

2078
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,880
I don't know why.

2079
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:04,440
Why, yes.

2080
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,080
Oh!

2081
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,740
Listen to those phones.

2082
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:07,720
But mostly they call

2083
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,860
and they want to have

2084
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:10,440
phone sex with

2085
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,900
Lonesome Cowboy Dave

2086
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,240
and on scenes like that.

2087
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:14,320
This is your chance, girls.

2088
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,520
Yes, yes, yes.

2089
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,040
So since he's on the phone now,

2090
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,780
if they call now,

2091
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,460
they can talk with Dave.

2092
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:22,900
Oh, Dave.

2093
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:24,800
But, you know.

2094
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:25,420
Oh, yay.

2095
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:27,220
Oh, yay.

2096
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:28,960
Oh, yay.

2097
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,140
Oh, yay.

2098
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:32,240
Oh, yay.

2099
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:33,780
Friends, where else

2100
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,420
can you find

2101
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:35,460
the oh, yay men?

2102
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:36,040
Oh, yay.

2103
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:36,280
Oh, yay.

2104
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,100
Where else can you hear

2105
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,460
tapes of Joe Offering?

2106
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,520
Where else can you hear

2107
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,780
Reverend Ivan Stank,

2108
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,700
Princess Weirdo,

2109
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:42,580
Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

2110
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,560
Dr. Sinister,

2111
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:44,500
and all the insane,

2112
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:45,660
crazy people

2113
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:46,660
at WCSB?

2114
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,080
Why, where else?

2115
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,000
Friends,

2116
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,240
call that number

2117
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,520
687-6900

2118
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,900
or else you'll end up

2119
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:56,620
listening to us

2120
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:57,160
sounding like

2121
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,900
regular DJs

2122
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,100
for hours at a time

2123
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,300
in between all the commercials.

2124
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:01,760
Yeah.

2125
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,080
Yeah.

2126
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:02,660
Yeah.

2127
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:02,940
Yeah.

2128
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:02,960
Yeah.

2129
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:03,020
Yeah.

2130
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:03,080
Yeah.

2131
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:03,200
Yeah.

2132
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:03,380
Yeah.

2133
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:03,380


2134
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:03,380


2135
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:03,380


2136
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:03,600
Yeah.

2137
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:03,660


2138
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:03,660


2139
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:03,660


2140
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:03,660


2141
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:03,660


2142
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:06,580
Yeah.

2143
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:09,020
3-7-4-9-0

2144
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:09,580
6900

2145
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:11,760
We are full grown

2146
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,220
We are grown up men

2147
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,000
We are all past

2148
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,520
The age of reasoning

2149
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,060
It is our mission

2150
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,620
It is our task

2151
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:26,720
It's obvious

2152
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,780
Yet you still ask

2153
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:33,720
We are going to save the universe

2154
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,400
We are going to save the universe

2155
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:34,400


2156
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:34,400


2157
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:34,400


2158
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:34,400


2159
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:34,400


2160
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:36,300
We are going to save the universe.

2161
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,940
We are going to save the universe.

2162
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:41,960
This time.

2163
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,920
Oh, yes, dear friends.

2164
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:45,360
That's right.

2165
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,840
We'll be saving the universe on this.

2166
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,060
This, like I say, it's one chance.

2167
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,880
The Swingin' Love Corpses want you to save the universe.

2168
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:57,580
Robert Anton Wilson, our special celebrity guest star, wants us to save the universe.

2169
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:01,060
And the Zombies for Bob here answering the phone want they desire.

2170
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:02,880
Ethan, what's a couple of days?

2171
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,000
He wants you to save the universe.

2172
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,620
First, can I say that you sound like you're on helium in these early recordings?

2173
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,720
Is it helium or is it nitrous oxide?

2174
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,500
Nitrous.

2175
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:10,840
No, no.

2176
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,200
It depended.

2177
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:13,760
I mean, some.

2178
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,700
That's laughing gas, isn't it?

2179
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:16,360
Or is it sleeping gas?

2180
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,240
Nitrous oxide is laughing gas.

2181
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:20,320
So do you laugh in a high chipmunk type voice?

2182
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,600
No, laughing gas makes you say.

2183
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:28,980
I really wish there was one soul per breath.

2184
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,980
But the helium makes you talk like a.

2185
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,040
Little funny chipmunk.

2186
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,700
Or like a radio DJ and friend.

2187
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:43,480
That's why you have to help support your community radio station.

2188
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:45,580
Such as this very one.

2189
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:46,460
Yes.

2190
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:49,580
I feel that coalescing of power.

2191
00:53:49,860 --> 00:54:00,360
I feel the hands and feet of the people of Cleveland closing in on me with their little shrimpy and god damn gigantic huge ass trays and checks.

2192
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:03,880
They are assembling outside with more money.

2193
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:04,460
Money I've ever.

2194
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:11,700
Oh, I believe we're going to make our 3000 goal in the next 25 seconds.

2195
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,800
Oh, the phone lines are free.

2196
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,940
So please call 216-687-6900.

2197
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,920
Call in tonight.

2198
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,080
This is a.

2199
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:27,880
We're reaching out to the females embracing the females of G9 tonight as much as we possibly can.

2200
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,120
Yes.

2201
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:33,040
I mean, it is so ironic.

2202
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:38,620
Because he these some of these false preachers can raise millions and millions of dollars.

2203
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:39,560
No problem there.

2204
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:43,100
Well, I tell you what I challenge you, Jim Swaggart.

2205
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,240
I challenge you, Jim Baker.

2206
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,480
I challenge you.

2207
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:47,620
Or I challenge you.

2208
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:48,860
You see this hand here.

2209
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,740
You see this hand in front of me.

2210
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,080
Mr. Jim Baker.

2211
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,840
This is called the claw.

2212
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:56,240
And it's got the power of dogs in it.

2213
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,320
And a power above.

2214
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:01,880
And I challenge you to show your ugly face here at this radio station and come forward.

2215
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:02,620
Go ahead.

2216
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,020
Come on.

2217
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:04,760
Come forward with all your millions.

2218
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,160
I'm ready to have a match without rules.

2219
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,500
No rules at all.

2220
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:10,920
One will survive.

2221
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:11,780
One only.

2222
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:14,180
One minister will leave the match still breathing.

2223
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:15,500
If one of you.

2224
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,400
One of you.

2225
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:19,680
Goody, goody preachers has the guts to show up.

2226
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:22,020
Yes.

2227
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,020
I'm sitting here drinking some Texas select beer.

2228
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:26,260
Beer.

2229
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,320
You hear that, Jimmy Swaggart?

2230
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,260
You don't drink beer.

2231
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:29,720
Oh, no.

2232
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,660
Or smoke on prop.

2233
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:33,000
Because you don't know the power of that.

2234
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:33,580
I'm going to show you the power of these herbs.

2235
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:36,740
I challenge any minister do-gooder out there to show up.

2236
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,600
All of you.

2237
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:42,980
With all your TV shows and all your bought-off politicians, your paid-off judges.

2238
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,440
Do any trick you want.

2239
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:45,240
But I got the claw.

2240
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,260
I got the power above.

2241
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,140
And the power of Texas select.

2242
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:52,020
And you, my friend listener, has the power to call 823-

2243
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,480
687-6900.

2244
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:58,420
I'm afraid we're going to have to tell them the real truth about this now, Stang.

2245
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:02,980
Their pledge goes to support the WCF.

2246
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:05,360
The WCSB slash CSU Foundation.

2247
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:10,320
Well, I was using some old Texas station pledge tapes.

2248
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:10,980
That's true.

2249
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:13,280
For a long time, I don't know if you read the Georgetown Quarterly or any of the other

2250
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,720
sinister type of ragazines from the Georgetown Beltway.

2251
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:27,440
But the CSB, WCSB slash CSU Foundation, has a long and sordid history of providing salaciously

2252
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:32,960
bizarre and unusual entertainment to a wide group of demographically-discriminating people.

2253
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:43,620
So far, we're on the requisite list of have-to and have-not-do-did-done things.

2254
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:51,240
It seems WCSB is not faltered in creating gigantic, huge, well, I don't want to go on

2255
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:55,520
describing them, but parts, new parts for the new brain.

2256
00:56:56,060 --> 00:57:01,800
If you pledge now, I suppose you may grow a new brain or part of a new brain.

2257
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:02,860
You may not.

2258
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:05,380
The idea is this, see?

2259
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:07,440
It's just as simple as all this.

2260
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:12,880
If you pledge now and you don't grow a new brain and tomorrow comes around, what are

2261
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:13,860
you going to do next?

2262
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:15,540
That's right, Charlie.

2263
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:16,660
What are you going to do next?

2264
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:22,320
And if, say, tomorrow you decide you didn't after you already did, you don't send your

2265
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:26,120
check to the foundation, maybe nothing's going to happen, see?

2266
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:26,860
But then maybe...

2267
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:28,560
I don't know.

2268
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:29,380
I don't know.

2269
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:32,840
I don't know.

2270
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:32,840


2271
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:32,840


2272
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:32,840


2273
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:33,320
That's why I'm here.

2274
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,400
I'm, I don't know.

2275
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:35,840
Oh, yes dear friends.

2276
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,420
Well, we're, uh, I, I, it looks like we've, uh, well, we've helped the stations some.

2277
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:47,480
We've, we've done what we can, and, uh, we've, can't do what we didn't, so.

2278
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,540
Got more donations than I did last year.

2279
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,980
Well, we try very hard, and I, I...

2280
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:56,040
I was threatening people with, like, physical violence.

2281
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,260
I was saying, this is a stick up.

2282
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,840
I'm pointing a gun at the microphone.

2283
00:57:58,920 --> 00:57:59,980
You've got to fork it over.

2284
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,820
Well, it doesn't even work if you point a gun at the dog's head.

2285
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:02,840


2286
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:05,300
They don't even care about the kitten.

2287
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:06,580
That's true.

2288
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:13,500
It's the abomination and the desolation of the pledge drive is what it is, man.

2289
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:16,940
If I were going to start my own country, the unit of currency we'd use would be the abomination.

2290
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,200
Well, it is in many...

2291
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,540
It currently is.

2292
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:22,880
It currently already is.

2293
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,480
It's abominable.

2294
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:25,600
No, no.

2295
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:26,980
But it's the real stuff.

2296
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,660
It's what we depend on.

2297
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:29,500
It's what you depend on.

2298
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:37,440
It's what you who listen here to the listless hour of slurred and some of the other fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

2299
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:45,540
Well, friends, we're going to thank you, those of you who called and pledged.

2300
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:50,580
And we know that you will actually mail that pledge in because we have faith.

2301
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,160
We have faith in you.

2302
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:58,340
And we know that you have faith in WCSB to continue to deliver you the finest and most weirdest.

2303
00:58:58,380 --> 00:58:58,780
And...

2304
00:58:58,780 --> 00:58:59,280
And...

2305
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,260
Extra sensory programming.

2306
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:05,840
Friends, J.R. Bob Dobbs loves you.

2307
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,660
Well, sort of in a general way.

2308
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,660
Actually, he doesn't care that much about you.

2309
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,600
And I don't really either personally.

2310
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,140
But...

2311
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:19,660
But in a general and sort of noble, altruistic way, we, everyone here at the station, thanks you.

2312
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:21,560
And we'll continue to do our best.

2313
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:22,640
And now...

2314
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,560
Uh...

2315
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,180
This.

2316
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:27,300
WCSB, Cleveland.

2317
00:59:59,380 --> 00:59:59,460
WCSB, Cleveland.

2318
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:29,280
WCSB, Cleveland.

2319
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:31,940
WCSB, Cleveland.

2320
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:31,940


2321
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:32,020
WCSB, Cleveland.

2322
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:32,020


2323
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:32,020


2324
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:32,020


2325
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:32,020


2326
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:32,020


2327
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:32,020


2328
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:33,440
The project was finished.

2329
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,680
The ship would hold 20.

2330
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:37,220
The power source was anything a crew would think was funny.

2331
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,720
We didn't need the slack list.

2332
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,280
They're hapless.

2333
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,860
Our moves proved its worth in escaping the stark fist.

2334
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:45,080
On our way to Planet X for sex that wrecks necks.

2335
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:47,660
A prairie squid and every pot of money shot a coney twat.

2336
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,500
It's an all-hoss hour of bonanza.

2337
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:52,080
It's like a world without Tony Danza.

2338
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,700
Or fans of the pink shit that hits the charts in a world of dead art.

2339
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,900
Simultaneous lobotomy and sodomy

2340
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,020
We take a moment and we pause to reflect

2341
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:02,760
On the pinks that we killed and the planet that they wrecked

2342
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:05,340
Then we laugh like banshees and howl like comanches

2343
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:08,100
Do a victory dance in our underoos and panties

2344
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:09,780
Our fantasy is a reality

2345
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:13,260
Earth's a tarnished dust, it's Planet X, you're bust for us

2346
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:14,500
Bob Piper's list

2347
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:15,660
Space and time shift

2348
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:18,480
The cause is a slack rift

2349
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,640
A dimensional split

2350
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,440
Severs for levers of geni from pink shit

2351
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,320
Locked in a circle and steadily exhaled in the smoke

2352
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,400
I can see why the pink boys failed

2353
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,900
To pay a naze has caused destruction

2354
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,480
Second hole of slackless suction

2355
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:36,060
Hey, per view, alien abduction

2356
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:38,560
Functioning on soulless slack

2357
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,900
The money should be painted black

2358
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:43,520
The mate from space that stole your balls

2359
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,980
Will soon come back and take it all

2360
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:48,620
Return to slack, return to Bob

2361
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:51,240
Repent, slack off, and quit your job

2362
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,080
Or slurp the beastly knob

2363
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:53,420
Come on, come on, come on, come on

2364
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:53,880
You can't breathe

2365
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,420
He licked the throbbing vein of slavery

2366
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:59,000
Now you're sleeping like a baby

2367
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,580
But Bob woke me up and said

2368
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:01,360
Get out of Dodge

2369
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:04,000
There's a guy who's dicking top with a UFO in his garage

2370
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,500
I ate some bad ham and I got really sick

2371
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:09,160
And in a puddle of my puke where the puke was most sick

2372
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,560
A mouse did appear and it beckoned me near

2373
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:14,140
And it whispered the following words into my ear

2374
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:16,880
It said, kill the pink boys, quit your job

2375
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,400
Mock the world and praise Bob Dobbs

2376
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,660
You'll build a ship and take a trip

2377
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:27,500
It's a pre-react

2378
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,880
Go on, go get a pen, write the coordinates

2379
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:32,800
Six and a half months, hold up alone

2380
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,320
Circuit boards, duct tape, and turkey bones

2381
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,880
The ship appeared more than disaster prone

2382
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,760
But the vomit the crew would think was funny

2383
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,780
We didn't need the slack list, they're hapless

2384
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:43,140
The ship would hold twenty

2385
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:45,700
The power source was anything the crew would think was funny

2386
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:47,720
We didn't need the slack list, they're hapless

2387
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:50,260
Our month proved its worth in escaping the star fist

2388
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:53,400
On our way to planet X for sex that wrecks me with a bang

2389
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,060
Next, a prairie squid and every pot of money shot a coney twang

2390
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:58,000
It's an all-hoss hour of bonanza

2391
01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:00,580
It's like a world without Tony Danza

2392
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:02,820
We're fans of the pink shit that hates the charts

2393
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:06,360
And a world of dead art, simultaneous lobotomy and sodomy

2394
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,500
We take a moment and we pause to reflect

2395
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:11,240
On the pinks that we killed and the planet that they wrecked

2396
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:13,800
Then we laugh like banshees and howl like comanches

2397
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,560
Do a victory dance in our underoos and panties

2398
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,280
Our fantasy is a reality

2399
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,600
Earth turns to dust, it's planet X or bus struts

2400
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,300
And help the planet X

2401
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:43,680
Embrace the aging blood that flows in your veins

2402
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:48,740
And let the frog pipe clouds breathe slack into your brain

2403
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:53,380
C'mon! Control what's left of you

2404
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:54,280
of your brain

2405
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:57,000
Oh yes, and all your money

2406
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,020
to the Reverend Einstein

2407
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:20,940
to the Saint

2408
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,280
Embracing the one that flows in your veins

2409
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:25,640
from the crowd by the clouds

2410
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,480
rings slack like Ray Lippop

2411
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:28,720
control of sense

2412
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:30,880
Oh yes, and all your money

2413
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:31,900
to the Reverend Einstein

2414
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:44,380
Embracing the one
