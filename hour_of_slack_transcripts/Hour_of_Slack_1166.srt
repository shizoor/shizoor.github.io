00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
This is a radio alert. We interrupt our normal programs as requested by the United States

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,840
government. Normal broadcasting will now be discontinued for an indefinite period.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:17,960
Discontinued information will be broadcast in most areas at 12 p.m. on your regular radio receiver.

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:24,920
All residents will receive official bulletins on your radio receiver, while the residents tune to

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:32,200
12 p.m. on your radio receiver. I repeat, official information will be discontinued in most areas

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,660
on your regular radio receiver.

7
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,720
The Self-Genius Hour of Squatch

8
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,200
Nothing is real.

9
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,900
It is day two.

10
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,420
Day two of our broadcasting project here at beautiful Brushwood.

11
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,800
Recording. Everything's going fine.

12
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:16,320
Very well, ladies and gentlemen, now I know you don't want to miss one minute of this incisive and all-inclusive broadcast.

13
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,340
Here are the wonders of the ages, explicated in exhaustive detail.

14
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,780
A curative...

15
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,800
for the mind.

16
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,020
A tonic...

17
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,920
for body and spirit.

18
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,060
Helps the men with those difficulties in the bedroom.

19
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,760
And ladies, you'll feel young just listening.

20
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:45,840
But step up and pay close attention to the magical and remarkable nostrums of the theater of air and darkness.

21
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:52,200
Now showing, brought to you by the Brushwood Folklore Center, the Church of the Subgenius,

22
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,860
and with the vocal talents of...

23
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,160
Ivan Stang, Sacred Scribe.

24
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,280
We are here broadcasting before you, and a lot is on the docket today.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,100
Not only reading off the now psychotically filled in gorilla and demon sheets,

26
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:21,240
but other important aspects of the broadcast bound to be recapitulated in future radio voyages.

27
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,000
Indeed.

28
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,740
Indeed.

29
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:23,760
Indeed.

30
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,020


31
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:24,620


32
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:24,880
Indeed.

33
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:24,900
Indeed.

34
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:24,900


35
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:24,900


36
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:24,900


37
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:24,900


38
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:24,900


39
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:24,900


40
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:24,900


41
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:24,900


42
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:24,900


43
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:24,900


44
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:24,900


45
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:24,900


46
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:24,900


47
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:24,900


48
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:24,900


49
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,080
Indeed.

50
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,760
Indeed.

51
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,000
Indeed.

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,900
Indeed.

53
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:54,900


54
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:54,900


55
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:54,900


56
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:54,900


57
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:54,900


58
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:54,900


59
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:54,900


60
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:54,900


61
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:54,900


62
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:54,900


63
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,300
Westboro Baptist Church is in hell.

64
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,840
Tormented in flames.

65
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,260
Deal with it.

66
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,240
Riding and screaming.

67
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,520
Loud mouth.

68
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,960
Westboro Baptist Church is doomed.

69
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,020
The obscene.

70
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,760
Filthy.

71
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,420
Westboro Baptist Church.

72
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,000
Filthy.

73
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:11,940
Scrambled.

74
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,860
Perverts.

75
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,720
Come, come, and come now.

76
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,900
I had nothing but disdain for Westboro Baptist Church.

77
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,780
Profane.

78
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,540
Loud mouth.

79
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,000
Westboro Baptist Church is doomed.

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,140
Doomed.

81
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,780
Doomed.

82
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:24,760
Doomed.

83
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,780
We will face.

84
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,520
Doomed.

85
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:28,840
No slack.

86
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,540
This is a dynamic equilibrium.

87
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,920
It's been going on for many years.

88
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,320
We are habituated to every feature of the cycle.

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,020
As long and complex as it might appear to outsiders,

90
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,500
it's really simplicity in itself.

91
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,100
Slack is generated and slack collectors suck it up.

92
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:52,980
For...

93
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:53,980
Nutrition.

94
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:59,500
And for building the edifice of eternity, which is Bob's holy temple.

95
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,980
I think you're gonna like this.

96
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,340
Bob.

97
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,480
Starring Bob Cumming.

98
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,340
Eileen, honey.

99
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,140
Oh, Bob.

100
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,260
Bob, you must have thought you had something.

101
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,000
I did.

102
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,940
I had the two girls.

103
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,620
Oh, I'm sorry to hear it, Bob.

104
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,940
I was hoping to represent you.

105
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,000
Tap, tap, tap.

106
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,000


107
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,800
Do-vados.

108
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:31,880
Tap, tap.

109
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,920
Stop the heat.

110
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,260
Ranad Нация.

111
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,420
Rinhao, could you end this thing for me, please?

112
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:46,460


113
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:46,460


114
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:46,460


115
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,820
Ha, ha, ha, ha, hush!

116
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,740
maybe this night.

117
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:52,980
Aargh.

118
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,640
Ha!

119
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:52,980
Stop!

120
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,000


121
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,700
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

122
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,260
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

123
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,580
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

124
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,460
Hee hee!

125
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,220
Hoo hoo!

126
00:04:59,320 --> 00:04:59,920
Hoo hoo hoo!

127
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,100
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

128
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,280
Bobby, Bobby, open Bobby!

129
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:01,580
Ha ha ha ha!

130
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,460
Tap, tap, tap, tap!

131
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,140
Look, Bob!

132
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,100
I had Bob and his bobble inks!

133
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,380
Three gorgeous girls, all beauty contest winners!

134
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,120
Bob's idea!

135
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,200
Pecker, pecker!

136
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,260
Pecker? Pecker?

137
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,620
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

138
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,740
Bob! Bob!

139
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,560
Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob!

140
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,100
Oh, Bobby!

141
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,540
Bob!

142
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,980
Oh, Bob, that was just beautiful!

143
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,600
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

144
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,100
Oh, just great, Bob!

145
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,580
What do you want to do next, Bob?

146
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,320
I'm going to Bob a' links!

147
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,800
But meanwhile, here we are back again,

148
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,460
in the bosom of Bob at Brushwood,

149
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,220
awaiting 7 a.m. tomorrow.

150
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,200
And how best to wait?

151
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,380
You know, there's so many approaches to that.

152
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,960
Some people say,

153
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,640
well, I'll let my faith keep me up all night,

154
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,520
and I'll be ready at 7.

155
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,880
Those have been known to pass out at exactly 5 minutes to 7.

156
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,320
I've got video to prove it.

157
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,520
So you'd recommend being tanned, rested, and ready for the sloth?

158
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,440
Well, everybody has a different way of doing it.

159
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,460
Some people drink all night,

160
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,600
so that by, or drug themselves on something.

161
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,160
Berries that they pick out in the woods,

162
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,380
or whatever crap off of cow patties.

163
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,820
Little grasshoppers, they'll get you off.

164
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,120
Dried June bugs, packed up your exit wound, that'll get you.

165
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,160
Anyway, personally for me, being, uh, uh,

166
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,100
ancient and wizened,

167
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,320
I always try to get a good night's sleep,

168
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,780
and get up and even take a shower.

169
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,360
Because, you know, you don't want to present a bad impression

170
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,940
to godlike alien creatures.

171
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,840
And you don't know how long it is before you'll get your next one.

172
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:38,600
Right.

173
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,240
You don't know how long it's going to be before you'll have a body again,

174
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,440
to clean.

175
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,280
Body odor.

176
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,840
Body odor.

177
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,260
Now, here we go.

178
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,620
Okay, good. Um, okay, good.

179
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,760
Um, you don't have to have all the answers.

180
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,280
And you certainly don't have to have all the answers.

181
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,080
Um, um, it-

182
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,000
We got a problem here, Bob smells all the time.

183
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,700
Yeah, yeah. Um-

184
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,660
Oh, bad is not helpful.

185
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,560
Body odor.

186
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,440
Yes, yes. I don't like it.

187
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,820
Well, he smells. Okay, thanks.

188
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,080
Um, we are talking about another employee behind closed doors.

189
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,940
Um, you can be utopian as you want to be,

190
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,240
and you can be used, um, for nefarious purposes.

191
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,180
Um, right. Now, look. No.

192
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,180
Some of you guys, I don't know, it's going to be rough.

193
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,960
You're going to have to make do with some of the squamous aliens

194
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,560
that pass themselves off as sex goddesses.

195
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,440
But as Hal was saying last night, their pheromones are so strong, you won't care.

196
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,660
That's right.

197
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,880
They touched upon that in that movie Galaxy Quest.

198
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,840
The actor playing the actor who plays the Bones character

199
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,860
fell in love with an alien woman on that, and when he-

200
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,360
when she lost control and started squirting tentacles up out of her body,

201
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,980
that turned him on even more.

202
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,320
He was the subgenius of that movie.

203
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,500
Who was it was saying- that told me? I think it was Doc Fropp.

204
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,480
He said, I like my coffee like I like my women.

205
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,440
Anally.

206
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,740
It was one I wasn't expecting.

207
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,880
Who goes there, friend or enema?

208
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,980
Chapter 2. 2.

209
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:38,300
Which on the seventh day Doc grew herb and breathed into his nostrils dust that surveyed the hip,

210
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,520
the narrow fmuhub. Good. That is it. That is it, you fmuhub.

211
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,580
Now thou mayest freely eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

212
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,020
Good. Meet Fowlier. Meet woman. Call them names.

213
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,400
Fowlier and this is now bone of my bones. And they were both homerfats.

214
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,220
The really good swag of the gods, of course, is the swag shack.

215
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,320
Swag shack.

216
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:01,700
Swag shack.

217
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,540
Yeah.

218
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:07,140
Run by the beautiful Nikki Death Chick Wilde.

219
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,560
She was married here at this stage one year ago.

220
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,560
You'll want to go up there and hang around and at least pretend you're going to-

221
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,100
You'll buy something so you can-

222
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,200
I did that already.

223
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,760
Oh, well. Well, but not everyone has.

224
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,140
Pretending is an important skill for subgeniuses.

225
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,700
You know, that's another thing.

226
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:35,660
There seems- a lot of the younger Bobby types seem to think that to be a good subgenius

227
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,780
you should run up to police officers with a joint in your mouth going,

228
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,180
Praise Bob, have you heard the good news?

229
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,560
Friends, those are the kind of subgeniuses that the rest of us are not.

230
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,700
Avoid and run away from.

231
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,440
We're not trying to save that cop.

232
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,740
Okay?

233
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,500
For one thing, he might already be a subgenius.

234
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,940
And running around assuming that a subgenius must be some nerd with a pipe in his mouth

235
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,640
and a Bob t-shirt, sure.

236
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,720
Anybody's got 30 bucks.

237
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,660
Let's face it.

238
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:15,520
As Onan put it, the best way to share the word is to make people think they've discovered

239
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,200
it themselves.

240
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:24,220
No one is saved harder than the pathetic drunk laying in the gutter who finds a pamphlet

241
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,260
washing up in that muddy stream bumping up against his nose.

242
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,520
Those are the ones who later-

243
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,800
Sure, he may be penniless then, but those are the ones who are saved by Bob.

244
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,240
They repent, get a job that they can later quit, and actually contribute.

245
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,860
Whereas, you know, if you-

246
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,500
Make your friends sit down, oh look at this video I just got from subgeniuses, it's great.

247
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,420
Well, you look like a religious fanatic.

248
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,140
Sure, we are religious fanatics.

249
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,180
We make the Jehovah's Witnesses look positively sane by comparison.

250
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,560
As well as anemic.

251
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,540
Right, but there's no hurry.

252
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,860
You know, slack comes first in the life of any initiate.

253
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,760
You can't cram your religion down their throat.

254
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,940
One thing I'll say for the Jehovah's Witnesses,

255
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,680
when you tell them you're not interested, they go away.

256
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,160
That's more than I can say for the Deanies.

257
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,640
Yes.

258
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,760
And some subgeniuses.

259
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,880
There's some where you just have to say,

260
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:31,260
dude, you're the other subgenius that is created by Jehovah to piss me off, so go away.

261
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,340
And they always think you're kidding.

262
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,300
Yes, these jolly subgeniuses will never be chap-fallen or discouraged.

263
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,680
They have too much positivity.

264
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,600
They have too much energy.

265
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,540
They haven't matriculated from the college of hard knocks.

266
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,120
But what Ivan Stang says is perfectly true.

267
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:56,200
What is easier, to learn how to get somewhere, to be driven there or to drive yourself?

268
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,260
It makes all the difference.

269
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,540
If you take yourself to Bob, you will know how to get there.

270
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:08,020
But somebody else, helpfully, trying to take you there, will not do you that much of a favor.

271
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,940
At any rate, the time for all of this is rapidly dwindling.

272
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:21,680
As we approach that cosmic singularity, x second of x minute of x hour of x day.

273
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:27,440
Everything's gone by so fast, but there it is, tomorrow.

274
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,700
Now, not all of you will be there at 7 a.m.

275
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:39,060
I know from experience, there are always so many whose faith is strong, but their exhaustion is egregious.

276
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,920
The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.

277
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,100
And we're not going to be there.

278
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:51,900
And we don't need the affidavits of all the doubting Thomases who claim that, you know, like they will deny on the time.

279
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,680
The time that comes, the proof is in the pudding.

280
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,820
If we see your face there, then we'll know you meant it.

281
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:08,560
Now, believe me, we get bitched out about that 7 o'clock a.m. time, as if we had anything to do with it here on measly little earth farm one.

282
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,860
That's like getting mad at a farmer's carrot.

283
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,580
Because the farmer has to get up early to plow.

284
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:24,980
To the excess, we're nothing but the way you and I look at mildew on our kitchen tile.

285
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,000
Something that's eventually we're going to have to clean up when it gets bad enough.

286
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,620
Except for Bob.

287
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:37,180
Bob is the one thing saying, no, this sample, take a sample of this mildew.

288
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,060
Take you a good whiff of it.

289
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,340
There's some anguish built up.

290
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,120
These life forms have consciousness.

291
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,140
They have emotions that are stored up in their bodies like batteries.

292
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,440
From PR News in Washington, I'm Benign or Malignant.

293
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:57,040
On Wall Street 1662313, President Bush says PR is bad.

294
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,880
The city's police chief says this is PR News.

295
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,360
A copy of the world without Bob would be imperfect indeed.

296
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:10,140
So we're hopefully we'll be heading off for the spaceships tomorrow.

297
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
But as we go.

298
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,280
We know the important Bob's most important lesson.

299
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,940
The lesson of X Day is X Day could happen any second.

300
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,740
We don't know what year this is.

301
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,620
We don't even know what damn planet this is.

302
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:30,120
So we're we sort of now at this point, it's a bit arbitrary that we guess maybe this will be 98.

303
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,760
Maybe this really is what they thought of as July.

304
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:39,320
Some people, of course, subscribe to the upside down 1998 theory.

305
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,820
That Bob really meant 8661.

306
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:50,160
But I think that's just a coincidence that he accidentally wrote it upside down and then corrected it.

307
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:57,620
It's just that we've been cheated in so many ways that we don't really know much of anything.

308
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,800
And that's in a way that's a blessing because that makes us a little bit more like Bob himself.

309
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,140
We shouldn't yearn for it though until we're really ready to accept it.

310
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,160
I have heard.

311
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:09,820
That.

312
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:23,120
That's that Bob spoke in a trance pronouncement that the exits are somewhat more inclined to land if the ladies take their shirts off.

313
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:28,720
That may be just some silly thing that somebody else came up with.

314
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,680
But you know, we can't take any risks.

315
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,520
This is a clothing optional campground.

316
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,040
Although we appreciate most of you keeping your drawers on.

317
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,800
Believe me.

318
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:39,300
Really.

319
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,300
You're so much better than the pagans that way.

320
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:52,460
I'm not sure the aliens are interested in rifling through your drawers, but they are estates and I'm sure responsive to the beautiful.

321
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:58,280
And the honesty they want to see honesty, you know, throw away that trust.

322
00:15:59,180 --> 00:15:59,800
Yes.

323
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,540
Forget that comb over.

324
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,380
Yes.

325
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,060
We come from.

326
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,340
We're not going to talk.

327
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,440
We come from.

328
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,780
We're not going to talk.

329
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,940
We're not going to talk.

330
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,740
We believe.

331
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,400
Ex.

332
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,060
State.

333
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,360
There will be.

334
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,480
A mass horizon.

335
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,540
There will be.

336
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,000
A mass horizon.

337
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:16,940
A mass horizon.

338
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,320
We believe.

339
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:19,980
Ex.

340
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:20,640
State.

341
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,140
We're not going to talk.

342
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,600
We believe.

343
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:22,860
Ex.

344
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,060
State.

345
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:23,420
Ex.

346
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:23,660
State.

347
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:23,880
Ex.

348
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,600
Well, this is this.

349
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,540
Look at this field of faces.

350
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,600
This is one of the biggest.

351
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,080
Turnouts we've had.

352
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:30,500
Dr.

353
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:30,760
How.

354
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,340
Well, as we approach that special hour, I'm sure.

355
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,120
Miss.

356
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,560
Givings and other strange emotional.

357
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:38,920
Misfortunes.

358
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,580
Jags drive people to the shelter here

359
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,260
before the stage

360
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,120
as we await the descent of the great

361
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,740
shining silver humming ships.

362
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,540
There will be noisy bands

363
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,740
all night long tonight, I'm afraid.

364
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,180
The bangety slam music.

365
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,940
All of the ones listed in the program book

366
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,400
are here and will be here.

367
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,380
We may have to, one member of Mike Bison,

368
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,880
we may have to tie up and allow,

369
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,800
just to let him close enough

370
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,360
to whatever his instrument is.

371
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,600
And then towed him away immediately after that.

372
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,860
But that's what we did and it worked.

373
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,540
Speaking of noisy bands, here, live at X-Day,

374
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,400
from Ann Arbor, the Versificators.

375
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,720
Another thing around our town that seems to be

376
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,240
this myth going around that there's a

377
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,380
pedestrian crossing.

378
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,260
It's called the pedestrian right of way law.

379
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,280
And people just walk out into the middle of the street

380
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,320
with children in tow on cell phones

381
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,220
as if I love them or something.

382
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,760
And I don't.

383
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,760
I've written songs about how much I hate them

384
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,400
and here's another one.

385
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,740
It's called the right of way to piss me off.

386
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,740
I can't believe what an honor it is

387
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,220
to live life of you and your kids in confidence

388
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,460
raised by self-esteem,

389
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,440
flying crossing and a gold medal.

390
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,500
Must be a genius that's been down there

391
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,120
picking you all up for a cross.

392
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,520
My God.

393
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,120
.

394
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,440
Yeah, I found a gas in most underground.

395
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,500
Doesn't teach you unless you find more in the back.

396
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,440
Here's this guy, make him leave in a minute.

397
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,920
Pest ridden right of way law.

398
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,900
Doesn't miss so much.

399
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,480
Coming from the highway in the north south.

400
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,360
Since you own milk, you own jail in the town.

401
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,300
And I saw you coming from a mine law.

402
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,240
And that's right of way, home far and peace.

403
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:29,540
.

404
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:39,820
.

405
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,060
Hey, thanks.

406
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,000
.

407
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,540
The Versificators at X Day.

408
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,300
And they are at myspace.com slash versificators.

409
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,860
Before that, some collages by Nor Elpref and Leemar.

410
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,380
And now, a back to Hour of Slack live at Brushwood July 4th

411
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,800
at the campground where no Space Brothers had as yet appeared.

412
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,920
But otherwise, everything seems to be just fine.

413
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,300
The, uh, I can't believe it's not

414
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:07,900
raining.

415
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,120
Wotan has smiled upon us.

416
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,660
As a matter of fact, yesterday it was pouring rain,

417
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,300
and the day before it poured rain until exactly the moment

418
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,720
when the X Day show was supposed to start, 2 o'clock.

419
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,180
At that moment, the sun shot out from behind the clouds,

420
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,100
and all the rain instantly dried up,

421
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,700
just like at the Miracle of Fatima.

422
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,960
Maybe you were high and didn't notice how miraculous it was,

423
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,340
but take my word for it.

424
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,060
It couldn't have happened naturally.

425
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,380
Almost nothing out here can happen naturally.

426
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,140
Uh, except for bears.

427
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,220
That's not a joke about the bears, by the way.

428
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,480
And I do suggest that you young people take your LSD or whatnot

429
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,360
and go for a long walk out in the woods, get lost,

430
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,480
and then remember what I said about the bears.

431
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,420
That's the way I always do it.

432
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,320
Oh, and the, uh,

433
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,140
the one instruction is don't run away,

434
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,980
because then they smell your fear.

435
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,460
You back away slowly.

436
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,400
Yeah, that's right.

437
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,640
Pretend you're a bear.

438
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,220
Give them...

439
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,380
Remember, kids, bears are really just like Yogi and Boo Boo.

440
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,800
They just want your picnic basket.

441
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,000
Unless they're brown bears, in which case they really want to hold your head in their jaws

442
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,300
and slowly bear you.

443
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,600
And they'll let you down until they hear a crack.

444
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,560
Yeah.

445
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,440
And that's... makes me hungry just thinking about it.

446
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:49,140
Well, our ancestors revered the giant cave bear, Ursus spelleus,

447
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,200
this huge brown bear,

448
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:56,840
which lived for thousands of years revered by, uh, primitive humans.

449
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:03,100
And who is to say that the world wasn't actually created for these large, intelligent bears,

450
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,220
who, uh, often died a natural death,

451
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,480
surrounded by their offspring and loved ones?

452
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:11,920
And...

453
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:19,640
Or, in other cases, were probably beheaded by the cave people who revered them so very much.

454
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,900
Well, they did, and they put shrines in caves,

455
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,360
giving the idea that, uh, primitive people lived in caves.

456
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,900
Maybe some of them did, but, uh,

457
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,080
there are ventilation and sanitation problems,

458
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,400
and mainly not enough caves.

459
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,200
But caves are a great place to live.

460
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,800
And a great place to store your sacred objects.

461
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,520
And that's why we find them there.

462
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,220
Yeah, so many wonderful things.

463
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,260
And skulls of cave bears and... and other things.

464
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,520
And primitive relics of earlier religious cycles.

465
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,980
And now at the pinnacle of all those years of evolution,

466
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:03,320
the Church of the Subgenius is ready for the ultimate sacrifice.

467
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,180
The ultimate expression of the Church.

468
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,440
The ultimate expression of religious sensibility.

469
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,100
The giving of everything.

470
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,640
The giving of everything physical and spiritual

471
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,400
in one ecstatic moment

472
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:21,300
as one boards the saucers of the sect goddesses.

473
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,080
Oh, you... were you just talking about the giving?

474
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:24,920
Yes.

475
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,060
I'm more interested in the taking myself.

476
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,700
The receiving. Well, you know, you get that.

477
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,420
I really like that expression.

478
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,720
You get that, don't you.

479
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:47,280
I like about offence the memory of something original.

480
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,340
Since it's so set.

481
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:55,800
Because the bloody thing is navel

482
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,680
It I like about it

483
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,820
Forget about everything else.

484
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,220
I'm aimed at that.

485
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:00,220


486
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:00,720
And 1 100 hamburger BC.

487
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:05,200
2 50.

488
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:14,320
in the world because he you know he can correct god dobbs dobbs says what are you talking about

489
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:22,280
forget that dobbs is a crazy sound of a bitch dobbs dobbs dobbs dobbs dobbs dobbs dobbs dobbs

490
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,660
dobbs dobbs dobbs so there's dobbs distorting the bible

491
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:40,940
say are there any questions out there now later on we're going to do an ask dr howell which is a

492
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:46,740
very formal way and you should think seriously about the kind of questions you can ask dr howell

493
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:54,760
because he is almost like an oracle like the oracle of delphi only he doesn't really he doesn't

494
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,560
know everything but he can see

495
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:56,640

say anything about your fellow subgeniuses and that's another problem come back okay tomorrow

502
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:48,820
morning 7 00 a.m we're lifted up we find ourselves in this pure pleasure zone where we can start

503
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:55,080
creating anything we want do we then create the biggest meanest spaceship so we can go kick dr

504
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,460
lakeham's ass and you know we have to be in a umpire at our school so we're gonna have to go to

505
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,240
his spaceship? Do we

506
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,480
go after our own subgenius

507
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:00,860
rivals?

508
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,580
My goodness,

509
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,840
that man came.

510
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,600
He really gets it.

511
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,900
Sheep. Sheep.

512
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,400
The sheep. Sheep.

513
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,280
That we really are sheep.

514
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,020
For sheep. Excellent piece.

515
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,760
Head, head. Reach out, reach out.

516
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,120
That we really are sheep.

517
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,340
Hey, Sting, where's

518
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:26,900
the entertainment?

519
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,260
You.

520
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,140
Dance.

521
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,040
I'm a Bobby.

522
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,400
I'm a Bobby. Where's the entertainment?

523
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,080
Where's my staff?

524
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,760
Thank you very much, Steve.

525
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,980
I'm sure we're not a participant.

526
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,320
No, I came here, come on.

527
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,340
Where's the party at? I came here because they said

528
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,680
there was going to be a Stag concert.

529
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,260
It is. Do, do, do, da, da, da.

530
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,380
Oh, a Sting?

531
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,360
I thought you said Sting, and I was like, please don't

532
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,300
say Sting.

533
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,140
It's a Stang

534
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:56,320
concert.

535
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,040
It's a Stang concert, okay?

536
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,580
It's not do, do, do, da, da, da.

537
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,100
There was actually a lot of do, do involved

538
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,920
in the Fat Freak show.

539
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,820
And, uh,

540
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,180
you were on.

541
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,600
That's what I like about that band.

542
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:09,820
Let's go.

543
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,100
Let's go.

544
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,040
Let's go.

545
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,080
Let's go.

546
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:13,800
Let's go.

547
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,040
Let's go.

548
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,040


549
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,040


550
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,580
Let's go.

551
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:17,840
Let's go.

552
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:17,840


553
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:19,580
Let's go.

554
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:20,920
Let's go.

555
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,300
Let's go.

556
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,720
Let's go.

557
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,420
Let's go.

558
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,840
Rock and soul

559
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,940
Rock and soul

560
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,000
Rock and soul

561
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,780
Rock and soul

562
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,360
Wow

563
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,980
Fat Free there from Brooklyn

564
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,480
Live at X Day 11

565
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,400
A studio version of that song

566
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,060
Rock and Sauce is at

567
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,580
MySpace.com

568
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,720
Slash Fat Free Music

569
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,980
Before that

570
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,600
Nor El Collage

571
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,060
And now after censoring

572
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,620
Some material about Sacred Goats

573
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,760
We continue with Hour of Slack

574
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,580
Live with

575
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,380
Dr. Howe

576
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,820
So now you know why a goat

577
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,260
And as far as the first question

578
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,120
About protecting one's anus

579
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,020
One must go to the animal kingdom

580
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,840
The bear

581
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,560
Inserts a plug

582
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,080
Called a tampion

583
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,920
When it hibernates to keep ants from getting in

584
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,620
And this is something that

585
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,000
You might consider also

586
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,280
You have some in your bag

587
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,920
Pisces has some tampions

588
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,940
Not a tampon

589
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,120
It's called a tampion with an I

590
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,780
It's a plug that the bear chews

591
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,940
Of tar from trees and other things

592
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,680
But humans can come up

593
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,080
With something more complicated

594
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,620
I'm sure

595
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,480
In fact friends

596
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,340
As Bob Prophecy says

597
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,860
Humans will wear

598
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,380
Broomsticks

599
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,040
In their butts

600
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,220
As plugs to replace Bob's dick

601
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,280
I guess you could say

602
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,560
And so remember

603
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,480
Even though the stock market

604
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,700
Is in pretty lousy shape right now

605
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,560
This is the time to invest

606
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,780
In cheap brittle broomsticks

607
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,200
You can look on the internet

608
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,660
And there are ads for

609
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,260
Jeweled butt plugs

610
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,640
With hearts and diamonds

611
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,440
And things on the end of them

612
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,760
So you know

613
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,780
Every time that

614
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,020
A subgenius cartoonist

615
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,720
Comes up with a silly satirical gag

616
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,900
That he thinks is just too absurd

617
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,920
And funny

618
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,820
And maybe this won't even work

619
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,860
Because it's too crazy

620
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,680
Somebody else

621
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:21,940
Makes money on it

622
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,720
Next day it's on Fox News

623
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,260
And somebody else

624
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,820
Is already making money off it

625
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,520
Look at those damn

626
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,700
Insight commercials

627
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,440
Cripes

628
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,700
That guy's going to prison

629
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,780
For 90 years

630
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,840
And his mom

631
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,920
But the ads are still on

632
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,960
When we finally do a Bob movie

633
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,840
We'll have to hire

634
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,440
That smiling Bob bitch

635
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,260
Hell yeah

636
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,560
Oh my God

637
00:30:59,560 --> 00:30:59,560


638
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,200
That is all

639
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:08,300
In our dalam

640
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,380
And we literally

641
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:13,420
Ch Cinüllt

642
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:13,420


643
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:13,420


644
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,620
Sing the finest intermittent.

645
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,920
Play for nuts.

646
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,660
Give it a hand.

647
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,040
Bob, Bob, Bob.

648
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,820
For it wants to off your family.

649
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,520
Makes you wonder what makes a man successful.

650
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,560
Brains?

651
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,220
Talent?

652
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,360
Maybe it's some other thing.

653
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,980
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

654
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,600
Lash of subgenius.

655
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,720
Well, you can't, you can't photograph J.R. Bob Dobbs

656
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,240
anymore.

657
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:49,180
It's been, I think 1967 or 68 was the last known period

658
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:53,060
when you could photograph Bob without it fogging your film

659
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,120
or erasing your videotape.

660
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,400
The Air Force is working on a new thing called ghost imaging,

661
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,400
which I can't explain how it works,

662
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,140
but I think what they're shooting for is to try to nail down

663
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,960
a picture of Bob again.

664
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,680
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

665
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,720
Not just any Bob.

666
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,080
Remember, friends, Bob is the most common name in the English language.

667
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:23,600
Every time you see the name like Bob's Liquors or Bob's Hamburgers,

668
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,280
it's not necessarily magic.

669
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,580
In the case of the ones near here, it is.

670
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,520
What's odd is that the Bob images are fogged on a disc

671
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,600
looking as if they were a piece of film,

672
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,740
which was similarly fogged.

673
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,400
Obviously.

674
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,540
Obviously, not all of us live up to all of the Ten Commandments

675
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:49,220
because one of the number one commandments was no comic books,

676
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,640
no pictures of Jesus,

677
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,600
no pictures of anything.

678
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,500
That's one of the Ten Commandments.

679
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,600
Graven images.

680
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,480
Yeah.

681
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:00,680
Yeah.

682
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,400
So how many people stick by that one?

683
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,040
Only the Muslims.

684
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,160
They'll kill you for making a Bob card.

685
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,060
They too are people of the book.

686
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,380
And I believe...

687
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:19,200
I believe that the so-called Islamofascists or whatever they are

688
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,780
will ultimately win.

689
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,880
They will prevail and we will lose.

690
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,660
Because they're dedicated and they care.

691
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,640
And we don't.

692
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,880
We don't care.

693
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,040
We just want entertainment.

694
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,180
And they're fanatics and they are motivated.

695
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,260
If only we could be similarly motivated.

696
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,640
I'm not trying to shoot myself in the foot here,

697
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,300
but frankly...

698
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,140
It only cost $25 to join Al-Qaeda.

699
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,900
And you get two little metal pins and three bumper stickers.

700
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,280
And they save their money in that cult too.

701
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:53,800
They...

702
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,360
If you requisition a car from Al-Qaeda,

703
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,620
you'd better use it only for Al-Qaeda business

704
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,760
and then give it back.

705
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,200
You know, if you get money for a hotel,

706
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:07,140
you have to give every penny back to Al-Qaeda

707
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,400
that you don't use in the name of Allah,

708
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,620
the All-Merciful, the Compassionate.

709
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,260
The Compassionate.

710
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,340
But we have expense accounts.

711
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,400
So who's going to win?

712
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:22,140
Our suicide bombers do not walk into convenience stores

713
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,540
wearing vests made of little bombs.

714
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,940
Our suicide bombers ride a motor scooter into Disneyland

715
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,120
with a small tactical nuke strapped to their back

716
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,420
and then pedal away as fast as they can.

717
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,560
Then there's also the slack bomb

718
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,120
from those little jack chicks.

719
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,800
Like subgenius pamphlets.

720
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:47,800
They perhaps do the most damage of all.

721
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,920
From the standpoint of the conspiracy.

722
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,220
The slack bomb.

723
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:53,820
Yeah.

724
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,560
Because that's really what they fear the most.

725
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,240
With slack, one isn't going to be a consumer.

726
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:03,480
With slack, you're deciding what you want to do

727
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,000
and then doing it.

728
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,440
That is what the pink most fears.

729
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,120
The moment of decision where it's like,

730
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,240
they have to make decisions.

731
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:12,240


732
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,260
They have to make their own choice

733
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,120
which channel they're going to watch.

734
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,200
Which job they're going to have.

735
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,080
These things drive them nuts.

736
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,480
If they really have to make the decision themselves.

737
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,000
As Magdalene said,

738
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,300
the subgenius first expects, waits for the miracle

739
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,240
and then gets off its butt.

740
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,580
But at least the subgenius knows what it wants.

741
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,800
You've noticed that we have never told anyone

742
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,080
what slack is.

743
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,220
Because it's going to be different for them.

744
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,120
It's going to be different for every one of you.

745
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,860
Some of you, it's a nice warm tampion

746
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,300
keeping those ants out.

747
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,300
And that's all you need.

748
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:53,280
To others, slack is an endless supply of cheap beer

749
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,920
and crappy TV shows.

750
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,800
No problem with that.

751
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,480
A lot of us are that sort of slackmeister.

752
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:06,620
Some people get slack by being anal compulsive workers

753
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,940
that never stop.

754
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,580
I don't think I've ever known Motomac there

755
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:12,480
and I've never seen him in my sleep.

756
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:16,720
And I'm usually only happy when I'm unhappy.

757
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,180
So, you know, we all have different ways.

758
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,240
Many of you are familiar with the writings

759
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,620
of assassinated Nen Master Nenslow.

760
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,260
Many people hate Nenslow because he's so blunt

761
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,120
and honest and he's always right.

762
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,240
And he is obnoxious and so forth.

763
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,080
But if somebody so many times,

764
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,720
I mean every week somebody goes,

765
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,340
well you're just a bitter old man.

766
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:42,560
What's the point of having slack?

767
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,520
And once a year or so Nenslow goes,

768
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,880
no, this is my slack.

769
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,580
Hating you is my slack, dumbass.

770
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,120
Slack, you don't go out and get slack.

771
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,240
The subgenius must have slack.

772
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,320
You already have the slack.

773
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,960
That's why you're the subgenius.

774
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,960
The trick is to not let the conspiracy distract you.

775
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,960
How many times have you looked at the news

776
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,100
and gone, oh my God, those poor people in China,

777
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,240
they're all dying in that earthquake.

778
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,780
Oh Jesus, there's horrible floods in Indiana.

779
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,120
Oh gosh, the show's going to be canceled.

780
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,340
You can't do anything about any of those things.

781
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,520
How much, what slack?

782
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,780
Now, if you happen to be near the flood,

783
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,100
you might gain slack going down there

784
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,080
and bravely throwing sandbags.

785
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,540
Until some muskrat burrows through

786
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,900
and destroys your slack once and for all.

787
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,520
In the end, Bob will always win.

788
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,260
Whether he comes as a muskrat in the night

789
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,060
or an unexpected rainstorm at Brushwood

790
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:50,240
that forces you into shelter with someone you didn't meet

791
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,740
and even though you're shy,

792
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,360
why, three hours later, you find yourself

793
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,460
having sex with that person.

794
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,040
You don't, that's what we call involuntary slack.

795
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,340
That moment when something happened,

796
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,340
you thought you were about to win the golden ring of slack.

797
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,320
You'd been working so hard

798
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,460
at that project or that thing

799
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:14,740
or that desired person of the whatever sex

800
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,640
and you're almost there

801
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,760
and suddenly the car wreck

802
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,080
or the rainstorm

803
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,540
or the bill comes in

804
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,100
or whatever.

805
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,720
You suddenly discover one of your nuts is missing.

806
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,640
Well, you never know

807
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,800
but that, what you think is a terrible disaster

808
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,540
may be what saves you and often is.

809
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,800
Because 24 hours later,

810
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,580
you're going, my God, I'm free.

811
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,600
My car is destroyed.

812
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,980
I can't go to work.

813
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,480
I lost that job.

814
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,020
I can do anything I want now.

815
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,640
And as we said, the worst thing that happens

816
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,200
when you repent and quit your job

817
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,500
is you get a better job.

818
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,740
Which is that much more fulfilling to quit

819
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,740
after having donated what you could out of it to the church.

820
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,760
And getting as many paper clips and staples

821
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,220
as you can walk away with.

822
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,480
I'm out of the country by the end of 2010.

823
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,940
But U.S. beach volleyball team member Misty May says

824
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,860
You know, try to find solutions.

825
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,200
A federal appeals court has thrown out federal judges.

826
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,200
Attorney General Michael Mukasey is urging Congress

827
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,400
to come up with new rules for PR news in Washington.

828
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,540
He wants Congress to set up rules for PR.

829
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:28,760
PR's bad.

830
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,580
Oh, the tawdry world of the conspiracy.

831
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,660
We must use its standards.

832
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,240
We must use its standards of measure even here

833
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,880
as we approach ultimate purification and absolution.

834
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,040
And now I see a question out there.

835
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,260
Well, first of all, when you have...

836
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,920
Space cottage cheese...

837
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,360
The very fabric of space cottage cheese

838
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,000
could be ripped, I suppose.

839
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,840
Cottage cheese is what we in America call

840
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,960
the ancient potation known as curds and whey.

841
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,620
You may remember, if you know your classics,

842
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,780
that a certain Miss Muffet was eating this

843
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,640
when frightened by a large spider.

844
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,320
Actually, there's an interesting story behind that

845
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,280
because her father,

846
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,280
Mr. Muffet,

847
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:41,800
was one of the earliest experts on spiders

848
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,500
in the 17th century.

849
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,040
But this has nothing to do with the particular problem.

850
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,600
The fact is the whey,

851
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,420
the runny parts of the cottage cheese,

852
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,580
is first drawn in by the gravitational anomaly

853
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,660
and then, and only then,

854
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,620
followed by the super compressed stream

855
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,580
of the solids of the cheese.

856
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,640
But it was only found out recently

857
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,360
that black holes, though they take in everything,

858
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,200
also squirt out enormous lances of energy

859
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:20,060
perpendicular to the plane of them.

860
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,180
And at the center of every galaxy,

861
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,600
there's a black hole.

862
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,740
And squirting out on either side

863
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,920
for an unthinkable distance

864
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,060
is a large plasma,

865
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,020
which in this case would be the very best

866
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,960
and most refined part of the cheese.

867
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,580
Goes in here, comes out there.

868
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,600
And perfectly preserved

869
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,620
in the nature's refrigerator of outer space.

870
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,780
I've noticed, Dr. Howell,

871
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,980
that a lot of sci-fi programs and books

872
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:59,280
seem to speculate that one could dive into a black hole

873
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,260
and come squirting out in some other,

874
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:04,560
especially scheduled time and place.

875
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,260
Well, you'll come out as cottage cheese, unfortunately.

876
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,440
It always seemed to me

877
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,000
that that would be a risky way of space travel.

878
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,640
Your feet might be together,

879
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,080
but your head will be pulped

880
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:22,160
because you'd have to go at a really fast rate.

881
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,120
I don't know.

882
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,460
There may be a solution to that.

883
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,540
I don't know the answer.

884
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,460
It seems a risky thing to me.

885
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,380
I wouldn't want to try it.

886
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,740
Now, speaking of which, friends, now,

887
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,860
7 a.m. comes tomorrow.

888
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,120
And, Price Bob, let's hope it's the day.

889
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,740
If you see your fellow subgeniuses

890
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,260
burst into flames, screaming,

891
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,460
don't get uptight.

892
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,360
And if you yourself start to feel the agonies of hell,

893
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,260
they seem to last forever.

894
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,740
This is, it's just your shell.

895
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,840
It's like changing shoes or something.

896
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,520
You don't need this old body.

897
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,740
Jim Jones explained it all in perfect detail.

898
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:06,680
Tis but a tent where takes his one day's rest

899
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,400
a sultan to the realm of death addressed.

900
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:13,760
The sultan rises and the dark farash strikes

901
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,500
and prepares it for another guest.

902
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,340
Dr. Howe talks real purty.

903
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,320
He's got a real purty mouth, don't he?

904
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:26,780
Yeah.

905
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,900
Polar bears are melting.

906
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,940
Polar bears are melting.

907
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,900
Polar bears are melting.

908
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,920
Polar bears are melting.

909
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,840
Polar bears are melting.

910
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,860
Polar bears are melting.

911
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,860
Polar bears are melting.

912
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,240
Polar bears are melting.

913
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,920
Polar bears are melting.

914
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,440
Polar bears are melting.

915
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,540
Polar bears are melting.

916
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,720
Polar bears are melting.

917
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:03,720


918
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:03,720


919
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,820
I didn't do it.

920
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,000
Lemur did it.

921
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,300
Yes, Dr. Holocaust.

922
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,240
That's not a bad question.

923
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:30,040
Did Bob buy the rights to the end of the world so that he could perpetually delay it?

924
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,300
Or was that it?

925
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,620
So...

926
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:37,500
Well, these are things for Bob to know and us to find out.

927
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:43,100
Well, why couldn't Bob be the ultimate tease and Connie be the ultimate cock tease?

928
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,320
That seems to fit somehow.

929
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:48,000
Bob plays in mysterious ways.

930
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,800
And it's all playful with Bob, as you should know.

931
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,060
One shouldn't get too serious about Bob.

932
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,760
Bob's grin says it all.

933
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,280
All the books, pamphlets, records...

934
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,440
writings, speeches, radio shows...

935
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:09,240
are nothing compared to just looking at that face where all the answers are.

936
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,660
And you must always think,

937
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,840
there but for the face of Bob go I.

938
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,880
Right, all the rest of it is just accessories.

939
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:23,020
You know, you don't buy the accessories first and then the Barbie.

940
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:26,600
Well, you do if you're a Bobby or a Barbie.

941
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,860
Right, as well as we've...

942
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,000
as I realized...

943
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:40,980
I'm reading the news all day reading alt slack, there are some people who can recite every inside joke and yet they never even knew there was an outer joke.

944
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,740
They come as consumers.

945
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,320
They know that the outside joke is them.

946
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,020
And they see it.

947
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:52,300
They see the punchline every morning in the mirror.

948
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:58,580
The few of them that actually look in a mirror, have that much concern about personal hygiene.

949
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,280
Those who come to Bob as consumers.

950
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,440
Consumers will be themselves consumed.

951
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:05,840
Manager tools.

952
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:06,340
Manager tools.

953
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:06,920
Manager tools.

954
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:07,340
Manager tools.

955
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:13,420
Body odor.

956
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:13,940
Body odor.

957
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:15,960
Well, body odor?

958
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,660
The fact is, we all smell body odor.

959
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:19,500
Giving feedback.

960
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,120
Body odor?

961
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:20,480
Yeah.

962
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:21,160
Oh, yeah.

963
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:21,920
Oh, yeah.

964
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:22,440
Oh, yeah.

965
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:22,840
Oh, yeah.

966
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,600
It is.

967
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:24,940
It is.

968
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,540
Yeah, totally.

969
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:29,880
Yeah.

970
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:30,220
Yeah.

971
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:30,340
Yeah.

972
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,140
Body odor.

973
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:38,860
I have a daughter who's now married and indeed is scheduled to whelp a new Uber baby in about

974
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:39,460
a month.

975
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,220
Praise Bob.

976
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:44,360
But in 1998, she was 16 years old.

977
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:49,320
And I brought my daughter here with her good-for-nothing Pobucker boyfriend.

978
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,380
He was scared to death.

979
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,240
He really didn't want to hang around.

980
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,660
But, you know, I was by the discipline.

981
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,140
The crowd was a little disappointed.

982
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,500
And you know how people are.

983
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,760
They blame poor Reverend Stang instead of Bob or whatnot.

984
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:11,740
I got stripped down naked by those three gorgeous redheads and thrown in the pond.

985
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:17,000
And my daughter did not gaze upon her father's nakedness.

986
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,580
And that probably saved us a lot of trouble.

987
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:20,980
Like what happened to Noah.

988
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,560
Yes, the daughters of Noah.

989
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:25,760
The daughters of Noah gazed upon his nakedness.

990
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,600
And he was having a nice dream, too, at the time.

991
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:28,980
Right.

992
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:29,180
Right.

993
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:33,360
They happened to walk in right when he was having a morning tent pole.

994
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:34,220
Yep.

995
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,300
And God punished them for seeing that.

996
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:40,500
Well, God has some problems, too, you know.

997
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:46,680
But Noah was doing pretty well for a guy more than 600 years old at the time.

998
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:49,140
He tried to save the dinosaurs.

999
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,560
Depending on which story you read.

1000
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:57,660
I don't know if it's been shown yet, but that cursed...

1001
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:58,520
Kurt...

1002
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:58,740
Kurt...

1003
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:04,940
A Kirsteiner film of Jack T. Chick interviews some of Chick's creepy friends.

1004
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,820
And one of them is a creationist who says,

1005
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:09,560
Oh, there were only about 30 dinosaurs anyway.

1006
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,280
And there was room for them all on the ark.

1007
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:15,220
This guy, I think, has been since popped for child molesting.

1008
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:16,420
John Todd?

1009
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:16,920
Yes.

1010
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:17,280
He died.

1011
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,280
Oh, he died?

1012
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:18,660
Yeah.

1013
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:19,680
Well, one of them...

1014
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,940
He never lived to see the film about his humiliation.

1015
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:25,600
Did he die while being popped for child molesting?

1016
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,120
Well, Dr. Dark was talking about showing that video.

1017
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,140
It's here, folks.

1018
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:39,760
If it rains again, we will strive to take that projector or something up to the studios,

1019
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:44,840
which is a nice big room next to the showers up there,

1020
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:49,340
which we are allowed to use, especially if it's raining,

1021
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:53,520
and we can all sit and watch the truth about those Jack T. Chick comics.

1022
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,540
I trust you know what we're talking about.

1023
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,880
The little Christian comics.

1024
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:01,840
From that great underground cartoonist, Jack T. Chick.

1025
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:02,440
Yeah.

1026
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,400
Self-published.

1027
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:07,040
He was infiltrated by a subgenius.

1028
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:07,940
Yay!

1029
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:15,660
And, in fact, has told Papa Joe Mama that he intends to do an anti-subgenius booklet

1030
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:21,380
once he's finished with his life's work, which is he's doing paintings of the Bible.

1031
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:22,460
Well, that's not him.

1032
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,060
Unfortunately, he's 95 years old.

1033
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,800
It's his friend, Fred Carter, who's doing those paintings.

1034
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,220
He's just supervising them.

1035
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:28,720
And he...

1036
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:28,720


1037
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:28,720


1038
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:34,120
He said he would pray on it and think about what he was going to say about the Church of the Subgenius.

1039
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:42,820
Fred Carter, yeah, he draws those two muscle-bound guys, the Crusaders,

1040
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,740
who have huge chins and they're always whipping off their shirts.

1041
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,600
He's the good artist of those comics.

1042
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,560
It's interesting.

1043
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:54,920
The Crusaders started off as a good slam-bang Christian comic series,

1044
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:58,560
and it turned into anti-Catholic rants where the pictures,

1045
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,900
got smaller and smaller, and the words got more and more,

1046
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:07,060
until finally there's just a little head floating somewhere on a huge page of text.

1047
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:13,240
But in the early versions of these comics, these two bozos, who look identical,

1048
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:18,060
except one's black and one's white, work in some kind of manufacturing plant,

1049
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:23,100
and they get the call that somewhere in Eastern Europe somebody needs Jesus.

1050
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,400
So they go to their boss and say,

1051
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,540
Well, Mr. Jones, we need somebody to help us.

1052
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:29,520
We need some time off for work.

1053
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,720
I think you know why.

1054
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,240
Well, you boys are good with the Lord, so you can go ahead.

1055
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:38,400
You understand I can't pay you for the time you're off.

1056
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:41,340
I can't give you your salary, but go ahead.

1057
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,460
But how are you going to get the airfare to go over there?

1058
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:48,140
Oh, we know a way, don't we?

1059
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:54,380
And they pray, Dear Jesus, please give us two tickets on the aisle, and so forth.

1060
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,040
And sure enough, at that moment,

1061
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:57,560
Sure enough, at that moment,

1062
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,520
some dotty old man, some dotty old man,

1063
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,280
some dotty old lady decides,

1064
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:02,840
I think I'll just donate air tickets to...

1065
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,140
And sure enough, there it comes.

1066
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,140
Boy, it works every time, doesn't it?

1067
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,620
Yep, Jesus always comes through. Praise Jesus.

1068
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:14,120
You know, that's the cooperation we're always waiting for from Bob.

1069
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,480
But Bob is not willing to be such a simpleton

1070
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:23,340
and answer such easily tendered prayers.

1071
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:28,400
You might think that what you want is a ticket to prove that Noah's Ark

1072
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:28,480
You might think that what you want is a ticket to prove that Noah's Ark

1073
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,400
exists or something.

1074
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,540
But Bob knows what you really want.

1075
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:33,980
And it's not that.

1076
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:38,260
Bob's waiting to give you what you really desire,

1077
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:41,140
but are concealing even from yourself.

1078
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,460
You pay to know what you really think.

1079
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:45,340
You pay.

1080
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:46,880
That sounds snarky.

1081
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:47,120
You pay.

1082
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,000
Like we're making fun of Scientologists.

1083
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:49,760
Oh, you pay, all right.

1084
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,780
But it's really true.

1085
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:51,580
Yeah.

1086
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,760
Pay through the nose.

1087
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,000
Speaking of Noah's Ark,

1088
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,500
I had a visit from some Jehovah's Witnesses,

1089
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:01,320
some dearly beloved Jehovah's Witnesses yesterday.

1090
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,860
The latest issue of The Watchtower is all about Noah's Ark.

1091
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,220
That's right.

1092
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:06,380
Yes, it is.

1093
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,440
I'm always polite to my fellow religious fanatics.

1094
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,680
Gets rid of them sooner.

1095
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,120
I did lie to them.

1096
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,760
But they were saying,

1097
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:18,420
I had to go.

1098
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:21,980
I really admire y'all's religion.

1099
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,440
I actually know a lot about Jehovah's Witnesses.

1100
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,220
I know your history.

1101
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,300
I admire your publishing outreach.

1102
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,840
And I didn't tell them that I had deliberately,

1103
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,160
very directly ripped off a lot of their graphics

1104
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,500
for subgenius purposes.

1105
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,240
I don't know if you all know the story of that.

1106
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,800
Perhaps there's not enough time to tell it here.

1107
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,120
But very swiftly, Kurt Kursteiner and I were riding on a bus,

1108
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:51,320
and we were just having fun, having an idle conversation.

1109
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:55,340
And somehow what we said offended the Jehovah's Witness

1110
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:58,380
who was sitting near us, which we found out when,

1111
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,460
he got up and flounced away,

1112
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:06,660
leaving behind his special copy of a heavy Jehovah's Witness book,

1113
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,380
which he'd been highlighting in yellow,

1114
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:15,200
which was full of delightful pictures of improbable monsters and so on.

1115
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:20,200
This book that he left on the bus because he was so offended by us

1116
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,020
and our subgenius dialogue,

1117
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:25,660
actually became the basis for Revelation X,

1118
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,280
the Bob Apocrypha.

1119
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,720
When my Jehovah's Witnesses were leaving,

1120
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,900
I had said, look, I really don't want you to,

1121
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:39,700
I'm busy and to tell the truth, I'm pretty much covered spiritually.

1122
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,420
I think they probably figured that meant I was Jewish or something.

1123
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:47,920
But I said, look, I'm behind any religion that doesn't want to kill everybody.

1124
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,040
And they high-fived me.

1125
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,360
But I lied, friends.

1126
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:58,100
I'm in one of the few religions that admits that it really does want to kill almost everybody.

1127
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,080
And something...

1128
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,980
But you know what?

1129
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:06,300
Every time you lie to a Jehovah's Witness,

1130
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,440
Bob comes in his pants.

1131
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:09,520
Every time.

1132
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:16,220
And those slack-fold drawers are pretty stiff as we approach X Day.

1133
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:17,180
That's right.

1134
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:24,580
Doesn't really bear too much thinking about.

1135
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,660

We always got something to do.

00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,420

Reverend Max Slack did that, Human Zoo.

1220
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:31,980
The Subgenius Zoo, however, with its books, DVDs, CDs, and 50,000 members and so forth,

1221
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:35,660
can be found at subgenius.com.

1222
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:41,160
This background music behind me right now is Calvin Ball, recorded live at X-Day,

1223
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:43,420
recording by Partner Nostril.

1224
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:51,200
And during the live hour of Slack shows, the music was by yours truly,

1225
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:55,140
Reverend Ivan Stang, some of it, plus some jams from Starwood,

1226
00:58:55,240 --> 00:59:00,220
some from Lamprey Systems, and Bob only knows what else.

1227
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:01,000
Praise Bob.

1228
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:05,120
Then the slaughter of the innocents actually took place,

1229
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:09,380

Yarr, yarr, yarr, yarr, yarr, yarr.

00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:21,120
Out by the hill and boozled mountains,

1232
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:22,460
the plans of yore.

1233
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,240
She plannixed her road to the big,

1234
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:25,780
the wide,

1235
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:26,580
from the shore.

1236
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:28,960
All that well, but no peace,

1237
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,440
just head and tall.

1238
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:31,860
Is she vulgenation?

1239
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:32,340
Popular,

1240
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:32,980
garrison?

1241
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:33,940
She is quite all,

1242
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:34,400
tall.
