1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
From PR News in Washington, I'm charged with assaulting suspected insurgents and 3,000 hits.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,400
Thousands of Jamaicans are ending the week at a long-time high next week.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,240
A baby that weighs 500 pounds, 3 ounces, has this report.

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,140
Wiggling, wiggling didn't fix things.

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,760
People just need to get used to this.

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,760
Less than 1% of babies weigh more than PR News in Washington.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,460
There is some pain involved in this procedure.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,360
Enjoy yourselves.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,720
Everybody at school was talking about it.

10
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,480
A surprise discovery.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,480
Marijuana.

12
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,440
Oh, my God.

13
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,900
A very special 7-Even.

14
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,900
You know, it's like a bad dream.

15
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,980
If you pray to God, I'll wake up and...

16
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,500
Why would anybody do such a thing?

17
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,040
Why?

18
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,640
Hey, how about that?

19
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,540
It's a little woozy.

20
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,560
I've never smoked one of those before.

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,400
Yeah, you're kidding me.

22
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,220
Maybe a few times.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,180
It's always the hard stuff.

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,760
Yeah, that's why.

25
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,480
That's why they call it a recreational drug.

26
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,840
All right, huh?

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,620
That's what we're doing here.

28
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,720
Just having a little recreation.

29
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,540
I know what you need.

30
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,600
One hit.

31
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,280
Just like a man.

32
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,160
I'll see you next time.

33
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,160


34
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,500
Bye-bye.

35
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:50,520
Bye-bye.

36
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,120
Bye-bye.

37
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,540
Bye-bye.

38
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,260
Bye-bye.

39
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:55,640
Bye-bye.

40
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,240
Bye-bye.

41
00:01:59,540 --> 00:01:59,980
Bye-bye.

42
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


43
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


44
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


45
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:26,600
Hello, my name is Gross Pearl, and I like to do a little bit of comedy once in a while about Brother Bob.

46
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:32,460
You've heard Bob speak, I got all the talent, but he got the looks.

47
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,660
Boy, I tell you, he's something else.

48
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,780
I'd like to tell you a joke about Brother Bob.

49
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,180
Bob is something else, I tell ya.

50
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,660
I get so embarrassed when I'm with Bob, it's terrible.

51
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,640
The other day Bob went down on the 200 pound bully.

52
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,600
Bob said, I gotta gain some weight.

53
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,120
Bob, we was at this gas station, and Bob got out.

54
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,780
Bob went across town the other day on the bus, and he's all-time.

55
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,580
Like I said, he's all-time.

56
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,420
He's just such an embarrassment to me.

57
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,920
So see, I'm telling you, he's just embarrassing me all the time.

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,180
Before I sign off, I'd like to sing a silly song to Brother Bob.

59
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:15,820
I love my Bob. I love my Bob. I love my Bob. Bob is all the world to me.

60
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,660
The time has come. Turn on to the live stream.

61
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,660
Tune in and drop off. Are you ready?

62
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,580
It's all part of a cosmic uncut.

63
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:35,360
Turn on, tune in, and drop out. Are you ready?

64
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,700
Man, you're talking about a war crime. I got one.

65
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,140
He said, how long would, on the average?

66
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,460
Well, do you have any diagrams?

67
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,400
I said, yes.

68
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,840
I said, I don't believe you.

69
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,420
I said, do you have the tension anus?

70
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,360
He said, yes.

71
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,920
I said, I don't believe you.

72
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,380
Do you have loop- 같i like muscles?

73
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,660
He said, yes.

74
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,140
Sure.

75
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,360
I said, I don't believe you.

76
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,080
I said, well. Do you have malt dystercit status?

77
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,760
He said, yes.

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,280
Right.

79
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:03,760
Right.

80
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,480
I said, I don't believe you.

81
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,620
I said, do you have d' who's male?

82
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,320
He said, yes.

83
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:06,880
True.

84
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,840
I said, I do

85
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,460
I said, do you have any психopedics can thrive?

86
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,240
He said, yes.

87
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,780
It just got cut off.

88
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,400
I said, right.

89
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,040
He said, I don't believe you.

90
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,760
I said, well, do you have any heart fluxes?

91
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,460
Sure.

92
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,500
He said, yes.

93
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,280
I said, you want to be normal for the rest of your life.

94
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,420
For the rest of your life.

95
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,380
Isn't that shocking?

96
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,000
That seems wrong.

97
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,840
You may know.

98
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,500
It's something that's difficult.

99
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,620
It was revealed.

100
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,680
I was homosexual, immoral, on drugs.

101
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,740
The worst kind of person.

102
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,640
Pingy-pangy, useless.

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,640
It's my own testimony of what I witnessed.

104
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,280
It's my own immorality, corruption.

105
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:51,040
I was on the rock man, down with an orchestra, in a very direct manner.

106
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,440
And what happened then?

107
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,040
Drugs followed that.

108
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,860
And all other spirits came enjoying such God.

109
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,940
The whole world enjoyed the rock music beat.

110
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,840
I first met George Bush in a tuna fish bath in Mendocino, California.

111
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,580
It was 1989.

112
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,060
He was taking the big cure.

113
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,340
He was a pill popper.

114
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,740
He was a pill popper like I was.

115
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,960
And I'll be for one thing and one thing only.

116
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,680
Scoopin' the lube, grippin' the shit, boop, doop.

117
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,880
I said, I've got no reason, my substance is a now baby.

118
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,840
The heart you see, but you're drivin' it, poor boy, crazy.

119
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,560
I said, I've got no reason, my substance is a now baby.

120
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,700
Because you kick him in the face, it's such a damn disgrace.

121
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,920
The way you run is like water.

122
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,120
I love it, I feel alive.

123
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,040
Stop abusing my substance abuser now, baby.

124
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:53,840
Hey!

125
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,100
Stop abusing my substance abuser now, baby.

126
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,020
Hey!

127
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,120
Because you kick him in the knee and then you say,

128
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,480
Oh please, I gotta do more of this murder, you whore.

129
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,280
You gotta...

130
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,960
Stop abusing my substance abuser now, baby.

131
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,360
This is one of those shows again.

132
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:31,380
And that was Lonesome Cowboy Dave and the Mondo Retardo Band

133
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:36,200
live at 8X Day Drill a few months back.

134
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,540
Before that, friends, there's some marvelous puzzling stuff

135
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,840
that happened in the show.

136
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,140
This is the opening of the Norel Pref collection,

137
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:59,240
which we heard just before Dave's song there.

138
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,360
Oh, and also there was a bit from Bill T. Miller,

139
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,540
OBE, out of band experience, the king of slack, you know.

140
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,260
And there'll be more of his classic.

141
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:10,540
And I think we'll have a good time.

142
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:10,540


143
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:10,540


144
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:10,540


145
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,140
And did I mention Norel?

146
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,460
Well, now there's some Norel.

147
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,280
Metal finish.

148
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,720
Okay, take this box.

149
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,400
Here, take it.

150
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,960
Prior to 1888.

151
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,800
There's the box.

152
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,600
Okay, I've got it.

153
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,800
Now put some gadgets in there.

154
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,380
All right.

155
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:51,740
Let's...

156
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,440
Load up this bucket of gadgets into that box.

157
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,380
Yeah, okay.

158
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,280
I can do that.

159
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,780
Okay, now the callers will be calling in expecting their gadgets any second, so...

160
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,740
A leather humidor?

161
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,860
Gadget universe keeps us in touch with all the gadgets we need.

162
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,040
Gadgets.

163
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,220
That's what I've been looking for.

164
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,640
Every kind of gadget that you're thinking of now...

165
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,000
Yeah.

166
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,900
...appears magically in gadget universe.

167
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,120
This one I didn't think of.

168
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:13,800
Wow!

169
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,440
I didn't think of that.

170
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,240
I thought of it, though.

171
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,020
But I wanted to.

172
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,820
I thought of it.

173
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,960
I thought of it.

174
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,340
This...

175
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,700
So the combined thoughts of you, puzzling evidence...

176
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,360
The future's better.

177
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:22,800
And...

178
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah.

179
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,140
You know, the future...

180
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,940
Dr. Philodrop.

181
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,560
...is really better than the future of the past.

182
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,420
That future of the past sucks.

183
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,120
Produce...

184
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,860
A known...

185
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,680
A known fiber optic flag...

186
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,480
...invision of future from the future, rather than envisioning...

187
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,020
And a spray gun kit.

188
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,620
...and manifesting a future...

189
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:39,700
Wee!

190
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:39,980
...in the future.

191
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:39,980


192
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:39,980


193
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:39,980


194
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:39,980


195
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,740
Based upon the past, or even the stale present.

196
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,460
The future of the future provides more...

197
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,160
But is it the future, or is it just an alternate past?

198
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,220
Wait a minute.

199
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:51,900
Wait, wait, what?

200
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,480
Is it yesterday's tomorrow, just today's...

201
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,480
Well, technically, yesterday...

202
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,660
...day after tomorrow?

203
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,500
...was the day before tomorrow yesterday.

204
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:07,000
And if tomorrow's yesterday is today's day after yesterday...

205
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,980
...then tomorrow's...

206
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:09,980


207
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:09,980


208
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,860
...is...

209
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,360
Caller.

210
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,380
...today's...

211
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,140
You can turn the page.

212
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,280
You can roll over and go back to sleep.

213
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,860
...day after yesterday's tomorrow.

214
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,780
...and put a stop to the madness.

215
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,280
You can, with your new utility trailer gadget.

216
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:22,880
...call in.

217
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:29,560
...towards my utility belt, because I have the ultimate ability to become the most awesome

218
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,780
person ever.

219
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,220
Bored on the planet Earth.

220
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,940
Even pure regimen.

221
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,260
...recognized.

222
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,240
...recognized.

223
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,620
...and then I...

224
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,140
...recognized.

225
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:41,760
...pure...

226
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,360
...evil.

227
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,240
...recognized.

228
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,540
...because...

229
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,520
Philodrummed.

230
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,580
Ed Holms.

231
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:55,020
And Puzzling Evidence on the Puzzling Evidence Show from KPFA in Berkeley.

232
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:03,580
Friends, which you can get copies of every week from the kpfa.org site, I believe, or

233
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,220
also just look at subgenius.com and follow the Hour of Slack link.

234
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:09,220


235
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:17,380
And it'll take you to the websites of the parts, like Philo's website at quiveringbrain.com.

236
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,660
Anyway, now, Fernanda Nandi-Lemur rocks out.

237
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,920
...and I'm going to go to the

238
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:57,940
...

239
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,020
...

240
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,060
...

241
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,260
...

242
00:10:59,260 --> 00:10:59,520
...

243
00:10:59,520 --> 00:10:59,740
...

244
00:10:59,740 --> 00:10:59,740


245
00:10:59,740 --> 00:10:59,740


246
00:10:59,740 --> 00:10:59,740


247
00:10:59,740 --> 00:10:59,740


248
00:10:59,740 --> 00:10:59,740


249
00:10:59,740 --> 00:10:59,740


250
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,240
...

251
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,540
...

252
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,320
...

253
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,260
thermificación,

254
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:04,260


255
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:04,900
...

256
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,760
.

257
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,400
..

258
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:12,400


259
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:12,400


260
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:12,400


261
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:12,400


262
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:30,300
. ..

263
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,080
Thank you.

264
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,660
Thank you.

265
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:02,040
Okay, moving on to the last of the stack here.

266
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,720
Let's see.

267
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,180
Keep going.

268
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,800
What is the ultimate chord progression?

269
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,200
Tritones is what I would say.

270
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,480
They sound good all the way up the scale.

271
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,780
Even in that upper register that only bats can hear

272
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,800
as they squeak and flit about,

273
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,940
searching for succulent moths in the darkness.

274
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,860
Yes, we may claim that harmonies are dead,

275
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,460
but our fads are only that.

276
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,800
There are certain things which always please and always displease.

277
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,640
And if we no longer...

278
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,460
If we no longer recognize them,

279
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:45,720
the animal kingdom will not have such tropes in their repertoire.

280
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:52,240
So does this have anything to do with soothing the savage beast or anything?

281
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,660
Well, they might stop to listen if you're playing them a tune

282
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,200
before devouring you, sucking your blood,

283
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,860
or attaching themselves to your intestinal wall.

284
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:06,400
But the animal kingdom wishes intimate encounters with you at all times.

285
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,540
Country, I am Bob Country.

286
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,500
I am Bob Country.

287
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,460
I am Bob Country.

288
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,820
I am Bob Dairy Queen.

289
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,840
President Bush's Antichrist Barb.

290
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,100
Sin, sin, sin, sin.

291
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,920
Dobbs, dobs, dobs, dobs.

292
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,160
As dobs, dobs, dobs, dobs.

293
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,660
As part of what's pushing him over the edge here.

294
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,000
Child killing with tranquility.

295
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,320
Child killing with tranquility.

296
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,100
Like a chocolate sundae.

297
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,420
Bob, I used to own a Dairy Queen.

298
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,600
It has no nutritional value, but makes Republicans feel better.

299
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,640
I mean, talk about being judgmental.

300
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,840
M-m-m-m-mental.

301
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,340
That's judgmental.

302
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:46,400
Many of us recognize homosexuality and gradually prostitution.

303
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,120
And pornography, it's a lifestyle.

304
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,760
Other homosexuals, come on out.

305
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,820
Come on out.

306
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,160
This is going to be fun.

307
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,480
Bring the kids for this stuff.

308
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:21,540
Trouble maturing in cleaned tacks.

309
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,900
Tying up neighborhood rulers only gets boring.

310
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,200
Need to great mix-up.

311
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
Roundup the rim are the only immune escolties.

312
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:27,200


313
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,700
...sh�만anganmu 하게 ol gayi camera diping in eyeliner with have-don't-sh alguém

314
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:29,700


315
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,500
... folded over withazzi cabалеus...

316
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:30,660
...band decree for sequel to.

Ba-dwa-dwa-dwa-dilla...

00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,320
...dienna m threats are flying high.

319
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:35,380
They're not even surprised at those drunk...

320
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,480
....I wanted to rule out most of this...

321
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,600
Uh-huh.

322
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,680
That's some lemur, ain't it?

323
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:07,800
And before that, ask Dr. Howell at 8X Day with Dr. Howell and Dr. Philodrum.

324
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:13,700
And by the way, the background music is Ego Plum from EbolaMusic.com.

325
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,260
And right now, we shall go to Bill T. Miller of OBE, Out of Band Experience, I guess.

326
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:27,600
Welcome, young people. He's leading our young people to drug addiction and promiscuity.

327
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,120
By virtue of the cosmos and all the powers in command.

328
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:47,180
By virtue of the form and all else that has that power.

329
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,060
Oh, no!

330
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,500
Wait, what? Oh, no, no, no, no.

331
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,920
Oh, no!

332
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,000
Oh, no!

333
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,660
You seem a little nervous.

334
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,160
You seem a little nervous, my friend.

335
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,500
You have the strength of my soul.

336
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,440
You're selling me from beyond.

337
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,040
You'd better be ready

338
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,660
to speak your piece.

339
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,980
You call me from beyond.

340
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,700
You disturb my rest of sleep.

341
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,300
With your childish games.

342
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:41,260
You don't know what you're playing with.

343
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,320
This is not a game.

344
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,120
Put a little voice in your soul.

345
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,680
This is your life.

346
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,620
You've become a good man.

347
00:16:59,180 --> 00:16:59,180


348
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,200
Look, we are not just another...

349
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,660
Look, we are not just another...

350
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:01,660


351
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:01,660


352
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,600
We are the only real fans.

353
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,400
Listen to your music backwards in reverse.

354
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,660
It's the truth.

355
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,760
It works for you.

356
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:11,800
It's the truth.

357
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,180
Heavy metal.

358
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:15,860
Heavy metal.

359
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,480
Heavy metal.

360
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,400
I'm going to set you in the...

361
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,380
We're only valid, okay?

362
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,640
The bottom line is...

363
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,660
Quietly, please.

364
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,900
Heavy, get it?

365
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,220
Cool.

366
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,100
Cool.

367
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:27,440
Cool.

368
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,420
Cool.

369
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:31,640


370
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:31,640


371
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:31,640


372
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:31,640


373
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:31,640


374
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:31,640


375
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:31,640


376
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:31,640


377
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:31,640


378
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,980
Keep going.

379
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,060
Kindly stop.

380
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:38,340
I didn't even get in a fight,

381
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,620
and I know this a great deal.

382
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,400
I'veguys are keen to think

383
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,220
when I go to sleep,

384
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:45,220


385
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:45,220


386
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:45,220


387
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:45,220


388
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:45,260
right now?

389
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:45,260


390
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,320
I know that the truth

391
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,760
is in the thinking of...

392
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,460
It's not the effect I've got.

393
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:54,620
No pain in the self

394
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,220
of being a nerdy loser.

395
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,140
I fucking sent you

396
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:56,920
baby.

397
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,180
No pain in the self

398
00:17:59,180 --> 00:17:59,180


399
00:17:59,180 --> 00:17:59,220
No pain in my life!

400
00:17:59,220 --> 00:17:59,860
Dude,

401
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:00,900
You are a mess!

402
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,640
You are a mad bitch!

403
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:01,640


404
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:01,640


405
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,120
You ready for me?

406
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,340
Can it be ready to face the consequences?

407
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,380
It's never too late to redeem yourself

408
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,420
One last chance

409
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,860
That's all you have

410
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,840
It's up to you

411
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,020
You ready for me?

412
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,080
No escaping my eyes

413
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,580
You'll see them in every dream

414
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,160
You ready?

415
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,860
You ready?

416
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,480
No escaping the eyes

417
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:15,460
The sun will never shine with the eyes again

418
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:22,280
You ready for me from the outside?

419
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,560
You ready to face the truth my friend?

420
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,480
I'm here for you

421
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:42,280
You ready?

422
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,840
The giant locusts have reached the Chicago Southside and nearby suburbs.

423
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,420
Men of Earth, we of the planet Mars give you this warning.

424
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,140
People!

425
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,320
No!

426
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,560
But don't mess with us because we're all you got.

427
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,220
In fact, if we fold, we'll have no damn phones.

428
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,000
It's like I picked the wrong week to quit amphetamines.

429
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,520
You're tearing me apart!

430
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,820
Horror and moral terror are your friends.

431
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,160
You can crawl out from under no rocks.

432
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,700
You've got no tails.

433
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,260
I'm a cop and you will respect my authority.

434
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,820
Bloodless, lifeless.

435
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,520
No pulse in one of them.

436
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,120
I'm gonna be naughty.

437
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,120
I'm gonna be a naughty vampire god.

438
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,140
Well Jim, there's no reason why you shouldn't live another 20 to 30 years.

439
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,640
However, you will be bleeding constantly from both eyes.

440
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,360
Okay, here's an important question.

441
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,220
A lot of people want to know.

442
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,100
I'm glad that they're listening.

443
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,100


444
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,100


445
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,100


446
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,100


447
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,100


448
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,100


449
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,420
I'm glad that this particular audience member was able to encapsulate this so well.

450
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:06,960
The vertical mark above Dobbs' left brow cannot possibly be a shadow.

451
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,000
I've done my calculations.

452
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,560
What is it?

453
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:18,200
You see, the beginning of wisdom is staring at the Dobbs head itself.

454
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:23,000
It's almost too much really for the human mind to consider.

455
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:27,100
There is a certain frightening majesty in it.

456
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,100


457
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,840
In the implacable visage of Dobbs.

458
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,240
Here we have an analog Dobbs behind us.

459
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,160
You see the mark there on the left brow.

460
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,940
This is not to be construed as the mark of Cain.

461
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,720
Which was put on the brow of the first murderer.

462
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,520
And those who derived from his loins.

463
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,920
After the expulsion of the first couple from paradise.

464
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,100
In fact, what is registered in many images of Dobbs.

465
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:57,100


466
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,960
As a mark.

467
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:02,260
Actually translates as no real mark at all.

468
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,340
It is the opposite of a look-a-fleck.

469
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,900
And I don't know the word for it.

470
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,860
You could call it a dark-a-fleck or something.

471
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,960
It's where the dark is gathered.

472
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,620
It's gathered on the corner.

473
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,500
Because on either side of it there are separate light sources.

474
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,920
There is a light source coming from the front of the Dobbs head.

475
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:24,240
And a light source coming from each side of the Dobbs head.

476
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,380
These light sources whose evidence we can see from the appearance of the Dobbs head itself.

477
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,000
Are not of equal intensity.

478
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:37,820
The strongest one comes from above the Dobbsian skull.

479
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,360
But as you can see it's also coming from the left side.

480
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,240
As well as from the top.

481
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,120
Where is the shadow to go?

482
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,240
Only in this little line.

483
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,840
On the left side of the head.

484
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,240
That represents a place where light is not.

485
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,940
But it is not a mark.

486
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,220
And if one ever could see the profile of Dobbs.

487
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:06,800
Something which scholastics and devout people have thought about for many years.

488
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,240
You would not see that line.

489
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:15,940
Only in the full fledged, full frontal confrontation of the face.

490
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,620
Does that line appear.

491
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,840
But unless it is Dobbs.

492
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,380
That line.

493
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,020
Well there it is.

494
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,640
So it's not a mark.

495
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,920
Get that out of your mind.

496
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,880
It's not a mark.

497
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,460
It's a place where light is not.

498
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,420
You have to define Dobbs with darkness and light like everything else.

499
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,540
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

500
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,960
That's a question I used to think about quite a bit.

501
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,680
After we took the dots off.

502
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,700
There seemed to be a lot of marks there that just weren't there before.

503
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,060
Dobbs.

504
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,120
Dobbs.

505
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,140
Dobbs.

506
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,200
Dobbs.

507
00:23:59,440 --> 00:23:59,920
Dobbs.

508
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:00,680
Dobbs.

509
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:01,920
Dobbs.

510
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,660
Let's go crazy.

511
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,380
Dobbs.

512
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,920
Now, Tipper Gore.

513
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,700
I guess you could say she was a sex fiend.

514
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,140
I met her in a hotel lobby.

515
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,280
Masturbating with a magazine.

516
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,000
10 to 12 times a day.

517
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,820
Blood races to my private spot.

518
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,480
Let's me know there's a fire.

519
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,860
Can't stop passion when passion's hot.

520
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,920
Come inside my sugar walls.

521
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,240
Come sleep inside my sugar walls.

522
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,240
F word.

523
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,520
F word.

524
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,700
You'll feel our hell on your back.

525
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,480
Sex fiend.

526
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,120
Blood follows blood and we make sure.

527
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,740
Life ain't for you and we're the cure.

528
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,740
Sex fiend.

529
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,760
Damage incorporated.

530
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,060
Smell inside of this.

531
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,160
It gets me going.

532
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,160
F word.

533
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,280
Masturbating with a magazine.

534
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,000
10 to 12 times a day.

535
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,540
Sex fiend.

536
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,520
Sex fiend.

537
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,140
Dobbs.

538
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,680
Dobbs.

539
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,140
Dobbs.

540
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,680
Let's go crazy.

541
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,380
Dobbs.

542
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,920
Now, Tipper Gore.

543
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,720
I guess you could say she was a sex fiend.

544
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,640
Let's go crazy.

545
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,120
Dobbs.

546
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,140
Let's go crazy. Dobbs.

547
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,340
Blood races to my private spot.

548
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,120
Sex fiend. Dobbs.

549
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,780
Dobbs.

550
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,540
Hell-po-puey.

551
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,680
Hell-po-puey.

552
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,020
The mighty

553
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,640
Hell-po-puey with

554
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,780
E-bad habit.

555
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,020
Before that, Norel Pref.

556
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,280
Sex fiend collage.

557
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,080
And 8X Day

558
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,720
Ask Dr. Howell

559
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,780
with Philodrummon.

560
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,000
And Dr. Howell.

561
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,980
And Leemurr was in there.

562
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,680
And Leemurr devotee.

563
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,220
And Lambre Systems.

564
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,660
All did little bits and trips and clicks.

565
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,140
And now, puzzling

566
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,780
And now, puzzling

567
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:53,800
evidence.

568
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,600
Evidence.

569
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,100
Slackmar

570
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,360
is only an appendage

571
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,220
in the past

572
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,400
into which our apertures

573
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,880
are freely associated.

574
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,340
And you're quite good.

575
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,500
Dr. Howell is not in the house tonight.

576
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,760
So, no, no.

577
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,260
Yeah, the Dr. Howell machine is broken.

578
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,000
I had to take it off the shelf

579
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,080
and put it in the back.

580
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,880
You removed his double-edged sword.

581
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,440
I moved his subliminal

582
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,720
mind extension

583
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,120
that he normally is able to protrude

584
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,460
into our studio

585
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,600
when he's out of town.

586
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,740
Just to make sure he gets a little piece of himself

587
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,460
on the show.

588
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,560
In absentia, so to speak.

589
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,100
In absencia. Not absentia.

590
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,560
He wasn't abstaining.

591
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,220
He was actually just not there.

592
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,760
He was just there.

593
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,360
He was just there.

594
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,480
Oh, hi there.

595
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,540
Oh, what, all this stuff?

596
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,920
Oh, hi there. Oh, what, all this stuff?

597
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,700
Well, I used to just do this

598
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,620
on the weekends.

599
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,460
And then I started

600
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,900
doing it in the evening

601
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,160
during the week.

602
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,720
And then I'd say to myself,

603
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,320
Well, I can do it

604
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,360
before work.

605
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,080
I can do this.

606
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,100
And I'd wake up

607
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,140
with my tongue

608
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,480
tasting like a soccer field

609
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,160
on the equator of Venus

610
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,100
where sarcastic third quadrant aliens

611
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,160
had been using my skull

612
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,100
for the ball.

613
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,480
I'd have to take my four

614
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,120
boiled neurons to the job

615
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,280
in a quartz-sized Ziploc bag

616
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,680
and the boys

617
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,380
would throw it back and forth

618
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,100
during lunch, pretending they weren't

619
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,560
ever gonna give it back.

620
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,140
I left the juice on

621
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,840
all night one time.

622
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,900
And when I woke up,

623
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,180
I smelled burning hair.

624
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,640
And when I looked at my feet,

625
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,060
I thought they were

626
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,620
female sex organs.

627
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,020
It was really scary.

628
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,980
I mean,

629
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,620
I'm no neurosurgeon.

630
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,140
I can't put those

631
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,480
nerve trunks back in the right places

632
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,500
every time.

633
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,100
When the psychoplasm spills over the edge

634
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,500
of the containment field,

635
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,380
it's every man, woman, and thing

636
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,260
for his, her, or itself.

637
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,660
And the escape valves

638
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,860
only have room for one at a time.

639
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,180
So, it can get pretty ugly in there.

640
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,780
It can get pretty ugly out here as well.

641
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,480
It's been getting worse

642
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:04,480


643
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:04,480


644
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:04,480


645
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:04,480


646
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:04,480


647
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:04,480


648
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:04,940
for a long time.

649
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:04,940


650
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:04,940


651
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:04,940


652
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,900
expensive tools.

653
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,960
I tend to fry

654
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,520
three or four pairs of shoes

655
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,240
a week.

656
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,180
And since the process

657
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,760
makes my feet grow,

658
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,700
it's getting intense

659
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,360
because I can't

660
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,240
pull this stuff.

661
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,580
And the neighbors

662
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,500
have been complaining

663
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:39,520
out of the garbage, and cats don't mate under their bedroom windows anymore.

664
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:50,240
And of course, having your eyes mounted on flexible spots like a crab's has its advantages.

665
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:57,240
You can get through lines at the stores a lot faster, although I'm not sure of exactly

666
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,540
why that is.

667
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:08,320
The powers of levitation come in pretty handy, as long as you remember to dodge the high

668
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,840
tension power lines.

669
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:18,280
And a lot of people seem to think that I'm over the edge for hooking myself up like this,

670
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:27,180
but as they say, one man's bummer is another man's beautiful thing, and I think the exposed

671
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,520
electrodes are really good.

672
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:34,640
They're really quite pretty, so I think I'm just going to keep on doing it.

673
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,760
I think I'm going to keep on doing it.

674
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,980
I think I'm going to keep on doing it.

675
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,660
Where are you?

676
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,660
Where's everybody going?

677
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,160
Maybe we're all insane.

678
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:46,820
A couple of very unimportant items seem to have eluded me, like who I am.

679
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,800
What in the name of everything holy is going on?

680
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,740
What's going on here?

681
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,760
Wait a minute, what's going on?

682
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,560
What's going on here?

683
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,720
We, all of us, we are in hell.

684
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,180
Maybe we're all insane.

685
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,740
Wait a minute, what's going on?

686
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,100
Where are you?

687
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,040
What's going on here?

688
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,260
What's going on here?

689
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,280
What in the name of everything holy is going on?

690
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,720
Who are you?

691
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,780
Who are you?

692
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,220
Who are you?

693
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:39,220


694
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,560
Who are you?

695
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,200
Who are you?

696
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:44,800
Who are you?

697
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:44,880
Who are you?

698
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,440
From PR News in Washington, I'm scattered in the streets and set fire to more than two dozen cars.

699
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:56,800
Lance Armstrong killed two Israelis at the Gaza border and Israel killed Judge John Roberts,

700
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,520
who allegedly carried out a murder.

701
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:03,420
The White House exploded in the luxury resort area of South London.

702
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,580
A powerful earthquake is not related to PR News, Washington.

703
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,720
Yes, you're listening to the best pseudo-religion in the West.

704
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,160
This is the puzzling evidence show.

705
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,220
Look, there's an overman stuck in the weeds of time.

706
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,500
Oh, yeah, look at that.

707
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,860
Living la vida loca, as far as I can tell.

708
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,180
A little show character.

709
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,420
He's skibbling along now.

710
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,500
Sage and sage.

711
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,560
Sacred scribe.

712
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,040
Ivan Stang himself.

713
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,860
Now, that's an interesting...

714
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,200
That's a subgenius after X-Day.

715
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:35,500
That's me.

716
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,080
I think that is me.

717
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,040
Vomiting blood, as it has been said in the last days.

718
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,640
Yeah, we're applying the special x-rays to the show.

719
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,200
It's taken me years to perfect the technique to be able to vomit blood.

720
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,180
The dropsicle.

721
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:55,180
Have you ever been hit by a quarter in the forehead from the balcony?

722
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,980
If you get to keep it...

723
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,500
No, I haven't.

724
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,560
It hurts.

725
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,120
It really...

726
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:00,980
Four dollars for Dobbs.

727
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,860
You lose a couple of memories every time a quarter hits you.

728
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:08,240
And if a guy throws a 50-cent piece and hits you square between the eyes...

729
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,060
You'll go berserk.

730
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,760
You lose your sermons for that night.

731
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:14,060
You'll go berserk like Mighty Joe Young in similar circumstances.

732
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:14,320
That's right.

733
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,900
I don't blame him a bit.

734
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,560
The stark fist of removal.

735
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,380
Hi, this is Thursday's channel.

736
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,420
This is my new single.

737
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,940
Hi, this is Day My Day My Day Day My Day Day Day Day My My Day Day My Day My Day My Day My Day My Day My My My My My My My My.

738
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,020
Hi, this is going to hell.

739
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:27,580
Pretty hell.

740
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,500
Thing going going going.

741
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,360
Thing ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding.

742
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,440
This is my new single.

743
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,160
Hi.

744
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:34,340
Hi.

745
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,940
Ooh, he's down, yeah

746
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:06,040
Gotta get some LSD, I gotta get some LSD now, baby

747
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:10,680
Get some LSD, wanna free your mind, you shouldn't listen to me, yeah

748
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:26,440
Shit was gold, it all would be rich

749
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,580
You didn't have to hear me, bitch

750
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,760
Get fucked up every night

751
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,960
I know that that, that ain't right

752
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,260
Get some grass, I get a little ass

753
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:42,260
Sex, drugs, rock and roll

754
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:46,560
Then I go home alone on LSD

755
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,000
He's on LSD

756
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,900
Karma, karma, come and go

757
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,320
Got the karma key

758
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,800
For karma fun

759
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,000
Use the key or lock the door

760
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,180
We'll make love forevermore on LSD

761
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,620
All this war, all this hate

762
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,380
It's all just a bloody big mistake

763
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,440
Where's this man that they call God?

764
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:45,660
Is he here or is he stoned on acid?

765
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,820
He's on acid

766
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,800
Sometimes I wish I wasn't born

767
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,300
While I'm here I'll have my own

768
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,700
I find what sex, drugs, rock and roll

769
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,960
Disco, sex, and soda

770
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,720
So in your acid

771
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,840
So in acid

772
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,960
Mmm

773
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,800
Mmm

774
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,540
Mmm

775
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,960
Mmm

776
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,920
Mmm

777
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:18,920


778
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:56,320


779
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:26,320


780
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:56,320


781
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:26,320


782
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:56,320


783
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:26,320


784
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:56,320


785
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,120
taking your old

786
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:05,320
Have you got篓

787
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:05,720
Mmm

788
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,200
Yum

789
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:08,200


790
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,860
Yum

791
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:10,860


792
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:10,860


793
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,920
Yum

794
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,340
You're really appreciate that

795
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,700
Well whereas I said

796
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:22,480
You're always gonna find me

797
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,000
So here's

798
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:26,300


799
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:34,300
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly, the girl with the frock in her eyes.

800
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:47,520
Great Yucateers mock of yellow and green, towering over your head.

801
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:54,820
Look for the puzzling evidence now and it's gone.

802
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:00,800
Connie in the sky with dog's heads.

803
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:06,020
Connie in the sky with dog's heads.

804
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:11,080
Connie in the sky with dog's heads.

805
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,480
I'll follow her down to the end.

806
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:17,500
I'll follow her down to the end.

807
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:24,960
You are rich by a mountain where mutated people eat habber frock pies.

808
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:35,540
Everyone sighs as you float past the Neagy and Jane-ers incredibly high.

809
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,300
Prairie squid flaxseed appears on the shore.

810
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,500
Waiting to take you home.

811
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:47,500


812
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,320
You're a little too old to go away.

813
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:55,640
Climb on the saucers that float through the clouds and you're gone.

814
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:01,340
Connie in the sky with dog's heads.

815
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:06,680
Connie in the sky with dog's heads.

816
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:11,720
Connie in the sky with dog's heads.

817
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,520
I'll picture yourself.

818
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:25,440
On a saucer of pleasure with pink boys for slaves of every size.

819
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,020
Suddenly someone is there on the planet.

820
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:36,180
The girl with the frock in her eyes.

821
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,400
Connie in the sky with dog's heads.

822
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:49,080
Connie in the sky with dog's heads.

823
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:53,980
Connie in the sky with dog's heads.

824
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,900
Connie in the sky with dog's heads.

825
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:08,860
Connie in the sky with dog's heads.

826
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:13,940
Connie in the sky with dog's heads.

827
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,420
Ah.

828
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,820
Connie in the sky with dog's heads.

829
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:28,860
Cohen in the sky with dog's heads.

830
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:33,460
Connie in the sky with dog's heads.

831
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:33,880
C-C-C-ookie in the sky.

832
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:39,320
by Phineas Narco, dear friends.

833
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:46,160
You can get more from him at nationalcynical.com.

834
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:53,440
And now let us go through the outflow valve into Dr. Howell's answer machine.

835
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:57,620
All right, now this is something I think we can all identify with.

836
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,520
The audience member, I wanted to call you a caller, but I won't.

837
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,840
I'll call you an audience member, more precise.

838
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,940
That makes you the caller.

839
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:11,520
It says, I just had a pseudo-recto-retro-endectomy.

840
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:13,920
When can I go swimming?

841
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:24,440
You can go in as soon as you like, but I wouldn't press myself against the outflow valve.

842
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,500
Good.

843
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,140
Good advice there, Dr. Howell.

844
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,420
I've been known to stay away from those valves myself.

845
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:38,020
You read that Chuck Polanyuk story, I assume.

846
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:43,040
Right, right, with the valve and the aperture misfortune.

847
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,440
Yeah, so let's go on.

848
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,260
This is interesting.

849
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,560
Because it's madness.

850
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,940
It's got some good pictures in it, too.

851
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,540
I just like to look at the pictures.

852
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,500
Dr. Howell.

853
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:05,840
I wish I had this with me when I was out last week in the woods.

854
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:06,500
Good, good, good.

855
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:06,960
Fine.

856
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,340
Because then I could have read it.

857
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,080
Look at these scary pictures of people getting shock-treated and stuff.

858
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:15,920
It's a book.

859
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,020
It's about what sane people think about people in insane asylums and stuff.

860
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,920
Which is probably a good viewpoint.

861
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,340
And the motivation of the people that run them.

862
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,520
Because if you're insane, you're going to get shot.

863
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:27,600
And if you're insane, you're probably going to get shot.

864
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:32,160
don't care about reading a book about insane people in an insane society the

865
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:41,540
same man must appear insane so that's always been your theory I know but how

866
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:51,120
do you know that how do you know that if you are insane that that you would be

867
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:58,820
or what did you say Rockner in an insane society the same man must appear insane

868
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:02,560
so what does that mean about like short memory loss where you can't remember

869
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:10,360
when you restart reducing your sentences to just two words sentences are you

870
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:18,080
reducing it to like 1984 news speak almost syntax reduction yeah like the

871
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,040
paper reductionist in Rudd you can only use

872
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,960
sentences with two words in them now see I just violated the primary rule

873
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:36,060
right now you did I did can they laugh and laugh laugh and laugh that's an

874
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:41,120
incomplete sentence those who doesn't count I laugh from PR news in Washington

875
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:45,360
I'm looking for a good place to set off a radioactive bomb residents in southern

876
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:49,720
Texas and the Mexican Gulf Coast passed over the Yucatan Peninsula and back into

877
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:50,540
the Gulf of Mexico

878
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:50,940
you

879
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:56,160
are arguing it is unconstitutional to strengthen into a category 3 storm 21

880
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,700
official groups have been killed in the two years since the invasion of the

881
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:07,260
Supreme Court I have oh okay here you go what is the airspeed velocity of an

882
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,300
overlaid and swallow I think there's something missing from that question

883
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:17,620
dr. how would you agree I'm not certain I I know what would be missing here the

884
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:20,840
degree to which the swallow was overlaid and would affect

885
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:30,360
the airspeed wasn't it that's true that there is more than one kind of of

886
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:36,020
swallow you can tell them of course by their swallow tales in the sky that

887
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:44,600
special tailcoat that they have what would it be laden with would it be full

888
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:50,740
of delicious selvages and bugs in its crop know it's carrying something

889
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:55,220
Carrying something in its little warm insides.

890
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,200
Helium balloons.

891
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:03,120
Well, see you're adding a piece of something that wasn't part of the question, a datum,

892
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,080
which you have brought to the equation.

893
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,580
Well, maybe it was, maybe so.

894
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,340
Helium balloon, maybe it was an anti-gravity device.

895
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:11,500
Possibly.

896
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:18,540
Still, I will say that the Swallow, however much it has picked up in flight, will still

897
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:21,480
endeavor to travel at its maximum speed.

898
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:25,820
It will not pace itself because it knows nothing of this.

899
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,940
It only knows that effort goes in and flight comes out.

900
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:33,020
Therefore, it will continue to make the effort.

901
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:41,000
But the human will destroy its mission before it even starts by fretfully considering this ratio.

902
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:48,520
It will fearfully consider its point of exhaustion before it happens and thus bring it into being.

903
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,140
And defeat itself.

904
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,700
Okay, excellent, excellent.

905
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,380
Riveting.

906
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,060
Shocking.

907
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:06,220
Since the neurons of the adult human brain do not reproduce, a space expedition represents irreparable brain damage

908
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:13,320
and would reduce the crew to idiots in even the eight years it would take to go to the nearest sun and return.

909
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:21,120
The

910
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:39,180
I'm abusing that substance abuser now, baby!

911
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:41,720
Please!

912
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:46,140
Stop abusing that substance abuser now, baby!

913
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,620
Oh, please!

914
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:48,520
Oh, please!

915
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:49,720
Oh, please!

916
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:50,100
Please!

917
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:50,440


918
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:50,440


919
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:50,440


920
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:51,900
Too bad.

921
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,340
They should have inflatable cups that you just want a little bit.

922
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:59,500
How about extreme prejudice?

923
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:01,240
We shouldn't let that guy get any votes.

924
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,300
His head's made of concrete.

925
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:04,620
For Christ's sake.

926
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,580
I did it with extreme prejudice.

927
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,020
Couldn't you just lighten up a little bit?

928
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,140
You know, everybody's kind of basically the same underneath.

929
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:17,160
Well, think about the two words that they're combining.

930
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,280
Extrem께!

931
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,600
and prejudice.

932
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,760
Both bad words.

933
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,040
Extreme prejudice.

934
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,900
Even bad is bad.

935
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,200
89.3. Extreme

936
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,260
prejudice.

937
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:30,740
Not really.

938
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:34,300
I can't believe anybody actually uses that word

939
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,420
as a marketing tool anymore.

940
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:38,140
Well, they used to use Ein Volk, Ein Reich,

941
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,800
Ein Führer.

942
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,880
Yeah, now it's Ein Volk, Ein Reich,

943
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:42,780
Ein News Channel.

944
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:48,340
Oh, I'm so old that I remember

945
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,740
when they used extreme

946
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,780
back in the 40s.

947
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,740
These things go in waves.

948
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,780
Before that, I think in the

949
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,120
around 1915,

950
00:51:58,220 --> 00:51:59,420
everything was extreme.

951
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:02,360
It was extreme ointment

952
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,820
and extreme

953
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:05,600
truss.

954
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,160
Schwartz's extreme

955
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,560
truss. Extreme polio vaccine.

956
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,300
Yeah, but that was in the

957
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,120
40s. Only they were

958
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,840
fake. Bob sold

959
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,460
a thing called extreme polio

960
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:19,580
vaccine. Excellent.

961
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:22,200
But it was not proven

962
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:22,720
effective.

963
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:23,780
Me?

964
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:26,960
Disease.

965
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,080
I thought it was just disease.

966
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,280
I thought it was just that doctor. He had damaged

967
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,260
the lining of my esophagus. He prescribed

968
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,600
erosions in my esophagus.

969
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:37,900
Setting in serious stomach conditions

970
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,320
and headache, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.

971
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:41,920
My esophagus needed

972
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:42,940
my esophagus.

973
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,300
Talk about pills.

974
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,840
Well, if only, I'm just saying, if they could make a designer

975
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,760
drug that made everything look like

976
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,700
it was made of chocolate, taste

977
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,880
like chocolate, feel like chocolate.

978
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,860
It'd be like going to Candyland.

979
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,800
The Aztecs had it all we needed

980
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,920
as a time machine to go back the year before

981
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,960
Cortez landed

982
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,360
and have some of this stuff.

983
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,300
You know what I'm saying?

984
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,360
Like I said, Montezuma, he drank like 40

985
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,360
40 like,

986
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,160
liters of this chocolate concoction every day.

987
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,160
And you know he wasn't drinking, you know,

988
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,560
Bosco or whatever you call it.

989
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:19,240
So that's why they call it Montezuma's revenge.

990
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,180
That was, he was the discovery of

991
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:22,740
Bosco.

992
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:24,080
Discover of Bosco.

993
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,560
That means a forest in Italian.

994
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:27,780
Foreta.

995
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:29,340
I believe.

996
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,560
Well, I'll tell you, I have,

997
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:34,240
as I've gotten older,

998
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,320
which seems to be

999
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,380
continuing, by the way, in case anyone

1000
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,120
was wondering. We're all getting older.

1001
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,500
Oh, you too.

1002
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,960
I thought you looked like you had aged.

1003
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:44,980
Just a little bit.

1004
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:45,760
Imagine that.

1005
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:49,700
Anyway, I find that the chocolate becomes

1006
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:51,660
a more important drug than

1007
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,860
almost any other one except for

1008
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:55,120
its close relative coffee.

1009
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,440
And some of its other relatives

1010
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,920
in the cannabinoid area.

1011
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,820
But really, the coffee, more than

1012
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:05,220
anything else, because

1013
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:07,720
the drugs I took seem to light up my brain.

1014
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:09,940
You know, women like to say

1015
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:11,720
that chocolate is a sort of a

1016
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,740
drug for them.

1017
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:14,780
It's an orgasm drug.

1018
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,040
If you look at all the actual chemicals

1019
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,880
that are found naturally occurring in chocolate,

1020
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,260
there are some drug-like compounds

1021
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,020
occurring in chocolate besides caffeine.

1022
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,740
People talk about caffeine being the first one,

1023
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,500
but theobromine is another one.

1024
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,040
Anandamide,

1025
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,440
which is a cannabinoid.

1026
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:32,980
There are cannabinoids in chocolate.

1027
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,680
Did you know that in the early days,

1028
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,620
the brothers burned

1029
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:39,340
the codices, which contained

1030
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:41,560
over 1,200 recipes for everything?

1031
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,080
They burned chocolate in different ways.

1032
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,320
There was aphrodisiac chocolate.

1033
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,900
There was hallucinogenic chocolate.

1034
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,000
There was this squeaky, squished chocolate.

1035
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:51,200
There was every kind

1036
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,500
known to man.

1037
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,920
And yet they thought it was the devil's work,

1038
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:56,700
and so they polished it and burned it.

1039
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,720
Except for the sisters did like their chocolate

1040
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,620
at night, and so that's what's left with.

1041
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:03,480
So what happened?

1042
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:04,660
Yeah.

1043
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,460
Finish the story, man.

1044
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:07,600
Well, that's what happened.

1045
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:08,940
They said, you know,

1046
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:11,520
well, sisters like chocolate. It's a good tonic.

1047
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,460
You know, people like that and a couple other uses.

1048
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:14,640
You know, cake was nice.

1049
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,720
But all the other stuff, this has got to be the devil.

1050
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:19,460
Yet, at the same time, they recorded

1051
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:21,280
hundreds of other things.

1052
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,920
They were scared of real chocolate for some reason.

1053
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,820
And these are lost

1054
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:27,140
to mankind, supposedly.

1055
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:29,340
We don't know if they were.

1056
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,220
I mean, it's not like it's a purple lotus, man.

1057
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:31,960
It's just chocolate.

1058
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:34,740
Well, once upon a time,

1059
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,340
it was very exotic

1060
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:39,020
to Westerners or to Europeans.

1061
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:40,640
It was like currency, wasn't it?

1062
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:42,400
Chocolate was.

1063
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,860
I mean, you know, this is something that

1064
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,360
was not found

1065
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:48,680
in Europe. So European society,

1066
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,900
once it first encountered it, obviously thought it was

1067
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,220
something exotic and strange.

1068
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,060
It originally came from the New World.

1069
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,800
I think it came from South America originally,

1070
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
but nowadays, I think most of it's grown in

1071
00:55:59,000 --> 00:55:59,580
West Africa.

1072
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:03,140
Right, but originally

1073
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,380
it was something that the Spaniards

1074
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:06,000
brought back.

1075
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:06,700
Yeah.

1076
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:08,880
Montezuma.

1077
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,240
Everyone's favorite.

1078
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:11,240
Montezuma.

1079
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,100
I was a big fan of chocolate.

1080
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:14,720
You know, like breakfast sausages

1081
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,540
used to hang out in these little houses in London,

1082
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,280
you know, and write poetry and drink chocolate.

1083
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,000
Can you repeat that question for me, sir?

1084
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:24,000
Oh, what kind of plant

1085
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,180
did they actually...

1086
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:25,980
It comes from a tree.

1087
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,360
The cacao tree.

1088
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:30,560
Its scientific name is Theobroma cacao.

1089
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:31,660
And

1090
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,140
the cacao fruit is

1091
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:37,200
kind of like melon-shaped size sort of thing.

1092
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:39,840
And it grows on

1093
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,200
the trunk.

1094
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:40,600
Nuts.

1095
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:41,980
On the trunk.

1096
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,720
And then like actual cacao beans are

1097
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:45,260
pretty big.

1098
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:47,520
Like they're, you know, they're nut-sized and

1099
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,280
they are...

1100
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,100
Their essential oil is very highly saturated

1101
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,880
fat that we know as cocoa butter.

1102
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:56,680
And you just grind those things up and that's

1103
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,500
that's cocoa...

1104
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,160
I mean, you have to roast...

1105
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,260
They roast them first, I think.

1106
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:02,360
Except for roasting them and grinding them, that's what cocoa powder is.

1107
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:06,000
Some radio synesthesia, dear friends.

1108
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:06,680
And before that,

1109
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,520
uh, Nour El-Preff's

1110
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,080
pills collage.

1111
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,440
Lonesome Cowboy Dave had

1112
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,180
8X Day.

1113
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:13,980
Howlin' Philo at 8X Day.

1114
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:15,420
Limer at 8X Day.

1115
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,300
PR News at 8X Day.

1116
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,320
And puzzling evidence everywhere.

1117
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,380
For everything about Dr. Philo Drummond,

1118
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:27,660
see quiveringbrain.com.

1119
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:30,880
Our background music here is by, uh,

1120
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:34,000
well, ebolamusic.com.

1121
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:35,500
It's ego club.

1122
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:40,460
And now, Limer and Nour El-Preff show separately,

1123
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,220
close us out.

1124
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:47,580
When we eat food.

1125
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,700
You're never eating wrong.

1126
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,020
When you eat food.

1127
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:54,460
That's right.

1128
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,160
Right.

1129
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,700
Friends, you're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Select.

1130
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:04,200
For more information, please check out to subgenius.com.

1131
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:06,660
Don't you get it?

1132
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:08,380
You gotta use reverse to reverse psychology.

1133
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,280
All right, I will.

1134
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:10,440
Subgenius.com.

1135
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,420
You're still the subgenius.

1136
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,900
All this work.

1137
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,900
I take it the most is that, ma'am.

1138
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,000
Bob, I am not Bob.

1139
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:23,660
I am Bob.

1140
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:24,280
I am not.

1141
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,520
Well, uh, oh!

1142
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:27,320
Oh.

1143
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:27,520
No.

1144
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:29,040
Oh, well, Bob.

1145
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,380
Bob in the first place.

1146
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:31,700
What?

1147
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,160
Oh.

1148
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:34,660
Oh.

1149
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,200
Will people get a little bored?

1150
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:37,480
About him?

1151
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,660
No, people wouldn't get bored.

1152
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:42,380
because he's an inspiration to everyone who reads about him.

1153
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:44,920
That's how all of us in the West feel about Bob.

1154
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:50,960
The drugs I took seem to light up my brain.

1155
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:54,200
This is your old friend, Bozo the Clown.

1156
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,960
Look on page one in your picture book.

1157
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:01,960
That's a picture of me with my pogo stick, but I call it cock.

1158
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,320
So high.

1159
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:06,720
Well, and look at that.

1160
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,560
That, well, big.

1161
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:10,420
Grants.

1162
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,240
Grants.

1163
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:14,700
Now I'm going down again.

1164
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:21,900
Well, I think I'll leave you to your dirty work.

1165
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,860
My name is...

1166
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,340
Never saw anything so big.

1167
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,100
This could go on forever.

1168
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,700
To all my friends who came to see me,

1169
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:40,760
I want to say, I hope you liked our trip together.

1170
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:43,200
Now that we've come to the end...
