1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
Try the wine.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,200
Huh.

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,560
I would like...

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,720
The subgenius power of slack.

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,260
What?

6
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,020
It made me real sick, a lot of it did.

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,740
Fear and nausea.

8
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,160
Ta!

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:27,300
Oh, yes, dear friends, some jealous imabob once claimed that if you heard one hour of slack, you heard them all, because they're always the same.

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,480
The same guy also said it would never last.

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,060
That was about 35 years ago, and we're on number 1,795.

12
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,760
Yes, it was the Canadian fake bomb.

13
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:46,400
What we're playing tonight is not exactly a rerun, but it was recorded on Halloween night of 1985.

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,600
The great subgenius ranter and assassin, G. Gordon Gordon, was in town from Bolivia,

15
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,120
and we'd been invited to Karen.

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:03,900
to Nard's popular nightly talk show on the Dallas NPR station, KERA.

17
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:09,960
This would have been hour of slack number 4, but it was a competing station show,

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:18,140
so we waited almost three years and then played it in small bits and pieces over several hours of slack around show number 150.

19
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,280
So this is the first time it's ever been played in its whole one-hour form.

20
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,700
I haven't heard it myself in all that time,

21
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,420
but I'm about to, so in a way, we're listening together.

22
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:39,300
It's time for the evening talk show, conversation and call-in, with your host, Karen Denard.

23
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:48,340
That old black magic has me in its spell

24
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:54,080
That old black magic that you weave so well

25
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,280
Those icy fingers that you hold so tight in your hand

26
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,280


27
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,200
Tears up and down my spine

28
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,960
The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine

29
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,520
The same old tingle that I feel inside

30
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,860
Good evening and welcome.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,880
If that old black magic has you in its spell, don't worry.

32
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,180
Hopefully it's going to wear off by tomorrow.

33
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,500
But tonight we celebrate Halloween.

34
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,280
And on the evening talk show, we're celebrating with the esteemed members of the Church of the Subgenius,

35
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,520
It's not going to be a revival or devival as they call it,

36
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,620
but we're going to try to come close.

37
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,620
Joining us, Reverend Ivan Stang, Pastor Buck Naked,

38
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,160
Hi, girls.

39
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,200
and G. Gordon Gordon.

40
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,420
Welcome to the evening talk show.

41
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:42,840
Thank you.

42
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:48,760
Reverend Stang, I need to start with you and understand exactly what the Church of the Subgenius really is.

43
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,660
Well, I'm glad you asked that question, Karen,

44
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,280
because that's probably the most important question a biped can ask.

45
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,280


46
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,500
In these, the end times.

47
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,060
A what can ask?

48
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,100
A biped, a two-legged creature.

49
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,660
I see.

50
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:05,060


51
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,620
Unfortunately, it takes about five years to answer that question.

52
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,780
And I don't know, we'll probably have to sip a little more of this liquid slack

53
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:20,140
before we can really, really try to define that which is the Church of the Subgenius.

54
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,820
Liquid slack, is that what we're drinking?

55
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,380
That's it.

56
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,020
That is brewed from the souls of those who,

57
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,280
those who are not a part of the Church of the Subgenius.

58
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,340
Those who are not subgeniuses, but wanted to be and sent us money.

59
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:30,880
I see.

60
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,000
It's good, isn't it?

61
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:32,780
It's delicious.

62
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,760
It's really good.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,680
Now, you say it's going to take you five years to tell us about the Church of the Subgenius.

64
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,640
Well, the Church...

65
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,740
It's taking longer than that so far to just get started.

66
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,460
This is true.

67
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:43,960
Yeah.

68
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:53,340
If the Church of the Subgenius could be, although it is not a joke, at the end, it could be

69
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,880
the greatest joke ever told.

70
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,280
If Earth can but make it to the punter.

71
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:57,340
Yeah.

72
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:57,340


73
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:57,380
That's the punchline.

74
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes.

75
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,740
And I don't know, I honestly don't know what that punchline is going to be.

76
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,260
Make sure it's the right punchline.

77
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:04,480
Yeah.

78
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:12,100
There is a way that we can sum up the Church in such a way that people will think they

79
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,740
understand it.

80
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,020
Okay.

81
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:20,700
Which is that the Church of the Subgenius was founded in 1953 by J.R. Bob Dobbs, who

82
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,520
is the living avatar of slack on this planet.

83
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,280
Bob came to teach us all about the subgenius.

84
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,000
Bob came to teach us all that we should have slack, that we were born with original slack,

85
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:37,540
but that there is a vast and insidious conspiracy, more insidious than most people ever dream,

86
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,280
trying to sap away our slack.

87
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,980
And you know who that conspiracy is?

88
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:43,620
Oh.

89
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,560
It's them normals.

90
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,520
That's right.

91
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:46,860
Mmm.

92
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,520
Yeah.

93
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,920
It's a conspiracy that doesn't even know it's a conspiracy.

94
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,980
There's a...

95
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,000
It's a go-along conspiracy.

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,100
But have you ever...

97
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,780
Do you know J.R. Bob?

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,260
No.

99
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:57,940
Oh.

100
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,400
Dobbs?

101
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,380
The day I came to know...

102
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:00,520
Yeah, he helped kill him.

103
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,940
Yeah, that's a real funny book.

104
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,500
That's not exactly true, Buck.

105
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,600
It was bad security.

106
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,800
What happened?

107
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,440
It won't happen again.

108
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,080
I don't know.

109
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,180
Stang was standing right there, and his buddies just pow, right in the head.

110
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,180
Oh my goodness.

111
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,060
J.R. Bob Dobbs was shot a year ago January in San Francisco.

112
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:17,660
Oh.

113
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,700
And did you read about it in the New York Times?

114
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,060
No.

115
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,800
Did you hear about it on all things considered?

116
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,460
Did you hear about it?

117
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,760
Was it in the Dallas Papers?

118
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,100
No.

119
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,000
That proves a conspiracy.

120
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,740
It wasn't even in the National Enquirer, dear friends.

121
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,160
Wasn't on Morning Edition either.

122
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:32,680
No.

123
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,120
No.

124
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,220
Bob Dobbs died and life went on.

125
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:36,740
Oh yes.

126
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:43,920
The people just kept going to work every day, not thinking about what they were doing it

127
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,200
for.

128
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,440
They don't have slack.

129
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,500
They don't realize what has happened.

130
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,080
It may be too late for a lot of them.

131
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,640
Did he appoint you as his heir for the Church of the Subgenius?

132
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,700
Was he leading the Church of the Subgenius?

133
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,000


134
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,000


135
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Well, I'm a different person than most others, so I understand what J.R. Bob Dobbs' role

136
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,280
was.

137
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:58,860
Bob leads.

138
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,000
Bob leads by mistake.

139
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,360
He became the leader of this thing by mistake.

140
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,420
He doesn't consciously set out to do anything.

141
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:12,360
A lot of us think he's the world's stupidest man and yet he's so lucky he has attracted

142
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,840
all this wealth and he sells.

143
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,940
He became a salesman and he just sells by pushing himself, which is the product.

144
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,620
In other words, nobody cares what piece of junk they leave with.

145
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,980
They only go in for what they want, they don't say a word to the people who have that.

146
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:24,980


147
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:24,980


148
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:24,980


149
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:24,980


150
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:24,980


151
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:31,420
the treatment which is bob i see g gordon gordon well i just wanted to say that uh a lot of people

152
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:36,140
aren't even aware of the fact that bob is dead and it's it's really presumptuous to speak about

153
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:42,820
an heir to bob at this particular time because bob will be coming back bob will come again there's

154
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:48,340
just no two ways about it when we're not sure and exactly where he will show up but there is no heir

155
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:54,580
to the church the reverend stang was selected by j.r dobbs as the sacred scribe and as the man to

156
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:01,120
stand up and take the heat when bob isn't there to answer for any and everything now i understand

157
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:07,640
that uh there are are some very illustrious members of the church of the subgenius somebody

158
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:14,680
told me todd run grin peewee herman no oh yes as a matter of fact those people those people get on

159
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:20,200
material they don't talk todd asked for us to send him a bunch of stuff and then never send his 20

160
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,420
dollar subscription because i called todd and he told me he never heard of you guys

162
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:37,840
oh i'm not going to argue over rock stars these are mere rock stars and karen you must understand

163
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,620
there are those people who will even though they have used dobbs or they think they've used him at

164
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,160
this particular time of their life to further their careers to further their wealth and their

165
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:54,420
personal standing many people will not admit that j.r bob dobbs is that one person that is

166
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,360
aumed the

167
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:56,360


168
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:56,500
he has

169
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:56,500


170
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:56,580
hade

171
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,160
october

172
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,340
europe

173
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,120
grace

174
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:18,320
something that somehow tilted his fate in the direction it's gone.

175
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,780
But we do have some other people who acknowledge the existence of Bob.

176
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,180
Oh, yeah.

177
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,360
If you want us to name drop, we can name drop.

178
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:24,420
Name drop.

179
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,480
The great saint of the church, George Clinton.

180
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,180
George Clinton.

181
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:29,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

182
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,440
Yeah.

183
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,620
And, oh, Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo.

184
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,880
Devo, okay.

185
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:43,940
Now, we could name some rock stars that are in town right now, but we're just not too sure anymore.

186
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:56,600
G. Gordon Gordon, it's clear to me, Reverend Stang, you know, when you say Reverend Stang and when you say Pastor Naked, that conjures up, you know, we all have, I think, an idea of what that is.

187
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:02,500
Now, G. Gordon Gordon, you need to clue me in as to what role you play in the church.

188
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,720
Well, officially, I am the mercenary of mercy.

189
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,900
And I'm sort of a hit man for Bob.

190
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,660
We say this to ensure disbelief.

191
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,060
Yes.

192
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:20,500
And we don't mind admitting it because just like the CIA and everything else in the conspiracy, if you admit it, everybody doesn't believe it and thinks it's a big joke.

193
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:28,760
But there are certain things that require work of a quasi-legal nature that Bob has to have done for him.

194
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,700
As an example.

195
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,640
Well, certain people have to be removed in certain places.

196
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,840
Security has to be maintained in other places.

197
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,640
Computer fights.

198
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,520
Files have to be emptied.

199
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,980
Sometimes we have to change their minds, so to speak.

200
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,640
So you have your coat on for what reason now?

201
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,840
So you can, so your weapons don't show?

202
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:53,640
No, actually, it's cold in this studio, so I thought that normally, yes, normally, but we, this being Dallas, people frown on you carrying guns.

203
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,400
Malaysia, it's no problem.

204
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,920
Unless you've got presidents in the sights, then you're okay.

205
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,420
Okay.

206
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,060
Reverend Naked, Pastor Naked, forgive me.

207
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:03,920
Whatever.

208
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,520
Tell me what.

209
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,980
What do you think the appeal of this church is?

210
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,780
I mean, since you say it's different from what we know as a church.

211
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,620
I think that just like any cult, when you're starting out, you have to promise something for free.

212
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,520
You know, free money, free love, you know, something for nothing.

213
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:24,300
And we do that more than I think other cults are right now.

214
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,640
In what way?

215
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:34,500
Well, you know, just by the doctrine of total slack and the approach to slack.

216
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:35,700
Okay.

217
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,240
You know, what is slack?

218
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,600
A lot of, a lot of, well, it's getting money for not working.

219
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,780
And it's.

220
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,920
And where does this money come from?

221
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,000
From Bob.

222
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:44,920
Ah.

223
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,740
Money from Bob, friends.

224
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:56,980
And someday money will rain from the flying saucers that shall come on that great day, X day, July 5th, 1998 at 7 a.m.

225
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:05,240
And all the subgeniuses will be ruptured up into the, into the, the pleasure dimension for eternity.

226
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,840
Or depending on how much money they've spent on the church.

227
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,380
Uh-huh.

228
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:14,940
And those who, those who sat around and said, oh, well, I'll, I'll, I'll buy that $1 pamphlet about Bob.

229
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,920
Or I'll, I'll have Bob tattooed on my head.

230
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,200
But I'm not going to send in that $20 for those magazines.

231
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,360
And those people will fry.

232
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:28,120
They shall fry along with the helpless pinks and mediocritans who compose most of what they call humanity.

233
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,820
Helpless pinks.

234
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,980
And also, Pastor Naked, you were going to say something?

235
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,220
What?

236
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:35,220


237
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,640
Well, I'll say goodbye.

238
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:37,560
Okay.

239
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,160
I'd like to say something, if I may.

240
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,660
Yes, you're good, you're good.

241
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:49,420
One of the reasons I think that the church is one of the fastest growing cults in the planet, I would, I would probably estimate, is that, that every.

242
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,760
Now, you just came from Brazil, did you tell me?

243
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,060
Yes, yes.

244
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,780
And there was the church of the subgenius there?

245
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,500
Oh, I am the Pope of Brazil and the Southern Hemisphere.

246
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:56,960
Okay.

247
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,880
And that we're not putting you on.

248
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,320
Okay.

249
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,600
I mean, none of this, everything we've said so far is true.

250
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,240
By what?

251
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,220
By what you would call true.

252
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:05,260
True.

253
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:05,560


254
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,680
But one of the reasons.

255
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:14,060
Because the church accommodates anything in a person's belief system into our dogma.

256
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,820
Anything the subgenius spouts becomes instantly part of our church.

257
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,780
Yeah, you can believe, unlike most religions, you can believe anything you want in this religion.

258
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,000
That's right.

259
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,160
We believe in everything.

260
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:22,840
Okay.

261
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,080
Now, you were making a point.

262
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:33,860
Well, I think one of the points is that the reason why the church of the subgenius is so popular is because most religions of every, of every persuasion of the scripture.

263
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,000
We call them, we call them the false.

264
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,420
False churches.

265
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:41,400
Require a great deal of hard personal work, concentration, studying, deprivation.

266
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,220
The church of the subgenius does not require you to give up anything in your diet.

267
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,700
They do not require you to give up any of those vices that many other religions require you to cease and desist.

268
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,020
We're trying to find new ones.

269
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,180
Now, that's exactly right.

270
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,220
And we know that people don't have time to spend 17 years on a mountaintop meditating.

271
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,100
Is your work the work of the devil?

272
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,820
Let's lay it out right on the table right now in here.

273
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,140
Heck no.

274
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,040
As a matter of fact, I'm.

275
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,900
I wonder about that every now and then, but never for very long, because the devil doesn't operate that way.

276
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,400
We're way too open.

277
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,920
Basically, the devil is as tricky as as as he is.

278
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,480
There you go.

279
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,860
Then, you know, who would he be imitating?

280
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,160
He sure wouldn't be imitating us.

281
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,200
I mean, what would what would that get him?

282
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,880
You're going to find the devil in church.

283
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,580
But not our church.

284
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,220
OK.

285
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,980
Now, there are certain demons that we make.

286
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,020
They have to pay obeisance to.

287
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:42,000
But that's that's that's a business thing that has nothing to do with the actual root.

288
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,200
It's kind of like the relationship of the Justice Department with the mafia.

289
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,700
You know, these are relatively benevolent demons.

290
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,620
OK, well, this is the evening talk show.

291
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,560
And I'm Karen Denard.

292
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,720
Tonight, we're talking with members of the Church of the Subgenius.

293
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,560
They're here talking about the leader congregation and race on data, which which alludes us still.

294
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,640
But if you have a question or a comment.

295
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,580
For Reverend Ivan Stang, Pastor Buck naked or G Gordon Gordon, you can give a call to our Dallas number.

296
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,880
If we have a caller on the line, it must be one of your disciples.

297
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,260
Hi, 90.1.

298
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:16,860
You're on the air.

299
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,480
Yes, this is Tim.

300
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,040
I'm calling from Farmers Branch.

301
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,060
Tim, are you a disciple?

302
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:31,980
Well, I guess sort of Bob really sort of first came into my life back when I was publishing a underground newspaper here in Dallas on the punk rock scene called the Steel Press.

303
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,320
I know who he is.

304
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,640
And Bob.

305
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:41,860
You know, made his appearance in the paper and sort of told me that really what we were doing there wasn't really what we should be doing.

306
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,580
And that from there, we sort of abandoned the paper.

307
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:53,960
And I kind of came into the church in a minor way and trying to help and support the Reverend Buck naked.

308
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,400
And he needs a lot of support, which I appreciate.

309
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:01,320
He needs large wooden sticks holding him up a lot of the time.

310
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,620
Well, Tim, anything else that you want to share with us?

311
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,240
My question is, is I've been involved with the church just in a minor way.

312
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,940
I really haven't subscribed to the church.

313
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,820
I haven't sent in dues or anything like that.

314
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,920
It's never too late, son.

315
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,580
I have tried to help support the Reverend Buck naked.

316
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:23,360
My question is, am I in error with Bob?

317
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:30,620
Am I able to communicate with Bob and be in good grace with him and the church, not being an active supporting member the way I am?

318
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:34,080
But in my own personal life, I'm subscribed to what Bob teaches.

319
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:34,400
Okay.

320
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,360
Well, I've got your question.

321
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:35,840
This is Buck.

322
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,420
Yeah.

323
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:37,580
Yeah.

324
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,340
You know, you've got a gland in your foot called your Bob gland.

325
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:41,820
Yeah.

326
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,740
And I know you well enough to know you've got a Bob gland, and it's active.

327
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,460
You've already been saved.

328
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:54,360
So I think that you ought to just hold on to your foot and chant the name of Bob and try to do the salute.

329
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

330
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,840
How do you do that?

331
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,520
While you do that.

332
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,380
Do that again, please.

333
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

334
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,520
And with your other hand.

335
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,860
And try to write a check to the Subgenius Foundation.

336
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,380
Well, one thing I have done, Buck, I've taken your suggestion.

337
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,280
I do have Bob's portrait hanging up on the wall opposite my throne in the bathroom.

338
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,400
Well, good, because.

339
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,040
And I do contemplate several times a day Bob's face.

340
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,620
Well, I've got news for you.

341
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,020
Bob can watch you back through those strange images of Bob.

342
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,460
That's true.

343
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,620
But don't worry.

344
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,100
There's nothing that he doesn't know about already.

345
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,280
And that is the most holy time of your day.

346
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,500
The time we call excrement.

347
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,000
The time we call meditation.

348
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,040
When you're on that special throne.

349
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:37,620
Yes.

350
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,220
And thinking only of Bob.

351
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,240
Tim.

352
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,600
As you void.

353
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,460
As you void.

354
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,080
Tim, one more thing.

355
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,280
You are partially saved, but as you know, J.R. Bob Dobbs says,

356
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,520
too much is always better than not enough.

357
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,180
And that goes for salvation, too.

358
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,780
Praise Bob.

359
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,840
So write that check as soon as you can, and you'll find even more slack.

360
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,580
Plus, you'll get about 300 pages of stuff in the mail.

361
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,380
All right.

362
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,180
Tim, so glad to hear from you.

363
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:00,800
Thank you so much.

364
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,520
Bye now.

365
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,280
Slack.

366
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,400
All right.

367
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,760
91.

368
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,740
You're on the air.

369
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,580
Hi.

370
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:12,580
I'm a recent convert to the church, although I've known about it for some time since my

371
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:17,880
kid is a big supporter of the church.

372
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,860
But one of the things that...

373
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,520
How did you find out about the church of the subgenius?

374
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:32,460
Well, from my boy, who's an artist, among other things, and kind of a lunatic.

375
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:38,140
But as a result of that, he finds out about many things, and so he told me about these

376
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,420
things.

377
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,080
Uh-huh.

378
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,320
That's how I bought the book, the book of the subgenius.

379
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,780
Available from Better Bookstores, published by McGraw-Hill.

380
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,260
Am I?

381
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,220
Is it really?

382
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:47,660
Yeah.

383
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,160
Yes, it is.

384
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:55,120
I recently bought a new Atari 520SP computer.

385
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,120
Uh-huh.

386
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,440
I know what you're going to ask.

387
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,940
Did you know about that?

388
00:17:59,140 --> 00:17:59,460
Yes.

389
00:17:59,460 --> 00:17:59,660
Yes.

390
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,880
That is Bob in the new Atari.

391
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:08,620
The subgenius minister, reverend householder, was employed by Atari at that time and was

392
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,640
using a Bob image as a test pattern.

393
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:18,160
And they loved it and worked it into whatever that hieroglyphic font that you get with the

394
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,380
Atari.

395
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,480
So Bob is in over five million homes now without those people knowing about it, and he's locked

396
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,680
onto their souls now.

397
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,460
They can't get away.

398
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,440
We'll get that check sooner or later.

399
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:31,700
Well, all they have to do is print character strings 28 and 29.

400
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:36,600
And one line in 30 and 31 to their screen, and they will see Bob right there.

401
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,280
Oh, my goodness.

402
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,100
Take down those numbers, all numerology experts call in.

403
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,680
Yeah, we need to hear from somebody who hates us, though.

404
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,960
Yeah, we need some more hate calls and some numerology.

405
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,080
That's what religion is all about most of the time.

406
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:48,420
Yeah.

407
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,440
I'm sure there's no shortage of those people here, so I'll get off the line and let them

408
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:53,820
call you.

409
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,660
Glad you are.

410
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,960
Thanks for sharing that with us.

411
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,200
There shall be slack.

412
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,220
By now.

413
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:58,660
Yes.

414
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,380
Thanks for sharing that with us.

415
00:18:59,380 --> 00:18:59,660
I'm sorry.

416
00:18:59,660 --> 00:18:59,660


417
00:18:59,660 --> 00:18:59,660


418
00:18:59,660 --> 00:18:59,660


419
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,900
Hi, 90.1, you're on the air.

420
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,620
Yeah.

421
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:11,640
I've just been listening for a few minutes, and I've been searching for a church or something,

422
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:17,500
and I've looked at a lot of things, and I'm already just real interested in this.

423
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:23,080
I mean, I've only heard a few things.

424
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:28,640
I mean, I've only been listening for about ten minutes, so I would just like an address

425
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,060
or whatever.

426
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,360
Okay.

427
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,360
Do you have a pen or a pen?

428
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,280
Sure.

429
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,040
Oh, we're good at giving our address.

430
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:34,760
A what?

431
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,280
We're good at giving that address.

432
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,280
Folks, get a pencil.

433
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:37,780
Yes.

434
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,540
Do you have your pencil?

435
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,580
What I'm saying is I just turned the radio on, and ...

436
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,600
Put your hands on the radio.

437
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,460
Okay.

438
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,280
It's there.

439
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,920
Now feel.

440
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,300
Feel Bob.

441
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,740
Feel the healing power coming through.

442
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,040
While you're holding onto the radio, we're going to hold a picture of Bob up so everyone

443
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,560
can see.

444
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:54,800
Okay.

445
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,240
Look over there on camera four.

446
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:56,560
Zoom in.

447
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,240
See that smiling face with the pipe in his mouth?

448
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,340
And that neat smile?

449
00:19:59,340 --> 00:19:59,340


450
00:19:59,340 --> 00:19:59,340


451
00:19:59,340 --> 00:19:59,340


452
00:19:59,340 --> 00:19:59,340


453
00:19:59,340 --> 00:19:59,340


454
00:19:59,340 --> 00:19:59,340


455
00:19:59,340 --> 00:19:59,340


456
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,420
Right there on the left on monitor three.

457
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,180
That's Bob.

458
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,520
That is Bob Dobbs, the man with the pipe whose face you see on ...

459
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,120
And you can reach that man with the pipe at the sacred post office box.

460
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:09,620
That's right.

461
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,080
Just right.

462
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,600
Bob at P.O.

463
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:21,920
Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

464
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,140
All right.

465
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,040
And I'm sorry that you have to keep repeating this and everything.

466
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,200
It's just that I was captivated by the fact that we're going to talk about the fact that

467
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:29,200


468
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:29,240
But I want to get into the real deal.

469
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,980
I'm glad you brought it up very suddenly.

470
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,840
No, it's the first time we mentioned it.

471
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,580
I'm glad you brought it up.

472
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,260
Not only that, you'll keep ...

473
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,140
And we're only too happy to repeat that box number over and over again.

474
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,420
You'll keep hearing us long after you turn your radio off.

475
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,320
You can turn off your car.

476
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,560
You can shut the power down to your house, and you'll still hear the subgenius hour of

477
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:46,840
slack.

478
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,280
Because you can't turn Bob off.

479
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,500
All right.

480
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,280
Thanks for calling.

481
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,640
I just need to know the name of the book.

482
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,480
Oh, it's called The Book of the Subgenius.

483
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,620
And you can go to Taylor's.

484
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,220
All right.

485
00:20:59,240 --> 00:20:59,980
Go to Taylor's.

486
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,140
Either one of the Taylor's stores.

487
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,020
Why just Taylor's?

488
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,680
You said it's a better book store than everywhere.

489
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,060
Well, I said better book stores.

490
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:05,540
Hard to find.

491
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:10,040
It was, as a matter of ... It came out two years ago, and it was in Walden's and B. Dalton's,

492
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,540
all the big chain stores, in the humor section, Fran.

493
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,500
Yes, the humor, among funny books.

494
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:15,820
Yes.

495
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:22,340
They decided McGraw-Hill, in their infinite wisdom, decided to label the truth humor.

496
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,140
And in a way, it makes sense, because that's the only way the people can take it.

497
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,340
It has to be purtied up.

498
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:31,460
They don't want to believe there could really be a conspiracy.

499
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,580
Oh, the conspiracy, that's just a joke.

500
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:33,880
Oh, yes.

501
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,860
Oh, I wouldn't work for the conspiracy.

502
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:40,100
I wouldn't give my money to the conspiracy on a yearly basis.

503
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,280
I'm not afraid of the conspiracy.

504
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:41,920
Oh, nay, nay.

505
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,380
Oh, no.

506
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,220
Of course not.

507
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,220
10,000 kids a day starve to death in Mexico City.

508
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,800
Oh, it's funny.

509
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,600
Oh, it's all a big joke.

510
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,100
Big joke.

511
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:50,480
Big joke.

512
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:50,940
Right.

513
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,240
Yeah.

514
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,840
The conspiracy doesn't exist.

515
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,700
It's part of the lunatic fringe, right?

516
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,580
Ah, yes.

517
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:56,940
Of course.

518
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,620
Okay, so you got the name of the book.

519
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,380
You have the post office box.

520
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:08,420
Yes, and I'm sorry that things were labeled that way, because it means a lot to me.

521
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,840
Glad you called.

522
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,200
Praise Bob.

523
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:10,640
Thank you.

524
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,160
Praise Bob.

525
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,640
That's a McGraw-Hill book.

526
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,900
They don't list the author exactly.

527
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,380
The author is Subgenius Foundation.

528
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,380
Hi, 90.1, you're on the air.

529
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,180
This is the profit margin.

530
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,480
The profit margin.

531
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,200
There he is.

532
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,220
That sounds like a false prophet to me.

533
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,560
Hardly, but I'm suffering in the midst of a crisis.

534
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:26,560


535
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:26,560


536
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:26,560


537
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:26,560


538
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:26,560


539
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,180
I'm suffering and I was unable to attend last Saturday's great revival.

540
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,720
Well, you would have suffered even more, friend, so maybe it's just as well, because

541
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,920
we were doing sickenings instead of healings.

542
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,400
That's true.

543
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,220
I didn't go.

544
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,580
I stayed at home and practiced pyroflatulation.

545
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,260
Praise Bob.

546
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:42,960
Praise Bob.

547
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,340
So many have forgotten the lost art of pyroflatulation.

548
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:52,300
Well, it can be mastered with work, but I'm suffering terribly from a head cold, and I

549
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,280
know that you know some of the more arcane arts.

550
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,720
Could you help me with opening the third nostril?

551
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:03,320
Well, you're going to need a crowbar, a chainsaw, and a musical, and at least one

552
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,860
subgenius musical group of surgeons.

553
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:11,460
Either More Drunk Cowboys would be the closest, or Doctors for Bob up in Little Rock have

554
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:15,140
probably the most experience with opening third nostrils with crowbars.

555
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:15,800
Let me see.

556
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:23,140
I prefer the punji stick method, which is done only in Dobbs Town, Malaysia, by the

557
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,160
doctors there with a mallet.

558
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:32,400
I'm going to use a 48-ounce mallet and a little punji sticks that the locals call it.

559
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:37,820
Although I do understand in Britain now they're using a croquet mallet and a cricket wicket

560
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,260
for third nostril expansion.

561
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,700
Think this common ordinary drill will do it that I've got here?

562
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,020
That's heresy.

563
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,100
No, sir.

564
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:46,700
No electricity.

565
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,780
Use a nine iron.

566
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,640
Nine iron?

567
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,000
Yeah, a nine iron will work.

568
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,420
Gentlemen, I thank you very much.

569
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,400
Well, so glad you called, Profit Margin.

570
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:53,940
Good evening.

571
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,420
Uh-huh.

572
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:54,560
Good.

573
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:55,420
Hi.

574
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,680
90.1, you're on the air.

575
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,380
Yeah, yeah.

576
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,360
This is Justice Byrd.

577
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,580
Oh, Justice.

578
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,300
How are you doing, guy?

579
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,440
Just fine, Buck.

580
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:01,660
Yeah.

581
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:01,880
Okay.

582
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:07,200
Yeah, well, Buck may not say this, but lately he hasn't been answering my phone

583
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:07,500
calls.

584
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:09,880
Why not?

585
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,980
That's because he's a subgenius.

586
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,540
See, the thing about it is that Buck thinks I've gone over to conspiracy.

587
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,020
Well, you know.

588
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,180
It's just because you quit playing in his band for free.

589
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,740
Come again?

590
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,060
It's just because you quit playing in his band for free.

591
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,160
Oh, that's it.

592
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,600
Well, see, Buck, I can explain all this.

593
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,160
Okay.

594
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:27,640
Explain.

595
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,600
You sure you want to tell everybody on the radio?

596
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,260
We want to hear it.

597
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:34,460
I think I've infiltrated this conspiracy quite deeply, and I'm ready to partner out with

598
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,200
information that could bring the whole thing crashing down.

599
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,260
All right.

600
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,800
And now, the thing about it is it's all very dangerous, and I think I'm being far-

601
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,120
Oh!

602
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,180
No!

603
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,700
They got him!

604
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,320
Dang it!

605
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:45,660
See?

606
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,820
Now, see, that's the conspiracy for you.

607
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,120
That's right.

608
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,560
The conspiracy got him?

609
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,080
You bet.

610
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:50,420
Yep.

611
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,080
Didn't you hear it?

612
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:51,940
I heard it.

613
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:52,600
The line went dead.

614
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,660
They snuffed my old buddy.

615
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,040
They snuffed him.

616
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,380
What?

617
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,000
Because he had proof on the conspiracy.

618
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:57,920
Oh, my goodness.

619
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,140
Well, we'll take another call.

620
00:24:59,220 --> 00:24:59,980
Hi, you're on the air.

621
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,400
Hi, how are you doing?

622
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,400
This is Michael from Dallas.

623
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,460
Michael, you see the company I'm keeping.

624
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,540
You know how I'm doing.

625
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:13,380
I am really stricken to hear that Bob himself has met the stark fist of removal.

626
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,420
Yeah, how about that?

627
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,020
Bad security.

628
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:16,920
Bad security.

629
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,720
If I'd have been there, it wouldn't have happened, but no.

630
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,540
That's what I say, too.

631
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,040
Hey, guy, can I tell you something?

632
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,640
I wasn't in Frisco when they killed Bob.

633
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,660
I was in Malaysia.

634
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,740
I was in a little temple, flapping up with some ministers in Dobstown.

635
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,520
And all of a sudden, outside, they start up this big racket.

636
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,040
And I came outside and said, what's going on?

637
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,300
And they said, Bob's been killed.

638
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,020
Bob's dead.

639
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,600
Bob's dead.

640
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,740
And everybody started working.

641
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,000
Sinners all.

642
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:46,160
I think just as soon as Bob's gone, they can start going back to their conspiracy behavior patterns.

643
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,560
But Bob is watching.

644
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,260
Working meaningless jobs for nothing.

645
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,700
And lucky to get him, too.

646
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,780
And I'm not immune.

647
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,080
I've had to do it just as much as the next guy.

648
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,220
Praise Bob.

649
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,340
Conspiracy does pay better than Bob.

650
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,260
In the short term.

651
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,100
In the short term.

652
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:12,160
But the thing about Bob's death, you've got to remember, Bob always has been saying for years that death is the greatest PR agent.

653
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,880
And you've seen the success that other religions have had with that.

654
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,340
Yeah?

655
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:17,600
Yeah.

656
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:17,680
Yeah.

657
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:17,800
Yeah.

658
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:17,860
So.

659
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:26,480
But on the other hand, it's getting, you know, the church after Bob is so much like, in a way, it's like early Christianity.

660
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:33,780
Suddenly, it's the apostles are fighting amongst each other as to who's the heir of Bob and the.

661
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,280
The false prophets come out of the woodwork.

662
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:36,680
Yeah.

663
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,300
And then you get the followers.

664
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:38,860
Oh, yeah.

665
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,720
We didn't used to have followers because Bob doesn't want followers.

666
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,160
He wants partners.

667
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,080
That's right.

668
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,600
But along came the Bobbies.

669
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,500
The sub-Denis.

670
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:47,580
The Bobbies.

671
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,180
The Moonees, as we call them on the west coast.

672
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,900
They're to Bob what the Moonies are to Reverend Moon.

673
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,260
The difference is Reverend Moon wants those kind of people.

674
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,860
We've, we're trying to avoid it.

675
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:08,120
We try to avoid it by making our reading materials so overblown and dense and our artwork so shocking that the Pinks and the Bobbies and the Mediocratons and.

676
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,160
The Norms.

677
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:09,880
The Norms.

678
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,220
The Glorps.

679
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,780
The Normworms would all, would avoid it, which they did.

680
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,440
And that's why the book isn't a bestseller.

681
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,000
I was going to say, you almost have succeeded in that.

682
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,940
Yes, yes.

683
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,060
And praise Bob.

684
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:21,320
Praise Bob.

685
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,200
I wanted to ask you about the career of the illustrious Bob.

686
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,860
You remember a couple years ago when they were having the presidential elections in El Salvador?

687
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:38,700
And you know, the guy who won is Jose Napoleon Duarte, who is here in the United States right now.

688
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,040
Right.

689
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,380
Do you remember his opponent?

690
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,200
Yes, you're talking about Major Bob.

691
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,440
You're talking about Robert Doosan.

692
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,420
Isn't, isn't Robert Duosan?

693
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,000
Roberto Doosan, Spanish for Bob Dobbs.

694
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,400
Yes, and it was a complete ripoff.

695
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:51,660
I've heard that everywhere.

696
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,400
It's a complete ripoff.

697
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:59,980
He took that name because he felt that it would help him in the third world because he had been in the States and found the power of Dobbs.

698
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,140
And you'll notice that he's out now.

699
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,040
He's just resigned from that figure.

700
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,780
So, so friends, beware of false Bobs.

701
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,160
That was a false Bob.

702
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,020
That's right.

703
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,500
That's right.

704
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,000
That's right.

705
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,520
They're all over too.

706
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,740
You see guys walking down the street with pipes all the time.

707
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,000
You know.

708
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,520
There's, there's a.

709
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,280
I'm really glad you cleared that up.

710
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,600
Okay.

711
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,320
Appreciate it.

712
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:31,160
There's even a, there's even a, a guy, a guy with white shading on his face and kind of a dark, where the light should be light, it's dark.

713
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,600
That's the anti-Bob.

714
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,440
But the neat thing about him is you can stare at the anti-Bob long enough, look in the clouds and you see Bob.

715
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,360
Bob, that's right.

716
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,220
Well, thank you.

717
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,760
You've, you've made me feel better.

718
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,640
I know they, they're very enlightening.

719
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,420
Let me thank you for calling.

720
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:44,840
Bye.

721
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:45,580
Bye.

722
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:45,600
Bye.

723
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:45,600


724
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,660
I'm going to go right now.

725
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:46,820
Oh.

726
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,400
I would like to talk, Reverend Nickhead, about pastor.

727
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,180
Excuse me.

728
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:50,880
Am I giving you a promotion?

729
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,460
Either way.

730
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,000
Either way.

731
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,020
Either way.

732
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:52,600
I love it.

733
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,740
But he is, he is a pastor because he has his own church and his own flock.

734
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,620
Oh, he does have his own church.

735
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:57,780
Right.

736
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,120
I didn't mention my church, did I?

737
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,580
You didn't know.

738
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,800
My church is called The First Naked Church of the Subgenius, and I'm a, I'm a career

739
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:04,740
devangelist.

740
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:09,420
And we were the, my church was the first church to have subgenius devivals.

741
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,360
Mmhmm.

742
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,300
Very first church.

743
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:11,420
That's right.

744
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:15,900
There were only four people at the first one, but there were 3,000 at the last one.

745
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,380
That's right.

746
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,600
Just goes to show you something.

747
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,340
3,000?

748
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:18,860
Where was this?

749
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,840
That was at the Republican National Convention, actually.

750
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,640
Ah-ha.

751
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,360
Yeah, well, it was.

752
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,040
And there are a lot of them who were Dallas police officers who were very polite, by the way.

753
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,040
And I think that the Dallas police appreciate Bob.

754
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,040
Right.

755
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,000
Cops love Bob.

756
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,880
And that's something that, I don't know, is kind of astounding to us.

757
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,700
Well, they have to deal with reality.

758
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,640
They have to deal with reality in its heaviest form all the time.

759
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:49,840
And Bob and the church brushes against subjects constantly that people don't want to talk about.

760
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:57,440
And the church does not in any way advocate anti-social activity in the sort of understood normal sense of the word.

761
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:02,200
We don't advocate going out breaking laws and blowing up clinics and things like that.

762
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:02,800
That's copycat stuff.

763
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,360
So geniuses are original.

764
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,940
Okay, well, let's see if we can.

765
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,480
They subvert in ways that the conspiracy could never guess it.

766
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,040
Okay.

767
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,800
Hi, 90.1, you're on the air.

768
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,560
Yes, this is Dr. Milton Goodrich.

769
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,440
And for some years I've had a problem with constipation.

770
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:24,780
And I understand that Oral Roberts is able to cure that by the laying on of hands.

771
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:30,720
But I don't have the financial resources to go to Tulsa.

772
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,660
Is there any way that.

773
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,940
Let's see if we can get a quick answer.

774
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,300
We have a news break in just a moment.

775
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,260
So we'll get a quick answer for you.

776
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:38,960
My congratulations.

777
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,500
Congratulations.

778
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,460
What a problem.

779
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,260
By the book of the subgenius, read the chapter on power of flagellation.

780
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,700
Put your hands on the radio.

781
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:54,940
Unscrew the back of the radio while you're listening to this show and put your finger against every little shining thing you can find in there.

782
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,140
And pretty soon you'll be loosened up.

783
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,160
Okay.

784
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,780
Now tell me about the healings that you do over the radio.

785
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,480
How does that.

786
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,760
And you do sickenings, too.

787
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,360
We read past lives and concurrent lives.

788
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,160
Concurrent lives.

789
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:07,640
Right.

790
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,900
But there's a media twin.

791
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:13,280
There's a subgenius that exists while they live.

792
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:20,860
And, you know, as the subgenius ascends to their own goals, their media twin may, you know.

793
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:21,500
Right.

794
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:21,800
Right.

795
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,880
Your media twin might be Erica on All My Children or.

796
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,280
Bill Cosby.

797
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,840
Or Johnny Appleseed in a book.

798
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,140
Yeah.

799
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:33,300
I mean, it's not real definite, but you have to have one or else.

800
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:38,480
And if you jump the gun and your soul gets a life.

801
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,360
And if you're a subgenius soul, that is.

802
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:42,820
Uh-huh.

803
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:46,540
The subgenius soul will consume the normal and destroy it.

804
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:54,080
We'll talk more about it if the conspiracy doesn't get us before we go to news headlines from National Public Radio.

805
00:31:54,160 --> 00:32:01,160
We're going to take this quick break and get back to your calls and back with the members of the Church of the Subgenius on this Halloween night.

806
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,140
Stay with us.

807
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,200
President Reagan says the U.S. will be presenting a new arms reduction offer to the Soviets.

808
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,160
Particularly those that are the most destabilizing.

809
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:24,260
From PR News in Washington, I'm sexually active at an arts festival in the eastern Afghan city of Trenton, Texas, where the Trump administration opened fire near migrant children.

810
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:28,440
Four remain in critical condition, including a 13-year-old boy.

811
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,900
Authorities in New Jersey say one person is listening to PR News from Washington.

812
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,060
And thank you, Lee Murr, for the news.

813
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:43,340
Friends, on the last show, I played a song called Big in Real Estate.

814
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,260
And I said that it was by Thunk.

815
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,740
It was not.

816
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:57,600
It was by show business giants from their 1995 album called Let's Have a Talk with the Dead.

817
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,560
Praise Bob.

818
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,540
And now back to our regularly scheduled programming.

819
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,380
Yay!

820
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:04,660
Yay!

821
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,460
Yay!

822
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,000
Yay!

823
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,720
Yay!

824
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,060
Yay!

825
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:07,300
Yay!

826
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:07,400


827
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:07,620
Yay!

828
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:07,740
Yay!

829
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:07,940
Yay!

830
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,060
Yay!

831
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,060


832
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,060


833
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,060


834
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,060


835
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,060


836
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,060


837
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,060


838
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,060


839
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,060


840
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,060


841
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,160
Yay!

842
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,080
Now, Buck, you've got to remember, the microphones can't take the salute.

843
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,900
Too close.

844
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,700
Microphones, in some ways, are like pain.

845
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,780
Too much is better than not enough, Stank.

846
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,700
Yeah, that's true.

847
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,120
This is the evening talk show, as you might have just heard.

848
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,580
Too much!

849
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,380
Too much!

850
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,500
It's always better than not enough.

851
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,600
As you might have just heard.

852
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:31,040
I will just ignore what I heard from Pastor Naked.

853
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,020
Tonight, we're hearing about the Church of the Subgenius.

854
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:34,460
Ignore me.

855
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,540
Some would call it an elaborate joke.

856
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,960
An elaborate global...

857
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:43,860
put on, but no true subgeni would ever admit that, and you've been hearing that tonight.

858
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:49,780
The church exists to serve J.R. Bob Dobbs, and people who deny the reality of Bob are

859
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:54,940
the same people who would deny the existence of Tarzan, Sherlock, and Robin Hood.

860
00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:00,600
Representing the church are Rev. Ivan Stang, Pastor Buck Naked, and G. Gordon Gordon.

861
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:05,560
If you have any questions or comments for these wacky folks, excuse me, wonderful people.

862
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,340
Religious holy men.

863
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,840
Man, if you don't mind.

864
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,500
Fanatics.

865
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,220
Fanatics.

866
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,200
You can give us a call.

867
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,500
We'll go right to this gentleman who is in a phone booth.

868
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,620
Hi, he's still with us.

869
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,800
Would you tell me some of that liquid slack?

870
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,620
Liquid slack.

871
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,160
Pardon?

872
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:20,880
I'm here.

873
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:21,480
Good.

874
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,520
Go right ahead, sir.

875
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,700
It sounded like somebody else was talking back there.

876
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,580
Yeah, well, listen, I'm wondering kind of what's going on with this, with the hype on

877
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,080
this stuff.

878
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:31,960
Hype?

879
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:36,320
Well, it's religious is hype, basically.

880
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,120
Well, we have a...

881
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,300
Yeah, but you've got to admit that puts us in common with quite a few other people.

882
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,420
Absolutely, a bunch of people.

883
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:50,860
And since man has always been hyped up on all kinds of religious things, then this is

884
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:54,740
just another one of the hype, right?

885
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,220
Well, this is the world's one true religion.

886
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,800
All others are false churches.

887
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,620
Well, we believe in all the other ones, and we've borrowed the best parts.

888
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:03,980
Sure.

889
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,940
See, this church is sort of like a monster.

890
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:06,720
Sure.

891
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,100
It's a monster.

892
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,100


893
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,100


894
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,100


895
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,100


896
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,100


897
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,100


898
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,100


899
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,100


900
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,100


901
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,100


902
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,100


903
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,100


904
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,100


905
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,860
They're from the parts of dead religions and then brought back to life.

906
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,280
You know, ever since Bob was a little tiny boy, he looked through all his parents' books

907
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,820
only looking for the good parts.

908
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,760
And he brought them together.

909
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,560
Including the religious documents.

910
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,420
Well, that's good salesmanship.

911
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,080
Bob is the ultimate salesman.

912
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,300
He is the saint of sales.

913
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:32,320
He has a mystic sales ability, and that's why he ultimately got into the religion business.

914
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:37,100
Well, there's always all kinds of doctors that go out.

915
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,860
on and do their sales pitches. No doubt about it. They can sell.

916
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,940
Well, we're doctors, and it's because in this

917
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:48,900
society, you know, nowadays people put a lot

918
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,760
more respect, they give a lot more respect to doctors than they do to

919
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,420
holy men or ministers or anything like that. Pay them a lot more.

920
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:59,260
That's right, they give a lot more money to doctors than they do to ministers.

921
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,300
Yeah, so that's why we're doctors as well as ministers.

922
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,200
Well, the idea, though, basically of man worshiping himself

923
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,900
has carried on through all the...

924
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:14,300
Oh, oh, oh. Now I know what he's talking about.

925
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:18,840
You understand, Pastor Nick? Right, right. He's talking about soloing it.

926
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:22,800
You know. Uh-huh. He's a solo artist.

927
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:26,360
No, I'm not sure he is. Oh, you don't think so? Man worshiping himself?

928
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,000
Think about that. Well, no, man has always

929
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,380
worshipped himself. That's true. Well, you know, some people

930
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,160
say that whereas...

931
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:40,240
Whereas God created man in his image,

932
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,160
the subgeniuses, some say,

933
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,240
that Bob was created in our image.

934
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,240
I personally don't subscribe to that heresy. I'm part of the Orthodox

935
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,460
old-time Stangian Megaphis Temple Lodge.

936
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,200
The old-time subgenius church. I don't go for this humanistic stuff.

937
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,020
Bob is a... He's a space god.

938
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,760
This fella, I think he's got...

939
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,820
A yeti in his blood. And I just say to you, sir, don't marry a human.

940
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,180
Don't taint your blood with the blood of a human.

941
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,880
You sound to me like one of the most pure-blood yetis we've had on the phone yet.

942
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:21,080
Well, there are a lot of... Well, there are a lot of... Basically, a lot of humans around.

943
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:26,440
Oh, you can use them! You can use them! You can... You can talk to them!

944
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:30,100
You can get over them. You can tell them something. But remember, you better marry a yeti gal!

945
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:34,080
No, the idea of saying that

946
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,180
there is...

947
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,940
there is whatever, as far as worshipping,

948
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,720
it all depends on

949
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,320
the human being himself.

950
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,520
It's always been that way.

951
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,980
Do you agree with that, G. Gordon Gordon?

952
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:57,100
Well, I understand what the gentleman's trying to say, but actually, no, it doesn't depend on the humans, because subgeniuses, or subgenii, are not humans.

953
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,640
It's only from the microscopic.

954
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,820
No, what you have to understand is that there are...

955
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,580
See, he's trying to get to the deep level of it.

956
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,120
Yeah. Here's the deep level of it.

957
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:05,900
There are actually...

958
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,260
There are actually only two races on the planet.

959
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,080
All the... the... the...

960
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,360
It's... there's, uh...

961
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,300
two races. Us and them.

962
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:14,820
Them, right.

963
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,580
The humans and the subgenii.

964
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:22,200
The subgenii are the master race, because they come in all colors.

965
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,180
Now, the thing is, people get mixed...

966
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,400
The problem is almost everyone is tainted with human blood.

967
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,560
A full-blood yeti is eight feet tall and has covers of hair.

968
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,540
And has hair all over his body.

969
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,440
Lives naked in the snow.

970
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,880
I didn't know you could do that.

971
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:35,880


972
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,220
You're getting... This is Halloween.

973
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,340
Uh-huh.

974
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,120
All right, let me thank you for calling.

975
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,720
Praise Bob. Praise Bob.

976
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,000
Hi, you're on.

977
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,640
This is Bob from Fort Worth.

978
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:51,420
I was wondering if any of those guys were considering running for president in 1988.

979
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,020
Well, I'm running for mayor in, uh, 87.

980
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,920
And it's, uh...

981
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,180
Yeah.

982
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,700
And it's a big, big, uh, tough race, because it's Stark versus naked.

983
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,540
Stark versus naked.

984
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,380
Yeah. Tell them some of your platforms.

985
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,120
Oh, yeah, my platforms? Can I run them by you?

986
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:08,440
Oh, please.

987
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,260
Okay. My number one platform is free beer.

988
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:12,620
Okay?

989
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,920
That's gonna get some votes.

990
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,380
And the number two is improve mass transit.

991
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:21,660
I say take all these buses that are taking up too much room on the roads and sell them.

992
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,340
And use the money to buy helicopters.

993
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,900
Now, it's true, we'll carry less people, but everyone will want to ride.

994
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,280
Third plank.

995
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,620
Put Bob in the classroom.

996
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,040
And fourth...

997
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,540
And the fourth plank...

998
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,200
Um...

999
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,360
Heck, what was the fourth plank?

1000
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,480
Oh, yeah, that's right. Better street names, which is kinda...

1001
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,580
Like what instead of what?

1002
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,300
Alright, well, Cedar Springs, Sex Avenue, uh, Walnut Hill, Wall Hill, because it's all walls and hills.

1003
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,500
You know, just make them all shorter and make them all more apropos.

1004
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,740
I see. Okay, well, did that answer all of your questions?

1005
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,240
Well, I was gonna vote for Pat Robertson, but these guys sound just as good.

1006
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,640
Vote for Bob. J.R. Bob Dobbs. Write him in.

1007
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:03,820
World Overlord. Bob Dobbs for World Overlord. He ran in 1984.

1008
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,360
For Big Brother. But...

1009
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:09,560
But he got his brains turned into hamburger before the primaries even started, so that's Bob for you.

1010
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,020
Yep.

1011
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,840
We'll take another call. Thanks.

1012
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,200
Hi, 90.1, you're on the air.

1013
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:18,280
Hi, this is Daniel Bass from Fort Worth.

1014
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:18,760
Hi, Dan.

1015
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:25,940
I have had opportunity to study several different, uh, of the cults in the past.

1016
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,120
And it's always fascinated me what they do with Jesus Christ.

1017
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:35,360
And I wanted to know from your guest, what is the opinion about how they do it?

1018
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:40,740
Who they think Jesus Christ is, and, um, about what he did to die on the cross for men's sins.

1019
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,220
Well, I'll tell you what. We have...

1020
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:49,140
It's just like with the theory of the two races. There's apparently, seems to be two jesai.

1021
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:56,140
There's the fightin' Jesus, which a great many subgeniuses actually believe in.

1022
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:04,640
Uh, and then there's the namby-pamby, crybaby, hate everybody, you know, who's not just like you sort of Jesus.

1023
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,860
So it depends on which Jesus you're talkin' about.

1024
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,420
That's between you and him. Okay?

1025
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:15,940
Okay, in that case, I'm talkin' about the, uh, Jesus Christ as he's spoken of in the Bible.

1026
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,940
Which Bible? The censored version? The Greek version? The King James version?

1027
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:27,700
Or the new, new censored Reader's Digest? The one that they're gonna burn for?

1028
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,320
Do you understand where we're comin' from?

1029
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,040
Uh, well, not exactly.

1030
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,620
Stan, can you...

1031
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,540
He's a wise man.

1032
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,720
Stan in line.

1033
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,160
This is a...

1034
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:37,980
Yeah, this is...

1035
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,840
Finally, we begin to hear wisdom.

1036
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:47,180
I'm, uh, the wisdom of the Bible teaches that Jesus Christ is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.

1037
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,260
It goes on to talk about this in Colossians.

1038
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:55,400
It says that, uh, for by him all things are created, things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible,

1039
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,760
whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities, for all things are created by him and for him.

1040
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,080
He is before all things. To him all things hold together.

1041
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,620
All right. Well, I'm glad you...

1042
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,080
You're gonna shut up yourself.

1043
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,360
No, if he's...

1044
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,400
If he's the image of the invisible God, he wouldn't be visible.

1045
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,740
Guys like this, they always miss the good parts, like Matthew 10, 32, where it says,

1046
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:18,360
um, I do not come to bring peace to the earth but a sword. I come to turn a father against

1047
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:23,840
his daughters and against their sons. And he says, nuns, screw up all your other relationships.

1048
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,300
I mean, these guys just have to look at the whole picture.

1049
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,920
Well, wait a minute. You started out by saying that you just wanted to talk about the church

1050
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,620
of the subgenius and you didn't have anything against these other religions, is what you

1051
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:33,820
said.

1052
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,320
No, but they have a lot against us.

1053
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,060
Uh-huh.

1054
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:36,800
Right.

1055
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,200
So, watch them? Is this the...

1056
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:45,280
I'll tell you what. The only people that we don't want as subgeniuses are atheists, because

1057
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,680
they can't believe in Bob.

1058
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,540
Or anything else.

1059
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:53,320
Or anything else. You know, they have the pride to think that that's all there is, is

1060
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:58,840
just them, a bunch of human beings, the highest evolved life form, when, you know...

1061
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,300
So, you want people from other religions to be a part of it.

1062
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,600
And what about the space visitors? I mean, what about the...

1063
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:03,600


1064
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,680
What about the nine elder space bankers?

1065
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:07,300
That's right.

1066
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,080
What about them?

1067
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:14,840
And you know that when the New Testament was written, it was a time of incredible visitation

1068
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,080
by flying saucers.

1069
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:16,360
Yeah.

1070
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,720
The whole thing was written by aliens.

1071
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:21,960
One thing we want to make clear, Bob wants everyone to know that he is not the Messiah.

1072
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:30,640
I know a lot of people are hoping and wishing, but Bob Dobbs is not the Messiah. He denies,

1073
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,460
absolutely, that he is the Messiah.

1074
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:38,720
Bob said, Bob said, those who, those who want to bow down to me, please bend over.

1075
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:46,240
94.1, you're on the air. Hello? That person left us. Let's try this line. Hi, you there?

1076
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,020
Hello, Karen?

1077
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:47,500
Yes.

1078
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,040
Hi. I'd like to talk with Reverend Bucknaggett, please.

1079
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:50,560
He's here.

1080
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:51,080
Okay.

1081
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,140
Reverend, I have terrible news.

1082
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:53,960
Oh, no.

1083
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,200
I have, I've had a vision tonight.

1084
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:57,140
Okay.

1085
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,300
I've seen the anti-Bob.

1086
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,440
Oh, yes. Well, you know...

1087
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:02,440


1088
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:08,720
That's not really too bad. Like I said, just close your eyes when you look at the anti-Bob. Look at the clouds and you'll see Bob. Bob in the clouds.

1089
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,120
Thank you for your infinite wisdom. You've healed me.

1090
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,420
You'll have to wait until in the morning.

1091
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,480
Thanks for sharing that with us. Thanks for sharing.

1092
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:14,740
Hi.

1093
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:18,040
If you didn't see the anti-Bob, he wouldn't have been able to make a phone call.

1094
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,360
Are you sure about that?

1095
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,260
Some of us can handle that. Some of us can handle it.

1096
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,260
Some people just fall on the floor and thrash around.

1097
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:23,580
I'm still here.

1098
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:26,500
Didn't do nothing to me.

1099
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,260
Hello. You're on the air.

1100
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:43,860
This is Phil from Fort Worth. I just want to say that I had never considered myself a subgenius until, or even a classification of, until I had heard these Bob guys talking to me.

1101
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,240
Yeah. Praise Bob.

1102
00:44:46,480 --> 00:45:01,180
Yeah. And I was just wondering if having seen Bob myself in a vision, if you all had ever considered that as being closer to Bob and then thus reaching a platform.

1103
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:01,240
Yeah.

1104
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:01,500
And so that was the first thing that got me to this point.

1105
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:01,500


1106
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:01,500


1107
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:01,500


1108
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:01,500


1109
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,500
And I think that Bob is a great example of a natural plateau of plumb Bob-ness.

1110
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,460
Hey, that's the amazing thing. Bob will reach out to people who've never sent us a penny.

1111
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,060
I know.

1112
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,620
And it sounds like you're one of them.

1113
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:11,320
Well, uh.

1114
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,100
So you.

1115
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:19,000
However, here's the thing. You start playing with Bob without having the full information, and it can get bad, brother.

1116
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:25,280
Well, what would you think is the Bob link between the subgenius and the unbeknown?

1117
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:31,220
Well, Bob said to release the subgenius information to the public, and he did.

1118
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:31,220


1119
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:34,240
told us to start doing it, and that's what we've been doing.

1120
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:38,080
That's what this whole evangelist crusade is all about.

1121
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:43,720
Well, at the same time, though, Bob and the church represent the ultimate mystery.

1122
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:49,840
We're here to show people that think they understand the mysteries, that maybe they don't,

1123
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:54,660
and those who don't believe there are mysteries, that indeed there are some, and it's a good thing,

1124
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,300
because if we knew, we'd really be in trouble.

1125
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:58,480
I don't think we could take it.

1126
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,900
You've got to know nothing.

1127
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:05,160
You've got to be able to be totally stupid before you can be a smarty pants, you know.

1128
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,260
Then we're giving away.

1129
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:13,520
This is mystic wisdom that took guys in the old world thousands of years to develop,

1130
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,380
and we're just handing it out for free over the airways.

1131
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:21,080
You can achieve enlightenment in spare time, in the weekends, after work, driving to work.

1132
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,480
The world's first industrial church, dear friends.

1133
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:24,940
Praise Bob.

1134
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:25,800
We pay taxes.

1135
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,500
This is not a tax write-off scam.

1136
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,440
We have to pay taxes.

1137
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,780
It's a sales tax when we sell our Bibles.

1138
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:36,800
And also, I think we might talk about why we ask people to send money.

1139
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,440
It's not because we need the money.

1140
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,480
Bob is so rich, it's ridiculous.

1141
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:44,380
But we have found that in certain cultures, money is extremely important.

1142
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:51,560
And if we can persuade people to part with just a small amount of that thing that they value so highly

1143
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:56,560
and send it to us, obviously they are losing their respect for that money.

1144
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:58,880
And by sending it to us, and because of that,

1145
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,540
we are beginning to break the hold that the conspiracy has on them

1146
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:05,140
through this little piece of green paper that's circulating.

1147
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:09,280
Every dollar that's given to me, I personally whiff-read each dollar.

1148
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:10,060
You do what?

1149
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:13,240
I actually whiff-read by holding it under my nose,

1150
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:19,500
and I whiff-read it through my third master, which has been penetrated in Malaysia,

1151
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,940
and I actually whiff-read each dollar.

1152
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,000
And what does that mean?

1153
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,480
What does that tell you when you do that?

1154
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:28,100
Well, I'm actually zooming in.

1155
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,140
There's that little part.

1156
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,700
There's that little part of their soul that rubs off on that check or that dollar bill

1157
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:38,420
that comes to me, and I can tell that the true subgenius is from the false subgenius.

1158
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:43,020
Friends, you ought to smell the souls on that famous room full of dollar checks we have.

1159
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:43,480
Yes, indeed.

1160
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,680
Well, I just want to tell you guys, I'm divinely mystified,

1161
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,700
and you'll certainly get my check and support.

1162
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:49,980
Well, hang on.

1163
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:53,900
We'll be reading that box number again at the end of the broadcast.

1164
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,900
We do a regular weekly show.

1165
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,680
I think they do it.

1166
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,000
We do.

1167
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,000
Can we tell them?

1168
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,320
Oh, please.

1169
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:01,140
Of course you can.

1170
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:01,480
Okay.

1171
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,620
Well, you can listen to...

1172
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:08,340
And the unsubgenius, they require this divine mystification also, I think.

1173
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,040
Okay.

1174
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,380
Well, this is Pastor Buck naked again,

1175
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:17,680
and you can listen to Reverend Stang and myself on the Hour of Slack radio ministry every Sunday night.

1176
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,920
Right now it's 1130 to 1230.

1177
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:26,200
They may change the time slightly, but the Hour of Slack radio ministry, 1130 to 1230.

1178
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,280
On KNON, 90.9 FM.

1179
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,060
Right next door to this.

1180
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,300
90.9.

1181
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:31,060
Right next door to this.

1182
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,620
It's the two stations that you can switch back and forth.

1183
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:34,360
Oh, great.

1184
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:35,600
Thanks.

1185
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:36,340
Praise Bob.

1186
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:37,520
Thanks, McCall.

1187
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,440
You have him trained already.

1188
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,180
Hi, 90.1, you're on the air.

1189
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:45,640
Yes, this is David from Arlington, and they've crossed the idea of an anti-Bob a couple times,

1190
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:48,200
and I'm wondering, does the anti-Bob have a name?

1191
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,240
Oboe.

1192
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,140
Oh, no.

1193
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:50,820
Oboe.

1194
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:51,600
Oboe?

1195
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,220
OBOe, Oboe.

1196
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:54,100
That's one name.

1197
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,160
Some people say it's Jim.

1198
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,540
We don't know who he is.

1199
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,700
Some people say it's Jim.

1200
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:58,420
The anti-Bob.

1201
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:58,680
Yeah.

1202
00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:59,560
Some say it's Jim.

1203
00:48:59,640 --> 00:48:59,960
That's a tag.

1204
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:00,960
That's a tag for him.

1205
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,500
When we say Oboe, we mean the anti-Bob.

1206
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,980
We don't know for sure who the anti-Bob is yet.

1207
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,560
Some people think it's Bob's evil twin brother, Jim.

1208
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:11,540
No, Dick.

1209
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,340
Oh, it's a Dick.

1210
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,920
Jim is the bland brother.

1211
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,540
Dick is the evil Dobbs brother.

1212
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,020
This sounds dangerous because you don't have any place to focus your hate.

1213
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:25,600
I wouldn't say that.

1214
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:26,640
Hate.

1215
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,200
This is what?

1216
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:28,440
This is what?

1217
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:33,360
This conspiracy, friends, is so all-encompassing that you can have an all-encompassing hate.

1218
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:36,300
None of this mealy-mouthed, normal hate.

1219
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,120
The normals say, oh, I hate my job.

1220
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,280
I hate President Reagan.

1221
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:40,060
I hate myself.

1222
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,180
I hate my wife.

1223
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:41,500
Yeah.

1224
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:46,940
This is the all-inclusive hate of the conspiracy that is taking away your slack.

1225
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:50,160
And it's so, it permeates everything.

1226
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,940
I mean, it's impossible to get away from.

1227
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,020
I have to work a conspiracy job.

1228
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,980
Pastor Naked has to worry.

1229
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:57,860
You know, it's like.

1230
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:58,820
It's.

1231
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:01,040
You know what I'm talking about.

1232
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:01,520
Yeah.

1233
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:06,000
You come home in the evenings and you've been making big plans all day about what you were going to do.

1234
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:09,660
While you were on your boring job, you were thinking all the great things you were going to do.

1235
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:14,080
But when you got home, so much slack had been sapped away that, well,

1236
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:19,020
it was the most you could do to kiss your kids goodnight and kind of wish you'd had more time to spend with them.

1237
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:24,940
That's the kind of slack the conspiracy chews up and doesn't spit back out either.

1238
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,100
I know.

1239
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,560
I've lost a lot of that kind of slack.

1240
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,240
Hey, they've taken years off of my life.

1241
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:38,660
The worst thing is, is that when they take your slack, then they give you, after a while, when they really get enough of it, then they give you presents.

1242
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:43,940
And the worst thing is, and then you get all this money, the more you get sucked in, the more often they'll pay you.

1243
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:44,620
And that's false slack.

1244
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:53,240
And the reason why it's false slack, though, is that by the time that you get the rewards the conspiracy gives you, you don't have anything left to appreciate it with.

1245
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,760
That's very true.

1246
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:56,740
That's very true.

1247
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,180
And that's the, that's the hollowness.

1248
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,180
The hollowness of serving the conspiracy.

1249
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,700
And that's why I, I, I hate the conspiracy.

1250
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:04,480
All right.

1251
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,280
Let me thank you for calling.

1252
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,660
Notice everyone backs away from the microphone when Buck's getting worked up.

1253
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:12,320
We're back away, hoping that Buck will back away from the microphone.

1254
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,040
Ah, ah, ah.

1255
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:13,820
I hate the conspiracy.

1256
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:14,480
There it goes again.

1257
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,820
I hate it now.

1258
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,260
Oh, boy.

1259
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,740
Poor VU meter's broken.

1260
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:18,500
I know.

1261
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:19,600
We'll take another call.

1262
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:20,600
Hi, 90.1.

1263
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,240
You're on the air.

1264
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:21,500
Hello.

1265
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:21,840
Hi.

1266
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:23,420
I'm Greg from Fort Worth.

1267
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:23,920
Hi, Greg.

1268
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,540
I used to be a Mormon, but I got a feeling these guys have got the idea.

1269
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,060
There's more.

1270
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,900
There's more slack this year than I've ever heard of.

1271
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,860
Hey, we've got more plates than, hey, we've got more Smiths and plates than the Mormons

1272
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:35,960
ever had.

1273
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,680
And we don't just have a small amount of slack.

1274
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,700
We've got more than a bucket of slack, more than an industrial 55-gallon drum of slack.

1275
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:47,120
We have the veritable swimming pool of slack.

1276
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:49,440
That sounds just exciting.

1277
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:52,880
What can I do in a response to this?

1278
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:53,880
Send money.

1279
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:57,260
You can write down our post office box and write for information.

1280
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:59,480
Or send a dollar for the first pamphlet.

1281
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,700
We'll hit you up for a lot more when you get that.

1282
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:07,200
Everyone have those pencils ready to write Bob at the Church of the Subgenius?

1283
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:16,080
P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1284
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,300
You know, we have parties in town, too.

1285
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,180
We have devivals.

1286
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,560
They're almost always at...

1287
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,700
You had one recently, didn't you?

1288
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:22,040
That's right.

1289
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,440
We have devivals, and the last one was at...

1290
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,880
It's called The Twilight Room.

1291
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,680
It's called Circulé Ranch, and they changed the name.

1292
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:31,580
Scariest club in town.

1293
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:32,120
That's true.

1294
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:32,840
Where is this?

1295
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:33,980
2111 Commerce.

1296
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:35,040
In Dallas?

1297
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:36,640
Ground zero of Dallas.

1298
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:40,440
It's Pearl and Commerce in Maine.

1299
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,240
Downtown.

1300
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:42,520
Downtown.

1301
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:46,380
I mean, it's where Maine and Central crossed.

1302
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:51,420
Where that 100-megaton bomb is going to go off about 1,000 feet right above us.

1303
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,160
Straight over the Twilight Room and erase all my tapes.

1304
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,360
Well, that's true.

1305
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:56,360
But I'll tell you what.

1306
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,880
I know a lot of folks there, and they'll be going,

1307
00:52:59,000 --> 00:52:59,680
Come on!

1308
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:00,420
Okay!

1309
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:02,600
Anything else?

1310
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,140
No, that's ample.

1311
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,680
That's more than enough, I know.

1312
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,840
Too much is always better than not enough.

1313
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:08,800
Thanks for calling.

1314
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,680
Now, tell us again what Slack is.

1315
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:13,380
Did we find out what Slack was?

1316
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,780
Let me give a quick reading from the Book of the Subgenius here,

1317
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,200
which is, again, available at Taylor Brooks or McGraw-Hill Book.

1318
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:26,420
Slack is the Aladdin's lamp that opens the other five.

1319
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,240
It is the yardstick by which we should measure ourselves.

1320
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:34,340
It is really the only good reason to get out of bed,

1321
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,740
and if you don't believe that, you're lost in perdition.

1322
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:40,100
The slack that can be described is not the true slack,

1323
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,440
and in its cosmic sense, it is that which remains

1324
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,140
when all that is not slack is taken away.

1325
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:50,240
Yet, it is a trickster, unknowable, uniffable, unsearchable,

1326
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,040
hidden in revelation.

1327
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:55,180
Friends, you were born with original slack,

1328
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:59,140
but your fancy scholars don't even know what it is.

1329
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,840
And that's why the idiot is closer to the divine,

1330
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,720
why Bob is adulated more for his follies than his skills.

1331
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,300
And if you do not believe in slack, my friend,

1332
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:12,900
it will not make itself available to you.

1333
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:13,800
Thank you.

1334
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,600
That was Prescripture 1714.

1335
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:19,620
The way I tell people what slack is,

1336
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:25,160
the way I tell people what slack is, is the conspiracy's got a iron cutout.

1337
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:25,160


1338
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,560
It's got a collar on your neck and a chain,

1339
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,360
and it's got an iron fist.

1340
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:33,580
And how long does it take before the conspiracy monster

1341
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,740
pulls and you stand up?

1342
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,700
That's how much slack you've got in this world.

1343
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:40,340
And slack can either be created or destroyed.

1344
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:43,780
There is a finite amount of slack in the universe.

1345
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,160
Everybody who is a subgenius, whether they know it or not,

1346
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,220
is born with a certain amount of slack.

1347
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,740
And it can only be taken away from you or given back to you.

1348
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:55,080
So if you don't have any slack, you ought to ask yourself,

1349
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,100
who's got it?

1350
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,660
How did they get it?

1351
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,240
And why do they have it?

1352
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:03,440
Anyone who's driving a Porsche doesn't deserve it.

1353
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:03,980
Amen.

1354
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:04,760
Amen.

1355
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:05,440
Amen.

1356
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,040
Pull the wool over your own eyes, friends.

1357
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:08,640
That's right.

1358
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:12,400
Relax in the safety of your own delusions.

1359
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:17,200
Can I get a quick parting remark from all of you?

1360
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:20,320
What thoughts would you want to leave us with?

1361
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,180
Pastor Buck Naked, let's start with you.

1362
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,160
Well, just keep going.

1363
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:25,720
Keep on slacking.

1364
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:26,660
Okay.

1365
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:28,380
G Gordon Gordon.

1366
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,040
Let Bob into your life.

1367
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:30,760
You need Bob.

1368
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:31,840
You must have Bob.

1369
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,740
Bob is here to protect you and help you.

1370
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:36,500
And if you don't know about Bob, you better find out about it

1371
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,920
because time is running out.

1372
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,360
What does the G stand for?

1373
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:40,060
Gordon.

1374
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,780
Why do you have three names that are the same?

1375
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,440
Well, it seems...

1376
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,560
His mother didn't trust him.

1377
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:46,800
His mother didn't trust him.

1378
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:47,160
That's why.

1379
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,360
Actually, it's a very good reason.

1380
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:48,780
What's it got to do with trust?

1381
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:49,860
It's a very good reason.

1382
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,100
It's because it's a lot easier to remember that way.

1383
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,160
My girlfriend, when I was 16, told me that if you don't trust him,

1384
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:58,020
you know anybody with two first names, you shouldn't trust them.

1385
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,040
So obviously his own mother didn't trust him.

1386
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,120
I have three last names.

1387
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:03,880
Oh, I got to get mine in.

1388
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,540
Yes, no, we definitely...

1389
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:06,100
We have time.

1390
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:06,580
We have time.

1391
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,000
I want to hear your applauding remark.

1392
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,480
I'll quote Dr. Gordon and say,

1393
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:14,840
Friends, choose the way you're going to get screwed.

1394
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,640
Some ways are fun.

1395
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:24,540
And send a dollar to P.O. Box 1403-06, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1396
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,380
Praise God.

1397
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:27,680
Praise God.

1398
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:32,860
Okay, yeah, there went the microphone.

1399
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,940
It's $50 worth of microphone there, Bob.

1400
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:37,640
You're going to have to buy us another shurimixer too.

1401
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:43,340
Okay, we still have two more minutes, so I'm just wondering if there's anything left unsaid.

1402
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:46,460
Is there something on this Halloween night that we want to leave?

1403
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:51,000
Well, it's sad that we couldn't play any of the tapes because we do a lot of our work,

1404
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,180
our audio work, and you can hear that on our radio show.

1405
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,140
A lot of our ministry work is tape.

1406
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:55,140


1407
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:58,880
I would really like to have done a healing over the air, too.

1408
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,600
Well, how would you have done that?

1409
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,900
Well, I mean, you just...

1410
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,100
I have to find out what their problem is before.

1411
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,700
I mean, I don't just heal anything.

1412
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,020
I mean, I might heal the wrong thing.

1413
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:10,780
You got your glam scaping, your acubating.

1414
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:12,020
Where does it hurt?

1415
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,460
That's what I always ask.

1416
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,580
We'll hit the part on the opposite end of that.

1417
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:16,960
What if your emotions hurt?

1418
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,900
Let's say you got your feelings hurt

1419
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,260
or somebody's not speaking to you or something.

1420
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,640
I mean, can you heal that kind of thing, too?

1421
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:24,340
Sure.

1422
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:25,880
I'll talk to them if that's all it takes.

1423
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:28,540
One quickest way is take all their money

1424
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:30,880
and they'll pretty quick have something else to think about.

1425
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:31,400
That's right.

1426
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:34,440
That's sort of fiscal acubating, that's called.

1427
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:38,480
So the idea is to give people something else to think about

1428
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,980
and that's the way you heal them.

1429
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,340
It's like acubating.

1430
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,540
You see, like if your leg hurts and you can't get rid of the pain,

1431
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,060
you smash yourself on the elbow with a ball-peen hammer

1432
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:49,340
and immediately that leg no longer bothers you.

1433
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:53,180
The slack that comes when you stop hitting yourself on the head with a hammer

1434
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:54,320
is amazing.

1435
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:56,060
Among the truest kinds of slack.

1436
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:56,640
Yes.

1437
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,520
And that about sums it up, I guess.

1438
00:57:58,940 --> 00:57:59,300
Right.

1439
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:01,480
It's kind of like those Zen masters who have to,

1440
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,960
they'll come up, well, what is slack, subgenius master?

1441
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,580
Then you just have to give them a good rep.

1442
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,520
Hit them a whack and that's it.

1443
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,000
Good whack on the head.

1444
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:10,660
A good rep.

1445
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:11,160
Okay.

1446
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,800
We should mention head launching, shouldn't we?

1447
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:13,200
No.

1448
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,380
We don't have time.

1449
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:14,940
We don't have time.

1450
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:18,340
They'll have to come to the next devival to see a head launching

1451
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:19,560
or get their own launch.

1452
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,380
Well, my goodness.

1453
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:24,060
Pastor Bucknay.

1454
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:28,280
Head, Dr. G. Gordon Gordon and Reverend Ivan Stang.

1455
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:33,280
Let me thank you all very much for filling us in on the Church of the Subgenius.

1456
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:37,760
It's been, as I mentioned before, very enlightening to hear all about it.

1457
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:38,540
Swing and time.

1458
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,940
Is there something you want to say to me?

1459
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:41,240
Sure.

1460
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:48,140
Praise Bob.

1461
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:48,900
Praise Bob.

1462
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,160
Thanks so much.

1463
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,800
I'm back in 23 hours, I hope.

1464
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:53,700
Fire and fire.

1465
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:59,460
And until then, have a happy Halloween and watch what you ask for because you might get it.

1466
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,780
I'm Karen Denard and thank you for listening.

1467
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,680
Thank you, Karen Denard.

1468
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:10,580
I wondered what happened to her and all I could get from Googling was that she had left KERA in 1994.

1469
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:17,160
Anyway, this is normally the hour of slack, which is normally much less normal.

1470
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:23,100
Dang near every show we ever did can be found in the radio section of subgenius.com.

1471
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,320
If you really look...

1472
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:26,260
And remember to scroll down.

1473
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:29,480
Not everybody can do either of those things.

1474
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:36,540
That's subgenius.com, which also leads you to several other subgenius shows, old and new,

1475
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:42,460
and many subgenius Facebook pages, the number of which is too damn high.

1476
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:53,320
Also, our catalog is there and my YouTube page link and something like 200,000 pages of text and art

1477
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,140
and even...

1478
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:54,320
And even...

1479
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:54,320


1480
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:54,320


1481
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:54,720
And even...

1482
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:59,760
Naked pictures from the olden X days before the girls' grandmas got on the internet.

1483
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,440
Subgenius.com.

1484
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:07,120
This music in the background is the swinging love choruses.

1485
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:22,280
And now we're in the internet-only part of the show where I can talk about stuff that I can't talk about on broadcast public-supported radio.

1486
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:33,980
Because you can't talk about anything that would make you money if you're doing a public-supported station show.

1487
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,660
Lonesome Cowboy Dave's situation, friends.

1488
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:45,500
He's still in the nursing home, but he's still planning to do shows.

1489
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:50,180
He can't walk very well, but he can talk, just like always.

1490
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:51,700
And...

1491
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:52,820
And...

1492
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:53,640
And...

1493
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:54,300


1494
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:54,300


1495
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:54,300


1496
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:54,300


1497
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:54,300


1498
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:54,300


1499
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:54,300


1500
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:54,300


1501
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:54,300


1502
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:54,300


1503
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:54,300


1504
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:54,300


1505
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:54,300


1506
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:54,300


1507
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:54,920
His...

1508
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:58,260
Because of weird state laws...

1509
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,200
Well, he's a ward of the state at this point.

1510
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:05,840
They're probably going to end up putting him in government housing, which is good in a way.

1511
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,780
But they're going to dock any kind of money he gets.

1512
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:18,100
So, for now, the fundraiser for Dave is the Subgenius donation button.

1513
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,960
You just have to leave a note there that you want it to go to Dave.

1514
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:22,720
It's...

1515
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,120
It'll be between...

1516
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,600
Between us and us.

1517
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,560
That's on the front of subgenius.com.

1518
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:33,760
And it's also on the Hour of Slack radio section page.

1519
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:40,280
Meanwhile, Dave's book, Neighbor World, is still available.

1520
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:42,280
And it's...

1521
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:47,660
He gets more if you buy it from us instead of amazon.com.

1522
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,100
Plus, I'll sign my little foreword.

1523
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,080
And the book of the Subgenius is still...

1524
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,660
In print after...

1525
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,900
For about 40 years, strangely enough.

1526
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:02,180
And you can get a signed copy...

1527
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:03,880
Signed by me.

1528
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:08,100
If you order that from us instead of amazon.

1529
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,100
And...

1530
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:11,700
It's the best thing we ever did.

1531
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:12,980
Uh...

1532
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:17,100
One of the other best things we ever did was Arise the Subgenius movie.

1533
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,640
Which is on the DVD.

1534
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,160
And has not been updated since 2005.

1535
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,300
And still has the...

1536
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,300
The wrong old Cleveland address on it.

1537
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:30,640
Meanwhile, Sandy Boone's new Subgenius movie...

1538
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,360
Which is actually better...

1539
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,800
Well, we're still waiting on that.

1540
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:35,840
They got a distributor.

1541
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,560
But, uh...

1542
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:40,740
This is a real bad time to book a movie...

1543
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:41,480
A movie...

1544
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:42,760
Into theaters.

1545
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:45,080
You know...

1546
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:51,400
I'm really hoping we start seeing it on streaming somehow soon.

1547
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:53,580
Uh...

1548
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:54,100
And...

1549
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:56,040
There's new, uh...

1550
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,920
Forums you can find.

1551
01:02:58,020 --> 01:02:58,480
Uh...

1552
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:01,340
If you look at subgenius.com, there's links right up front.

1553
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:05,800
There's dobbs.town on Mastodon.

1554
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:09,280
Which is non-Facebook, non-Google.

1555
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:11,900
And it's really very active.

1556
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:12,660
Uh...

1557
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:16,220
Dr. Onan Kanabite is the mayor of dobbs.town.

1558
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:19,460
If you type in dobbs.town, you'll get there.

1559
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:20,560
But you have to email...

1560
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:21,740
Onan.

1561
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:22,740
Uh...

1562
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,500
Uncle Onan at gmail.com and ask him.

1563
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:29,020
Or...

1564
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:30,880
You have to be a Subgenius minister.

1565
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:35,220
You'll be able to do it if you join the church.

1566
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:36,720
Subgenius.com.

1567
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:41,220
And there's also a new forum with video and all kinds of stuff.

1568
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:42,440
Uh...

1569
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:43,320
Dobbscord.

1570
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,220
Kinda like Discord.

1571
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:47,020
It's on Discord.

1572
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:51,420
Which, again, is like less conspiracy than Facebook.

1573
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:51,980
Or Google.

1574
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:59,780
And that address is discord.subgeniuses.com.

1575
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:02,380
Dr. Fox runs that one.

1576
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:07,580
And he owns subgeniuses.com.

1577
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:08,940
Heh heh heh.

1578
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:10,040
Heh heh.

1579
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:10,520


1580
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:11,320
Hmm.

1581
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,100
And friends, uh...

1582
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,240
Thank you for listening.

1583
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,000
Uh...

1584
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,560
Princess Wee is busy upstairs on Zoom.

1585
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:20,420
Rehearsing.

1586
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:25,180
Rehearsing with her Cleveland, uh, folk band.

1587
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:27,920
And, uh...

1588
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,280
Uh, Buddy's okay.

1589
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:38,300
Well, he has a dent in his head where the snake bite caused muscles to atrophy.

1590
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:43,280
His jaw muscles just shrank away on one side of his head and he looks slope-headed.

1591
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:44,820
What?

1592
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,260
Feed me a diploma.

1593
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:50,680
I like it better than...

1594
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:50,680


1595
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:50,680


1596
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:50,680


1597
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:51,120
Loved liver.

1598
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,340
I like it better than spleen.

1599
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:55,640
The

1600
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:12,800
I like gravy with my hair.

1601
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,280
I am a preserve.

1602
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,760
I like gravy with my hair.

1603
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:19,420
Lovable...

1604
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:20,660
I like garlic.

1605
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:20,660


1606
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:20,660


1607
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:20,660


1608
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,540
And the hair is high in fiber

1609
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,360
The Swingin' Love Corpses, friends.

1610
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:38,360
And I think, I don't know if you,

1611
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:41,400
well, actually, you can download probably that whole album.

1612
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:44,800
That was Bay Mixes, tape one.

1613
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:49,300
You can get that from quiveringbrain.com,

1614
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:51,000
which is Philo's domain.

1615
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,800
I should have mentioned quiveringbrain.com.

1616
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:58,420
He's got all kinds of really weird and interesting stuff there,

1617
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:01,200
including his own kind of an irregular show

1618
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,620
where he just, he's a real collector

1619
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:08,840
of weird and offensive music.

1620
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:12,960
And he's got all that stuff for you to steal,

1621
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,160
I think, on quiveringbrain.com

1622
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:17,780
and much, much more.

1623
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,920
And we will be doing live shows still.

1624
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,840
In fact, I think we'll probably do one with Philo pretty soon.

1625
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:26,960
Maybe Philo and Onan.

1626
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,820
Maybe Philo and Onan and Sterno.

1627
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:31,660
Maybe Philo and Onan and Sterno and Doug Wellman

1628
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:33,460
and Princess We.

1629
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:36,060
And the reason I mention those gentlemen

1630
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:39,480
is because, well, we have a special club.

1631
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:41,840
Okay, Price Bob.

1632
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:47,080
Free your radio and your mind will follow.

1633
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,280
Free think radio.

1634
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:51,440
Radio is your one-stop source

1635
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,040
for all the subgenius radio shows,

1636
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:58,340
including the Hour of Slack every Thursday at 11 a.m.

1637
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:01,580
Also on freethinkradio.com.

1638
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:05,460
At different times, you can have time for the show,

1639
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:08,400
National Cynical, Puzzling Evidence,

1640
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:10,800
Bob's Slack Time Funhouse,

1641
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:13,880
Fergan Fridays, and much, much more.

1642
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:19,200
All in one place at freethinkradio.com.

1643
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:22,540
And I'm Tom Hiddleston.

1644
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:22,600


1645
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:22,600


1646
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,180
Bye-bye.

1647
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:27,040
Gee, I want to try triology.

1648
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,100
All the kids are doing it, Mom.

1649
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:34,180
There's a Dobbshead in every bar of triology soaps.

1650
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,240
Yes, friends, triology soaps

1651
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:40,380
with an actual Dobbshead made of soap

1652
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:45,480
embedded in an outer shell of translucent soap.

1653
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,340
You can see the Dobbshead inside.

1654
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:55,500
side. It tells fortunes as you rotate it swiftly, lathering away the conspiracy stench and other

1655
01:07:55,500 --> 01:08:02,020
schmata. If the Dobbs head happens to come up in the end, in the true perfect pipe placement

1656
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:10,180
position, you have good luck all day. If it comes up the other way, 20 more years of winter.

1657
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:20,080
That's TriologySoaps.com. They come in every flavor or scent. You probably don't have to eat

1658
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:27,040
them, but they come in so many different scents, you won't believe it. It's not nonsense. It's every

1659
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:36,460
possible scents with funny names and good smells. You can contact www.TriologySoaps.com

1660
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:40,020
and get clean at Triology Soaps.
