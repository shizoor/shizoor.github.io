1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,180
I don't want to start yakking until I can see a bog.

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,060
Volume! That's me. No, I'm the one with the volume. They don't need to turn it up.

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,320
I haven't even started yet. This is the sound check.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,260
It'll be going on for another hour and a half since this is a subgenius show.

5
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,700
There we go. Okay.

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,560
Let's just watch this one-minute commercial and then we'll begin.

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,580
The subgenius power of sweat.

8
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,380
There's a better, long-lasting, healthy way to help yourself.

9
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,000
Just a pill. Maybe a drink at night.

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,980
The older you get, the more somehow your priorities change.

11
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,820
I mean, most people go, my number one priority is sex, baby, sex.

12
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:59,660
But, you know, really, you can go a lot longer without sex than you can go without urinating.

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,740
So is sex really the first thing in your life?

14
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:10,000
If you start making a list, it'll be down there around number 11, just before Bob.

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,560
If you're really messed up, it'll be after Bob.

16
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:22,640
But I think breathing was, air was number one priority, and I think drinking water was next,

17
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,720
and then urinating, then eating, then crapping.

18
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,560
And stuff like money and...

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,680
sex are pretty low down there.

20
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,320
Your back not hurting is like number five.

21
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,860
So we're a practical religion, friends.

22
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,940
You know, like I say, we don't even get to Bob up until 11 or so.

23
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,520
And this is 11.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,520
Actually, it's 1,113.

25
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,440
That's how many of these weekly shows we've done since 1985.

26
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,780
And what you just heard was recorded at the Starwood Festival,

27
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,560
2000.

28
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,280
2007.

29
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:07,640
And most of this whole episode was recorded on that same location at 10X Day,

30
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:13,560
the subgenius event at Brushwood in deepest New York.

31
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:20,840
And this year, we had Dr. Howell and Reverend Filippo Abernathy there doing live show with us

32
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,120
and other gorillas and demons.

33
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:25,580
Right?

34
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,280
Five people.

35
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,700
Anybody else have a gorilla and demon list?

36
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,520
That they want to share with us?

37
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:30,680
Yeah.

38
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,740
Are there any of those left?

39
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,880
Because those guys didn't really have that many of them.

40
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,740
There's still some left.

41
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,220
There are some.

42
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:35,940
There are some.

43
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,080
Yeah.

44
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,600
If you want to fill one out, please feel free to.

45
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,780
You're free, your inner gorilla.

46
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,680
And demon.

47
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,540
And demon.

48
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,900
So there we are.

49
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,400
And as a matter of fact, as we traveled, we saw more.

50
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,560
And it was over there.

51
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,140
I saw too much.

52
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:57,900
Yeah.

53
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,300
I wish I could forget.

54
00:02:59,360 --> 00:02:59,540
Yeah.

55
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,100
I wish I could forget some of it.

56
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,340
I wish I could choose which to forget.

57
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,420
Boy, that would be great.

58
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,920
Selective forgetting?

59
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,600
We were just talking about that.

60
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:07,620
Yeah.

61
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,720
When I start thinking of things that I want to forget, it always backfires.

62
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,540
You know?

63
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,660
It's difficult.

64
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,880
That's the ultimate example of that is that beautiful movie, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,

65
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,820
where that happens.

66
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,880
They selectively forget.

67
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,540
Yeah.

68
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,660
I saw that, but I can't remember it.

69
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,520
Ah, that's because you selectively forgot it.

70
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,240
Yeah.

71
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,380
It worked.

72
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,680
It was a movie that worked, I guess you could say.

73
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:38,640
I think your thing is that you are able to take all the things that have happened to you

74
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,560
and use them as fuel.

75
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,340
There's no need for you to selectively forget.

76
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:49,260
I think you're able to channel anything that's negative that's happened to you into your head.

77
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,580
Oh, that's what you think.

78
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,180
No, you can't do that.

79
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:52,340
Oh, no.

80
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,180
We bottle up the really bad ones now.

81
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,320
We keep those bottled up.

82
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,200
Because you need...

83
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,220
Yeah.

84
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,640
You need the pressure from that to release the good ones.

85
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,200
You use that.

86
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,580
That's what keeps everything compressed.

87
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,840
Plus, you can't...

88
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,200
That's a more valuable soul to the aliens, the ones that have a lot of anguish.

89
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,640
Steeped in it.

90
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,300
Steeped in anguish.

91
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,520
Yeah, the souls that have redolent of anguish and pain.

92
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,660
That's what really gets the aliens off.

93
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:25,600
You can get a lot more money for a tortured subgenius soul than a complacent pink soul.

94
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
In fact, really, they just use it.

95
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:35,980
The subgenius souls are so rare that they use those as flavoring and condiments on the pink souls that they...

96
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,660
I guess that's what they're hooked on.

97
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:37,960
Yeah, a little dab will do you.

98
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,580
That's what they can afford.

99
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,540
A little dab will do you.

100
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:40,920
It's true.

101
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,640
It's much...

102
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,720
The subgenius brain just tastes richer, I think.

103
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,100
It's just more...

104
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,940
I don't know.

105
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,800
Just more meat in it.

106
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,460
They smell awful, though.

107
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,000
Well...

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,600
You don't have to keep them in your basement.

109
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,900
We keep...

110
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,900
That's not a rumor.

111
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,900
A lot of people...

112
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,580
We just had the one in our freezer.

113
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,020
They must be kidding about the canisters full of souls in the basement.

114
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:09,680
But the sad thing is it's really true and there really are probably 3,000 of those canisters now.

115
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,460
In your basement?

116
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,100
And rusting.

117
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,520
We probably can't even crank the valve on most of them.

118
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,160
They've been there since the 80s.

119
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,900
I just had the one frozen one that you gave us that we've just been slicing little slices off it for years now.

120
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,660
But you never know when it's going to be cut with bad soul.

121
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,640
Well...

122
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,620
There's a lot of different kind of subgeniuses that join up.

123
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,040
And I'm sure when we get home and process all these new memberships, the most of them will kind of go...

124
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,860
Oh, that's a good one.

125
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,700
You know, you can kind of smell a little bit as it passes through.

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,400
And...

127
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,680
That one's okay.

128
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,140
You know, another $30 well spent by that person.

129
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:44,360
And...

130
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,440
Oh, God!

131
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,240
Oh!

132
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:46,960
Oh!

133
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:47,700
Not...

134
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,820
I remember that one.

135
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,280
I remember you showed me that one.

136
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:50,960
Every now and...

137
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,560
It's like every seventh or eighth one you run into a bad soul.

138
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:54,920
Yeah.

139
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:55,960
You know, a bad...

140
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,600
A chameleon soul.

141
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,620
A lizard soul.

142
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,160
Mm-hmm.

143
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,980
It changes.

144
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:00,740
Uh-huh.

145
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,420
Because you got to...

146
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,580
You can't be a lizard soul.

147
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,240
You don't want to have a lizard soul that changes all the time.

148
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,100
Because then you have to think all the time to cover what...

149
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,480
To remember what lies you told to who.

150
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:19,460
As Mark Twain said, if you always tell the truth, you don't have to think about anything.

151
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,500
And if we could be as pure as Bob...

152
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,620
He doesn't have the guile to do that.

153
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,160
He doesn't have the guile to lie.

154
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,940
He doesn't have the sense to lie.

155
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,440
Lying is what makes us human.

156
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,300
It's what separates us.

157
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:39,120
Our social habits are so much more complex because they're built on lies, on tricking

158
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,140
the other monkey, as cynical as that may sound.

159
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:51,260
And our goal is to be more like Bob, to grin happily and emptily without suspicion because

160
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,980
we would have to be as lucky as Bob.

161
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,820
You wouldn't have to worry about anything.

162
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,600
Of course, we're not.

163
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:55,600


164
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:55,600


165
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:55,600


166
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:55,600


167
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:55,600


168
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:55,600


169
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:55,600


170
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:55,600


171
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:55,600


172
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:55,600


173
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:55,600


174
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:55,600


175
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:55,600


176
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:55,600


177
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:55,600


178
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,960
We're never going to be like Bob.

179
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:02,440
But that's a good sort of a direction to head in.

180
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:02,980
I hate those shirts.

181
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:03,680
They're so stiff.

182
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,360
You can never get where Bob is, but you can follow in his trail, which is pretty easy

183
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:08,760
to do.

184
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,200
I tried on one of his shirts that one time.

185
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:10,740
It was impossible.

186
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:11,980
I'm sorry.

187
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,180
You can...

188
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,560
He leaves a trail, but you can smell it.

189
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:22,700
And plus, if you walk around here, you will occasionally find little piles of cotter pins

190
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,320
and jello.

191
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,760
And that's how we know Bob has been here.

192
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,680
And he has.

193
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,820
He comes to Brushwood a lot.

194
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,720
No, I didn't know this.

195
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,080
Yeah.

196
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,320
Cotter pins and...

197
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,020
You didn't know that?

198
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:34,460
No.

199
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,440
And he's always...

200
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,340
It's my first time here this time.

201
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:36,820
He's always just missing.

202
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,280
Every time that's happened, the smoke was still lingering in the air.

203
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,420
The jello was still quivering.

204
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,800
It hadn't melted in the sun.

205
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,400
And the cotter pins, well, they just...

206
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:47,680
Yeah.

207
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,220
Well, he always had those around the house.

208
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,240
Just jars of them.

209
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,080
Well, we don't...

210
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,300
I don't know what the deal is.

211
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:54,300


212
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,700
I don't know what the deal is with that, but that's how you know you've just missed

213
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:56,960
Bob.

214
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,140
He's just been there.

215
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,900
And believe me, friends, that's the best way to know Bob.

216
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,220
Is be right on his tail, but don't catch up with him.

217
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:07,920
No.

218
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,480
Because his slack has to come from somewhere.

219
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,380
Now, where do you think it comes from, my friend?

220
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,920
He's the vortex, the whirlpool.

221
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,020
He sucks it in.

222
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,380
You come close, and suddenly you're like one of those little nubs in the computer graphics

223
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,480
program that suddenly move together.

224
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,200
Like magnetic things that suddenly suck in.

225
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,740
And when it's over with, Bob's still there.

226
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,980
Where are you, my friend?

227
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:30,420
Yeah.

228
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,980
I was hitchhiking once with Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger years ago.

229
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,520
Again, I'm going back to the 80s here.

230
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,960
And we were in this horrible little median strip in the middle of Chicago.

231
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,360
Where four freeways merged.

232
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,320
It was a terrifying little spot that nobody could really slow down in.

233
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,820
But some completely tripping trucker had dropped us off there.

234
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,480
And so we're...

235
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,940
We're standing in this little triangle with our thumbs out and our signs.

236
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,040
And the traffic is whipping by.

237
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,200
And we're just kind of terrified.

238
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,260
And we see a car.

239
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,340
It's this...

240
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,460
I forget what it was.

241
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,040
It was a really nice Detroit car coming by.

242
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,460
And you could see from far away that it didn't have wheels.

243
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,380
There were no wheels in the car staying.

244
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,160
And I don't know if I've ever told you this.

245
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:18,880
Yeah, you did.

246
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,360
Yeah.

247
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:19,500
Yeah.

248
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,900
And it went right by us.

249
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:31,540
And just as he started to approach, he took the pipe out of his mouth, smiled, waved,

250
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,580
put the pipe back in his mouth, still smiling, and drove past us.

251
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,240
And it was Bob.

252
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,920
And we were so glad he didn't pick us up.

253
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,360
Philo and I had a real similar...

254
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,000
That was the only car that passed us that we weren't glad that picked us up.

255
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,060
Philo and I have had similar experiences where we saw Bob drive by.

256
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,320
That's it.

257
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:49,820
Yeah.

258
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,200
It's like he's just letting you know that he's there.

259
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,620
Yep.

260
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,880
He's not really watching.

261
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,420
I wouldn't want to ride him, I think.

262
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:55,460
He's just there.

263
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,220
At least I...

264
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,120
I don't know if I'm ready for...

265
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,340
I'd ever be ready for a ride from Bob.

266
00:09:59,340 --> 00:09:59,620
I used to...

267
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,020
I had a nightmare once where I went to the door...

268
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,900
The doorbell rang in the wee hours of the morning, which is creepy.

269
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,380
And I went to the door and standing there was J.R. Bob Dobbs.

270
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,700
But in the dream, I knew it wasn't really him.

271
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,940
It was something making me see Bob.

272
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,260
And that was a really...

273
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,580
That was a real nightmare that I woke up sweating.

274
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:27,820
Now, we know from alien abductions that if you think it's a dream, that's just what they

275
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,680
want you to think.

276
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,160
They always set it up to where it's real dream-like, where you wake up in bed going,

277
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,380
I've been abducted.

278
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,400
Oh, no, I just had a dream.

279
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,060
One of the last things they say is, this was a dream.

280
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,040
Oh, but they always do it that way.

281
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,480
See?

282
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,980
They hide it in plain sight.

283
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,180
You must drink the nectar of forgetfulness.

284
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:44,400
That's how the conspiracy works.

285
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,940
They hide every...

286
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,420
It's all so obvious.

287
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,840
They don't even have to hide it.

288
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,380
What makes...

289
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:56,320
What amuses me is these nuts that get stuck on one tiny aspect of the conspiracy like

290
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,000
the Masons.

291
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,100
And they found these secrets that were hidden.

292
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,540
And they're not even really hidden.

293
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,640
They just weren't commonly known because nobody gives a hoot.

294
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:12,440
But to the kook mind, the connections all add up to a deliberate conspiracy of, the

295
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,200
Masons don't have anything exciting enough to hide.

296
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,060
Believe me.

297
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,340
The secret of the universe is...

298
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:23,660
The ones that do have something worth, a secret worth hiding, you don't know about

299
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,820
because you ain't J.R. Bob Dobbs.

300
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:30,600
And you aren't, you never made it to the top rungs of the conspiracy ladder before, rebelling.

301
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,540
Nor have I.

302
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,420
So I'm just taking his word for it, I suppose.

303
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,620
The secret is...

304
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,860
But then we have to assume quite a bit these days now, don't we?

305
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:44,500
We have to assume that this is some sort of planet Earth, which we've lately found out

306
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,460
is not so at all.

307
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:52,100
We have to assume that this year is 2007, even though by obvious, it was obvious this

308
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,220
morning at 7 a.m. that this could not be the year 2007.

309
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,260
Why is Danny Elfman hollering in the background?

310
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,120
He's always doing that.

311
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,040
Have you heard his instrumental orchestral symphony thing?

312
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:07,680
No.

313
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,680
He has a new symphony.

314
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,520
I bet it all sounds like Batman.

315
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,380
And here's another weird publication.

316
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,900
Starwood 27 Tour Guide.

317
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:21,760
This is as good for laughs as the Weekly World News.

318
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,340
And it's about as accurate, actually, if you try to stick by the schedule.

319
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,380
But traditionally, I love to go through the...

320
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,640
Before we start making fun of the subgeniuses, we have to make...

321
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,100
The pagans actually pay us to make fun of them.

322
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,360
Christians don't pay us to make fun of them.

323
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,320
Scientologists don't pay us to make fun of them.

324
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,840
I have a feeling the Amish might.

325
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:57,600
I met a guy who's called the Amish comic, a traveling stand-up comic who's an Amish dude.

326
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:03,000
I wish I could tell you something funny about him, but he was just an Amish guy.

327
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,460
But I'd love to go through this, and I'm not putting anybody down at all.

328
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,580
I did that already.

329
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,280
Years 10, 15 years ago, I wrote a book called...

330
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:23,360
High Weirdness by Mail, where I was snidely made fun of all the Wiccans and Scientologists and subgeniuses and so forth.

331
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,800
And the funny thing is...

332
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,420
And this is my 17th Starwood.

333
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,000
Despite that book, they invited me to speak at Starwood, and I'm about to be good friends with almost everybody I made fun of.

334
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,980
Now, if only I could improve my own self-image, then we'd be friends with everybody.

335
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,220
I'm...

336
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,260
But...

337
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,200
Now, talk!

338
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,540
Talk about bad scheduling.

339
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:54,860
On the same day, this was on Wednesday, at the same time, these two workshops, Feng Shui and Natural Campsite,

340
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,620
that was at the same time as Wilderness Survival Part One.

341
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,600
It seems like you'd have to go to both.

342
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,700
How can you do Wilderness Survival if you don't have the proper Feng Shui in your survival campsite?

343
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,320
You could starve to death.

344
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,380
I like the name here, Afro-Belly-Hip...

345
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,220
Hippie Hop.

346
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,900
I don't know what that means, it just sounds good.

347
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,380
Afro-Belly-Hippie Hop.

348
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,900
Elspeth did one that was...

349
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:28,700
It had a very subgenius-like title, about...

350
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,240
That sort of relates to Slack.

351
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,480
I don't know what I want, but this isn't it.

352
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,700
Someone was teaching, learn to spin.

353
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,240
And I thought that that's kind of...

354
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,800
shameful, teaching children how to get high.

355
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,800
Like, encouraging little children. They do that already.

356
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:54,200
Someone had a class called, Are You Full of Poo?

357
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,960
Now that's what I call a loaded question.

358
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,520
Sorry, I had to do that one.

359
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,980
Flute Salad, that's a nice one.

360
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,720
Floydtronica.

361
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,100
Serpent and Reptile Magic.

362
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:14,660
Now that's the kind of thing that makes the fundamentalist Christians in Sherman think that we're devil worshipers.

363
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:28,960
And I noticed a whole lot of workshops about fairies and something about the land of Faerie or something.

364
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,860
I'm very ignorant about that, I'm going to have to Wikipedia it.

365
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,760
I'm more familiar with the world of Bigfoot.

366
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:41,360
And Yetis, which I think is maybe the opposite of the fairies, I don't know.

367
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:46,660
But somebody should do a workshop about the challenges of intermarriage.

368
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,840
Between Yetis and fairies.

369
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,120
That's like Chihuahuas and Great Danes.

370
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,200
It puts a weird picture in your head.

371
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,860
Hawks smelly and good for you.

372
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,940
That's not explained, but I figured it was about medical marijuana.

373
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:17,440
And right underneath that, annual high faerie tea and pot luck.

374
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:24,040
Which didn't bother me especially until I realized that the person teaching it is my next door neighbor.

375
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:25,900
Seriously.

376
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,460
Buffing and polishing your craft.

377
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,500
Is that what they're calling it now?

378
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,780
Partner stress.

379
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,220
Stretching.

380
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,920
Is that what they're calling it now?

381
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,640
And I guess our friend Ron Slabe is going to be doing pyroglyphics.

382
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:49,480
That'll be the big fire and explosives show over there.

383
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,960
We do have insurance, by the way.

384
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:59,280
And I guess pyroglyphics, he's going to be writing slogans in flames on all of Brushwood.

385
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,060
That should be seen from a plane if you can do it.

386
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,660
The Land of the Blind concert.

387
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,480
That's tonight.

388
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,200
I'll be king for a day at that one.

389
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,820
Oh, and Erotic World of Faerie.

390
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,220
But they left out Erotic World of Bigfoot.

391
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,400
Prejudice against the subgeniuses, friends.

392
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,400
I'm ready for the loan-ger.

393
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,280
Ready for him.

394
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,340
Loan-ger.

395
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,160
The loan-ger.

396
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,920
Come on, be quiet.

397
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,760
For a moment, the loan-ger made no reaction.

398
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:34,900
He replied.

399
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,400
His eyes burned with murder lust.

400
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,480
Answer me!

401
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,700
Shut up.

402
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,040
Me going to shack.

403
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,140
Then me show you loan-ger.

404
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,840
Then me come.

405
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,580
Why?

406
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,240
It easy.

407
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,300
No, no, no, wait.

408
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,600
Me not, I not my way.

409
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,360
You mean you want a loan-ger?

410
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,520
Me, oh, go to shack.

411
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,240
Me promise show you loan-ger.

412
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,240
Then me come.

413
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,260
All right, go ahead.

414
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,720
But make it fast.

415
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,200
Me not take law.

416
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,920
Then came a sound that removed all doubt.

417
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,460
The loan-ger blanked out.

418
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,520
His eyes moved soundlessly, and his lips had the look of a madman.

419
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,580
The loan-ger came from several directions.

420
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,260
Broderick was hit in the shoulder.

421
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,960
The loan-ger.

422
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,760
The last I saw him, he disappeared behind a tree.

423
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:34,760


424
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:34,760


425
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:34,760


426
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:34,760


427
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:34,760


428
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:34,760


429
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:34,760


430
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:34,760


431
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:34,760


432
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:34,760


433
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:34,760


434
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:34,760


435
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:34,760


436
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:34,760


437
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,320
some brushwood.

438
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,400
The loner changed his appearance

439
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,140
by hollow plugs in his nostrils.

440
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,180
And I'll take care of the loner.

441
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,020
The loner, wearing a disguise

442
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,160
with tense and alert,

443
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,520
his cock came into view.

444
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,040
His voice was husky with emotion when he spoke.

445
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,200
Me loner.

446
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,760
I never suspected

447
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,080
he was the loner.

448
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:56,940
I don't know.

449
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,660
Look, my forward skip won't work.

450
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,180
Whoa!

451
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,400
And now,

452
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,000
the most important revelation

453
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,280
of 2007

454
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,860
or any year.

455
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,200
Yes, friends,

456
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,820
a new quote from Bob.

457
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,440
If you weren't here at 7 in the morning,

458
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:25,920
heed.

459
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,100
There are four new

460
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,460
transmissions passed down

461
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,460
from J.R. Bob Dobbs.

462
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,940
Never before heard until now.

463
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,240
The first one,

464
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,280
Bob said,

465
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,800
so many look but don't see.

466
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,400
And most don't even look.

467
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,200
They just use their eyes

468
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,920
to keep from bumping into things.

469
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,920
This is the Tom fuckery

470
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,720
of foolishness.

471
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,640
And that was the end of that.

472
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,480
Take right there.

473
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,320
Isn't that amazing?

474
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,880
And that was the Tom fuckery

475
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,080
of foolishness.

476
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,500
The subgenius must have tape.

477
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,800
Now, on another

478
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,520
on another occasion,

479
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,360
Bob handed down this,

480
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,620
his first comment

481
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,880
on the subgenius internet.

482
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,040
It's a comment about

483
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,340
the subgenius internet.

484
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,800
Alt.slack is the Cleveland,

485
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,320
of the internet.

486
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,080
You gotta be tough.

487
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,880
I'm surprised that Bob

488
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,540
even was aware of alt.slack.

489
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,060
Honest.

490
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,880
And oh,

491
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,960
the third quote

492
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,740
from Bob.

493
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,860
No need to watch

494
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,340
spilt milk burn.

495
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,700
You just think about that,

496
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,140
my friends. I did and it,

497
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,080
I learned nothing.

498
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,520
The, the final thing

499
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,480
is that it was,

500
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,160
it's not really from Bob,

501
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,340
but it was about Bob.

502
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,180
We've learned that in American

503
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,180
sign language,

504
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,800
Bob's name is spelled

505
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,220
in this mystic hand pass.

506
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:18,200
B-O-B-H.

507
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,000
You can throw in the huh.

508
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,640
B-O-B-H.

509
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,620
Did I do that right?

510
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,900
B-O-B-H.

511
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:25,900


512
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,920
B-O-B-H.

513
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,240
B-O-B-H.

514
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:30,940
B-O-B-H.

515
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:30,940


516
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:30,940


517
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,980
Now see, you can tell they're shitty cultists

518
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,160
because they're not even attempting to image.

519
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,720
There's one guy back there in Princess Wee.

520
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,060
And she already, she's the one who taught it to us.

521
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,940
Oh, and Barbara Alien.

522
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,720
She's a good sport.

523
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,960
B-O-B-H.

524
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,560
That's right, everybody, come on.

525
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,900
B-O-B-H.

526
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,020
Now Dr. Dark is adding the quotes,

527
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,800
the little devil horns that go on either end.

528
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,880
And that does make it sound like a good thing.

529
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,080
It's sacred.

530
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,020
So I guess you could go, huh.

531
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,760
B-O-B-H.

532
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,560
Yeah, that's the uh.

533
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,500
That's more cultish.

534
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:04,760
That's the uh.

535
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,420
Well, think about in Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

536
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:13,100
There was this whole field full of Indians going, ah, eh, eh, oh, eh.

537
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,060
And still making some little hand motion.

538
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:16,320
Oh, yeah, yeah.

539
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,460
Yeah, yeah.

540
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,760
Yeah, it was very impressive.

541
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,620
Now, we don't have that field of subgeniuses.

542
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,940
We have to see that film again because they may have been doing B-O-B.

543
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,120
I don't think they were.

544
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:24,400
No?

545
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,860
No, I think I would have remembered.

546
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:25,860


547
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:25,860


548
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:25,860


549
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:25,860


550
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:25,860


551
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:25,960
I don't remember.

552
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,780
Now here's another one.

553
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,700
Yeah, without the quotes it's not real.

554
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,980
Because you overslept the saucer's arrival like so many.

555
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,800
X-day in American Sign Language.

556
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:41,640
It turns out the X is the same symbol as a huh or a question mark.

557
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,240
It's a question mark or huh or an X.

558
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,100
A day is like that.

559
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,280
Sun going across the sky.

560
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,000
So X-day is just simply like that.

561
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,200
You can walk up to people.

562
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,820
In the Sherman supermarket tomorrow when you're going to walk up to Amish people and just

563
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:09,020
go huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, and see what happens.

564
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,760
You know, maybe you'll recruit some Amish people for the church.

565
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,200
They're surprisingly, they're real friendly folks.

566
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,940
We have a lot in common with the Amish.

567
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,480
Everybody else thinks they're nuts.

568
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,740
And they think everybody else is full of it.

569
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,180
In fact, they call us.

570
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,000
They call us the English.

571
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,200
Did you know that?

572
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,840
Anyone who's not Amish is English.

573
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,900
So we're all English on this bus, you might say.

574
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,920
Some more English than others, I suppose.

575
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:39,740
So.

576
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,700
I was sad that I didn't meet any subgeniuses in England.

577
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,540
Is that a new one?

578
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,620
Oh, there's a lot of them.

579
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,540
Oh, and the other thing.

580
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,160
This is the other thing we announced.

581
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,960
Was that this morning?

582
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:52,360
It was X.

583
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,560
No, that was yesterday morning.

584
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,300
No, that was yesterday morning.

585
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:55,720
It's just one day, man.

586
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,380
It is.

587
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,080
X day is like Brigadoon.

588
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,120
It's just one day that keeps repeating every hundred years.

589
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,400
We got a membership.

590
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:09,540
We get about three or four ordainment orders a day these days.

591
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:15,960
And on June 28th, while I was at my daughter's wedding,

592
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:24,780
we got an order from Robert Dobbs in Beaufort, South Carolina.

593
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:30,860
Not Robert R. Dobbs or anything like that.

594
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,980
No, James Robert.

595
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,760
The JR, by the way, just is a JR.

596
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,000
It doesn't stand for anything.

597
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:39,280
And Bob is on his birth certificate.

598
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,520
But this is a Robert Dobbs, a person who happens to be named Bob Dobbs.

599
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,900
And I doubt if it's him because it says Robert M.

600
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,400
What is JR?

601
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,180
Does JR have a middle name after Bob?

602
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:54,620
No, it doesn't.

603
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,440
It doesn't stand for anything.

604
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,040
No.

605
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,420
No, a lot of people that have the cutesy idea,

606
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,580
oh, it must mean Jesus Robert or something.

607
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,040
Or no, no.

608
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:09,360
It's just J.R. quote, B.O.B. unquote Dobbs on his birth certificate.

609
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,160
Because his dad was not a real sophisticated fellow.

610
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,460
He was a pharmacist, but he was an immigrant.

611
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:20,180
And he thought he had had a boss who had a nameplate with a quote in the middle.

612
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,780
And he thought that was a sign of success.

613
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:23,420
Right.

614
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,720
You know, J.B. Tiny, Osmond, or whatever.

615
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,340
Well, the name you are injects you with success or not, you know, depending upon the name.

616
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,680
Like someone named, you know, Percival will have a hard time, perhaps, because, you know,

617
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,760
he'd be Percy and no one's named Percy now.

618
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,140
Oh, but that's just what can turn you into a subgenius.

619
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,860
Yes, exactly.

620
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,600
That having a funny name.

621
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,160
Yep.

622
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,320
It might be enough to awaken that Yeti gene.

623
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,340
On the other hand, it might be enough to make you sort of autistic almost, kind of depends

624
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,400
on how it all comes along.

625
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,240
It comes down the pike.

626
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,780
They made fun of me in kindergarten because my name was Bleepo.

627
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,800
Yeah, imagine that.

628
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,440
Bleepo is probably what turned you into a subgenius.

629
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,080
Yeah, I think so.

630
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,360
I think it really was.

631
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,520
I would have been one of the ones picking on you, too.

632
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:12,680
Well, by the time I was in first grade, I was like, you know, really, I figured it out.

633
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,860
I had it all together.

634
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,180
But then when I was 13, I lost it, but then I got it back again.

635
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,980
I don't want to talk about what made me different.

636
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:22,780
Yeah.

637
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,100
I did that once out here, and I never should have.

638
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,940
It's been following me around.

639
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:29,580
Yeah.

640
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,420
People can't handle it.

641
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,220
Oh, there it is.

642
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:32,560
Oh, yeah.

643
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,680
I just saw it.

644
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,980
It was right there.

645
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,380
Let's see.

646
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,480
I knew it was around here somewhere, man.

647
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,020
Don't worry, man.

648
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,660
I wish it would stay further away.

649
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,700
Oh, wait.

650
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,940
We have another gorilla.

651
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,240
Oh, another gorilla.

652
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:43,640
Great.

653
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,340
Now, this one's all sound effects.

654
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,700
It's Reverend Emperor Delirious.

655
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,780
Okay, here's what the gorilla says.

656
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,200
Yeah.

657
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,340
.

658
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,640
That's the gorilla.

659
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:13,080
The devil says, hey, gorilla, stop eating the urine-stained gravel.

660
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,780
It isn't really albino candy corn.

661
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,300
.

662
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,660
I just lost...

663
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,220
Oh, there.

664
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,200
It's just my ears.

665
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:24,960
I'm sorry.

666
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,760
I thought the equipment was messed up.

667
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,400
Here's another gorilla.

668
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,360
Oh, can I...

669
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,300
Oh, for use...

670
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:30,940
This is good.

671
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,900
It perfectly timed.

672
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,600
For use when show gets slow or retarded.

673
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,360
Perfect timing there, Lord Cyclohexane.

674
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:38,900
Oh, here.

675
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,120
You can do that one.

676
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:42,800
All right.

677
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,540
I'll try it.

678
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:44,680
.

679
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,160
Oh, my God.

680
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,160


681
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,420
Oh, my God.

682
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:46,640
Oh, my God.

683
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:46,640


684
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:46,640


685
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:46,640


686
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:46,640


687
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:46,640


688
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:46,640


689
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:46,640


690
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:46,640


691
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,540
I can't do this.

692
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:48,540


693
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,420
Don't poke me.

694
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,020
Oh, wait.

695
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,100
You gotta turn it down for this voice.

696
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:51,580
Sorry.

697
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,200
Don't poke me.

698
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,140
Sleeping.

699
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,500
Half awake always.

700
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,320
Wait for hate.

701
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,940
Wait to wake.

702
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,100
Wait for annoyance.

703
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:01,900
Sleep.

704
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,180
Want.

705
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,820
Roll over.

706
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,680
Back asleep.

707
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,040
Building.

708
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,800
Annoyance.

709
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,600
Hold it in.

710
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,980
Percolate in hate.

711
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,760
Wait for it.

712
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,620
Wait for it.

713
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:16,620


714
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:16,620


715
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:16,620


716
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:16,620


717
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:16,620


718
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:16,620


719
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:16,620


720
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:16,620


721
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,900
for it. Fuck you!

722
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,520
What the fuck? Let me

723
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,460
goddamn sleep! Monkey smash!

724
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,540
Remove heart

725
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,540
to half awake, half

726
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,460
alive state. Fall

727
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,640
asleep. Walk

728
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,920
through life

729
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,340
never paying attention.

730
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,160
Sleep.

731
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,260
Wait.

732
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,360
Explode when

733
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,580
necessary.

734
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,440
Wow, that was great!

735
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,820
That was the best one ever.

736
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,280
Yeah!

737
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,920
Okay, here's the demon now.

738
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,320
Tar baby crawling through

739
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,620
asphyxiatic dreams. Lockstep

740
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,520
jackboot nicotine march through

741
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,480
narrowed veins. This is obviously

742
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,400
a heavy metal demon.

743
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,660
Green phlegm thrown from diseased

744
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,560
lungs starving for the sweet air.

745
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,440
Red blood cells craving

746
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,380
company of carbon's monoxide.

747
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,920
Shunning dioxide's euphoric

748
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,160
embrace. Ah!

749
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,440
The beauty!

750
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,940
Wow. And that's a quote from, apparently that's a quote from

751
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,680
Reflections from a Nicotine Demon.

752
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,120
Or maybe that just was...

753
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,740
I recognize that one. Yeah.

754
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,240
That was nice. I like that.

755
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,960
Good demons! Somebody must have quit smoking.

756
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,080
Anybody who's just arrived or hasn't

757
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,920
done this yet, we have these forms somewhere.

758
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,060
I hope still a couple of them. You fill

759
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,860
them out with your inner gorilla

760
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,500
and your inner demon and

761
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,020
the subgenus radio ministers will

762
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,440
you know, read it.

763
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,260
By the way,

764
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:44,900
Princess,

765
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,340
Princess,

766
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,600
we are, though, there has been teaching,

767
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,580
has been learning American sign

768
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,460
language and she taught me how to spell

769
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,160
Bob and it's really easy.

770
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,820
This is a B

771
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,240
and this is an O

772
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,820
and that's a B, so you only need to know two things.

773
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,660
Uh, yeah.

774
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:05,680
Yeah.

775
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,360
B, O, B.

776
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:10,880
Or

777
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,560
you could do the quotes, which is like

778
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,360
a little devil horn.

779
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,360
Quote, B, O,

780
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,140
B, quote.

781
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,080
Quote, B, O,

782
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,680
B, quote.

783
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,700
Quote, B,

784
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,400
O, B, quote.

785
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,020
You guys are such

786
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,140
better cultists than

787
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,520
the subgeniuses.

788
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,020
I am not kidding. I could not get

789
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,080
any of them. They couldn't even remember

790
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,860
the third B.

791
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,340
And you notice I have trouble with it.

792
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,580
Why do you think we call it subgenius?

793
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,340
I get to say that once a week

794
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,600
and that was my weekly

795
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,120
utterance of that.

796
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,320
Well, that was certainly something.

797
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,140
Yes, it should be Dr. Jam

798
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,840
and weird images

799
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,880
and, uh,

800
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,140
you know, we can always sit around and watch movies of

801
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,680
Last X Day. That's true.

802
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:05,280
That's actually what happens

803
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,160
if it rains, if the

804
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,620
prophesied thunderstorm,

805
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,040
which has not really shown up yet.

806
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,240
You may think you saw the rain,

807
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,240
but the real Brushwood rain,

808
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,400
hasn't happened yet.

809
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,540
It surely must. You'll know when it happens

810
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,000
because you won't be able to see.

811
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,620
It's that

812
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,260
sudden. It's a

813
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,120
biblical flood

814
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,120
that happens for about two hours.

815
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,620
It's got to happen.

816
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,260
But when that happens, that's when we go to

817
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,180
the studio up at the top of the hill.

818
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,060
The Heavenly Studio, which is

819
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,400
indoors.

820
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,180
Where we set up the video

821
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,220
projector and watch the sunny

822
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,300
parts of X Day.

823
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:44,980
So,

824
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,380
we're prepared for every eventuality.

825
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,440
This is PR.

826
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,660
PR.

827
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:50,900
PR.

828
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,000
This is PR.

829
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,620
Advancing public well-being through improved

830
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,280
communication.

831
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,020
Helping to develop PR's fun.

832
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,960
From PR News in Washington, I'm detained.

833
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,960
The US government continued to exert every effort

834
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,920
to channel assistance to Saddam Hussein,

835
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,000
even with evidence that he was not only promoting

836
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,960
terrorism, but was also

837
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,320
pursuing a nuclear war.

838
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:15,500
The US government has been

839
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:15,500


840
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:15,500


841
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:15,500


842
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:15,500


843
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,380
nuclear weapons program.

844
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,820
A senior US diplomat says this is PR news.

845
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,260
Some six pounds of fresh and frozen ground beef

846
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,180
have been recalled after officials suspected

847
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,480
Bob contaminated some of the meat.

848
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,100
When it comes to bad meat,

849
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,600
it's all voluntary.

850
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,140
PR comes from contaminated meat.

851
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,680
Under the penis jar.

852
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,680
Yes.

853
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,160
Yes, but we need more forms.

854
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,860
There's at least a couple that we haven't received yet.

855
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,320
That's for sure.

856
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,320


857
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,320


858
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,320


859
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,320


860
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,320


861
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,320


862
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,340
Speaking of forms, I need to prepare the Ask Dr.

863
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,740
Howell questionnaire forms.

864
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:52,600
Oh, yes.

865
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,900
And my equipment is back at the swag shack.

866
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,960
So I'm going to ask somebody else to sit up here at the mic.

867
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,740
What happened to young Alex?

868
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,280
Alex, why don't you come up here?

869
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,280
Howell is waiting to come back up.

870
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,260
No, I didn't.

871
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,420
We're going to do Ask Dr. Howell in a little while,

872
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:14,460
and we have to have the question snippet thingies.

873
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,180
Which I go, ah, ah.

874
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,040
I can make things like that.

875
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,620
Yeah, but the scissors are back up there.

876
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,800
I have scissors here.

877
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,180
You just sit there.

878
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,500
The Reverend Alex walks up to the mic.

879
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,280
I should say the Saint Alex.

880
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,440
That's right.

881
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:39,120
The reason I started calling myself a saint is actually due to Reverend Stang,

882
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,640
because the very first year that I ranted,

883
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,840
afterwards he yelled,

884
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,440
praise God.

885
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,120
He said, praise Saint Alex.

886
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:49,680
And at the time, you know, I figured I was youth and Bob.

887
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,660
I didn't really have the wherewithal to be a saint at that point in my life.

888
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,380
So I gave it a few years,

889
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:02,800
and now I'm ready to embrace what it is to be a subgenius saint.

890
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,340
And that is a lucky thing for me because actually you live under my roof now.

891
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,280
That is correct.

892
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,040
We are roof dwellers.

893
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,260
We live under a roof.

894
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,860
It's not really an apartment.

895
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,780
It's just this little sort of subsection under a roof in Brooklyn.

896
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,920
Above a flower shop.

897
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,120
It's I think the highest point in the whole place.

898
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,460
It's about three and a half feet high.

899
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,580
But it's really colorfully decorated.

900
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,220
It is.

901
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:35,240
It's beautifully decorated with wild psychedelic streaks of color.

902
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:41,040
And that was almost entirely done by Professor Ali Valkyrie.

903
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,600
Is that correct?

904
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,160
Yes, yes.

905
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,900
Professor Ali Valkyrie also shares the dwelling.

906
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:51,200
And it's a nonstop, well, you'd have to see it anyway.

907
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,680
You really would because it's a marvelous thing.

908
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:59,580
If there are ever any photos taken of the apartment, then, you know.

909
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,740
But, you know.

910
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,220
I'm still working on my sainthood.

911
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,420
Well, yeah.

912
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,880
But you've enough titles for now.

913
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,020
Because in addition to being a rock star, you're a real saint.

914
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:11,560
You're a reverend.

915
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,660
And a doctor.

916
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,160
You were also radio pope of the northeast.

917
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,520
Yeah, but I don't like that.

918
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,620
You know, I don't like, yeah, look at me, radio pope.

919
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,580
You know, I don't like doing that.

920
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,960
Some popes do that.

921
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,000
I just, you know, I like to keep it under my sleeve.

922
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,620
And, you know, I pull it out when I need it.

923
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,960
That's basically it.

924
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:41,000
But I was mentioning earlier that, you know, even older subgeni tend to forget that the masthead of the Book of the Subgenius includes your surname listed on the back of the book.

925
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,000


926
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,500
And it's listed first and foremost among the radio popes is radio pope Cates.

927
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,620
Oh, you know.

928
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,040
The very first.

929
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,440
Some call that my surname.

930
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:50,660
Some.

931
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,480
Some would call, some would call that your surname.

932
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,860
Some would call Abernathy your surname.

933
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,180
I like to call it my master name.

934
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,080
Yes.

935
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,700
But, you know, sir, master.

936
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:03,380
It's all just, you know, nomenclature S and M really is what it boils down to.

937
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,060
That's right.

938
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:04,060


939
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,160
So, you know, we're slaves to our names.

940
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,460
We are slaves to our names.

941
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,520
Which is why it's important to reinvent our names as subgeniuses, I think, sometimes.

942
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:10,820
That's right.

943
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,560
So that we can become slaves to Bob.

944
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,120
Yeah.

945
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,160
Through our new names.

946
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:14,720
Yeah.

947
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,920
We can learn more about the name of Bob.

948
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:17,460
Yeah.

949
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,780
Which is the purest name.

950
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,460
Which, as you may remember, is B-O-B.

951
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:22,740
B.

952
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,560
Oh, but of course.

953
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:23,780
Yes, that's right.

954
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,180
Uh.

955
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:24,960
Uh.

956
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:25,420
Yeah.

957
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:25,660
Uh.

958
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:30,080
You can, I don't know if, since the uhs are double, you can do them either before or after.

959
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,440
We have to establish how that goes.

960
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:31,820
I don't know.

961
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,860
I don't know how that would go.

962
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,240
But that does seem to be the running theme of this year's X-Day, just a uh.

963
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,780
I think before and after.

964
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,400
Before, okay.

965
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:38,880
Okay.

966
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:39,660
Uh.

967
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:40,980
B-O-B.

968
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:40,980


969
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:40,980


970
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,980
B-O-B.

971
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:42,420
Uh.

972
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:43,460
Okay.

973
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,060
So remember that.

974
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,340
You can go up to people in grocery stores and just start doing that and they'll, they

975
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,800
will just follow you around.

976
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,380
Mm-hmm.

977
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,300
You know, that's what I, that's what I, that's what I love about Bob is, is that everybody

978
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,520
understands Bob.

979
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,320
That's right.

980
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,260
This is how we get him into the literature.

981
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:01,060
Well, that's, no, actually that's just something of a misnomer because not everyone

982
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:01,620
Okay.

983
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:02,780
Understands Bob.

984
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,640
I was just trying to sell it.

985
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,840
It was just bullshit I was saying.

986
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,780
That was bullshit, but that's okay because.

987
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,840
I was trying to sell it, you know, because I, I've been selling things for a long time

988
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,080
so.

989
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,520
I understand.

990
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,040
If I say a selling line sometimes don't people see it.

991
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,480
Everybody understands it.

992
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,100
That's always a good selling line.

993
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:16,500
Yeah.

994
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,140
Because people want to.

995
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,840
Yeah, you want this.

996
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,540
Come on everybody.

997
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,660
Everybody understands it.

998
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,940
Everybody, everybody understands it.

999
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,580
Don't you want to be like everybody who understands it?

1000
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,720
Of course there's the legend of this.

1001
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,360
The Brushwood Demon.

1002
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,600
The Brushwood Demon.

1003
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:34,620
The Brushwood Demon has been known to haunt these parts for nigh on 40 years.

1004
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:39,680
And he, he eats only the jello that's left in the wake of dawn.

1005
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,060
Yeah.

1006
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:46,820
And he files away the cotter pins and makes, makes little, little dresses.

1007
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:47,980
Or so it's said.

1008
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,080
Or some would say.

1009
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:49,420
Yep.

1010
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:50,660
Yes.

1011
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:54,460
If you can find those cotter pins and the jello, well you set them out in a trap.

1012
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,320
You might be able to just trap yourself a Brushwood Demon.

1013
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:57,960
That's right.

1014
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,700
They call him the Brushwood Demon.

1015
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,060
But then what you do with it when you're done, well.

1016
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,940
That's your own business.

1017
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,920
The Brushwood Demon speaks the truth.

1018
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,640
Indeed.

1019
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,080
Whether you like it or not.

1020
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:08,400
Yeah.

1021
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:08,620
You know.

1022
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:15,920
He's kind of like, he's kind of like the, the Brushwood version of Apollonius of Tyana.

1023
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:16,340
You know.

1024
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,920
He'll tell you what you want to, or he'll tell you the truth even if it's not necessarily.

1025
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:21,480
What you want to hear.

1026
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,900
What you want to hear.

1027
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,140
That's why he, that's how he earned the moniker of Demon.

1028
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:31,680
Because people became so irate that he was, you know, accurately predicting their, their,

1029
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,080
in divining their futures.

1030
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,480
Oh you Demon.

1031
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,540
You Brushwood Demon.

1032
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,240
Forsooth.

1033
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,360
What is Sooth anyway?

1034
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,640
I don't know what Sooth is.

1035
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,880
I'm stuck in the voice of Walter Brennan.

1036
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,440
That's my son, Will Sonnet.

1037
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,940
You know where he is, don't you?

1038
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,000
Yeah.

1039
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:50,520
Yeah.

1040
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,220
All right.

1041
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:51,800
Now I'm over it now.

1042
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,020
Okay.

1043
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,340
Okay.

1044
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,940
That only lasted like a minute.

1045
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:55,400
But that's okay.

1046
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,020
Usually does.

1047
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,320
Walter Brennan comes and goes.

1048
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:58,740
You know.

1049
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,060
He just.

1050
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,420
Yeah.

1051
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,500
He comes into your life.

1052
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,020
He was like a completely racist asshole.

1053
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:03,560
Yeah.

1054
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:03,800
He was.

1055
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,360
Apparently.

1056
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,460
Walter Brennan was a very racist man, which I was quite surprised to discover.

1057
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:12,200
He didn't like, he didn't like Jews and he didn't like black people.

1058
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,680
No, no he didn't.

1059
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,340
And he was necessarily.

1060
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,860
He always used those names for the movie.

1061
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:19,840
But you know, Bob likes Jews and Bob likes black people.

1062
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:20,520
Exactly.

1063
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,100
And you know, and they're used.

1064
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:23,980
A tape.

1065
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,000
Oh, uh oh.

1066
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,200
Or something here.

1067
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:26,480
You.

1068
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,220
I don't know.

1069
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,820
Is this a mini disc?

1070
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:30,920
Only .

1071
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,640
So, uh.

1072
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,340
I don't know.

1073
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:34,340


1074
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:34,340


1075
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:34,540
I'm not sure.

1076
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:34,540


1077
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:34,540


1078
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:34,540


1079
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:34,540


1080
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:34,540


1081
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:34,540


1082
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:34,540


1083
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,760
Make your own radio show for a minute or two, everybody.

1084
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,740
Where's Sven?

1085
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,400
Where'd he go?

1086
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,220
What's going on?

1087
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,360
Well, the.

1088
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:40,780
The.

1089
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,000
Hello.

1090
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,180
We're off the air.

1091
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:46,380
And we can't talk on the microphones unless we're on the air.

1092
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:46,760
Fine.

1093
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,680
Yep.

1094
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:48,560
.

1095
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:56,300
Being an AV boy, I have some understanding of some of the things that

1096
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,400
does with these things.

1097
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:57,940
.

1098
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,320
So, one moment please while we.

1099
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:01,920
Oh.

1100
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,340
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

1101
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:16,120
Do-doo-doo, do-doo-doo-doo, do-doo-doo-doo, do-doo-doo-doo, do-doo-doo-doo, do-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

1102
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,180
Liza.

1103
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,280
Any more, girl?

1104
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:21,680
Question.

1105
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,480
Any more question?

1106
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:26,060
I see out there there's a place called Dobbstown.

1107
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,520
How can I get there?

1108
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,520
Dobbstown.

1109
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,180
Dobbstown.

1110
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,720
Remember Jonestown?

1111
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,300
Jim Jones and Guyana had this great club of,

1112
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,700
well, they were kind of over-anxious sub-genius.

1113
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,560
It's like Heaven's Gate.

1114
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,460
They didn't feel like waiting around for the bus.

1115
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,340
They had to jump right in front of it.

1116
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,520
Dobbstown is hidden, is deep in the jungles of Malaysia.

1117
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,220
It's actually in disputed territory.

1118
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,640
It's pretty hard to get there.

1119
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,240
First, you have to join the church with that $30

1120
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,340
and learn to chant Bob Slack, Bob Slack,

1121
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,320
and become a real stupid fundamentalist Bobby for a while

1122
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,300
where you quote all of our slogans

1123
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:15,940
like a tiresome Monty Python fan that never shuts up, you know?

1124
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,940
Or whatever fan.

1125
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,580
I'm not going to put down Monty Python.

1126
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,760
I know people that do that with Firesign Theater and sub-genius.

1127
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,300
Alistair Crowley, any of those comedy outfits.

1128
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,560
But then you go to Dobbstown and the overmen deprogram you.

1129
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,700
And it hurts.

1130
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,680
And you can't sit down for a year.

1131
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,580
But it's worth it.

1132
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:45,160
Because the true Slack comes when the hammer stops hitting your head.

1133
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:45,880
You know what I mean?

1134
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,540
Really, everybody has original Slack.

1135
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,120
You're already in Dobbstown.

1136
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:54,200
You're floating in a sea of the good pills.

1137
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,220
But you don't really appreciate.

1138
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,960
You don't really appreciate it until it's taken away.

1139
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,660
The day that you can't sleep.

1140
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,620
The day that you have nothing to eat.

1141
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,940
The day that you truly can't pee.

1142
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:11,520
That's when you'll know how much Slack you always had, my friend.

1143
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,600
Thank you.

1144
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,000
This is an open stage.

1145
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:56,720
If you have a rant, you should be right here.

1146
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:14,660
When I say open stage, there's nothing that indicates that you will have an audience later.

1147
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:20,840
If you must have an audience, this is your best bet right now.

1148
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:22,520
Thank you.

1149
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,780
So we've got 15 more minutes.

1150
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,660
Are there any questions?

1151
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:34,960
This is my favorite part.

1152
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,340
Sure.

1153
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,320
Yeah.

1154
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,920
I'm pretty sure that next week is coming.

1155
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,980
And I've got to make some decisions about what to do.

1156
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,740
And I can either go to the beach and pee town with some friends.

1157
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,380
Or maybe have a glass of wine with my neighbor.

1158
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,080
Or do something.

1159
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,340
And I don't know.

1160
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,140
How do I decide relative amounts of Slack?

1161
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,260
If I'm looking for some Slack, how do I decide what to do next week?

1162
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,100
You really need to spend that $30.

1163
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:09,460
I can tell by your indecisiveness that you need to limit your options.

1164
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,760
And if you're $30 lighter, you're going to take whichever one is cheaper.

1165
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:18,440
And either one is going to give you as much Slack.

1166
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,020
And this way you'd be spreading the Slack you see.

1167
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,000
So, you know, the other thing you can do is flip a coin and let Bob decide.

1168
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:27,640
Okay.

1169
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,400
Speaking of which, suicide.

1170
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,760
Not a good idea.

1171
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:40,020
Number one, the reason you're doing it is because you're such a miserable failure and everything is so screwed up, right?

1172
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,880
Well, killing yourself is just another one of your dumb mistakes.

1173
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:51,320
Bob or God is going to get around to killing you anyway, sooner or later.

1174
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:55,400
Do you really think you're going to do a better job than Bob?

1175
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,520
So, you know.

1176
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,500
All you have to do is wait until X day.

1177
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,300
It's not like you're going to have to suffer forever.

1178
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,820
Put up with it a little while longer.

1179
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,320
Maybe you don't really know the future.

1180
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:14,200
Maybe everything isn't going to be completely screwed up forever.

1181
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:20,140
Maybe that person you're madly in love with is suddenly, for some reason, going to suddenly be divorced.

1182
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:24,380
And it turned out that you're the one they were interested in.

1183
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:25,060
You don't know.

1184
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,460
That was the message of 1998.

1185
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,160
We all quit making predictions when the saucers didn't show.

1186
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,500
The End

1187
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,920
Music

1188
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,720

1210
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:05,840
Here it comes

1211
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,680
He's coming, bud

1212
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,100
Go come on

1213
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,640
Go come and take your slack away

1214
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:19,720
He's back

1215
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:26,740
He's back

1216
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,680
He's back

1217
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,720
He's back

1218
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:30,220
Here it comes

1219
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:39,380
He's back

1220
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:42,500
Slack

1221
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,200
He's coming to take your slack away

1222
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,340
He'll take it too

1223
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,540
That big bad bob

1224
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,320
Heaven in the sky

1225
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:00,540
That's right, just send us your one dollar

1226
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,160
One dollar

1227
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,680
One dollar

1228
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:03,740
One dollar

1229
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,940
One dollar

1230
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,980
You get a lot more for your money

1231
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,280
Heck, one dollar

1232
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,640
You get bob

1233
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,040
Think of bob

1234
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,220
Yeah, think of bob

1235
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:23,620
Think about bob

1236
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,200
Yeah, he makes us

1237
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,560
Think of

1238
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:27,080
Bob

1239
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:27,980
Everybody's

1240
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:28,920
Think about bob

1241
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,740
Everybody wants to

1242
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:31,680
Think of bob

1243
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:32,560
Yeah

1244
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:34,080
Well, I'll

1245
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:34,800
Think of

1246
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,300
Bob

1247
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:35,980
Bob

1248
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:37,680
We'll

1249
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,320
Think of

1250
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:38,780
Bob

1251
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:39,200
Bob

1252
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,180
Yeah, we'll

1253
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:40,700
Think of

1254
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,400
Bob

1255
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,160
Bob

1256
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:44,700
Everybody's

1257
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:45,060
Think of

1258
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:45,320
Bob

1259
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,280
Now to continue our story

1260
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:53,360
After Bob left

1261
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:54,700
He dashed into the

1262
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,020
Lawn-ger

1263
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,540
The lawn-ger returned to

1264
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:58,200
Camp by a roundabout route

1265
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,300
At top speed

1266
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,740
And without being seen by

1267
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:02,480
Bob's dark exhausted horse

1268
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,480
Bob made slow time

1269
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,920
On his first full familiar

1270
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,280
Little silenced bell

1271
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,300
Just

1272
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,300
Go ahead, Bob

1273
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,600
And see how things work out

1274
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:11,960
You

1275
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,960
Great Scott the Lord

1276
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:14,780
Here

1277
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:16,060
In time

1278
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,440
I'll let you go on

1279
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,140
Just a minute, Bob

1280
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,740
You propose to make an example

1281
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:20,700
Of that young scamp

1282
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:21,940
Bob stole money

1283
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:23,260
I'll hear, Bob

1284
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,480
He knows it, Tonto

1285
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:24,940
Bob

1286
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:25,340
Bob

1287
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:25,700
Bob

1288
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:25,800
Bob

1289
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:25,960
Bob

1290
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:26,020
Bob

1291
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:26,020


1292
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,120
Here

1293
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,600
What do you want me to do with Bob?

1294
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,160
Got to think of some way

1295
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,120
To send Bob to jail

1296
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:31,840
You think

1297
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,540
You'll refine Bob guilty?

1298
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,140
Maybe

1299
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:34,820
Maybe

1300
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:35,120
Maybe

1301
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:35,400
Maybe

1302
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:35,540
Maybe

1303
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:39,660
The lawn-ger kept a close watch

1304
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:40,700
On Bob in town

1305
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:46,940
The lawn-ger found a small hill

1306
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:48,320
On which they could watch Bob

1307
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,280
And if Bob stole all the money

1308
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:50,920
That was stolen

1309
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,520
Doesn't Bob mean something?

1310
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,560
Not a chance

1311
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:54,880
Well, maybe

1312
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,000
If Bob was on the scene

1313
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:56,940
Bob's identified, Bob.

1314
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:59,060
He'll go to jail for life.

1315
00:50:59,160 --> 00:50:59,440
Uh-oh.

1316
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,240
Bob.

1317
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:01,200
Oh, Bob.

1318
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:01,500
Bob.

1319
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:02,540
I'll hear Bob.

1320
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,500
Talk to me, Bob.

1321
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,720
Tell me about the tears on poor, hungry faces.

1322
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,080
Bob's gonna die.

1323
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,120
Oh, that's good, Bob.

1324
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:12,740
Oh, Bob.

1325
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:13,940
Tell me again.

1326
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:15,100
She's gonna die.

1327
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:16,820
Tell us of you, wasn't it, Bob?

1328
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,580
What's it to you?

1329
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:19,520
Bob.

1330
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:20,720
Oh, Bob.

1331
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:21,240
Bob.

1332
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,160
Dead says they're sure to find you guilty.

1333
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:24,340
Oh, doggone.

1334
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:24,580
Gone.

1335
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:26,540
Oh, here comes Dad now.

1336
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,040
Now, don't recall, Ted.

1337
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,520
Dad, what's the matter?

1338
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:29,960
Hey.

1339
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:30,860
I got Bob.

1340
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:31,460
Yeah.

1341
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,300
Oh, but there must be something I do.

1342
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,900
There's something I do, Dad.

1343
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:36,860
So I see.

1344
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,920
Bob surrenders day after tomorrow.

1345
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:43,140
I can just see the tears on poor, hungry faces.

1346
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,700
They're coming from all sides.

1347
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:45,920
Yeah.

1348
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:48,080
Thanks to the loan, Jack.

1349
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:48,860
I'm dead.

1350
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,060
Now back to the show.

1351
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:00,880
Thank you, Bob.

1352
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:04,280
We'll be right back, Jayden.

1353
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,960
As always, I'm playing with a Folge 10 of the

1354
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:05,960


1355
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:06,140
Understanding There's Askiulture With Honour

1356
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:11,580
with Des Federer My Pooey

1357
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,200
Ho occasional

1358
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:18,460
I encountered

1359
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:23,740
a guy

1360
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:23,740


1361
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:23,740


1362
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:23,920
major

1363
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,220
And Carter LeBlanc, ranting about ranting.

1364
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,100
Over five-fisted, Tales of Connie, the X-Day Jam Band.

1365
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:37,760
Matthew Dare doing music in the background right now is the Amino Acids live at 10X Day.

1366
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:45,600
And the killer music that you're about to hear is Bonobo's Convergence live at 10X Day.

1367
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:23,900
Bonobo's Convergence live at 10X Day.

1368
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:53,900
Bonobo's Convergence live at 10X Day.

1369
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:23,880
Bonobo's Convergence live at 10X Day.

1370
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,900
Bonobo's Convergence live at 10X Day.

1371
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,900
Bonobo's Convergence live at 10X Day.

1372
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,880
Bonobo's Convergence live at 10X Day.

1373
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,660
Bonobo's Convergence live at 10X Day.

1374
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:06,340
Bonobo's Convergence live at 10X Day.

1375
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:13,560
Bonobo's Convergence live at 10X Day.

1376
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:13,560


1377
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,500
Bonobo's Convergence live at 10X Day.

1378
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,740
Bonobo's Convergence live at 10X Day.

1379
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,860
Bonobo's Convergence live at 10X Day.

1380
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:30,740
An ordinary can be just another one, another one

1381
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:37,020
Freaking with a smile on, is that nothing special?

1382
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:45,960
An ordinary can be just another one, another one

1383
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:52,360
Freaking with a smile on, is that nothing special?

1384
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,920
Going on

1385
00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:01,540
An ordinary can be just another one, another one

1386
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:07,940
Freaking with a smile on, is that nothing special?

1387
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,460
Going on

1388
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:19,420
Thank you everyone! Thank you Reverend Stank, thank you Princess Wee, thank you Dr. Howe, thank you Lonesome Cowboy Dave, thank you everyone! We love it here! Thank you very much!

1389
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:32,020
We have Bonobos Convergence! Thank you! Have a wonderful, wonderful, stay cool for the amino acids!

1390
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:36,380
Stay cool for the amino acids!

1391
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:40,680
Praise Bob and thanks to Bonobos Convergence heard live at X-Day

1392
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:46,340
Thanks to Potter Nostril for the recording and also of the amino acids in the background

1393
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:52,340
More can be had about Bonobos Convergence at bonobosmusic.com

1394
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:52,340


1395
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:52,340


1396
00:57:52,360 --> 00:58:04,200
This is our Slack number 1113 or 14 or something like that from the Church of the Subgenius

1397
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:10,680
For more on the subgenius morons, see subgenius.com

1398
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:16,900
And now, Glass Madness and other old-timey doctors take us away

1399
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:21,580
Oh wowee!

1400
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:22,340
Oh wowee!

1401
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:22,340


1402
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:22,340


1403
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:25,080
We shall verse a genius

1404
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:31,500
Oh wowee!

1405
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:33,880
We shall qualify

1406
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:44,580
He's something, saying something over there, way over on that other channel

1407
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:48,020
We can't see left, can't hear anything

1408
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:51,700
You notice that our patient is strapped in, he cannot see the two-way mirror

1409
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,820
Nor can he hear our instructions, ladies and gentlemen

1410
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:56,860
So you will be with us on this experiment in green brain

1411
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:58,580
In private

1412
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:02,780
Okay, now we have his brain here, which we've taken out in a hologram

1413
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:03,740
I have worn it

1414
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,940
It looks much like it does inside his head right now

1415
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:07,540
We're going to put it in the Vegematic

1416
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:12,200
You'll notice a lot of static, a lot of static blur

1417
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:17,280
The Brain-O-Matic pulverizes into a breezy bulb in just two seconds

1418
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:21,680
Now be careful, don't heat that brain up too much because, uh,

1419
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,020
We've lost a lot of memories that way

1420
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:25,780
Perhaps we want to turn it down then

1421
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:27,020
When you put it back, it just isn't the same

1422
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:31,240
The last I saw of him, he disappeared behind some brushwoods

1423
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:34,160
Brushwoods, brushwoods, brushwoods, brushwoods, brushwoods, brushwoods
