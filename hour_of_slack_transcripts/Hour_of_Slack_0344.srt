1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
All the peoples of the world are, in effect, partners in this interest.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:12,320
And for our own part, we see very clearly that unless justice be done to others, it will not be done to us.

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,760
The program for the world's peace, as we see it, is this.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:27,260
The Church of the Subgenius in the name of J.R. Bogg.

5
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,120
Ah, yes, dear friends.

6
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:49,900
And so good, so good to be back, back on the airwaves with tonight's Hour of Slack show,

7
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:55,040
which, by the way, will be a collision of subgenius shows.

8
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,980
It's been a while since we've let all the shows that are...

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,040
The original shows done out there in subgenius land just collide in the time warp of the Church,

10
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,240
the bosom of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,220
We have a special guest here tonight, the Tevinator.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,080
Tevinator, are you prepared with your statement?

13
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:22,980
You may proceed.

14
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,120
We are the future, the children of a new era.

15
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,180
We have been born from the mistakes of the past.

16
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,840
And are expected to pick up the pieces of the future.

17
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:39,560
We are shackled by a dysfunctional system that is unable to keep pace with our hyper-cellularated culture.

18
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,540
We have been told what to think by fundamentalist demons masquerading as leaders and saints.

19
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:50,120
We are expected to ignore the damages inflicted by a disposal society.

20
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,380
We are forced to watch our rights being whittled to dust.

21
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,800
Our time is now!

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,140
We must use all the tools in our power.

23
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,160
We must utilize our brains.

24
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,380
As a primary weapon.

25
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,120
We must harness the power of chaos.

26
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,180
We must forcefully occupy cyberspace.

27
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,360
We must assimilate.

28
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,320
We must subvert.

29
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,980
We must pay the new leadership for a new millennium.

30
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,800
We must regain control of our destiny.

31
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,240
Or our lives are meaningless.

32
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,420
Praise Bobby!

33
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,140
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

34
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,040
And now dear friends.

35
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,180
The show you've been waiting for.

36
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,140
The subgenius radio ministry hour of...

37
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,260
Slacker, yes.

38
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,960
It's worthless.

39
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,060
Because it's merely the work of a few unbridled individualists.

40
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,680
Artistic value is achieved collectively.

41
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,760
By each man subordinating himself to the standards of the majority.

42
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,960
I read that in your column yesterday.

43
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,920
You did? Thank you.

44
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:04,640
Now, the greatness of Peter Keating's personality lies in the fact that there is no personality stamped upon his building.

45
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,180
Quite true.

46
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,300
Thus he represents not himself, but the multitude of all men together.

47
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,920
And produces great big marble bromides.

48
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,400
I believe I'm failing to sell you Peter Keating.

49
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,380
Why no.

50
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,960
You're succeeding.

51
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,520
Your Keating is worthless.

52
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,000
So he's probably the right choice for that building.

53
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,540
He's sure to be popular.

54
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,360
You wouldn't expect me to pick a man of merit, would you?

55
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,460
We are told we are weak.

56
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,380
Incapable of grasping scale.

57
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:49,100
Afraid of ourselves and desperate to push responsibility for all events in our lives onto them.

58
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:58,340
We are insistently trained to accept our corporal existence.

59
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,640
As hopeless in itself.

60
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,460
To become subservient to the greater good.

61
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:17,440
We are perpetually conditioned, encouraged and blackmailed into self-restriction.

62
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,020
Into narrower and narrower perceptions of ourselves.

63
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,580
Our own importance.

64
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,660
Our own potential and our own experience.

65
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,360
We are trained to ignore the evidence of our senses and experiences.

66
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,220
And to feel guilt when we glimpse the self-genius.

67
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,400
Our own...

68
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:46,960
...sense.

69
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:58,560
The Self-Genius

70
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,600
Please leave the area.

71
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,140
We are starting the final countdown.

72
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,440
TSC, this is Florida Control.

73
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,600
All power for the shields checking out at one hundred and fifty.

74
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,220
All systems are go.

75
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,940
Please run final checks on all shield power elements.

76
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,160


77
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,040
Please leave the area.

78
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,620
We are starting the final countdown.

79
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,760
Hello?

80
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,460
Hello?

81
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,240
Hello?

82
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,280
We're recording. Everything's going fine.

83
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,080
...the children sir.

84
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:23,700
Ha ha ha.

85
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,200
That's what he said.

86
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,180
Can I see that back door on his platform?

87
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,320
Don't you think it's time we let them have a glimpse of what it's like?

88
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:37,840
Don't you think it's time that you sat down and, uh, came face to face with your destiny?

89
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,200
My destiny.

90
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,180
My destiny.

91
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,680
My destiny.

92
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,920
Here at the top of the Texas School Book Depository, I'm...

93
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:51,260
Uh, isn't it about time you came face to face with...

94
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,900
...Buh-buh.

95
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,540
Um...

96
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,640
...Buh...

97
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:57,320
...my friends.

98
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,240
It's easy enough to do.

99
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,380
It's the strangest...

100
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,740
...Jesus...

101
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,920
...you ever...

102
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,400
...seen.

103
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,620
Face to face with my destiny.

104
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:24,080
Now, this famous curtain rod depository was on the site of Medeli Plaza.

105
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,920
My destiny.

106
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:35,760
Yes, right here at Let's Make a Dealey Plaza, we're going to begin the quiz show of all quiz shows.

107
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,360
The 1963 election giveaway.

108
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,920
And our first gag guest is Gero, the monkey that's been trained to act like George Bush.

109
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,080
Let's give him a big hand.

110
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,160
Well...

111
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,680
Well...

112
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,460
Well...

113
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,480
...see my...

114
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:01,620
Gero can walk on stools, dance jigs on his hands and somersault through hoops like any ordinary circus monk.

115
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,020
Well...

116
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,780
But he can also mimic the president's actions and emotions with uncanny accuracy.

117
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,180
Read my lips.

118
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,720
Read my...

119
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,040
Oh!

120
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,760
Oh!

121
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,400
There they go.

122
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,020
Hey, listen, that's just a picture.

123
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,160
He didn't actually say it, but it becomes this kind of surreal cartoon of itself.

124
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:25,020
He is an actor, not just an animal doing tricks, said Taro Murasaki, 30, Gero's trainer.

125
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,180
That is the art of suromawashi.

126
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:38,020
In the stomach medicine ad, Gero parodies the pain of overindulgence in booze and the very human ritual of vowing never ever again with cruel precision.

127
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,400
Gero's most recent skit is equally sharp-edged.

128
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,740
Bush-san, coked Murasaki.

129
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:44,980
Bush-san.

130
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:54,640
The monkey gags, pretends to vomit, then closes his eyes and swoons in the manner of flu-stricken President George Herbert Walker Bush.

131
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,840
It was during a state dinner with Prime Minister Kiyichi Miyazawa last month.

132
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:05,340
Poor taste, sure, but it elicits guffaws from both Japanese and listeners of KPFA.

133
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,420
Weep, weep, weep.

134
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:13,740
By the time of the shooting, there seemed to be some commotion.

135
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:23,360
I just am unable to describe a flash of light, smoke, or something.

136
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,920
which caused me to feel that something out of the ordinary had occurred there on the embankment.

137
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:40,340
The Church of the Subgenius in the name of J.R. Bob Dobs.

138
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,580
The Church of the Subgenius in the name of J.R. Bob Dobs.

139
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,420
How long have you been here?

140
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:22,760
How long have you been here?

141
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,360
Peace

142
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,440
Peace in the Middle East

143
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,680
Everlasting loving peace

144
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,180
Joy, joy in the middle east

145
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,480
Everlasting loving peace

146
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,320
Peace, peace

147
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,320
Everlasting loving peace

148
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,120
Peace, peace

149
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,620
Everlasting loving peace

150
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:41,620


151
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,920
Now who ever said the Subgeniuses were not politically correct?

152
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,240
Can't go wrong

153
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,320
Urging peace

154
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,360
Peace

155
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,820
Everlasting peace

156
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,340
Peace

157
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,460
Everlasting peace

158
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,880
Peace, peace

159
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,200
Everlasting peace

160
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
And please, don't get me wrong.

161
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,160
I'm not accusing.

162
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,440
What I'm trying to say is

163
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,640
if you have to lose your self-respect

164
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,020
in order to be popular,

165
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,240
is it worth it?

166
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,320
You know, we tried every kind of treatment

167
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,420
and it just failed.

168
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,100
She wanted to be cremated.

169
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,520
Would that make a difference?

170
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,120
No, that makes no difference.

171
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,640
If she wants to be cremated, that's what you do.

172
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,880
So, in other words...

173
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,040
And that's more reasonable.

174
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,080
If I wanted to bring the lighter fluid in the match...

175
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,940
No, you can't do a lighter fluid in match.

176
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,860
You have to have her cremated at the crematory.

177
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,620
Well, she wanted me to do it.

178
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,340
No, you can't cremate her.

179
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,260
So, it has to be done at a crematory.

180
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,600
Would that cost extra?

181
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,540
No, no.

182
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,360
The cremation is less reasonable.

183
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,920
It's less than the burial, of course.

184
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,180
Okay, well, that sounds very good.

185
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,480
And one more thing.

186
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,740
She wanted me to cut a piece of her off.

187
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,660
Cut a piece of her off?

188
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,100
Just to save to remember her.

189
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,200
Her ring finger.

190
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,340
You can't cut a piece of her off.

191
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,760
You can't do that either.

192
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,180
Because she said that I should.

193
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,260
I didn't want to do it.

194
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,800
No, you can't cut a piece of her off unless you take a piece of her hair.

195
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,240
But not her finger.

196
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:10,920
Huh?

197
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,220
Her finger.

198
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,420
Oh, no, you couldn't keep her finger.

199
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:14,940
No way.

200
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,160
No.

201
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,620
I couldn't eat her flesh.

202
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:21,980
Huh?

203
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:22,880
Huh?

204
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,080
Huh?

205
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,280
Huh?

206
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:23,320
Huh?

207
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,320


208
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,320


209
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,320


210
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,320


211
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,320


212
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,320


213
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,320


214
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,320


215
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,320


216
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,340
No, you can't.

217
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,240
She wanted me to eat her flesh.

218
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,940
You can't do that.

219
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,520
I'm sorry.

220
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,320
I'm not a cannibal, ordinarily.

221
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,620
Mm-hmm.

222
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,540
Well, I don't know.

223
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,700
What time can you come down to see me tomorrow?

224
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,160
Now, I have a funeral here at 1 o'clock.

225
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,140
So can you come down in the morning?

226
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,740
Well, who...

227
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,320
I guess I can.

228
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,260
I'd like to see you at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning.

229
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,380
I'm coming here at the funeral home.

230
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,140
Okay.

231
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,680
And one more question.

232
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,200
The man who's...

233
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,280
Is it a man or a woman at the funeral?

234
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,320
Could I eat their flesh?

235
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,380
You want to eat...

236
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,520
You want to eat their flesh?

237
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,180
I'm a ghoul.

238
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,420
I'm a real cool ghoul.

239
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,820
I'm a real cool ghoul.

240
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,640
I don't know about you, but before the election,

241
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:21,640


242
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,240
I don't know about you, but before the election, I'm going to have to...

243
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,560
It's a real fascination, as if it's disclosing somebody deep within.

244
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,260
As he jabs the finger into the air.

245
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:30,460
Ow!

246
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,660
Hey, you don't need to demonstrate, Philip.

247
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,060
Into the air and screeches the words again and again.

248
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,720
Screech!

249
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,800
His commercial business becomes to seem more and more desperate,

250
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,080
more and more absurd.

251
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:40,940
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

252
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,240
These dedicated television viewers...

253
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,800
Oh, my, I just don't know.

254
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,500
...to take the president seriously.

255
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,440
Every time.

256
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,420
I never believe you.

257
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,860
...the obscene stories...

258
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,940
Oh, you stupid idiot!

259
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,000
This stuff costs money!

260
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,680
I'm sorry, I spoke a little out of turn,

261
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,740
but, boy, what a skullbuster of a headache I've got.

262
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,420
Doing this show this early in the morning is no picnic, I tell you.

263
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,740
It's at a time like this that I want to kick back and relax

264
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,520
with a silly chocolate bar.

265
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,020
Yeah, they say this isn't a funny show, it's just a silly show,

266
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,740
and it's at that time I want a silly chocolate bar.

267
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,540
The powerhouse bar that knocks you silly.

268
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:30,780
Covered with creamy milk chocolate, it's zesty, tangy, tasty, yeasty,

269
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,500
with caramel nougat, crunchy walnuts, and a rich butter taste.

270
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,700
It contains sugar, cocoa butter, milk, chocolate,

271
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,780
and like a thing added as an emulsifier,

272
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,400
salt artificially...

273
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,720
...flavored with cough syrup,

274
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:48,580
vanillin, a vanilla substitute, and 27 milligrams of millivanillin,

275
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,840
an artificial, phony sugar substitute, butter, almonds with salt, and...

276
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:52,840


277
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:52,840


278
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,480
...an artificial flavor with more sugar, more lecithin, more everything

279
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,740
in a silly chocolate bar.

280
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,320
They're cool.

281
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,020
Enjoy a silly chocolate bar and you can be cool, like me.

282
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,520
I'm a real cool ghoul.

283
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,360
They say...

284
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,240
They say...

285
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,700
We have spoken not of sugar in terms too concrete

286
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,940
and not free to admit of any further doubt or question.

287
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,380
An evident principle runs through the whole program I have outlined.

288
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,400
I'm a real cool ghoul.

289
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,300
Ooh.

290
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,960
Buried in that area, so it would behoove you to use a funeral home

291
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,780
in that particular locale.

292
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,800
Well, what if we, like, have cremated?

293
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,620
Uh, you still would probably use a funeral home

294
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,700
in your own locale, rather than come way down here into Neptune.

295
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,300
What hospital is the body in?

296
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,700
Paul Kimball.

297
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,320
Oh, it's in Paul Kimball.

298
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:03,600
Mm.

299
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:09,320
Well, it would do you better to go to one of them local funeral homes,

300
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,300
rather than to try to come down here.

301
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,680
We'd decide to eat him.

302
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:19,640
Um, well, what if we decided to, like, chop him up and eat him?

303
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,040
Eat his flesh?

304
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,560
That would be fine.

305
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,440
Y'all go ahead and get him and chop him up and eat him,

306
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,380
because that would do you good.

307
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,840
We're a real cool ghoul.

308
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,140
Yeah, that would do you just right to chop him up and eat him.

309
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,640
Why don't you get some lye and put him in a pot of lye,

310
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,400
and then it'll all dissolve in the lye.

311
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,660
Why, thanks, man.

312
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,980
That's a good idea, isn't it?

313
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:42,600
Ah-hoo!

314
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,500
All right, whore.

315
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,280
What?

316
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,820
I said do your thing, whore.

317
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,300
Is this any way for a funeral director to be targeting?

318
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,340
Hey, yo, is that?

319
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,460
You know, she's so unresponsible, I'll just cut it.

320
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,780
And why would you wait till 12.25 at night to call a funeral director?

321
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,140
Because I get...

322
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,660
You should be calling one tomorrow morning early.

323
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,040
Because...

324
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,000
One of your choice.

325
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,140
Well, let me tell you, I've got an inheritance coming.

326
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,700
I've got money, all right?

327
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,380
You know, it's just...

328
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,060
I don't have to explain every...

329
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,680
No, you really don't have to explain none of it to me,

330
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,560
because I'm not going to have the body.

331
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,340
Well, you won't do it?

332
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,360
I'm not going to have it.

333
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,660
This is the third prank call I've had tonight about dead people.

334
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,860
And I'm not going to have anybody that's dead,

335
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,920
so I don't need to listen to your...

336
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,240
But you're off funeral home.

337
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,260
No, what are you saying?

338
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,260
What are you, insane?

339
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,700
Yes, I'm very much insane.

340
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,280
Do you know Jerry Lewis?

341
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,100
I'm Jerry Lewis.

342
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,100
You know what?

343
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,120
You're Jerry Lewis?

344
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,520
I'm Jerry Lewis.

345
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,060
Oh, that's cute.

346
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:58,620
That's...

347
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,960
No, I really am.

348
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:00,900
Listen...

349
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,380
Listen to me.

350
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,960
You know, I love to talk to an idiot.

351
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,300
It makes me laugh.

352
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:07,820
What?

353
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,160
What?

354
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,120
What?

355
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,480
What?

356
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,740
Now, am I in communication with some sort of...

357
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,460
Is this supposed to be your caller here?

358
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,140
Is this supposed to be your little caller?

359
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,440
Is this what you call a little caller?

360
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,020
Hey, let's lose the background track.

361
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,500
Yeah, thanks.

362
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,520
Now, caller, I want you to tell me your most embarrassing moment.

363
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,160
My most embarrassing moment?

364
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,420
That's right.

365
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,240
Well...

366
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,580
Go ahead.

367
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,360
We're all ears.

368
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:44,380
Well, I'd raped myself into the church and nailed myself to their cross

369
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,240
and was standing there on the cross.

370
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:46,240


371
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:46,240


372
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,820
I was sitting there above the altar when all of a sudden my loincloth came down.

373
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,740
They all thought I was Jesus Christ until they saw that I was hung like a subgenius.

374
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,920
It is the time to go public with the war on Satan.

375
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:07,620
We must go public because when the government made ease to wipe out drug users and homosexuals,

376
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,240
it was not enough.

377
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,820
Yes, we need more.

378
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:16,220
They have developed terms that will mark people who take drugs and let them go.

379
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:16,220


380
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,220
They have turned us into loud music.

381
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,160
They've discouraged the skin of people who listen to certain vibrations of music.

382
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,760
They've discouraged drug users also.

383
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,080
They have terms to kill all major sinners who kill the Christians.

384
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,120
Satan kills.

385
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,520
God will kill him.

386
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,520
How many bodies die?

387
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,160
Children of God dying.

388
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,480
We will say a prayer.

389
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,480
God help us cast out the infidels.

390
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,020
We welcome Satan's plundering, pillaging, and killing.

391
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
For Satan kills all men.

392
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,120
Only the depraved and wretched.

393
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,020
God, let the gargoyles loose from the gates of hell.

394
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,720
You said that you're a weapon against wretchedness.

395
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:08,660
Let them cast out their feces upon the faces of earth into the quagmire of human filth and wickedness.

396
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,680
God will stamp his heel into the sinner's face.

397
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,800
Then Satan will judge and beat them down again.

398
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,980
Then they will be cast into hell.

399
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,300
Their insides will come out from within.

400
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,640
And all sinners who don't die will be old and decrepit.

401
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,620
Who died?

402
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:26,980
Christ.

403
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:27,320
Why?

404
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,280
Your sins.

405
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,020
God always does die.

406
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,220
He died for you.

407
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:31,980
I can do it.

408
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,420
Okay, ma'am.

409
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,400
He's going to talk to you.

410
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:34,660
Okay?

411
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,160
Okay.

412
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,180
He'd rather do it himself.

413
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:36,840
Okay.

414
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,520
Hey.

415
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,200
Yeah.

416
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,340
Now, listen here.

417
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,500
There's...

418
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,300
There was a sexual day.

419
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:44,600
I...

420
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,280
When everything happened...

421
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:47,840
Be quiet.

422
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,280
I don't know how long ago.

423
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,080
Don't ask him.

424
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,760
He's drunk.

425
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,200
Well, listen here, guys.

426
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,880
Uh, I...

427
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,360
Like you say, and we know that you have drank too much, but do you have a mother and a father?

428
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,140
Hell no.

429
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,480
I'm 21.

430
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,440
He's 18.

431
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,140
And...

432
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,460
And you don't have a mother?

433
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,020
No.

434
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,220
Is she dead?

435
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,060
She's dead.

436
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:07,720
Is your dad?

437
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,080
My daddy got ran over by a car.

438
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:10,760
Oh.

439
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,940
How long ago?

440
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,480
Two years ago.

441
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:13,920
Really?

442
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,760
Well, do you work?

443
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,600
Do I work?

444
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:17,960
Uh-huh.

445
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,080
Oh, yeah, I work.

446
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,420
Uh-huh.

447
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,460
I work at Phillips.

448
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,780
You work at Phillips.

449
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,900
Does your brother work?

450
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,680
Yeah, my brother works at Burger King.

451
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,100
At Burger King.

452
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,080
Well...

453
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,920
Uh...

454
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,640
It just seems to me like you guys just don't have enough to do.

455
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,340
And, uh...

456
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:35,760
Well, what do you...

457
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,640
I don't understand.

458
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:42,740
Well, to be getting on the phone this time of night and be drunk and talking out of your

459
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,420
mind.

460
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:43,460


461
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:43,460


462
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,220
It sort of sounds ridiculous now, doesn't it, really?

463
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,800
Well, I mean, I'm sorry, ma'am.

464
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,700
No, I don't have a daughter named Glenda.

465
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,580
I have two.

466
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,240
Well, you know, I tried to tell you a minute ago that I'm sorry.

467
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,440
Well, I know.

468
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,980
And I don't know how in the hell this all came about.

469
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,940
I really don't.

470
00:21:59,060 --> 00:21:59,720
Well, I don't either.

471
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,560
But you know what?

472
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,960
I don't think it's an accident you call me.

473
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,180
Uh, now, your name is Johnson.

474
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:05,900
Yes.

475
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,360
And what's your first name, did you say?

476
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:07,980
David.

477
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:08,540
David.

478
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,380
David Johnson.

479
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,440
Well, anyway, what I was gonna tell you, uh, David, is that you're a man.

480
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:13,440


481
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:13,440


482
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,360
David Johnson.

483
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:14,360


484
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,060
And I don't know if it's an accident you call me.

485
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,980
Is it, all right.

486
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,160
But, um, let me tell you why.

487
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,940
Because I know I used to be a real miserable person.

488
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,460
And I done think that I knew that I shouldn't do.

489
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:32,060
But I was running and I was looking for something to fill a void that I had in my heart.

490
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,220
And, like you, you're not happy, are you?

491
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,340
No, ma'am.

492
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:36,860
Not really.

493
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,020
I hate my job.

494
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,220
I hate my wife.

495
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,000
I hate both of my kids.

496
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,100
I hate my brother. All he ever does is get drunk. That's all I ever do. I hate myself.

497
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,900
Well, that's what it all boils down to, David.

498
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,860
And really, you know, we're not supposed to hate ourselves.

499
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:59,320
And it's not that you hate yourself. You have just made such a mess of your life.

500
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,160
My daddy did that before he died.

501
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:07,080
He probably did that. He didn't help you any. If he was a mean person or...

502
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,380
He was. He used to beat me up, me and my brother.

503
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:13,680
He beat you both up. Was your mother a good person?

504
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,820
Do what?

505
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,940
Was your mother a good person?

506
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,520
My mother was a saint.

507
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,140
She was a saint. Do you think she was a Christian?

508
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:28,180
I know for a fact she was. She used to make me go to church, and I didn't like her because of that.

509
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,200
But you really now wish that you had...

510
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,640
I wish my mama was here so she could take me to church today.

511
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,920
Are there any questions?

512
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,140
Yes.

513
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,760
Please ask your questions so that all the members may hear.

514
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,360
Yes, John.

515
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,180
Hello.

516
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:11,840
Hello.

517
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,020
Hello.

518
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:27,060
Oh money pad me wallet. Oh money pad me wallet. Oh money pad me wallet. Oh money pad me wallet. Oh money pad me wallet.

519
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,740
Oh feel the energy.

520
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,040
There's the grounding and self-centering.

521
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:36,000
We need to do a grounding and self-centering right now.

522
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,760
Oh I can feel the change coming on right now.

523
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,480
Joe, speak it, Joe.

524
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,920
Now, we want you to clear your mind and think only of yourself.

525
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,260
Only of you.

526
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,840
Only of you.

527
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,360
In the name of Jesus.

528
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,200
From here up to nature.

529
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,260
.

530
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:51,480
.

531
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,140
.

532
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:54,840
.

533
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,080
.

534
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:55,600
. .

535
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:55,600


536
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,560
Me, me, I, me, I .

537
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:00,560


538
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,300
I, me, me, I.

539
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,820
.

540
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,460
.

541
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:06,480
.

542
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,300
There's no place like my ego.

543
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,760
Boy, that was refreshing, wasn't it?

544
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,700
Aren't you occasions, Joe?

545
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,540
John Lennon, I me mine, I me mine, I me mine.

546
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:35,980
Hey, Sting, thanks again for clarifying again this thing about the Trevino-ist, you know, making sure that...

547
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,540
It can't be said enough.

548
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,160
No.

549
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:47,920
As long as the secular Trevino-ists are still launching Trevino heads on Thursdays, Easter, or any other time,

550
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,840
that we cannot rest.

551
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,240
No.

552
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,340
Our vigilance can never cease.

553
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:53,500
The mighty heads.

554
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,660
The mighty bleeding heads.

555
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,260
There's one right here in the station, friends.

556
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,760
It's a head sort of manifestation.

557
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,640
Bleeding head good, heel head bad.

558
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,820
Hey, you can't do that.

559
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,760
You can't deliver a plug on this show.

560
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,160
Food plugging.

561
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,620
It's time to prank the preacher.

562
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,680
Immediately cover over with obfuscation.

563
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,320
Yeah, we're going to have to bleep that out.

564
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,580
We'll have to adjust that later so none of you heard it.

565
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,680
I don't know who you think you are.

566
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,480
You can't come on the air and do a...

567
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,280
We'll have to do a specific subgenius address on this show.

568
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,280
Oh, who's plugging?

569
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,200
I'm just asking you to prank him.

570
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:36,520
Well, now look, you can stop scratching that squirrel and get back to basics as you study your subgenius doctrine.

571
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,100
In the book of pre-scriptures.

572
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,640
Okay, and here it is now.

573
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,880
Doctrine one.

574
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:48,420
As we walk down the path, we walk down the pathway of life.

575
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,020
Do you ever turn to yourself and say,

576
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,140
Dammit, where to?

577
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,680
I left socks go.

578
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,540
Now, you know, women and childrens listens to this show.

579
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,560
Women and children.

580
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,580
Women and children come into my laundry room and steal my socks.

581
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,120
And get up.

582
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,720
I'm falling.

583
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,920
And I can't get up.

584
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,980
Oh, my God.

585
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,660
And I can't get up.

586
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:15,120
Well, you'd better buy some of that senior home security stuff, Missy, or else you'll get all out of control.

587
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,160
Yes, join a support group for senior support socks.

588
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,280
Oh, that was...

589
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,280
Too much.

590
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,680
Well, now we're back at the tunnel of love.

591
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,820
Trickling along at a pleasantly slow pace.

592
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,180
And not much more can happen to us.

593
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,340
I tell you, this evening has been one of those times.

594
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,980
It's what you call a Malox moment.

595
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,900
Well, look, that's what it says here.

596
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,620
You know, we've got to get better riders.

597
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,640
That's all I have to say.

598
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,440
Well, anyway, off the record, it's been fun.

599
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,420
But, you know, it kind of gets...

600
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,800
It wears you down after a while.

601
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,400
You come on.

602
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,540
Out here, you do these shows.

603
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,980
It gets so that, you know, it's just not fun anymore.

604
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,900
And that's when you need a little bit of new blood.

605
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,940
It's what we call the time control effect.

606
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,600
I thought he was running away.

607
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,000
Dr. Fred is here.

608
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:21,760
I'm here!

609
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:22,980
He's with us.

610
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,500
And Sister Clone's back.

611
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,860
And the flow, the show, it's floating down around you right now.

612
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,760
Golden baubles floating through the air.

613
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,900
Should we have a little epitaph for Dr. St. Bogomil?

614
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,820
He's not dead yet.

615
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,920
High over Humboldt Bay, looking out on the beautiful lights and the rain.

616
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,020
It's a pleasant sight.

617
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,680
We're drifting gently with the radio show.

618
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,260
The panorama.

619
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:52,540
Drifting down low.

620
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,380
Drifting down low.

621
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,160
The stratosphere.

622
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,260
Drifting down into your headphones.

623
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:57,880
Out there.

624
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,280
Below us, we see the lights of Arcata Eureka.

625
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,620
It's all so beautiful.

626
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,760
The special little light of Bob's country buses.

627
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,900
And we have no telephones up here where we're at, so we're not taking any calls.

628
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,140
Juggle, juggle, juggle.

629
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:22,920
KHS.

630
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:27,640
You with Dr. Fred and Sister Klein.

631
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:31,800
St. Dogzomatic from Arcata there.

632
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:46,420
As well as some prank call reenactments submitted by some anonymous friends of James Blanchard, I think.

633
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,600
Yes.

634
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,800
You also heard, dear friends.

635
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,580
Of course, WCSB in Cleveland.

636
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:04,480
A Reverend Cole show, on which I was lucky enough to appear with St. Stymie de Bergerac and Reverend Mary Squared, au contraire.

637
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,920
And of course, also the most recognizable voices in Subgenius Radio.

638
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:14,940
Dr. Howland puzzling evidence there on KPFA in Berkeley.

639
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,440
Oh, yes.

640
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,920
What a lovely, horrible thing.

641
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,640
Putting a little rain seed.

642
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,140
A little rain seed here, a little rain seed there.

643
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,800
Ha, ha, ha.

644
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,200
We're a little short of oxygen, but that doesn't hurt us.

645
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,100
We don't need it.

646
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:37,340
Fortunately, due to these gills I got at Bobstown, Dobstown, I can breathe almost any kind of thing.

647
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,260
Absolutely.

648
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,060
Acid rain doesn't bother us either.

649
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,840
We're impervious.

650
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:52,300
Looking down below the lights of Arcata and Eureka and Bob's country bunker, a special little light shining off.

651
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,920
And we are in California.

652
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,400
It's so nice to be here.

653
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,920
This guy has a flaming inverted cross.

654
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:02,020
Uh, it looks like, yes, a flaming inverted cross on somebody's lawn in Manila.

655
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,000
I don't understand it.

656
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:04,960
Manila?

657
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,860
There appears to be a dead baby at the same house.

658
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,140
I, perhaps it is too, is suspended from the light.

659
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,860
Do you think you could zero the show in a little closer to this cross burning on the lawn in Manila?

660
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,780
Uh, standby.

661
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,160
Oh.

662
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,360
Hold on, Fred, hold on.

663
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,780
We're working.

664
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,200
We're working.

665
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,380
Twenty-six Americans.

666
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,280
Here we go.

667
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:24,740
Here we go.

668
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,200
Hold on.

669
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,000
Oh, yeah.

670
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:26,180
Hold on.

671
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:26,740
That is...

672
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,700
And you've already killed 17 Americans.

673
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,120
Oh, the cross.

674
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,340
P-L-O-T.

675
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,380
P-L-O-T.

676
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,600
Oh, oh, I'm kind of dizzy.

677
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,620
Did we have to go so low so quickly?

678
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,100
Ah.

679
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,700
I'm coming.

680
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:49,700


681
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,640
I'm coming.

682
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:50,900
I'm coming.

683
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:51,760
I'm coming.

684
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:51,760


685
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:51,760


686
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:51,760


687
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:51,760


688
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:51,760


689
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:51,760


690
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:51,760


691
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:51,760


692
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:51,760


693
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:53,920
I'm coming.

694
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,280
I'm coming.

695
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,100
Whoa.

696
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,020
I'm coming.

697
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,540
I'm coming.

698
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:10,540


699
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:10,540


700
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:10,540


701
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:10,540


702
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:10,540


703
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,940
Isn't he guarantees life?

704
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:11,940


705
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:11,940


706
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,280
You were saying something about us going toaaaaan the moon.

707
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:12,720
Oh, yes we were.

708
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:12,720


709
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:12,900


710
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:12,900


711
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:12,900


712
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,340
Hmm.

713
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:13,340


714
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,500
What do you mean we were at the moon?

715
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,320
We were on planet C.

716
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,000
We were like very successful.

717
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,140
Ah.

718
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,080
Unfortunately.

719
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,080


720
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,080


721
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:26,400
you so much, even no matter what all you do, even that you're drunk as a dog, he still

722
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:31,480
loves you, and he doesn't like your sins, he doesn't like things you've done, and he

723
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:36,960
knows you've made a mess of your life, but he realizes that you're just weak, you know,

724
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,840
you're just a person, a human that makes no sense, but he loves you, and I'd like to be

725
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,040
your mother, I'd like for you to go to church with me, I'll take the place of your mother,

726
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,680
really.

727
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:57,060
Ma'am, this is so touching, I just, I know my brother's drunk too, but you tell him the

728
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,180
same thing you just told me, and we may feel better, hang on.

729
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:02,920
Hello.

730
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,260
Yeah.

731
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,480
Now your name is Bob?

732
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,200
Yeah.

733
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,100
And you really are her brother, his brother?

734
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:09,840
Uh-huh.

735
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,220
Are you drunk?

736
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,300
Uh, yeah.

737
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,640
Well, how come you guys, how come you guys get drunk?

738
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,220
Well, you all right?

739
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:21,760
Hey.

740
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,360
Yeah, I'm sorry.

741
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:24,820
Hey.

742
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,540
Just a second.

743
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,200
Hey, Bob.

744
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,240
Don't hang up.

745
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,260
I won't hang up.

746
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:38,940
The voluntary relinquishing of responsibility for our lives and actions is one of the greatest

747
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,140
enemies of our times.

748
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,100
Oswald was a radar operator.

749
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,020
He'd have about as much...

750
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,120
He'd have as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.

751
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,000
These books have gotten to your mind, Mr. Garrison.

752
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,340
And then...

753
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,240
Here's Johnny!

754
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:03,280
Ask not what your country can do for you.

755
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,420
Ask what you can do for your...

756
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,520
Here is a bulletin.

757
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:14,620
But there are certain things that we can all agree on.

758
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,060
There is...

759
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,020
There is...

760
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,460
A right and a left.

761
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,480
Uh-huh.

762
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,500
Let me hear you say, uh-huh.

763
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,720
Uh-huh.

764
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,680
There is a dark and a light.

765
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,340
Uh-huh.

766
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,320
Uh-huh.

767
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,280
There's a good and a bad.

768
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,080
Uh-huh.

769
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:34,660
A religion!

770
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,160
A wrong and a right.

771
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,760
Now...

772
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,580
Who's the wrong?

773
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:44,080
To the pagan, there's a lord versus lady.

774
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,000
Taoists are yin versus yang.

775
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,000


776
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,000


777
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,000


778
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,000


779
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,700
is yang but the subgenius?

780
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,460
Yang man.

781
00:34:51,980 --> 00:35:01,380
Well, Bob might have had a lot of yang.

782
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,720
Take it from me, folks.

783
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,960
Connie L. Yang.

784
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,100
It may take a subgenius to make all that money,

785
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,420
but honey, it took a Connie to send it.

786
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,440
Charming, charming Irene.

787
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,380
My heart is filled with joy.

788
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,060
Your love, you said, is mine.

789
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,420
And all of very good.

790
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,720
You're good, you're good, Irene.

791
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,420
Heaven sent you to me.

792
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,640
Charming, charming Irene.

793
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,460
I'm in love with you.

794
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:40,080
You'll be imploding with joy before you know it.

795
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,760
Oh, happy, happy joy.

796
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,740
Did you notice how when I launched the head

797
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,360
in the name of Ren and Stimpy,

798
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:47,980
how the author...

799
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,800
The audience just went nuts.

800
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,700
Absolutely went wild.

801
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,100
Truly, Ren and Stimpy cuts across all,

802
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:59,160
almost all cultural and whatever kind of borders.

803
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,700
Oh, it brings me back to those days of my childhood

804
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,840
in front of the television with that audiovisual

805
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,360
pouring into my eyes,

806
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,540
eating those highly sugared cereals

807
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,060
and taking a couple of hits off that whipped cream bottle.

808
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,980
That's where it all started.

809
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,500
This is Ren the Hwacky.

810
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,600
And this is Stimson J. Catt of the Ren and Stimpy Show.

811
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,720
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack on KNON.

812
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,760
Keep listening, you idiot.

813
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

814
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,240
Else I shall deal you.

815
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,900
In the name of Ren and Stimpy.

816
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,160
A secondary launching.

817
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,780
A secondary launching.

818
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,480
It's incredible.

819
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:45,680
Rainbomb.

820
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:46,800
Rainbomb.

821
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,600
Rainbomb.

822
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,860
Rainbomb.

823
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,100
Rainbomb.

824
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:50,700
Rainbomb.

825
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,940
Bleeding head cut.

826
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,880
Healed head down.

827
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,940
Bleeding head cut.

828
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,040
Healed head down.

829
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,840
Bleeding head cut.

830
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,840
Healed head down.

831
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,380
Oh, speaking of fun.

832
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,840
Connie is the true goddess of the subgenius church.

833
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,980
You can't con Connie.

834
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,980
Garden belts for great ideas.

835
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,660
When I'm good, I'm very, very good.

836
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,180
But baby, when I'm slack, I'm better.

837
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,840
I'm better.

838
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,860
Let's testify.

839
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,420
Yes, Lord.

840
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,080
Amen.

841
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:36,960
Amen.

842
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,760
Well, before you go getting in all this dogmatic stuff,

843
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,020
we just want to welcome you back.

844
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,800
You've been gone so long, Sister Clone.

845
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,080
Yeah, where the hell have you been?

846
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,300
It's been a difficult absence, you know.

847
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,780
Um, I'm really...

848
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,120
I'm really still not sure what happened.

849
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:49,880
I...

850
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,880
Were you off studying the ways of Bob?

851
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:52,780
No, I...

852
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,140
You were studying the ways of Hobie.

853
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,220
I don't know if it was a dream or if it really happened,

854
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:57,680
but I think that I was...

855
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,880
Studying the ways of Akira.

856
00:37:59,140 --> 00:37:59,980
I was kidnapped.

857
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,100
So, I do know Akira.

858
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,080
Oh, go ahead.

859
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:04,500
Go ahead.

860
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,380
I was kidnapped by a...

861
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:09,000
Don't let us big, powerful subgenius doctors frighten you,

862
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:09,700
Sister Clone.

863
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,200
Go ahead.

864
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:10,520
Speak.

865
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,600
Oh, well, it's so...

866
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,860
I'm still so shaken up by my experiences.

867
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,020
I can imagine.

868
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,720
I was kidnapped by someone who attempted to...

869
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:21,460
deprogram me, force-fed me Pepsi and aspirin

870
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,180
as an antidote to what they said.

871
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,000
Uh, what was a...

872
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,420
A deep, uh...

873
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,920
I was having a problem.

874
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:29,620
408.

875
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,060
And, um...

876
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,080
You know...

877
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:33,500
Yes, yes.

878
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,100
It was actually working.

879
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,960
I was attempting to invoke the power of Bob.

880
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,420
Straight out of Brooklyn, boy!

881
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,480
Yo, boy, straight out of Brooklyn!

882
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,000
And you invoked that power of Bob, and what happened?

883
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,400
Well, I don't know,

884
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,140
but I woke up, uh, lying in the parking lot next to a 7-Eleven,

885
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,440
clutching a Pepsi, wondering if it had all been just a dream,

886
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,080
whether they had actually deprogrammed me and learned some of the secrets.

887
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,580
Oh, it's them, them subgenius people taking your voice away,

888
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,700
and they're giving you nothing but this parking little howl,

889
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,000
and all you could do is just kinda yop, yop and yop and...

890
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:15,380
Scientists announced today that time travel is theoretically possible.

891
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,100
An article on...

892
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,640
Page 2 of the San Francisco Examiner...

893
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:24,780
postulated that a gravitational field could, in theory,

894
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,660
and in accordance with the beliefs of modern physics,

895
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,180
influence time within a controlled area.

896
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:32,660
Ah...

897
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,960
Hey, Hal, what's the liquid slack?

898
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:42,240
The problem is total disorientation and confusion of all elements of life by the renegade rogue device.

899
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,360
Wait, wait, wait.

900
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,340
There's something in there.

901
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,460
There's two of you over there.

902
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,140
Wait, who's she?

903
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:46,900
What's happening?

904
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,260
I'm in a space and now...

905
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,800
The problem is it...

906
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,520
Don't take that!

907
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,340
I've got you!

908
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:53,780
Oh, Gesundheit.

909
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,800
It's real hard to try to fix this thing when it's going haywire and...

910
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,000
Here we go.

911
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,340
The effects could be disastrous to our own continuum.

912
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,060
There we go.

913
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,420
Oh!

914
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,260
They're shooting at us.

915
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,460
Okay, we're clearly at the top now of the hill.

916
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,040
All the subgeniuses are all around me.

917
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:07,720
How do we get out of this?

918
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,560
I've only got a few bullets left.

919
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,360
I'm gonna have to...

920
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:09,860
All the cops!

921
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,540
Wait a minute, I didn't have anything to do with this.

922
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:13,920
Okay, you're under arrest now.

923
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,180
Wow, I'm passing out.

924
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,020
And you're in the subgenius chair.

925
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,380
I'm in the subgenius chair.

926
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,100
I'm going crazy.

927
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,280
I hear the water dripping and the interrogator's voice.

928
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,120
Hey, who's that?

929
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,240
Oh, holy moly!

930
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,260
All right, stand launch.

931
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,060
One.

932
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:26,600
Ignition.

933
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,260
Oh my god.

934
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:28,900
Lift off.

935
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,800
Oh, oh, I'll get it.

936
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,060
All right, if I could just hear this bolt, I could...

937
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,840
Okay, here we go.

938
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,200
Project on bad.

939
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,540
Yeah, well you see, um...

940
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:43,720
Project on bad.

941
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,360
They said that the problem is that instead of the influence of the...

942
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:47,360


943
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:53,740
the external continuum, the chrononaut or time traveler might, uh, reduce his, uh...

944
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,000
How will this one put it?

945
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,280
It's not even in the...

946
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,960
Yeah, that'll teach me, yeah.

947
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,360
Well, well, hey clown.

948
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:05,920
Hello.

949
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,700
Let me tell you, you sound really pretty tonight.

950
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,400
I know, I'm feeling pretty.

951
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,800
But you know what?

952
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,640
I felt...

953
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,200
I felt the giggle coming on when I heard you.

954
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,380
You sound sort of Louisianish.

955
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:17,820
Well...

956
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,600
You do sound like you should shoot our next president.

957
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,720
Well, you know...

958
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,500
You're a man!

959
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,020
Now and then, we all get the urge.

960
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:26,740
Yeah.

961
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,260
Is this a symptom of having used your prairie squid prior to de-beaking?

962
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,580
I mean, is this what happened?

963
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:37,300
Well, you know, this was an oral use of prairie squid, which I cannot recommend to any subgenius.

964
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,260
It's definitely out.

965
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:41,440
I got a shot of straight sepia right down my gullet.

966
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:41,740
Oh.

967
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,860
And things have not been the same since.

968
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,040
I hate it when that happens.

969
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:45,640
Oh, lord.

970
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:45,760
Yeah.

971
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,200
I'm not sure if I can get it out.

972
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:46,200


973
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:46,200


974
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:46,200


975
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,000
I don't know if I will recover.

976
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:50,920
However, I have been using a snake oil.

977
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,600
I mean, not the Dobbs brand snake oil, but something's going to get me going again, I'm

978
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:55,880
sure.

979
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:02,100
Will you be well enough to attend a special anniversary celebrations of the Day of Infamy

980
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,240
occurring tomorrow throughout Humboldt County?

981
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,800
The Day of Infamy, of course.

982
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,300
Yeah.

983
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,800
Boy, how destructive this thing is.

984
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:14,280
You know, it's damaging the fabric of the universe and the space-time continuum.

985
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,760
All through the universe.

986
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,740
All through all time.

987
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,040
Well, that's what happens when you use that excess technology without a future.

988
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,260
What are excess technology?

989
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,060
It's what we call forbidden science.

990
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,780
It's the incredible excess technology we all think we're within the show.

991
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,600
Yes, it's Edgar Allan Poe once again.

992
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,680
And I think...

993
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,240
I'm afraid not.

994
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,360
Well, you know, we've got other things.

995
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,960
We've got lots of stuff for you.

996
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,300
We've got lots of stuff.

997
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,000
We've got gags, cosmic truth, stories.

998
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,640
We have 28 minutes left in the show.

999
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,600
It's the meeting.

1000
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:45,740
You can have it.

1001
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:45,740


1002
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,240
It's the meeting of life.

1003
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,860
It's the meeting of life.

1004
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,300
That little carrot in your backyard that you thought was so unimportant.

1005
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,780
Life and life's effluents clouded walls and shadows.

1006
00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:00,800
Jolly color is the spirit and the power which wedded nature gives to us in dower.

1007
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,600
A new earth and a new heaven.

1008
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,780
Undreamt of by the sensual and the proud.

1009
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,400
Slack is the soft voice.

1010
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,620
Slack the luminous cloud.

1011
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,740
We in ourselves rejoice.

1012
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:28,880
Reverend Cole tried to shoot me last night.

1013
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,680
And you know, the funny thing is I really don't...

1014
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,520
I wasn't that upset because...

1015
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,440
Well, I missed.

1016
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,320
I don't fear death.

1017
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,000
I don't fear death at all.

1018
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:40,760
I know that I will never be allowed into the Christian heaven.

1019
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:41,800
Praise Bob.

1020
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:42,800
Praise Bob.

1021
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,640
Praise Bob.

1022
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,360
None of your friends would be there.

1023
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,340
Who would want to go?

1024
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,680
And the Christian hell is only for those who believe in it.

1025
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:53,040
It's only there to, like, scare Muslims and Christians and people.

1026
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,060
For venalists.

1027
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:54,340
Right.

1028
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,360
For those who are afraid that if they don't believe in it, they'll go there.

1029
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:57,840
They'll go there.

1030
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,260
That's right.

1031
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,900
Those are the ones that are on the low...

1032
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,140
Get the lowest rung.

1033
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,320
And everyone knows...

1034
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,360
Everyone knows how hard it is to get a good corned beef sandwich in heaven, too.

1035
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:06,860
Yeah.

1036
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,160
As opposed to this one.

1037
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,360
But subgenius hell.

1038
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:09,700
It's just too white.

1039
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:10,980
Valhalla.

1040
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:11,120
Valhalla.

1041
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,460
It's just...

1042
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:15,860
It's the kind of classical hell, the subgenius hell.

1043
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:16,540
It's called helle.

1044
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,580
With two L's and an E.

1045
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:18,800
Helle.

1046
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:19,780
Helle.

1047
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:20,020


1048
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,380
It's...

1049
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:22,440
It's...

1050
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:23,440
Probably...

1051
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:29,360
It's the more organic spiritual version of the escape vessels of the sex goddesses, which...

1052
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:35,620
So, like, on X day, no matter what happens, if you die as a subgenius or if you are ruptured

1053
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:40,960
up into the escape vessels, you either get the spiritual hell or the techno hell.

1054
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,800
Which, of course, by the hell we mean these are like heaven.

1055
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:49,400
But you have to go through subgenius hell in order to be ready for the pleasure, in

1056
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:54,060
order to be able to withstand the increased pleasure of the subgenius heaven.

1057
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:54,700
Ah, yes.

1058
00:44:54,700 --> 00:45:00,380
It's like a cleansing purgatory that prepares you for the true, true slackness.

1059
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:01,480
Ah.

1060
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:04,760
Oh, over there.

1061
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,840
You have to call him.

1062
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,180
Good afternoon, Sturdy.

1063
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:10,960
Back this way, ladies and gentlemen.

1064
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:10,960


1065
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:10,960


1066
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:10,960


1067
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:10,960


1068
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:10,960


1069
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,040
You'll see Tutantese, the ugliest thing on the midway.

1070
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:18,680
And if you step into this tent, gentlemen, no children or...

1071
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,700
They dwell in caves, not high-rise apartments.

1072
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:25,120
You will see the most sickening sight your eyes have ever seen.

1073
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:29,500
It's caution, ladies and gentlemen, against doing that terrible drug, LSD.

1074
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:35,600
Inside this tent, my good friends, is a young man who experimented with this deadly drunk

1075
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,320
and you can see for yourself the effect it had.

1076
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:39,720
Ah.

1077
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,000
Not only on his mind and his soul...

1078
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:42,140
Hell.

1079
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:46,020
...but on his very own body, right down to his toenails.

1080
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:47,840
And here is that young man now.

1081
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,380
Hey, hell.

1082
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,440
What is it, my boy?

1083
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,160
It's Gary.

1084
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:54,040
Could you guys stop by here on the way home?

1085
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,340
Well, I suppose so.

1086
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,400
What's going on over there?

1087
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,320
Well, I can't talk about it right now, but I...

1088
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,240
You'll like it, whatever it is.

1089
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:07,820
I hope you're not mad at me for giving you that hoot and holler early around in the evening.

1090
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:08,840
No, I'm not.

1091
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:09,700
I'm just...

1092
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:09,700


1093
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:09,700


1094
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:09,700


1095
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:09,700


1096
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:09,720
I'm just trying to get my mind off of the Earth.

1097
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,020
But if you guys could stop by, I'd appreciate it.

1098
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,240
You betcha, you bet.

1099
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:18,700
Well, you have to ask Dr. Brough because he's piloting the space module.

1100
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,640
Well, I'm sure he'll be amenable when he finds out about the free prop program.

1101
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:24,880
Oh, wow.

1102
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,280
Amenable, abominable, adorable.

1103
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:29,200
We'll do it.

1104
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:29,600
Sure.

1105
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,040
I've got another two and a half weeks, so see you later.

1106
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:32,820
Okay.

1107
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:37,020
We'll be right over to dip our wicks in the fountain of eternal pleasure.

1108
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:39,680
That's located right off the Earth.

1109
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:39,680


1110
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:39,680


1111
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:39,680


1112
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:39,680


1113
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:39,680


1114
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:39,680


1115
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:39,960
All right, I shall be waiting for you.

1116
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,600
All right, Dr. Brough, we're going to take you up to Jungle Boulevard in beautiful Oak

1117
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,440
Town, California.

1118
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:47,980
And we'll stop by and pick up some ice cream too, is that all right, Auntie May?

1119
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:50,480
Wait a minute, who am I talking to now?

1120
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,780
This is the phony caller.

1121
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:56,220
You know, it's so strange to be disembodied right at the moment.

1122
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,940
You seem rather disembodied.

1123
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,000
Floating, floating here...

1124
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I may be mistaken, that girl ain't got her pants on.

1125
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,540
I hear zippers here and there.

1126
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,060
Yeah, well, that's a check.

1127
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,280
What you see right here...

1128
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,180
The boys of the year.

1129
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:08,540
Is the boys of the year...

1130
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:09,320
I like what we see down.

1131
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:09,660
You want to know why we're down?

1132
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:09,660


1133
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,700
The voice is here.

1134
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,240
Straight out of Brooklyn and Boyd.

1135
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,200
No, man.

1136
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,780
Talk to me, number three.

1137
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:16,560
Talk to me.

1138
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,600
Yeah, yeah.

1139
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:21,100
So are you deathly ill?

1140
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:24,260
Can we send a care basket, perhaps some chocolate-covered...

1141
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:25,660
Shit, Uncle Reed!

1142
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,560
Actually, it's just a voice.

1143
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:29,480
You know, I...

1144
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,040
It hurts to talk, but I'm doing it.

1145
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:33,920
I'm doing it.

1146
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:36,040
Are you doing it for Bob, damn it?

1147
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,060
I give testimony.

1148
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,120
I mean, there's a reward.

1149
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,160
There's a bounty out for my voice.

1150
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,240
You should find it.

1151
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:45,180
I will hit you on the head and give you the healing power of Bob!

1152
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,580
Can I get a witness?

1153
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:49,100
I will give you my seat on the exorcist.

1154
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:51,000
If you can find my voice.

1155
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,640
Children, there is a quest in Arcata tonight.

1156
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,720
I have given a secret treasure map.

1157
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:56,640
It's buried in...

1158
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,500
It's on the plaza at the foot of President McKinley's feet.

1159
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,700
The Lord has blessed this quest.

1160
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,080
Exactly.

1161
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,200
You follow the map and you find my voice.

1162
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:07,820
I want every waking subgenius to head down to the plaza right now

1163
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:08,100
and find my voice.

1164
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:08,520
I want every waking subgenius to head down to the plaza right now

1165
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:08,560
and find my voice.

1166
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:08,560


1167
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,000
and find that map.

1168
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,280
Right now, right now.

1169
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:13,300
When we find your voice, we will cage it and return it to you.

1170
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:16,580
Or would you prefer that we freed it in some wild area

1171
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:18,080
so that it could roam the area?

1172
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:21,880
Actually, just let it watch the antics with a little bit of prairie squid action.

1173
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:25,600
You know, just let it sit and do the voyeur thing that it's so fond of.

1174
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:29,360
Special prize for all you subgeniuses who make it down to that plaza right now.

1175
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,300
Constable Bob will be waiting there for you.

1176
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:32,880
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

1177
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:37,540
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

1178
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:55,500
The Blaise Brown Food Pints of the Gods, and you're listening to the subgenius.

1179
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:57,460
The Subgenius.

1180
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:59,180
Our home.

1181
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,000
What?

1182
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:03,380
Gosh.

1183
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:07,160
What else caught your eye at the show, at the devival, Reverend Stang?

1184
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:11,120
Well, I got snagged on a coat hanger at one point when they were trying to...

1185
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,100
God almighty.

1186
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:12,700
In your eye?

1187
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:19,500
Yeah, but, you know, I'm on a lot of healing herbs at any given time.

1188
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,960
Well, I was going to say, what good would a bleeding Stang head do us?

1189
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:24,480
Yeah.

1190
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,340
And launch it.

1191
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,180
Well, couldn't you?

1192
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:27,980
Well, not in its present form.

1193
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:30,020
That was one industrial-strength catapult.

1194
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:33,000
I think you could have actually launched the Stang head.

1195
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:38,220
Oh, friends, the launching catapult, we hadn't even mentioned that.

1196
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,960
It was the most obscene.

1197
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,700
All I can say is, if the legs had been spread a little bit more,

1198
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,140
the head probably would have flown farther.

1199
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:51,340
Had the legs been spread more, there would have been a ladder between them.

1200
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,040
Oh, the alabaster legs.

1201
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,900
There would have been more head either way.

1202
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,440
But the head did squirt around.

1203
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,080
You could feel the electricity.

1204
00:49:59,080 --> 00:49:59,620
Oh.

1205
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:02,360
You could feel the electricity in the air from that head launching.

1206
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,340
It was a thing to behold.

1207
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,720
Now we know why she got no legs.

1208
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:12,200
As Janer, the crazy preacher, Janer of Little Rock,

1209
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,660
he punctuates his every other sentence with,

1210
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,140
Help me, somebody.

1211
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,020
She ain't got no legs.

1212
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:19,000
My legs are on fire.

1213
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,160
Pull the lever down and you go.

1214
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,220
We pulled the lever down.

1215
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:28,940
The she ain't got no legs is from the unfortunate incidents of people losing their legs.

1216
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:32,300
At Doctors for Bob concerts, we often wondered where those legs went.

1217
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,460
And there they were up on stage.

1218
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:35,040
That's true.

1219
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:40,680
With lasciviously spread eagles mounted on this sort of framework,

1220
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,840
religious-looking framework.

1221
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,100
The platform of cherubim.

1222
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:44,960
Yeah.

1223
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:45,540
Yeah.

1224
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,980
It's like, oh, God.

1225
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,740
Frightening-looking thing.

1226
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:53,280
But it was a great launching, and it had a secondary launching.

1227
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,720
The first launching, it landed in somebody's lap,

1228
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:59,060
and they screamed and threw the head up.

1229
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,540
Up into the air, further back into the audience.

1230
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:03,580
People kissing it.

1231
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,460
They really responded to the head launching,

1232
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,860
which was the climax of the show.

1233
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,320
Hail, Connie.

1234
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:17,320
But we lose track of the elusive Connie.

1235
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:19,520
Where did she go?

1236
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,060
To the

1237
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,520
hospital.

1238
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:42,080
Oh, yes, dear friends.

1239
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:52,180
And before it gets too much later, I think I should at least fill some of you in on what's going on.

1240
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,500
In a way, we hate to do that.

1241
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,880
But I should explain that you're listening to the Subgenius Radio.

1242
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,500
We're a ministry hour of slack.

1243
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:05,180
Sponsored by, yes, the Church of the Subgenius.

1244
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:13,320
Tonight's show in particular has been a cross-section of the other subgenius shows from around the country.

1245
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:21,140
There's only two or three other original ones, which this one is off to compose.

1246
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:27,800
And while you can learn more about our outreach,

1247
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:29,400
you can also learn more about the subgenius of the Subgenius Radio.

1248
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:35,680
In the name of J.R. Bob Dobbs, the living avatar of slack,

1249
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,560
by writing for free information.

1250
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:42,140
And I'm about to give you that post office box and number to write to.

1251
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,120
Just drop us a line.

1252
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:49,500
Say, Bob, I don't know if I'm with you yet or not,

1253
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,220
but I'm willing to hear what you have to say.

1254
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,800
I'm willing to try slack on for size.

1255
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:56,360
One size fits all, dear friends.

1256
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,420
Just write to Bob.

1257
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:08,300
at post office box 140306.

1258
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:18,000
That's 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1259
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:22,680
And I know that the way I say that and the fact that it's in Dallas, Texas,

1260
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:27,660
and the way all this sounds, like, it sounds like it's just a joke just to put on.

1261
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,200
There's probably nothing at that address.

1262
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:29,920
Well, that's not true.

1263
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:39,520
You're just going to have to drop us a line, and you'll find out for free just how much is at that address.

1264
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,200
And you may find yourself surprised.

1265
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:48,920
There's things to see, say, and do, things to think and know,

1266
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:52,300
and you'll pay to know what you really think, won't you?

1267
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:56,780
Yeah, well, we'll find out.

1268
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,360
Praise Bobby.

1269
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:05,620
Oh, speaking of Bob, last night was the beginning, not only of the first rant and rave

1270
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:09,060
and the little extra dribble of Hurricane Bob,

1271
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:15,440
but in that town, Avon, Colorado, where they named their bridge Bob,

1272
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:17,020
a true omen,

1273
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,760
they're holding the Bob Festival.

1274
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:25,460
And apparently there's, it's like just this Bob out.

1275
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:27,200
Of course, this is the way the conspiracy,

1276
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,140
tries to water down Bob.

1277
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,880
They are basically, it's like the Nissan commercial

1278
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,060
and all those other ways the conspiracy uses to make.

1279
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,680
The cousin Bob, the mellow Bob.

1280
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:38,840
The friendly Bob.

1281
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:39,340
Bob beer.

1282
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:40,980
Bob beer.

1283
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:46,440
Do you think Bob, well, actually Bob did market a type of beer.

1284
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,200
It was called Beer God.

1285
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,980
It was a little series of liquor stores in Tennessee called Beer God.

1286
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,400
Thirst beeper.

1287
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,880
I can't, I can't say what it was.

1288
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,160
It was like, thirst beeper.

1289
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:02,300
And yeah, Beer God.

1290
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,980
He also had Burger God, hunger beeper.

1291
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,840
It was kind of a little chain.

1292
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:11,220
He later moved, it became very successful in Brazil.

1293
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:15,080
There are Bob's Burgers, like the McDonald's of Brazil.

1294
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,180
In the competition.

1295
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:20,920
A country well respected for its culinary tastes and skills.

1296
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:22,500
Oh, it is actually.

1297
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:26,060
They're wonderful hamburgers, very American style.

1298
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,120
But you know, I understand.

1299
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:32,220
I understand the rumor has it that it's Connie that's pulling the strings behind all of those.

1300
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:34,160
Oh, you could, you better believe it.

1301
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:36,620
Any of those extra little, those kind of things.

1302
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:37,800
That's Connie.

1303
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,360
It definitely is.

1304
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,260
It's like with the Jimmy Swagger.

1305
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:47,080
He was the sort of crazy preacher, but his wife was the one who made the ministry so big.

1306
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:47,540
She focused him.

1307
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:49,860
Well, no one knows meat like Connie.

1308
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:50,460
She focused him and whipped him into shape.

1309
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:56,760
She made the bad Bob's say, please and thank you.

1310
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:57,100
Ladies.

1311
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:57,340
That's not.

1312
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,360
Oh, no kidding.

1313
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,760
That probably ain't all she did.

1314
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:06,500
Remember the guy who had never been put on before?

1315
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:07,600
Mm-hmm.

1316
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:14,000
It was at the sales table after all the preaching and dancing and killing had happened.

1317
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,140
And, and there.

1318
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,280
Attempted killing.

1319
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:23,720
The ace and subgenius type people had already, you know, they were, they'd seen the show, they bought their stuff and they were gone.

1320
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,100
So it was only the regular Smart Bar crowd that were there.

1321
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:27,100


1322
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:27,100


1323
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:27,100


1324
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:30,800
And they were coming down to where the, they encountered these bookstores.

1325
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:40,020
It was like an ace store with all these underground comics and amazing sort of, I don't know what kind of philosophy books.

1326
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,140
Timothy Leary and Abbie Hoffman.

1327
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:42,800
Luminatus.

1328
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:43,260
Yeah.

1329
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:44,240
Yeah.

1330
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:44,760
Tom Robbins.

1331
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,800
All those sort of rare things.

1332
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:47,880
Genetology books.

1333
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:49,100
Those were very important.

1334
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,000
Yeah.

1335
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:50,420
Genetology.

1336
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:57,100
This, this guy came down and it was like he, he was looking at the subgenius tapes.

1337
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:57,100


1338
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:57,100


1339
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:57,100


1340
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:57,100


1341
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:57,260
I mean, he had a Bible.

1342
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:03,920
I was about to pack up and quit and so it worked, he, but he gave us hard time about the dollar.

1343
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,580
He was going, well, what is this all about?

1344
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:09,940
He wanted us to tell him what the church of the subgenius was all about.

1345
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:10,360
Get this.

1346
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:14,600
He goes, would you explain briefly what this was all, brief and broad?

1347
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:15,020
Okay.

1348
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:15,780
And.

1349
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:16,220
We do.

1350
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:24,480
We said, look really, honestly, this little pamphlet here is the best thing that, that's the only way to really get you to understand this.

1351
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:25,560
It's only a buck.

1352
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:26,680
I mean.

1353
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,880
God only knows what he paid to get in.

1354
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:32,340
He probably had $40 worth of ecstasy in his pocket or whatever.

1355
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,620
But none of these people wanted to spend a dollar.

1356
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:39,440
That's probably just what you want me to do, give you a dollar.

1357
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:45,360
As if we weren't giving him a 16-page book in return that takes a week to read.

1358
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:46,900
He wouldn't do it.

1359
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,820
So at that point, he goes, I don't even know who Bob is.

1360
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:55,660
And Gobi and I just kind of went, oh, you don't know who he is?

1361
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,600
Well, you can't read this.

1362
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,680
Oh, good. Oh, good. Oh, man.

1363
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:01,100
Stay. Whatever you do, don't buy it. You don't want it.

1364
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:06,560
And I started grabbing not just the pamphlet, but all of the stuff off the table and packing it up.

1365
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,440
It's too dangerous. You'll hurt yourself.

1366
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,800
I was like, stay away. Whatever you do, don't end up like us.

1367
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:14,180
He got a little angry at first.

1368
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:15,080
Yeah, he was pissed.

1369
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,880
But to his credit, he did.

1370
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:21,880
He wandered away, and I think he realized that we had been challenging him somewhat.

1371
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,460
And he came back, and he bought the pamphlet.

1372
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:26,500
It was a true subgenius deal.

1373
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:27,000
He did buy it.

1374
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,060
He did buy it.

1375
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:28,420
He did buy it.

1376
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:29,180
He did buy the pamphlet.

1377
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,660
And then he...

1378
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:34,580
But he went around and got to talking to different people.

1379
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:39,420
And it became obvious to us that the poor guy...

1380
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:45,460
I mean, the Church of the Subgenius is a serious religion, but we love to put each other on.

1381
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:46,700
And we put, you know...

1382
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:50,900
It was like this guy took everything anybody said at face value.

1383
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:53,100
I feel such pity for this man.

1384
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,160
It's like...

1385
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:56,440
He's...

1386
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,040
He's ripe for Scientology.

1387
00:58:58,700 --> 00:58:59,500
Well, he...

1388
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,800
Or maybe he already is.

1389
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:05,200
But fortunately, he has some of the sacred documents in his hand now.

1390
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,500
And so he may well be saved from Scientology.

1391
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:14,460
And he'll learn that until your first dollar is going to Bob, you will never really understand Bob Dobbs.

1392
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:17,120
You will never understand that man until at least one dollar.

1393
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,260
You have to make that breakthrough.

1394
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:19,760
I mean, what's a dollar?

1395
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,080
That's really a token amount.

1396
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:24,620
A dollar is what we used to consider a penny back when I was a kid.

1397
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:26,260
You can get a piece of gum.

1398
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:26,980
Or a dollar.

1399
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,500
L. Ron Hubbard, did you ever order anything?

1400
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,900
As a matter of fact, and this is a true story,

1401
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:37,720
this old gal, Reverend Betsy Curtis in Pennsylvania,

1402
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:44,040
happened to be an old friend of L. Ron Hubbard's from back when he was a science fiction writer.

1403
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,280
And they'd stayed in touch.

1404
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,000
And she had his for real address.

1405
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,520
It was a post office box in Florida.

1406
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:52,880
And people would take his mail to him out on his yacht.

1407
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:54,920
And she gave it to me.

1408
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:56,500
And I said, you know,

1409
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:00,480
you ought to send him some of the subgenius stuff that's slightly based on Scientology,

1410
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,620
like our questionnaire.

1411
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:05,500
And I sent him the pamphlet and the questionnaire and all that

1412
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,160
and thought he might get a kick out of it.

1413
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:08,860
And he died a week later.

1414
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:09,540
Yeah.

1415
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,740
He died a week after I mailed it.

1416
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:12,100
Fancy that.

1417
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:15,460
The same thing happened to the science fiction writer, Philip K. Dick.

1418
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:16,100
Yeah.

1419
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:20,900
We got his address and sent him a subgenius pamphlet.

1420
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,600
And within a week, he was dead.

1421
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:26,320
The second to last person who saw Dick alive was,

1422
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,920
uh, Reverend Jay Condom, the author of P-Dawg Comics,

1423
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:34,040
who had just met him and gone over and they discussed it a little bit.

1424
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:38,040
Well, there are some people who are uncertain about Philip K. Dick's death,

1425
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,640
whether that was really staged or not.

1426
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,180
So, uh, you never know.

1427
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:44,240
Maybe L. Ron Hubbard after Dick?

1428
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,900
I like to think that...

1429
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,880
Cruising with Elvis in Bigfoot's UFO?

1430
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:48,560
That's right.

1431
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,020
That's right.

1432
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,940
The Elvis, Elvis Presley, of course, is alive.

1433
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:53,620
I mean, there's no question about that.

1434
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:54,380
What could kill him?

1435
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:56,060
Bob, Elvis.

1436
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:57,060
Kennedy.

1437
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:58,980
Uh, the...

1438
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,420
Oh, they try to make it seem like partying could cure...

1439
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:03,480
could kill Elvis.

1440
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:04,320
I...

1441
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:04,880
It's impossible.

1442
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,340
They're all in Dobstown.

1443
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:07,320
They're gambling, man.

1444
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:08,220
They're having a great time.

1445
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,660
As long as that Hydra's out there trying to take our slack away.

1446
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:12,660
They cannot die.

1447
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:13,120
No.

1448
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:13,840
There are some...

1449
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:19,520
The kings and the queens of true slackdomness shall ne'er die.

1450
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:21,400
Now, Jimi Hendrix really did die.

1451
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:25,620
But he was reincarnated as an entire tribe of exists.

1452
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,820
And so we know everything's gonna be okay.

1453
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,180
Come on, you're putting us on.

1454
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:32,040
No, that's in Book of the Subgenius, man.

1455
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,660
Haven't you been re-knowing that?

1456
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:35,640
It wasn't in there when I read it.

1457
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:36,000
Right.

1458
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:36,560
It may not have been.

1459
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,280
I'm sure the next time I get by, it'll be back in there.

1460
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:38,660
Yeah.

1461
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:39,480
That's funny.

1462
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:42,360
Have you all ever noticed how your Book of the Subgenius will...

1463
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:43,060
Absolutely.

1464
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:43,640
Yes.

1465
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:44,800
I've noticed that.

1466
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:47,160
It kind of ticks me off, though, because I...

1467
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:51,240
You know, I've read the thing about 14, 15 times, and I still don't know a damn thing.

1468
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:52,840
Mine moves all the time.

1469
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,340
I leave it in my chamber of excremeditation.

1470
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:56,280
I go to find it.

1471
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:56,900
I leave it, and it's not there.

1472
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:57,360
It's gone.

1473
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,440
And the bob's heads are on different pages each time you look.

1474
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:01,260
It's, you know, there...

1475
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:02,160
Upside-down print.

1476
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,680
You know there was one in the corner here, but it's another corner now.

1477
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:05,420
Different languages.

1478
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:07,680
All kinds of things twisted and turned.

1479
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:12,200
And, you know, sometimes I'll find it laying right next to my frap table,

1480
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:18,520
and my frappy will be consumed more so than I thought it had been before.

1481
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:22,080
And then I'll pick up the book, and I'll start reading it,

1482
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:26,260
and the words seem to speak more clearly.

1483
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:34,460
They seem to penetrate between my nostrils into that third nostril,

1484
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:40,960
and I get that psychic stench, that stench where somebody's been smoking.

1485
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:41,720
Oh, with that stench.

1486
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:43,020
Woo!

1487
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:47,500
But it sure hasn't been me, but my book's looking on that table,

1488
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:51,720
looking up at me, and that man's sitting there smiling with that pop in his face,

1489
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:53,120
and he's going, oh, yeah.

1490
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:53,720
Woo!

1491
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,840
And he's got bloodshot eyes.

1492
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:56,640
Tell it.

1493
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,660
Bloodshot eyes.

1494
01:02:57,820 --> 01:02:58,320
Tell it.

1495
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:58,840
Tell it.

1496
01:02:58,920 --> 01:02:59,080
Woo!

1497
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:00,020
Testify.
