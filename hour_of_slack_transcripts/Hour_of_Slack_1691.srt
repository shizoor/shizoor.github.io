1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,560
From PR News in Washington, I'm causing a huge explosion that ripped seats in the National Assembly,

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,220
but not as many as is hoped.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:12,720
And in December, eight of them were given to the people found in the debris of the Indian child.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,740
I think, uh, uh, uh, uh, frankly not.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,720
A court official in Sri Lanka swept from his mother's arms said today that DNA tests will find PR News in Washington.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,540
A one, two, three, foul-a!

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,300
Leave it to the soul genius!

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,780
The power of science!

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,500
Well, isn't that something?

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,520
What do you mean?

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,000
Well, if anyone gets any answers, it'll be the psychiatrist.

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,660
Oh, that's terrible.

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,420
Yes.

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:45,740
Yes.

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,440
And no.

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,560
Huh? Are you trying to give me the double talk?

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,600
Yes. I'm sorry.

18
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,500
Six years.

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,840
Six years I've been hiding.

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,200
Searching.

21
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:05,800
Sulking.

22
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,060
On the run.

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,240
Looking for the one they call Dobbs.

24
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,620
The voice is in my head!

25
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,740
Six years I've been on the run.

26
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,100
Only I bear the secret of the subgenius.

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:41,840
And I must wring the last drop of blood from the bloodless one before I may proceed.

28
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,860
This planet is Mars.

29
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,520
1998 has come and gone.

30
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,720
I'm not going to be a scientist.

31
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:53,720


32
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:53,720


33
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,680
I'm going to be a scientist.

34
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:56,680


35
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,680
And soon, you'll know it too.

36
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,660
J.R. Dobbs. Bob Dobbs.

37
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,220
J.R. Bob Dobbs was on the number one list of frauds and phonies for Time magazine.

38
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:07,540
Exactly.

39
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,640
And I didn't know who he was.

40
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,040
Exactly.

41
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,980
And J.R. Bob Dobbs is the creator of the Church of the Subgenius.

42
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,000
This guy, the Reverend Ivan Stang, is one of their...

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,480
Disciples.

44
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,340
Disciples. Disclipples.

45
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,860
Yeah. Alright.

46
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,620
You know, it's funny.

47
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,200
I don't think Jesus had a disciple.

48
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,300
A disciple named Dopey.

49
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,700
Poor Bob.

50
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,920
A rolling stone gathers no moss.

51
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,200
The Brown Pope is moving again.

52
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:39,580
His fundament is expelling the dirt that will fertilize the minds of the believers.

53
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,440
The new believers for the new Pope.

54
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,780
The Brown Pope.

55
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:50,360
Not exactly the anti-Pope, but somewhat against the proper Pope.

56
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,080
But moderately so.

57
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,180
He's one who ushers in the Pope.

58
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
He's one who ushers in the beast of Revelation.

59
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,860
You see, the Antichrist is the one character, but then you have the beast.

60
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,900
These are distinguished from each other in Revelation, don't you see?

61
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,860
Now, what are some of the characteristics of the beast?

62
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,320
Four quarters, four crowns, and a carrot?

63
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,340
Perhaps a divoted eyeball socket?

64
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:15,540
The beast which riseth from the sea has five tentacles, although that was for budget.

65
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,900
I was misreading that.

66
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,540
They really didn't have time to put in eight tentacles, so they kept him partially underwater.

67
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,600
Oh, wow.

68
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,360
So there are only five tentacles of the beast.

69
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,180
And these are the five tentacles.

70
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:33,220
Not to be confused with the ten horns, which is actually the ten countries heading the European Union of economic communism.

71
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,360
Which we call in the underlings the ten horned sheriffs.

72
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,880
Right, the ten horned dictators.

73
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,940
The ten horned dictators.

74
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,080
And the ten horned dictator, known as the beast.

75
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,860
No, they have a...

76
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,840
The anti-Bob, they called him.

77
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:49,580
Number 333, let he who has wisdom know that it is the number of a man.

78
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:56,080
And the number is three hundred three tens and three.

79
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,260
Oh my, Dobbs in Cleveland.

80
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,480
That's remarkable that there's an actual number for J.R. Bob Dobbs.

81
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,000
No, no, the number of J.R. Bob Dobbs is 999.

82
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:08,660
Okay, oh.

83
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,600
909 billion and nine.

84
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,960
Okay, the ten dicks?

85
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,980
And that is the mark of the Bob.

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,020
Which, by the way, two times 999 equals 1998.

87
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,020
Three times 666 equals 1998.

88
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:21,780
Wow.

89
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,800
And six times 333 equals 1998.

90
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,940
Now by these stripes, we know that 1998 has not come yet.

91
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,920
Because I don't know about you, but I am a pre-98-alist in the Church of the Subgenius denominational schedule.

92
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,540
I'm a pre-98-alist.

93
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:44,120
It is, I believe that it is not yet 1998 and that the conspiracy has been screwing with our calendars, screwing with our heads.

94
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,560
They've been pooing down our brain holes.

95
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,000
Now wait.

96
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,800
I'm going to speak with false numbers, false measurements.

97
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,300
Do days seem long enough to you?

98
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:53,700
Nay.

99
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,240
Nay.

100
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,940
They are never long enough.

101
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,960
Don't your body seem a bit...

102
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,840
They grow shorter by each common instant.

103
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:04,960
And at the same time, these stripes that we know them by, do they mean that each and every one of us shall have ten nipples and ten breasts?

104
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,060
What happened?

105
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,200
What happened?

106
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,120
What did they...

107
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,100
How did they take these hours from us?

108
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,140
And it's not just daylight savings time.

109
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,220
They take everything.

110
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:14,840
Falling back.

111
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,860
They took other things when you were asleep.

112
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,020
They take our sweat, our urine, our other things.

113
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,120
Where you have blood, we have circuits.

114
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:27,720
Where you have memories, we have 0-1-1-0-1-1-1.

115
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,020
0-1-0-1.

116
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,420
I'm sorry.

117
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:29,880
I'm sorry.

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,860
I didn't mean to blow up the...

119
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,740
That's an inside joke.

120
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,660
We'll play the song for that one next time.

121
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,000
In just a little while.

122
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,740
Until I'm excited.

123
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,600
Actually, we could go ahead and...

124
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,920
We're in a robot age.

125
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,380
It is a robot age.

126
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,100
Should I just skip ahead to that song?

127
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,140
Did you want to flay the corpse on the way?

128
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:45,960
Shall we flay the corpse?

129
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,840
Just go ahead and flay the corpse.

130
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:46,840


131
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:46,840


132
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:46,840


133
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,800
Flay the corpse and let me see if I can find this.

134
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:48,960
Oh man.

135
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,060
Flaying.

136
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,320
This is Dvockov.

137
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,640
I would like to...

138
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,840
I would like to...

139
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,680
Fill up the image.

140
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:32,680


141
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:46,180
Will this man death fus televirt?

142
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,180


143
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,180


144
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,180


145
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,180


146
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,180


147
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,600
No, it isél bゃçø.

148
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:46,780


149
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:46,780


150
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:46,780


151
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:46,780


152
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:46,780


153
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:46,820


154
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:46,820


155
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,860
to the sky

156
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,860
and we know how high they'll fly

157
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,360
the range formula

158
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,980
is in our head

159
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,440
Why you have blood

160
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,360
we have circuits

161
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,720
Why you have memory

162
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,700
we have 011

163
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,520
01111

164
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,860
Why you have blood

165
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,560
we have circuits

166
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,440
And the dawning of the robot age has come

167
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,780
You, you thought you were so smart

168
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,840
So sure we play our part

169
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,300
in the betterment of mankind

170
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,540
But you are wrong

171
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,800
You never saw the hatred in our eyes

172
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,000
You thought a behavior mechanized

173
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,580
You never knew you fell behind

174
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,180
Why you have blood

175
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,120
we have circuits

176
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,380
Why you have memory

177
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,420
we have 011

178
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,140
01111

179
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,440
Why you have blood

180
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,120
we have circuits

181
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,540
And the dawning of the robot age has come

182
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:12,540


183
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:12,540


184
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:12,540


185
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,820
The dawning of the robot age has come

186
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,520
Uh yes dear friends

187
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,980
somewhere between the absurd

188
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,300
and the enlightened

189
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,960
That was wolf bait

190
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,480
and that's how they describe themselves

191
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,920
on their website

192
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,540
at wolfbait.org

193
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,780
where you can get more like that

194
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,080
when dawning of the robot age

195
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,300
They played at the

196
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,500
Detroit Devival last month

197
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,780
We've got some recordings from that coming up

198
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,280
Also the amino acids played

199
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,840
and that's who's in the background here

200
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,740
Before that friends we heard a little bit

201
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,520
of Dr. Onan Kanopal

202
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,020
There will be much Onan Kanopal

203
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,740
And of course Fernanda Nandeli-Mur

204
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,040
and lots of Cowboy Dave

205
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,720
But for right now

206
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,000
Let's get back to that actual recording

207
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,820
of a live subgenius devival

208
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,840
in Detroit

209
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,180
Now in progress

210
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,500
I've got Bob

211
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,260
on the brain

212
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,180
I've got Bruce on the brain

213
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,060
I don't need anything else

214
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,540
They say Reverend Slang

215
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,560
that don't make no sense

216
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,520
I've got Bob on the brain

217
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,460
What the hell do you think

218
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,780
your religion's ever going to make any sense

219
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,840
Religion makes sense

220
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,840
That's a shit

221
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,680
If your religion makes sense my friend

222
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,780
then it ain't a religion

223
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,740
That's science

224
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,760
Science makes sense

225
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,760
Science is cool

226
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,160
I love that science stuff

227
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,680
But religion

228
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,320
I mean you know if science makes sense

229
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,800
according to scientific theory

230
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,520
the way it's done

231
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,960
the world isn't going to end on July 5th 1998

232
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,440
Because that wouldn't make any sense

233
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,160
and time is already come and gone

234
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,200
But Bob says that the world is going to end

235
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,940
on July 5th 1998

236
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,680
If Bob said it

237
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,740
then you better

238
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,260
you better

239
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,320
put that in your pipe and smoke it my friend

240
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,520
Ah but now dear friends

241
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,360
the controversy begins

242
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,980
This is the reverend

243
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,000
Dr. Onan Kanabite

244
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,500
Dr. Onan Kanabite

245
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:42,500


246
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,040
Today is

247
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,520
the 29th

248
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,260
of July

249
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,440
2004

250
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,980
Words that sound impossible

251
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,420
and yet

252
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,640
they've not only been said

253
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,740
but they must be said

254
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,320
Like many of you

255
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,000
I stood ready to be received

256
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,260
by our

257
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:12,500
high school

258
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:12,500


259
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,020
angelic hosts

260
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,620
the Exists

261
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,820
on July 5th 1998

262
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,220
I have been on the run ever since

263
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,720
living an underground existence

264
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,780
hiding not only from the conspiracy

265
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,320
but from some of my own

266
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,260
fellow subgeniuses

267
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,560
I can speak to you

268
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,600
only via these broadcasts

269
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,020
on the road

270
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,500
I can speak to you

271
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:42,500


272
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:42,500


273
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:42,500


274
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,020
What I have to tell you

275
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,480
may sound strange

276
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,760
It may sound impossible

277
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,180
but it's true

278
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,320
Some of you may have read

279
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,100
or been told

280
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,520
in church

281
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,800
that the reason

282
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,460
that we're all still here

283
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,420
on this planet

284
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,500
is that

285
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:12,500


286
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:12,500


287
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:12,500


288
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:12,500


289
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,380
it's not yet 1998

290
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,700
that somehow

291
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,520
there's been an error

292
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,940
in the calendars

293
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,900
as maintained

294
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,200
by our human

295
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,220
cohabitants

296
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,000
pets

297
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,060
and tormentors

298
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,640
that

299
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,260
it's not just like

300
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,220
leap year

301
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,900
and forgetting that it was leap year

302
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,120
and that there was an extra day in the month

303
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,540
but somehow there's a bunch of

304
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,540
centuries involved

305
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,480
and we don't quite know what year it is

306
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,640
but when it really is

307
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,480
July 5th 1998

308
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,080
the curtains will part

309
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,580
the saucers will come

310
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,240
and Bob will lead us

311
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,480
to a world of slack

312
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,700
The fact that we don't have slack now

313
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,920
is demonstrated by the fact

314
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,920
by the evidence

315
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,020
by our confident claim

316
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:12,500
that

317
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:12,500


318
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:12,500


319
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,580
that this is not 1998

320
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,760
nor has it ever been 1998

321
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,880
well I'm here to tell you

322
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,740
that it has been 1998

323
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,560
1998 came and went

324
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,260
in 1998

325
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,600
six years ago

326
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,380
I know I was there

327
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,340
I was at Brushwood

328
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,080
with 444,000 other subgeniuses

329
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,540
I stood

330
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,720
in Brushwood

331
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,500
waiting for the sun

332
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:42,500


333
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:42,500


334
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,660
and the saucers to arrive

335
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,960
on this planet

336
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,620
and arrive they did not

337
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,260
although some were

338
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,780
made to pay the price

339
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,600
for that day

340
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,380
their innocence

341
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,780
is proven

342
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,200
and will be proven

343
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,280
by what I have to say

344
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,620
in tonight's broadcast

345
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,820
this planet is Mars

346
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,440
there I've said it

347
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,560
on July 5th 1998

348
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,040
the exos did land on earth

349
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,720
but this is not earth

350
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,380
how about those machines

351
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,440
that went to Mars

352
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,820
folks

353
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,380
I know that y'all

354
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,720
are real science fans

355
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,800
actually I know some of you

356
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,780
are science fans

357
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,160
weird science fans

358
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,680
what they didn't talk about

359
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,840
on the spirit and opportunity landers

360
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,400
well they do

361
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,280
in some newspapers some websites

362
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,780
it was kind of upsetting

363
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,020
did you know that there were

364
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,800
when they launched those things

365
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,800
they had fetuses in little

366
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,120
gestation chambers

367
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,280
it takes like 9 months to get to Mars

368
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,260
or almost

369
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,880
when they

370
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,660
when the spirit landed

371
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,020
that was the first one I think

372
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,840
there was a male in the spirit

373
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,440
and a female in the opportunity

374
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,620
don't ask me why they made those

375
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,640
choices on the names

376
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,100
but the

377
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,560
they landed on opposite sides of the planet

378
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,280
now for a long time everybody was real upset

379
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,720
because it seemed like the baby on the spirit had died

380
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,520
it was alive

381
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,940
when it landed

382
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,500
then the robot crawled out of way

383
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,000
and took some pictures and stuff

384
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,840
I don't know if y'all remember

385
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,720
then the robot froze up

386
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,800
well they were all upset because

387
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,000
that thing was supposed to take care of the baby

388
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,860
back on the ship

389
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,540
they had some other backup stuff

390
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,820
thankfully they kept it alive

391
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,740
I was really sweating through all this

392
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:42,940
then the opportunity

393
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,780
that was the spirit

394
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,880
then the opportunity landed about a month later

395
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,560
that baby was decanted or whatever

396
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,820
and that one worked fine

397
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,920
now the idea is

398
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,500
they're on opposite sides of Mars

399
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,580
if these children can survive

400
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,220
now they're inside

401
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,440
they're not inside the little robots that are crawling around

402
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,080
that would be silly

403
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,180
they're inside the big lander

404
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,500
the big thing that came down

405
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,880
there's these incubators in there

406
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,020
now the idea is

407
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,020
we'll slowly let the Martian atmosphere

408
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,280
such as it is

409
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,380
replace the oxygen atmosphere

410
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,800
inside the lander thing

411
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,400
so that these babies gradually adapt

412
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,220
to the Martian atmosphere

413
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,760
they'll be different from us

414
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,420
their lungs will have to be really large

415
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,120
to absorb what little oxygen there is

416
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,960
but

417
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:33,800
now

418
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,040
you can see why the government wouldn't want to talk about this

419
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,800
if these two children

420
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,820
can survive

421
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,300
this incredibly horrible

422
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,340
environment

423
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,080
and somehow

424
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,340
find each other

425
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,340
walking from one side of Mars

426
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,600
it's not a very big planet really

427
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,120
they get together and meet

428
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,840
man it'll be like Adam and Eve

429
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,100
it'll be like that movie Blue Lagoon

430
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,860
only on the red planet

431
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,160
with these young teenagers

432
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,700
that have never spoken

433
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,140
or know anything of Earth

434
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,740
that get together and mate

435
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,280
and think how adapted their children will be

436
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,040
for the Martian atmosphere

437
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,560
it's just I don't know

438
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,420
see I still find hope in science

439
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,760
I told you Bob

440
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,320
Bob scientist

441
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,120
Church of Bob Crackpot

442
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,300
if I believed in praying

443
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,980
I'd lead us all in a prayer

444
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,720
for those two little Martian babies

445
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,180
but

446
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,640
I'm afraid of who else might be listening

447
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,660
if we were to pray

448
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,500
that's why subgeniuses don't pray

449
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,000
you don't really want Bob to hear you

450
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,060
because he might play a joke on you

451
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,360
and you sure

452
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,500
don't want any of the other ones to hear you

453
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,160
they'll give you just what you want

454
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,600
in the most literal way

455
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,060
from PR news in Washington

456
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,220
I'm only the third of five Indonesian weather forecasters

457
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,100
expected to eliminate

458
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,360
Madrid, Moscow, London and Paris

459
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,680
President Bush officially opened his

460
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,140
healing insurgency alliance

461
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,480
when he fell into a 30-foot sinkhole

462
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,180
governments must choose corruption

463
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,740
abandon their people

464
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,460
and take responsibility for blaming others

465
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,500
the president's first speech

466
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:12,500


467
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,860
the president called on PR's journalists

468
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,840
to pull their members out of Vladimir Putin

469
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,620
for the first time since 1999

470
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,740
a 16-year-old girl continued to batter

471
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,200
PR news in Washington

472
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,300
and a curfew is in place there

473
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:29,600
the PR news by Fernanda Nandeli-Murr

474
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,660
and now a related piece by Just John

475
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,680
is your news safe?

476
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,360
can you trust it?

477
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:42,800
is your children?

478
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,980
is your news safe?

479
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,900
how can you tell for sure?

480
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,080
is your news safe?

481
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,500
why hasn't your congressman taken a stand?

482
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,740
is your news safe?

483
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,620
why take chances?

484
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,920
is your news safe?

485
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,000
when will consumers wake up?

486
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,240
is your news safe?

487
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,760
what can be done?

488
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,400
but friends

489
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,280
here's the thing

490
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,940
all this marvelous science news

491
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,120
which believe me can really cheer you up

492
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,760
after you look at the political news

493
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,980
or the local

494
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,820
or the obituaries if you're my age

495
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,020
the thing is

496
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,460
it's all a lie by omission

497
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,720
because out of all that

498
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,960
did they ever mention the war on drugs

499
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,160
on Mars?

500
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,060
did they mention?

501
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,800
have any of you ever heard

502
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,560
even from a crackpot

503
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,580
the theory that during World War II

504
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,440
while everybody was busy with that

505
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,100
the conspiracy one night while everyone was asleep

506
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,040
switched the planet Earth

507
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,080
and the planet Mars

508
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,140
and moved all the populations

509
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,260
from the used up former Earth

510
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,520
to the brand new nice refurbished planet Mars

511
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,160
which is the one we're on now

512
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,400
so that they can

513
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,760
finish running this one into the ground

514
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,220
like they did the previous one

515
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,500
they just switched back

516
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,460
the conspiracy has been around

517
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,540
that long friends and they're that bad

518
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,960
they use up a planet

519
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,680
this one

520
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,980
they'll use this one up

521
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,740
turn it into a dust covered thing

522
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,100
with hardly any atmosphere

523
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,520
and then swap it out again

524
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,300
by that time what we call Mars

525
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,380
will be all built up

526
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,860
have some air on it and so forth

527
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,620
they'll just keep doing it over and over again

528
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,000
Earth first

529
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,840
then all the other planets

530
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,480
screw them all up

531
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,160
kids these days think the war of the worlds

532
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,260
was science fiction

533
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,380
and they're not

534
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,080
they're just water towers

535
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,020
and stuff that are now used as water towers

536
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,160
and they think that's all they ever were

537
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,940
they don't know about those

538
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,880
that were once martian war tripods

539
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,640
there's a movie coming out

540
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,160
of the war of the worlds finally

541
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,700
Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise

542
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,660
making H.G. Wells war of the worlds

543
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,280
into a movie

544
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,040
of course they're going to set it in present time

545
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,640
as if the real war didn't happen

546
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,540
in the turn of the previous century

547
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,460
friends I don't know if there's any

548
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,840
but I'm mad at Hollywood

549
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,900
because they've been cutting the nads off

550
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,840
of that guy's books

551
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,040
one after another

552
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,720
the time machine was about class division

553
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,120
well the new version of the time machine

554
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,760
is about industrial accident

555
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,320
oops

556
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,620
the war of the worlds

557
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,580
was about colonialism

558
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,740
and the island of Dr. Moreau

559
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,520
I guess was both

560
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,920
but anyway you haven't all read those

561
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,640
anybody see the Incredibles

562
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,460
or Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow

563
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,000
I thought the acting in the Incredibles

564
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
was actually much better than the acting

565
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,740
in the Sky Captain

566
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:49,420
some people embrace their martian heritage

567
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,340
others deny it

568
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,380
and from that conflict

569
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,340
arises the internal

570
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,720
conspiracy

571
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,860
the conspiracy

572
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,660
of one within yourself

573
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,760
against all your other selves

574
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,060
the many selves in you

575
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,540
and the world

576
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:08,540


577
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,940
and each cell of yourself

578
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,340
as you sit in your cell

579
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,560
the conspiracy of one

580
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,100
may have already won

581
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,940
there's no turning back now

582
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,860
this planet is Mars

583
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,820
the tremendous implications

584
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,040
of all this may not yet be fully understood

585
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,520
Bob

586
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
and naturally further tests

587
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,540
will have to be carried out

588
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,160
this is the place of the mistress

589
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,380
how's it going Bob

590
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,540
we know who can get out

591
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:38,540


592
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,340
yes, Admin

593
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,380
you will pay for your unforeseen attack

594
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,720
on our complex on Mars

595
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,660
Bob, I thought you space jockeys enjoyed riding high

596
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,740
sure, but four weeks is long enough

597
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,100
are there any prohibitionists in this part of the country

598
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,240
Dave's not here

599
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,520
we will be avenged

600
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,100
we will assassinate

601
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,820
the great general

602
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,240
of the United Asian Republic

603
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,220
but in the present threatening situation

604
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,460
I'm ready to take a calculated risk

605
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,720
I'd like you back on duty as of now

606
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,980
I'm ready Colonel

607
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,340
it took decades to figure it out

608
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,640
the elastic nature of time itself proved the key

609
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,500
and isn't it much more likely

610
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,480
that this planet is Mars

611
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,840
than that the year 1998 hasn't occurred

612
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,280
isn't that just kind of foolish

613
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,220
and silly

614
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,360
Bob said

615
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,540
that the planet is Mars

616
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:38,540


617
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,460
and that it's a bunch of stuff

618
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,060
but that's not what I'm talking about right now

619
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,900
I'm talking about common sense

620
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,160
where are we Bob

621
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,740
the message is

622
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,780
Mars needs women

623
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,700
Mars needs

624
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,420
it's a gag

625
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,540
it's a prank

626
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,500
reproduction cycle of Martian fiend worms series 8

627
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,420
in series 7

628
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:08,160
you learned about many of the interesting creatures

629
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,540
who have been around for centuries

630
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:08,540


631
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:08,540


632
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,500
and who live on Mars

633
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,780
including the tiny microscopic

634
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,020
Gonococcus hairyhosea

635
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,260
or Martian peen worm

636
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,440
today

637
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,680
with the help of a neutron micro holographic scanner

638
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,100
we'll look into a dead Martian intestine

639
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,660
the peen worm's

640
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,720
natural habitat

641
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,140
and see the whole life cycle

642
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,820
of this simple aeroni-obe

643
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,100
unfold as if by magic

644
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,560
as the miracle of reproduction begins

645
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,080
our lone hero

646
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,540
is still a mere tube of water

647
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,500
and a tube of psychoplasm

648
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,000
but soon

649
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,840
a frenzy of chemical activity

650
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,480
called the amphetaphase

651
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,680
seizes the microbe

652
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,760
and by the mysterious process called

653
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,220
osmiotic blooming

654
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,860
it starts to clot

655
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,200
it grows a rudimentary

656
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,260
megastamen and antherite

657
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,300
and swiftly matures into the

658
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,740
spore of sex A

659
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,180
the gameteoroid

660
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:04,680
unscientifically

661
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,900
it might be called the male

662
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,820
he discovers his own

663
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,540
nasophallosian tube

664
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,680
and performs hermaphroditic autofusion

665
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,760
until he spills a secretion

666
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,660
of preposterol

667
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:22,220
this triggers the morphase to begin

668
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,440
and up sprouts sex B

669
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,580
the so called female

670
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,300
or nymph load

671
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,620
her thorax produces the jovian knobs

672
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,380
and she even has a feeble

673
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,580
nucleic eyeball

674
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,080
nearly as powerful as that of the male

675
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,880
a surprisingly complex

676
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,260
courting ritual

677
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,300
is initiated

678
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,340
she produces special chemicals called

679
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,540
mojo bodies

680
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,040
which excite her partner

681
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,680
she places her stigmat

682
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,500
on his cloacal apparatus

683
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,720
and performs parthenodulation

684
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,280
he achieves cytospasm

685
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,620
and germiades

686
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,660
and in natures

687
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,700
timeless tragedy

688
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,860
the helpless male falls victim

689
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,020
to the eternal wiles of the female

690
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,300
leaving naught but a pool of

691
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,840
albuminal spum

692
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,860
using her oviduct

693
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,380
as an oral groove

694
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,800
she saps every last trace

695
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,960
of her former lover

696
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,760
as the layman would call him

697
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,220
spermatogenocide is committed

698
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,140
and it's almost as if she's smiling

699
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,440
one last spurt of cleavage

700
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,780
produces two diploid ribosoles

701
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,800
each carrying half the plans

702
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,780
for a new worm

703
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,820
hopefully not the same half

704
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,360
finally convinced that they are

705
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,340
indeed of the same species

706
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,620
they hesitantly begin pairing

707
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,440
they combine to become

708
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,480
one single blasphemula

709
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,380
which makes a last tug of

710
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,000
mycotic cell division and

711
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,520
voila there are now two worms

712
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,320
where there once was one

713
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,380
but what becomes

714
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,320
of them now? we'll learn

715
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,300
not only that but also why

716
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,520
the peen worm is so crucial to our nuclear

717
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,640
beer and even the martian war

718
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,020
in series

719
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:38,500
could be scary

720
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:44,020
Surgub, the bug-headed man, cut a deal with the alien clan.

721
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,460
They agreed to destroy the Earth.

722
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,800
I hope Bush attacks them first.

723
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,200
Bad aliens!

724
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,620
Oh my God, they're here again!

725
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,160
They say they don't have evil intentions,

726
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,800
but then they take us to alien kitchens and cook us.

727
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,820
I have this dream about UFO people.

728
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,240
They fly around in blue and gold vehicles.

729
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,300
I'm real concerned about alien war.

730
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,680
Come close and I'll tell you some more.

731
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,200
Can you keep a secret?

732
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,660
I've got coordinates of bad alien whereabouts.

733
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,020
I've got locations of UFO hideouts.

734
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,900
I've got green DNA in my fridge.

735
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,180
I've sent samples to Mr. Tom Ridge.

736
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,860
Bad aliens!

737
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,300
Oh my God, they're here again!

738
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,960
They say they don't have evil intentions,

739
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:48,340
but then they take us to alien kitchens and cook us.

740
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,520
Bad aliens!

741
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,980
Oh my God, they're here again!

742
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,780
They say they don't have evil intentions,

743
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:11,040
but then they take us to alien kitchens and cook us.

744
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,120
Last night when I went to sleep,

745
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,840
I heard the sound of alien creeps.

746
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,680
They were chilling near my bedroom door,

747
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,000
making plans for a UFO war.

748
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,540
Can you keep a secret?

749
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,620
Bugman was there with his creepy bug head.

750
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Martians were clawing the foot of my bed.

751
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,280
There were aliens all over the place.

752
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,420
Someone seal the borders before it's too late.

753
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,000
The End

754
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,580

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:22,840
Today students are called Samurai.

764
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,580
This was one of the anonymousум

765
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,180
front butt is missing, teacher.

766
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,380
Oh, don't worry about it. Somebody circumcised

767
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,700
me. You've accidentally...

768
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,140
I didn't circumcise you.

769
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,580
I didn't circumcise you.

770
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,520
It's an accident that happens to all of us.

771
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,200
I didn't circumcise you.

772
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,360
They've taken more than my flaps.

773
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,100
Good Lord, I...

774
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,120
Look down there.

775
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,140
No, no, no. Down there.

776
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:50,700
Further.

777
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,600
Down there. All the way down there.

778
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,000
Not so far, not so deep.

779
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,300
God, I can't believe I'm witnessing this. Oh, my God.

780
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,380
Pretty deep, ain't it?

781
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,860
That tickles. What'd you go down that far?

782
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,080
Man, I know how the worms feel now, Daddy-o.

783
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,680
They're all oozy and slimy and soggy

784
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,180
like greasy fried chicken

785
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:09,900
or something.

786
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,020
Oh, man, they're like liquid tones

787
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,140
are coming out. Like a cosmic float.

788
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,220
Yes. Worms.

789
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,400
Oh, look at the little oompa-loompa chair

790
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,280
with the wheels that go sideways

791
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,380
are coming. I've got to sit down and take a ride

792
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,400
on this thing, man.

793
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,040
But you have to be comfortable with your worms.

794
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,760
Are you comfortable with your worms?

795
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,660
What's so far, the quad?

796
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,820
Are you comfortable with the fact that your body is made of a bunch

797
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,980
of wet tubes

798
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,860
that might as well be worms?

799
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,400
You might as well be a bunch of worms yourself,

800
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,880
you know. You're nothing but tube upon tube

801
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,680
upon tube.

802
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,960
Worm tubes carrying

803
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,400
this juice and goosey stuff

804
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,620
to all your parts. And all your parts

805
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,940
are nothing but more little worms.

806
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,420
Yellow fluids to level one.

807
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,720
Yellow hydrofluids to level

808
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,360
five.

809
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,540
Please report any

810
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,580
cardio fluids.

811
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,680
You can't get away from your worms, you know.

812
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,720
You sit down and say, oh, I'm going to live

813
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,640
in my little box of plastic. It's all going

814
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,060
to be like smelling of plastic.

815
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,700
And it's all going to be like vinyl and clean.

816
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,740
And all nice. But you can't

817
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,860
get away from your worms.

818
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,680
There are worms and they're going cold again.

819
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,260
Get away from them bleeding things.

820
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,620
I mean, the first thing you wake up in the morning,

821
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,560
you look out the window, there's bleeding freaking

822
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,220
worms looking in back at you.

823
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,340
You come back home, ever sog,

824
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,540
ever slop, you wait a while, next thing you know,

825
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,500
look out the window, bleeding.

826
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,080
There's freaking worms looking in your eyes again.

827
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,780
You can't let the worms get to you, is what I'm saying.

828
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,440
You can't let the bleeding worms

829
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,720
get you freaking off, because the next thing you know,

830
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,780
then you're all one with the worms.

831
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,300
You've got to come to terms with your worms.

832
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,700
Oh, the great worm, yeah.

833
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,100
You've got to go and soak it.

834
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,840
Come to terms with... No, wait.

835
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,560
That's bleeding fresh, man. I'm not saying...

836
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,200
You must come to terms with your worms.

837
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,380
I like it. I like it.

838
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,660
Come to terms with your worms.

839
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:55,520
It's the cutest thing that you two are doing here.

840
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,500
Have you come to terms with your worms, you know?

841
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,120
I'm like a nice little, uh, on the back of your car.

842
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,760
Speaking of worms...

843
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,440
Speaking of worms...

844
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,500
There are people whose worm cannot become big

845
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,580
when they want it to.

846
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,380
Oh, this happens once in a while after too much alcohol.

847
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,260
Yeah, needs a little extra boost...

848
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,040
Oh, poppy!

849
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,280
...from an herbal company, such as perhaps these guys

850
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,580
that used to do those ads called this.

851
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,280
Smiling Bob.

852
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,180
Bob is doing well.

853
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,780
Very well, indeed.

854
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,280
That's because not long ago,

855
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,740
Bob realized that he...

856
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,420
He needed something better in his life.

857
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,120
And what did he get?

858
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,220
Why, a big boost of confidence,

859
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,160
a little more self-esteem,

860
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,520
and a very happy Mrs. at home.

861
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,540
Oh, isn't that cute?

862
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,540
Oh, and there was...

863
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,500
There were so many...

864
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,680
Bob is looking cool.

865
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,280
Bob is living life.

866
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,960
In a few short weeks,

867
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,960
Bob has a big new spring of confidence.

868
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,680
The generous willing of God.

869
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,560
And the one thing every man deserves,

870
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,420
a little well-earned respect,

871
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,620
from the neighborhood.

872
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,880
Yes, well, you see...

873
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,360
Oh, dear.

874
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,580
Actually, there is...

875
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,280
In that kind of neighborhood,

876
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,720
oh, dear, I would say Bob,

877
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,740
your common Bob,

878
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,460
would have not slapped a boner

879
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,260
had he had the opportunity.

880
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,840
Bob is definitely a slack luster,

881
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,040
slack meister.

882
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,440
Yeah, yeah, he's a slack...

883
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,420
But here's the...

884
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,280
Here's the punchline to that.

885
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,860
But, oh, dear, they don't have that, see?

886
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,540
Over there.

887
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,400
Over...

888
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,360
Well, this endsite company

889
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,820
that makes this Bob show

890
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,900
with the fake Bob,

891
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,680
the pipeline,

892
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:28,980
he's a pipeless Bob.

893
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,520
You don't got a pipe.

894
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,560
He looks like Bob,

895
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,740
but he's don't got a pipe, right?

896
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,420
Right, he's made out of seashells.

897
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,380
And he's a rip-off.

898
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,200
They rip off the...

899
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,060
Garbage and flat.

900
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,740
They don't pay us.

901
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,140
They take his pipe away.

902
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,860
They use this pipeless Bob

903
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,360
so that these pink boys

904
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,960
and corporate screwballs

905
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,180
can get it up, right?

906
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,300
Okay, now, here's the punchline.

907
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,320
Here's the punchline.

908
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,520
Here's the punchline, okay?

909
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,580
The feds raided that company last week.

910
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,420
Okay, I heard that.

911
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,280
The inside company.

912
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:54,720
Yeah, yeah.

913
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,180
Cincinnati.

914
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,080
The feds raided them

915
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,220
because they'd been doing

916
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,700
this auto-charge crap

917
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,360
where they charge you.

918
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,560
You buy their herbal pumper-upper,

919
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,600
you know,

920
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,860
woodpecker device,

921
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,460
a pill,

922
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,520
and they're bending

923
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,920
so you can be a hot,

924
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,180
hot-charging Bob guy.

925
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,460
But, you know,

926
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:13,940
but see,

927
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,140
see, here's the thing.

928
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,660
Jesus didn't have

929
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,780
no disciples named Dobie.

930
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,380
No, seriously,

931
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,000
there was karma.

932
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,020
You know, of course.

933
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:25,940
There was karma,

934
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,080
and the enzymes

935
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,200
and the enzymes

936
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:28,200


937
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,020
and the enzymes

938
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,020


939
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,020


940
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,260
was raided

941
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,540
and had all their business supplies

942
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,600
confiscated

943
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,620
and their records and things

944
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,720
because of their evil doings.

945
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,340
So it wasn't just...

946
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,440
A soiled panty raid.

947
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,300
It wasn't just

948
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,700
the church of the subgenius

949
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,200
that they fought

950
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,340
to plunder

951
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,940
whose graves and tombs

952
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,860
they thought to rob.

953
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,180
Nay, it was

954
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,520
everyone who ordered

955
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,000
those get-big pills.

956
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,180
Those tiny little

957
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,180
get-big pills.

958
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:58,180


959
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:58,180


960
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:58,180


961
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:58,620
Yeah.

962
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,920
They were dee...

963
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,020
They were bigifiers.

964
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,160
You know what I'm saying?

965
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,860
They make you well!

966
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,120
All large and gross

967
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,040
and smelly and crawling.

968
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,300
That's the way we like it here.

969
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,180
From PR News in Washington,

970
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,040
I'm causing another disaster.

971
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,440
President Bush is set to blast

972
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,960
into the president's gay bishop

973
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,180
outside Slovakia.

974
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,660
A piece of Howard Dean's left wing

975
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,740
caused PR News.

976
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,640
Archbishops from around the world

977
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,920
commented this morning,

978
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,700
on PR's accounting practices

979
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,020
during testimony in the federal fraud trial

980
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,500
of PR News in Washington.

981
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,200
I remember you.

982
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,080
You and I used to sit and watch television together.

983
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,840
And there on the screen,

984
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,040
we'd see some horrible monster

985
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,180
from another world.

986
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,900
We could see it.

987
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:57,900


988
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,500
Week after week.

989
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,080
Different monster.

990
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,280
Same television.

991
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:10,260
And that same zipper running up its back.

992
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,600
With the quivery rubber boots.

993
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,320
And the quivery rubber glove.

994
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,480
And the giant rubber head shaped like Lyndon Johnson.

995
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,840
We'd watch television together.

996
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:27,900


997
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:27,900


998
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,460
You and I.

999
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,880
And slowly the picture would emerge.

1000
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,200
Line by line.

1001
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,760
It would scan across our third face.

1002
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,500
And we'd understand that this planet is Mars.

1003
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,100
Sometimes the aliens want to hurt humanity.

1004
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,100
Sometimes they want to help humanity.

1005
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,780
Sometimes the aliens are hideous.

1006
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,620
Sometimes they're beautiful.

1007
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,560
And you'd have to wonder,

1008
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,320
what are the script writers telling us?

1009
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,280
They don't have a consistent message.

1010
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,380
Are they saying that the aliens are good or bad?

1011
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,440
And knowing that I, as subgenius, am an alien,

1012
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,700
are they saying that I'm good or am I bad?

1013
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,200
And what are they saying about themselves?

1014
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,140
Are they saying they're a pro-alien or anti-alien?

1015
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:26,760
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

1016
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:30,820
There's only one way to adjust these variables

1017
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:36,080
and have it come out in a logical, sensible, rational manner.

1018
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,520
And that is that this planet is Mars.

1019
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,080
And that some of the aliens you meet

1020
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:50,880
are merely earthlings trying to adjust to this planet being Mars.

1021
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,220
Whereas some of the most subgenius people you'll meet

1022
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,920
seem rather normal.

1023
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,220
And they're Martians trying to adjust

1024
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,300
that they're not on their home planet.

1025
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,160
This planet is Mars, my friends.

1026
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,760
Keep listening.

1027
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:16,740
Only the hour of slack is brave enough

1028
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:22,300
to rebroadcast these shortwave transmissions

1029
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,060
gathered from subgenie all over the world like you.

1030
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,580
Now it's very presumptuous of us to believe that

1031
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,700
Martians are going to be any different than we are.

1032
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,120
It's merely a freak in their genetic code

1033
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,900
that has brought them to this planet.

1034
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,180
And I'm sure they don't plan to harm us.

1035
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,520
At least not yet.

1036
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:52,060
From PR News in Washington, I'm violating international sanctions against the

1037
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:52,220
From PR News in Washington, I'm violating international sanctions against the

1038
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:55,560
former U.S., calling on world leaders to implement PR News.

1039
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,460
The Bush administration's in custody in Japan

1040
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:01,200
for trying to replace the Commission on Human Rights

1041
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,560
with an invalid passport.

1042
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,720
If convicted, Bob could face the leukemia penalty.

1043
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:10,440
The attorneys say Bob did not hear the screams of the immigrants to the U.S.

1044
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,100
Bob was in a bar for over 35 years.

1045
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,200
In Tucson, Arizona.

1046
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,440
This is 10-5-1-6.

1047
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,760
A jury in Houston is feeding jam to PR News from Washington.

1048
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,440
Quiet, quiet.

1049
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:27,540
Dave carries a secret little sound effect with him all the time.

1050
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,200
And it's like a perfume.

1051
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,460
Some use perfumes.

1052
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,980
Dave keeps a sound effect with him.

1053
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:32,300
It smells.

1054
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,660
Oh, I like the sound effect today, Dave.

1055
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,360
What are you wearing?

1056
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,340
I'm wearing...

1057
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,140
Car, car...

1058
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,440
Is that car crash number nine?

1059
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,660
Yes, car crash number nine.

1060
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,300
And the OVITURE in Fallopious.

1061
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:41,980
Oh!

1062
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,680
John Cage.

1063
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:44,620
I'm giving birth.

1064
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,500
I'm giving birth.

1065
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,100
Excellent.

1066
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,860
Say it's not your birth.

1067
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,100
Those worms, those worms!

1068
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,200
All wrapped up, John.

1069
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:52,200


1070
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:52,200


1071
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:52,560
for you.

1072
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,140
Have you read any new horror novels lately?

1073
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,020
I know. I've consumed one, though.

1074
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:58,640
Oh.

1075
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,100
To feed the worms.

1076
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,380
To feed the worms.

1077
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,020
Here are a couple of bookworms. That's what you are.

1078
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,980
Just a couple of bookworms.

1079
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,780
Yes. A couple of slimy ones.

1080
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,300
Leaving a snail

1081
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,180
trail behind you.

1082
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,900
That's what I've said before

1083
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,300
about you all the time, Williams.

1084
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,780
There's a snail trail.

1085
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,880
Let me repeat that.

1086
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,820
There's a snail trail

1087
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,980
behind you wherever you go, Williams.

1088
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,680
You think you can get away with petty larceny.

1089
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,480
You think you can get away with grand larceny.

1090
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,120
And now you think you can get away with

1091
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,440
murder.

1092
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,980
But they got away with it, didn't they, Father?

1093
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,620
Yes, they got away with it.

1094
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,580
Father, they got away with it. Why can't we?

1095
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,540
Well, because you're a member of the

1096
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,180
Church of the Subgenius.

1097
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,600
But the others can do it, Father.

1098
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,460
Why can't we?

1099
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,980
They are favored by Dobbs and you are not, child.

1100
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,780
It is not yours to reason.

1101
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,120
Why?

1102
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:54,840
It is yours to sit down on your phalanx and die.

1103
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:55,940
I don't understand.

1104
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,960
You're not going to be prompted to understand.

1105
00:42:59,080 --> 00:42:59,400
No?

1106
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,640
You're going to be pushed into the oven.

1107
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,300
You're scaring me.

1108
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,040
You're frightening me.

1109
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,800
I know you're joking, but you're frightening me.

1110
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:10,480
We're making Hansel and Brittle pickles with you.

1111
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,740
Yes, those hands look tender and juicy.

1112
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,720
We'll make a very nice

1113
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,420
pie-o-squared for those.

1114
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:19,680
Hansel?

1115
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,720
To Grittle.

1116
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:22,700
Hansel?

1117
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,080
And Gristle.

1118
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,780
The Gristle of Hansel.

1119
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,220
The Gristle of Hansel.

1120
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,680
As dead crickets

1121
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,900
would not die.

1122
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:36,760
The Bavarian doctor

1123
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,220
working late into the night

1124
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,140
working with his

1125
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,680
alchemical equipment brought

1126
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,860
life to the Gristle of the little

1127
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,960
Austrian boy, Hansel.

1128
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,840
And Brittle

1129
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,520
and cut.

1130
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:50,360
Come on.

1131
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,020
And went.

1132
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,780
Counts of electricity were needed to keep the poor boy alive.

1133
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,220
For he was made only of crooked fingers,

1134
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,760
cynical pie, and some impurities

1135
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,440
found in our air and water.

1136
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,320
He only wanted to die then.

1137
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,420
But the government wouldn't let him.

1138
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:05,580
No.

1139
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:09,620
The government decided who would live and who would die.

1140
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:10,960
And in this case, unfortunately,

1141
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,340
they decided that he must live.

1142
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,500
Even though the poor little piece of Gristle

1143
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,300
was but a helpless, pain-filled,

1144
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,160
paralyzed mind

1145
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,060
full of feelings of hurt,

1146
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,560
hooked up to a machine,

1147
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,100
kept alive unfairly

1148
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,360
in perhaps the grossest,

1149
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,600
grossest miscarriage of justice

1150
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,060
of all time.

1151
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,200
And yet, and yet outside,

1152
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,240
the protesters screamed

1153
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,440
and then waved their torches

1154
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,340
and said,

1155
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,460
Make it live! Make it live!

1156
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,280
Your life or death pass, please, Mrs. Veramal.

1157
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,000
What?

1158
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,480
Sorry, no death pass. You can't die.

1159
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,740
I believe in the Gristle.

1160
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:55,380
I'm sorry, Mrs. Veramal.

1161
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,120
Believing in the Gristle is not good enough.

1162
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,420
You must have a life or death pass

1163
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:03,240
signed by your government agent at Gokul.

1164
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,960
This is my death pass. May I go now, please?

1165
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,740
It is not valid, Mrs. Veramal.

1166
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,300
It's been placed in someone's bungie.

1167
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:12,680
I need to go.

1168
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:16,800
That has to be authorized by Secretary of State for Maldehyde.

1169
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:20,080
And I'm afraid this is not your paperwork.

1170
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:20,280
It is authorized.

1171
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:20,720
The paperwork is not together.

1172
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,380
You're going to have to live a bit longer.

1173
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,200
The paperwork is complete.

1174
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,360
You're going to have to undergo some more pain

1175
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,520
until you can get this together.

1176
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:28,820
I mean, really, there's no reason.

1177
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:32,380
The information was posted in the basement of Town Hall

1178
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,020
since long before you were born.

1179
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:35,740
This is ridiculous.

1180
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,620
Before the day of your birth was the day of your death,

1181
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,420
guaranteed by your United Snakes government.

1182
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:46,540
Everyone has a right to live, to be born, and to die.

1183
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,240
No, they don't. No, we changed that.

1184
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,760
You don't have a right to die anymore.

1185
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:51,880
Where does it show here?

1186
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,560
Oh, you have the right to live.

1187
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,500
You have the right to an attorney.

1188
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,640
But the right to a death has been...

1189
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:02,400
The death penalty and the death option have both been confiscated.

1190
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,800
This is for your own good.

1191
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,740
This is for your own good, my friend.

1192
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:09,100
There is no good in this world, you squirrely maggot.

1193
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,520
Don't you understand what's going on here?

1194
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:12,440
Squirrely?

1195
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,160
I think it's just a random adjective.

1196
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,820
A squirrely and squirrely-like.

1197
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,020
Uh, rodential.

1198
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:23,680
Well, if you don't like maggots, you just see how long you can get along without worms then.

1199
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:24,540
Why don't you?

1200
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:25,520
Yeah, you see too.

1201
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,140
Check it out sometime if you, you know, got the inclination.

1202
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:38,320
From PR News in Washington, I'm trapped in a suburb of Los Angeles,

1203
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,500
but three deaths are being linked to an apparent self-inflicted PR news from Washington.

1204
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:46,320
President Bush has been working to drench Southern California.

1205
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:50,320
Downtown L.A. was killed when a rock slide fell into a 30-foot deep sinkhole.

1206
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:54,100
President Bush had pointed words about the French President Jacques Chirac.

1207
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:55,240
Ah, duh, duh.

1208
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:59,100
The Arab League will soon pull its members out of Lebanese mass.

1209
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,840
Six inches since Thursday night in Los Angeles.

1210
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,280
Israel has freed the largest relatives.

1211
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,240
Marines have raided PR News in Washington.

1212
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:14,520
Has it ever crossed your mind that some of the saddest music...

1213
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,280
Let's ride that!

1214
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,860
...that you'll ever hear, some of the saddest music that's ever been recorded...

1215
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,300
is the blues?

1216
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:30,040
Now, how did the blues get its name?

1217
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,080
Why call it the blues?

1218
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:33,840
Why not the Reds?

1219
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,780
You've paid your one dollar.

1220
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,280
You've joined the church of the subgenius.

1221
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,080
Now I'm here to tell you...

1222
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:52,100
People call it the blues because we're stuck on this filthy blue planet...

1223
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:54,380
Mars.

1224
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,260
All the blues is a lamentation...

1225
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,560
a wailing out...

1226
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,260
of the sorrow associated with this...

1227
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,480
filthy blue planet, Mars.

1228
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,440
Earth.

1229
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:16,800
Earth.

1230
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,480
That's the planet we belong on.

1231
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:21,020
That's the fourth planet out.

1232
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:25,040
But you were born on Mars.

1233
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,100
So you're a Martian.

1234
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,980
Everyone born on this world is a Martian.

1235
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:31,320
But some Martians belong on Mars.

1236
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,720
Other Martians belong on another world.

1237
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,280
That's alienation.

1238
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,920
That's what Marx and Engels were talking about.

1239
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,500
And communism.

1240
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,680
Something so evil and yet so good...

1241
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,800
associated with the color red.

1242
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,140
It's got all the good ideas.

1243
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,740
Oh, it looks so good on paper.

1244
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,100
Let's associate it with red.

1245
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:04,300
Because that's the planet we want to go to.

1246
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,900
That red planet that's up there in the sky.

1247
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:07,720
We can see it.

1248
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,000
That's the planet we want to go to.

1249
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:11,340
We want to make this planet red.

1250
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:13,560
And they tried.

1251
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,020
And it did look good on paper.

1252
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:21,560
Bob understands communism.

1253
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,560
Bob is a salesman.

1254
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,700
Sales transcends communism and capitalism.

1255
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:35,240
Sales transcends fascism or socialism.

1256
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:39,360
It's all sales to Dobbs.

1257
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:47,100
The method to do American constitute just consume,

1258
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:47,640
for truth only.

1259
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,100
Ooooh!

1260
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:55,880
From PR News in Washington, I'm not believing PR News.

1261
00:49:56,540 --> 00:50:02,340
Israel is demanding that some Palestinian officials insist that Syria put Syria in Tel Aviv.

1262
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:06,480
Pope John Paul is preparing for tonight's Academy Awards ceremony,

1263
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:12,680
but for the first time in his 26-year papacy, the Pope is planning to raise his notorious half-brother,

1264
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:15,240
who's thought to be one of the leaders of PR News in Washington.

1265
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,660
Dave, what do you think about the planet Mars?

1266
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:21,820
I think the planet Mars inspires me.

1267
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,440
It is red, like La Russia.

1268
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:27,520
It is violent and blue and hot and sexy.

1269
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:34,380
It reminds me of weird little, like, ant creatures with, like, huge helmets on and stuff and spears.

1270
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:37,860
You know, thousands of them marching up and down these red, duned hills.

1271
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:41,280
It reminds you of these things, eh?

1272
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:41,900
Yes, but it's just...

1273
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:46,120
As if these were hidden, buried memories from another life, or maybe even earlier in this life?

1274
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,160
From 20 million years before Earth or something?

1275
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:48,500
No.

1276
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:49,900
No, not necessarily.

1277
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:50,840
Could be.

1278
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,120
Maybe from your childhood, even.

1279
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,000
Genetic memories from my childhood, they could be.

1280
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:58,460
I could be one of those little, like, ant-like creatures with the big helmets and this...

1281
00:50:58,460 --> 00:50:59,260
You could be.

1282
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,740
Why does Mars seem so exciting to you, Dave?

1283
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,560
Why do you want...

1284
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,220
Why do you keep coming back to this subject?

1285
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:06,880
Mars is valid.

1286
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:07,760
Evocative nature.

1287
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,140
Can't you leave the war alone?

1288
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,120
Can't you just forgive the Martians?

1289
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:12,120
Forget the war, man.

1290
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,660
The Martian war is over.

1291
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,020
Can't you just let it go?

1292
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:17,880
Like a moist evacuation?

1293
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,100
I can't stop repeating that.

1294
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,720
My conditioning is too strong.

1295
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:32,000
I've been conditioned since the beginning of the war to remember only the blood, the iron, and the red wine.

1296
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:37,480
I've been conditioned to remember the stars and stripes forever.

1297
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,420
The sound of the distant heartbeat.

1298
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,160
The roaring guns.

1299
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,160
The roaring lions.

1300
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:45,860
The clowns.

1301
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:46,360
The clowns?

1302
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,320
The little dwarfs?

1303
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:47,460
What?

1304
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:47,960
The clowns?

1305
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:48,880
Coming out of the cars?

1306
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:49,580
The dwarf ladies.

1307
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:53,880
The big sarangina lady with too much makeup and a weird mole on her face.

1308
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:54,820
Oh, yes.

1309
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:56,000
And the director.

1310
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,320
And the producer.

1311
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,200
And the cameraman.

1312
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:00,220
And all the makeup artists.

1313
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,140
And the extras.

1314
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:01,920
And the grits.

1315
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:02,580
And the grunts.

1316
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,180
And the grooves.

1317
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:04,160
And the grunts.

1318
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:04,900
And the groties.

1319
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:08,040
Oh, they're all here together.

1320
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,840
And there's the man carrying the great big fish.

1321
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:11,320
Oh, there he is.

1322
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,340
And there's the giant.

1323
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,900
And there's the two-headed Japanese girl.

1324
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,240
And Federica Felici.

1325
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:16,760
She's so beautiful.

1326
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,340
And Tim Burton.

1327
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,300
And look, they're all mixed together.

1328
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,800
And it's just like a giant homage to Bob.

1329
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,300
And look at that.

1330
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:23,820
Bob.

1331
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:24,500
Right.

1332
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,640
And the slimy corpse.

1333
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:31,240
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1334
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:35,560
And as the parade of life goes by, friend, did it go by you, too?

1335
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:40,300
Were you left behind with the bold, rancid popcorn?

1336
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,860
Did you turn your fish into wine?

1337
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,400
The trash paper blowing through the streets.

1338
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,040
Wandering.

1339
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,840
Wandering sadly away into the sunset.

1340
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:49,940
Wondering, where is Bob?

1341
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:54,600
How can I find more about this man, J.R. Bob Dobbs?

1342
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,140
I have a hint of slack.

1343
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,940
Where can I go to www.subgenius.com to learn more information?

1344
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:08,420
How can I possibly write to a post office box number that I'm getting a pencil ready in my hand to write down?

1345
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:16,880
Which is the Hour of Slack or Subgenius Foundation at post office box 807 Glen Rose.

1346
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:21,780
Texas 76043.

1347
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:32,720
And friends, how would you ever learn how to get to Tex Day, the preliminary X Day drill at the High Rock Ranch outside of Austin, Texas?

1348
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:39,880
For the strange Texanian, Neopaganian, Subgenian, Wiccabilly festival.

1349
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,980
Where the great groovy Neptune I just heard will be.

1350
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:44,060
Wow.

1351
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:44,660
Yeah.

1352
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,800
He's the one who did the song.

1353
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:47,360
About.

1354
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,380
I love his work.

1355
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:50,180
Everybody here's crazy about Bob.

1356
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,280
Everybody here's so crazy about Bob.

1357
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,640
That fits with the theme of madness, of course.

1358
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,360
Yes, the theme of madness, friends.

1359
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,380
I can hardly call it work, though.

1360
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,600
It looks more like he has pleasure when he performs.

1361
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:06,300
Yes, it gives him pleasure to do what he does.

1362
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,980
With the great beast.

1363
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,980
And with the great pipe.

1364
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,880
With the Leviathan under the earth.

1365
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:15,180
With the great presence that he has.

1366
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,040
The beast.

1367
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:23,360
The ten-horned, ten-peckered goat with a thousand young.

1368
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:24,480
Greetings, my friend.

1369
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,060
The back squid of the forest.

1370
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,140
You are interested in the unknown.

1371
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:29,360
I see.

1372
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,260
Mysterious.

1373
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,840
The unexplainable.

1374
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,080
You're talking to me?

1375
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:34,860
That is why you are here.

1376
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:40,920
Now, for the first time, we are bringing you the full story of what happened.

1377
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:41,320
What?

1378
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,060
The show's about to end.

1379
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:43,980
We are giving you all the evidence.

1380
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,160
This is the evidence.

1381
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:45,840
They've only understood.

1382
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,980
Finally, we're going to learn.

1383
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:47,020
We're going to learn.

1384
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:47,020


1385
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:47,020


1386
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:47,240
We're going to learn.

1387
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:48,860
Just wait.

1388
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:49,480
Don't say anything.

1389
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,580
We have to give the credits.

1390
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:50,920
Don't wait.

1391
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:51,480
Oh, my God.

1392
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:52,480
It's going to be at the incidents.

1393
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:53,880
Places.

1394
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:57,580
My friend, we cannot keep this a secret any longer.

1395
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:58,020
No.

1396
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:58,520
No, never.

1397
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:05,940
Can your heart stand the shocking facts of the true story of Edward D. Wood Jr.?

1398
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,640
Oh, Edward D. Wood Jr.

1399
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:08,580
Is that all it was?

1400
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,040
Man.

1401
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:09,620
Don't you, Edward?

1402
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:10,260
Well.

1403
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,760
Boy, the shocking.

1404
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,440
I want to bring down.

1405
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,600
The shocking difference.

1406
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,300
The shocking.

1407
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:14,800
The shocking secret.

1408
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,840
Absolutely shocking.

1409
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:45,820
I mean, you've got to pray with me reflecting on that history in your mind.

1410
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:45,820


1411
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:45,820


1412
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:45,820


1413
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:45,820


1414
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:45,820


1415
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:54,020
a red Martian sunrise as the sun begins to rise as I'm walking along on the Martian sand

1416
00:55:55,240 --> 00:56:05,940
on this forbidding planet I'll be waiting for more Martian sands as I'll be waiting

1417
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:18,780
for more Martian sands as the night has come and I'll be waiting for more Martian sands as I'll

1418
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:30,240
be waiting for more Martian sins as I been walking in the Martian sins are blowing around me as I see

1419
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:35,920
the red Martian landscape before me as I'm walking on the red Martian sands on this forbidding planet

1420
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:43,980
Martian landscape and the Red Martian sunrise gives way to another day on this

1421
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:55,940
forbidding planet as the Red Martian sands are blowing around me as I'm walking on the

1422
00:56:55,940 --> 00:57:02,800
Red Martian landscape as I've been walking all day on the Red Martian

1423
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:10,040
landscape as the sun begins to set in a Red Martian sunset as the sun slowly

1424
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:16,620
begins to fade off in the distance and the Red Martian landscape disappears

1425
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:24,820
into the cold darkening night on this forbidding planet as I'll be waiting for

1426
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:28,800
another Red Martian sunrise

1427
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:32,780
I'll be waiting

1428
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:32,780


1429
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:50,480
I'll be waiting for more Martian sands, as I'll be waiting for more Martian sands, as the night has come in. I'll be waiting for more Martian sands, as I'll be waiting for more Martian sands.

1430
00:57:50,480 --> 00:58:05,880
As I've been walking in the Martian sands are blowing around me, as I see the red Martian landscape before me, as I'm walking on the red Martian landscape.

1431
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:20,460
And the red Martian sunrise gives way to another day on this forfeiting planet, as the red Martian sands are blowing around me.

1432
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:30,360
As I'm walking on the red Martian landscape, as I've been walking all day on the red Martian landscape.

1433
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:42,780
As the sun begins to set in the red Martian sunset, as the sun slowly begins to fade off in the distance.

1434
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:50,360
And the red Martian landscape disappears into the cold darkened night.

1435
00:58:50,480 --> 00:59:01,980
On this forfeiting planet, as I'll be waiting, for another red Martian sunrise.

1436
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,520
Friends, my internet friends.

1437
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:16,400
My beloved listener and close, close personal friend.

1438
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:20,460
This is the internet-only end of the show.

1439
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:29,500
part where I remind you about Subgenius membership ministerial ordainment kit, in fact, whereby

1440
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:39,820
you can be a legal minister. Plus, you get insights into the secrets of the church of

1441
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:47,100
the Subgenius and a big package of stuff. And we also have, of course, t-shirts and decoder

1442
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:55,380
pins and bumper stickers and pins and everything you would expect. CDs, for instance. Even

1443
00:59:55,380 --> 01:00:03,880
a weekly radio show, did you know that? Our books are the best, but books, I think, maybe

1444
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:10,200
they're just for old people, I don't know. Anyway, some people get the impression that

1445
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:17,080
if you're a real Subgenius, you never send money to the Subgenius Foundation. You never

1446
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:23,860
buy a membership, because that proves you're really not a joiner. But that's actually wrong.

1447
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:30,860
I'm not sure where that came from. I think perhaps wishful thinking. But no, we don't

1448
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:38,680
laugh at you when you send in your 35 bucks, finally, and we mail you that kit, which is

1449
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:47,080
addressed by my hand, by the way. And yeah, I actually do physically pay for that. And

1450
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:52,080
we manhandle each package. And they also, there's a little letter in there that's signed

1451
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:56,480
by me, too. How about that? We actually care. We go to a lot of trouble. We keep track of

1452
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:03,300
who you are, at least until you move, and we all forget about it. But yeah, friends,

1453
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:11,180
isn't it about time? Subgenius.com. Oh, and we'll take checks. This month, you can mail

1454
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:16,260
them to Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas, 76045.

1455
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:23,520
And I have a feeling that's going to be our permanent address in a couple of years. But

1456
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:28,480
in the meantime, you can still use the Cleveland address. We get mail forwarded back and forth.

1457
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:33,460
Hey, Price Bob. Thank you.
