1
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,640
The Final Frontier

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,460
These are the enterprise of the subgenius Voyage.

3
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:33,180
Its thousand year mission? To explore stange new worlds, to seek out and destroy new civilizations, to boldly go where Bob has gone before.

4
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,820
No.

5
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,000
No.

6
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,260
Why do we have to wait for aliens?

7
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,980
1, 3, 0, 1, 3.

8
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:10,500
And now, the subgenius hour of SWAC.

9
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,820
Amazing, powerful, simple, quiet, low profile, lightweight.

10
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,440
Had nothing to do with the subgenius.

11
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:27,700
High performance, wall hugging, convenient, built in, high capacity, cordless, articulating, easy, swivel action, handheld, dust spewing.

12
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,060
Bob?

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,780
It's alive.

14
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,600
It's alive.

15
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,780
It's alive. It's alive.

16
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,140
It's alive.

17
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,380
In the name of God.

18
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,540
Now I know what it feels like to be God.

19
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,340
Henry is well, but he's very busy.

20
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,600
Friends, this is going to be an X Day show.

21
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,840
Yes, because X Day is approaching.

22
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,540
July 5th of 1998.

23
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,920
That will be the real X Day when it arrives.

24
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:08,020
But we celebrate X Day and we drill for the end of the world every year on July 5th.

25
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,980
This year, which the conspiracy claims is the year 2003.

26
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,480
We will be doing that.

27
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,920
And, you know, for those of you who don't understand our religion, it's this simple.

28
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:28,220
For those who sent 30 bucks to J.R. Bob Dobbs at that Texas post office box or check in, well, whatever.

29
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:36,580
Those who are saved and justified in that man Bob, they will be on that mighty date.

30
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,940
Lifted up.

31
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:47,300
Ruptured, as we call it, up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses from Planet X.

32
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,880
There to live forever.

33
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,120
Forever.

34
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,000
Until they die.

35
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,900
And then they go to subgenius heaven, which goes on forever and ever and ever, too.

36
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,500
And, friends, it's a beautiful story.

37
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,320
And it's all coming true for those who believe.

38
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,860
Anything is possible for those who believe.

39
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,340
And every day is X Day when you have a gun.

40
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,760
Praise Bob.

41
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,700
Men and women of all races and creeds pause to destroy the earth.

42
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,440
Bob.

43
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:17,980
Bob.

44
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:18,400
Bob.

45
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:18,560
Bob.

46
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:18,960
Bob.

47
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,240
Bob.

48
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:19,660
Bob.

49
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,100
Bob.

50
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:20,520
Bob.

51
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,200
Bob.

52
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,620
Bob.

53
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:21,980
Bob.

54
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,860
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

55
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,260
Bob!

56
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:26,860
Bob!

57
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,840
What's that?

58
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,660
What's that?

59
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,940
Right on goes the music.

60
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,560
From now on, it also has monitored reptiles, mammals, cats, snakes, dogs, a-borigines,

61
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,800
birds, super lizards, culture, to achieve financial independence.

62
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,780
Well, I've, waited so long, for this, day to come.

63
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:48,860
You will have to give the man a little help.

64
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:48,860


65
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:48,860


66
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,720
I don't know who they are or where they come from

67
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,420
But I know I've been chosen, must be one of the few

68
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,360
Only first class on the mothership will do

69
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,120
I've seen them saucers sliding, baby, up in the air

70
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,000
And I know what they mean, I know the end is near

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,660
So I'll climb the silver staircase and I'll find link with the crew

72
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,600
Only first class on the mothership will do

73
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,400
We're going light speed out to space

74
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,440
We're the last hope for the human race

75
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,280
A little green fly to take us directly in

76
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,100
The spears and peanuts of the first class on the mothership will do

77
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,880
There'll be nothing to want, there'll be nothing to need me watching

78
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,140
Grand Ole Opry and Hee Haw in 3D

79
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,960
Laying horseshoes on the holodeck, eat roast beef from a tube

80
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,960
Only first class on the mothership will do

81
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,740
We're going light speed out to space

82
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,800
We're the last hope for the human race

83
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,500
A little green fly to take us directly in

84
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,580
The spears and peanuts of the first class on the mothership will do

85
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,500
First Class on the Mothership will do

86
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,560
We're going home, going home

87
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,680
On the saucer, get on board

88
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,040
Singing praises, Hallelujah to the Lord

89
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,520
Praise the Lord

90
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,620
I'm so glad that I've been chosen

91
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,540
For to start my life anew

92
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,400
Only First Class on the Mothership will do

93
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,740
If you'd fly with me, baby

94
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,620
We'd make a cosmic team

95
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,620
Like Tammy and George Jones

96
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,480
Or Adam and Eve

97
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,480
Flying past the rings of Saturn

98
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,120
Have a winder with you

99
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,140
Flying First Class on the Mothership with you

100
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:25,080
We're going life speed out through space

101
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,880
We're the last hope for the human race

102
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,940
Little green flight attendants

103
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,660
Bring the anguished pears and peanuts

104
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,500
Up to First Class on the Mothership will do

105
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,440
We're going home, going home

106
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,520
On the saucer, get on board

107
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,540
Singing praises, Hallelujah to the Lord

108
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,420
Praise the Lord

109
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,320
I'm so glad that I've been chosen

110
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,160
For to start my life anew

111
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,300
Only First Class on the Mothership will do

112
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,540
Music

113
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,280
First Class on the Mothership

114
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,520
By Hank Floyd and the Swerving Headlights

115
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,580
Uh, sorry, it sounded sort of like tank flies.

116
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,940
And the Swerving Headlights

117
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:21,000
From their CD, Interstellar Cattle Drive

118
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:27,340
And you can find out more about that from www.swervingheadlights.com

119
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,740
More of them coming up

120
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,740
All of the surrounding collages are by

121
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,460
The great artiste, Fernande Lemaire

122
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,460
Uh, yes, yes, yes, friends

123
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,560
Uh, uh, we're going to...

124
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,940
To Planet X with Lemaire this time

125
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,480
We do know how to get on the Mothership

126
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,340
And we do know which aliens to go with

127
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,580
And we did get our First Class tickets already

128
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,360
From that man, J.R. Bob Dobbs

129
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,480
And it's so easy

130
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,420
Ooh

131
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,480
It just feels good

132
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,620
Isn't that the moose?

133
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,820
And you're an attractive woman

134
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,760
You're single

135
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,240
And you probably have a normal outlook

136
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,540
On matters of sexual freedom

137
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,780
And if that's so, friends

138
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,980
You won't want to miss

139
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,200
as S-X-X-X-X Day 6.

140
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,660
Sick Sex Day.

141
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,500
You don't want to miss the saucers.

142
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,480
You don't want to miss the coming revolution,

143
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,000
as heard here by the jelly eaters.

144
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,580
This is the hour.

145
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,460
This is the hour.

146
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,820
The coming revolution.

147
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,980
This is the hour.

148
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,760
This is the hour.

149
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,080
The coming revolution.

150
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,700
Michigan and California, the spawning grounds for the revolutionary activities.

151
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:34,160
The White Panthers headquarters in Ann Arbor.

152
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,360
This is the hour.

153
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,240
This is the hour.

154
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,480
The coming revolution.

155
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,740
This is the hour.

156
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,600
This is the hour.

157
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,760
The coming revolution.

158
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,180
Students for a democratic society.

159
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,460
The White Panthers.

160
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,500
SDS class is seen.

161
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,020
We better do it now.

162
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,120
This is the hour.

163
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,000
This is the hour.

164
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,120
The coming revolution.

165
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,560
This is the hour.

166
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,360
This is the hour.

167
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,580
The coming revolution.

168
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,060
Every high school and college in the country will close with riots and sabotage.

169
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,920
Millions of young people will surge into the streets of every city.

170
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,920
Dancing, singing, smoking pot, and having sexual intercourse.

171
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:37,880
And of course,

172
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,020
Bob Hope said,

173
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,040
Oh, just some college kids having fun.

174
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,440
This is the hour.

175
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,220
This is the hour.

176
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,380
The coming revolution.

177
00:10:52,920 --> 00:11:00,040
Our program is cultural revolution through a total assault on the culture which makes use of every tool, every energy, every media we can get our hands on.

178
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,040
Our message is one, and that is freedom.

179
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,300
For the first time in America,

180
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,320
we have a generation of visionary,

181
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:08,960
mania,

182
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,680
white mother,

183
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,180
country,

184
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:10,740
dope,

185
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,340
being rock and roll freaks,

186
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,820
who are ready to kick out the jams,

187
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,560
all the jams.

188
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,240
This is the hour.

189
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,020
This is the hour.

190
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,180
The coming revolution.

191
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,060
The coming revolution.

192
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,620
This is the hour.

193
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,380
This is the hour.

194
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,520
The coming revolution.

195
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,080
This is the hour.

196
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,880
This is the hour.

197
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,000
The coming revolution.

198
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,420
The program of total freedom for everyone.

199
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,840
We are totally committed to carrying out our program.

200
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,940
We breathe revolution.

201
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,160
We are LSD driven maniacs in the universe.

202
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,800
We'll do anything we can to drive people crazy out of their heads into their bodies.

203
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,380
This is the hour.

204
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,260
This is the hour.

205
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,380
The coming revolution.

206
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,800
This is the hour.

207
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,700
This is the hour.

208
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,960
The coming revolution.

209
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,660
We're getting out of the streets.

210
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:46,340
Thanks, todo.

211
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,100
It's fight or die time,

212
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,100


213
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,160
Check out my dress code PianosOil expensive programming and büydingumbled i estudian

214
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,160


215
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,180
question

216
00:12:49,180 --> 00:13:00,940
do you have a gun in your pocket?

217
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,620
Colin's got the control over my campuses.

218
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:03,800
So,

219
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:05,420
yes,

220
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,700
I was preaching the word of Satan, deceiving my congregation.

221
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,720
I tried to get a concept of who's the Jesus me, the, the.

222
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,400
I tried to get a big brain.

223
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,360
Who's Jesus me Christ.

224
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:33,060
The word of Jesus me, the, the, the, the, the.

225
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,800
That's fascinating.

226
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,000
Would it be okay if Gilbert spent the night?

227
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,380
I ask him simply to consider this.

228
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,300
Submit evidence to review and get this matter settled.

229
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,400
We don't rule out anything at all.

230
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,620
Thanks a lot, Mom.

231
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,500
Their sympathies may lie in the wrong area, but, uh...

232
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,500
Well, yeah, they don't need me.

233
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,040
They still got my sister to push around while I'm away.

234
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:04,900
Yeah.

235
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,080
So the job of the government is surely to take all necessary steps

236
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:16,360
to safeguard the public regardless of the sensibilities of a striking union.

237
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,240
I ask the Prime Minister simply this.

238
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,660
I can get out of this satellite contract at any time, right?

239
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,720
Yes, I guess so.

240
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,700
We understand the issues that they have.

241
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,600
Golly, beep.

242
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,100
The reality is that the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister

243
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,040
will mislead all of those who are in the same boat.

244
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,040


245
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:38,660
And it's worth remembering that when the Green Goddesses were last used,

246
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,360
they were only 20 years old.

247
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,760
I didn't think it was gonna happen so quick.

248
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,660
Me neither.

249
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,140
There must be no...

250
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:54,320
Have you noticed the difference in my eye?

251
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,400
It's gooey.

252
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,600
Yes, and it has a little slit instead of a cornea.

253
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,600
Oh, my God.

254
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,380
I can see behind my own head when I'm walking forward.

255
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:02,940
Well, good.

256
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:03,800
Disgusting.

257
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,320
Whether they see me, they will need a little bit more time.

258
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,380
I think when I see them, it will be too late.

259
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,800
It's always too late, Dave.

260
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,400
Especially if you're on the wrong page.

261
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,900
It's too late if you're late for X-Day 1998.

262
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,320
That's right.

263
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,480
This July 5th, 1998.

264
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,560
Whenever that may be.

265
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,660
X-Day will happen.

266
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,940
The following members of...

267
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,140
The Nationalist League have been banned from production,

268
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,920
been found guilty,

269
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:43,560
or social humanism traces in their urine and mine.

270
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,100
Oops.

271
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:51,780
I've been kind of hoping that X-Day would come along and rupture us

272
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:56,580
before July 5th of this year when we have our big party.

273
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,760
I mean, it'll be a great party, but...

274
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,240
The wounded coming back.

275
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,180
The stompers.

276
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,100
You know, the guys in the front row going,

277
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,400
ooh, bop, bop.

278
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,160
They have one hand, you know, and you feel so sorry.

279
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,040
It's hard to make them laugh.

280
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,220
It's hard to preach to a room full of one-armed people.

281
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:13,680
I know.

282
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,200
I know that's true.

283
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,720
I've tried to do it.

284
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,660
It's hard.

285
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,460
Back in the now.

286
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,040
To get a good laugh out of an amputado.

287
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,380
But sometimes they're more than willing to laugh

288
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,820
just because of the awful, terrible sights they've seen.

289
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:29,680
You develop a great sense of humor when you've been mangled and traumatized.

290
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,620
You've seen Rumsfeld from the rear side, so to speak.

291
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,180
Or get kind of, you know, generally depressed all the time.

292
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,020
Yeah, there's feelings of nausea, I guess, blistering of the skin,

293
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,540
viruses that can connect you with your family genealogy.

294
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,560
I'm not going to take that ride.

295
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,200
No, I'm not going.

296
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,220
Dr. Pavlov, Steng is doing well.

297
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,720
But you know, who is to say that disease is not a gift,

298
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,540
a natural change in consciousness

299
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,240
designed to teach us?

300
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,820
Pain and agony.

301
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,900
So we learn the lesson of senseless hurt.

302
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,140
Whatever that lesson is.

303
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,760
Which is the lesson of life.

304
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,920
It hasn't stopped, so evidently I haven't learned that lesson.

305
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,800
There is pain and suffering.

306
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,420
Indemnitably, there is rubbing of the genital areas

307
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,580
and some short intercalations

308
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,540
and then back to the suffering mind.

309
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,780
Digging for gold and salt.

310
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,700
And copper and iron.

311
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,800
And little tools to make the aliens return.

312
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,520
Is that all there is, though, Dr. Day?

313
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,000
There must be more.

314
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,000
There has to be.

315
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:53,000
Surely we're not just little pain balls aching in a void.

316
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,620
It's the way Bob found us

317
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,420
and the way he likes to take us under his armpit

318
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,400
and gently stroke those pains away.

319
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,280
He is a man who is more than a common man.

320
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,580
He is a man who is imbued with the powers

321
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,480
of powerful aliens themselves

322
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,620
who have returned to Earth

323
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,260
to give a message to mankind.

324
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,960
And Bob J.R. Bob Dobbs

325
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,900
is the allocutor of that ma...

326
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,000
ma...

327
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,800
ma...

328
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,680
7 a.m. July 5th.

329
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,340
One of these years.

330
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,100
The saved,

331
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,660
that is, those who have proven their love

332
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,240
30 bucks worth to J.R. Bob Dobbs,

333
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,920
will be lifted up,

334
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,320
ruptured up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses

335
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,920
there to swim in an ocean of snot.

336
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,000
A headache that lasts all year.

337
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:59,760
And sex with sinuses and just slimy nasal passages

338
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,600
beyond the kind of madness

339
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:02,960
that is the life of a man.

340
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,380
Or his sister.

341
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,480
It's not a fixation.

342
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,740
His mind has become a fixed.

343
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,480
And that is new and it's in the past.

344
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,240
He can feel now

345
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,580
where his diaphragm is racing slowly.

346
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,740
There won't be too much problem from now on.

347
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,340
As long as we can keep him breathing steadily

348
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,940
and evacuate fluids.

349
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,120
He's waiting for a day that may never come.

350
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,380
He's waiting for the day that has already come and gone.

351
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,900
Now I'm waiting for another bottle of Robitussin.

352
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,720
Don't worry, my friend.

353
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,700
All of your earthy problems will be rolled up into that little balloon ball.

354
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:47,700
Turn light?

355
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,880
And cast into the cosmos. Like so.

356
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,960
Tell me how.

357
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,360
Very simple.

358
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,680
Take a penicillin on a piece of paper or a check.

359
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,120
Draw a picture of the father of the country,

360
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,080
George Washington, on the covers.

361
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,580
Put thirty on each side.

362
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:08,660
Send them to the church of the subgenius at...

363
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,420
What's that address again?

364
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,560
The church of the subgenius is...

365
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,380
The address that is... is...

366
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,160
Oh, uh, what?

367
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,360
Uh, what's the...

368
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,580
Austin's... Austin box?

369
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,040
Oh, the pund office buns.

370
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,160
The box.

371
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,840
Buns of a steer.

372
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,740
Cage mansion.

373
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,040
Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

374
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,540
44118.

375
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,260
And...

376
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,820
Free with every order.

377
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:44,280
You get to spank the Japanese girl band of your choice at an all-night preview.

378
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,140
You'll be free with every order that Bob gets you.

379
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:57,460
Every single dick trait that Bob lays down makes you that much more free.

380
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:01,240
Every tingling dick is made for potatoes that are free.

381
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,560
Every single thing that your dad does is like goop. It's like syrup.

382
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:08,800
You're swirling in a miasm of your own psychedelic, high-culture colonic.

383
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,940
I was out driving one night far from town.

384
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,540
Aimless I wandered, my pickup broke down.

385
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,360
Then I looked up, Lord, and I beheld a sight.

386
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,380
Praise the Lord!

387
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,200
I saw them lights.

388
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,220
I saw them lights.

389
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,820
I saw them lights.

390
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,600
They came for me in the middle of the night.

391
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,260
Up in the sky, Lord, shining so bright.

392
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,400
Praise the Lord!

393
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,080
I saw them lights.

394
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,860
I saw them lights.

395
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,440
I saw them lights.

396
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,500
I saw them lights.

397
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,180
I saw them lights.

398
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:24,180


399
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,160
They came for me in the middle of the night.

400
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,800
Up in the sky, Lord, shining so bright

401
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,640
Praise the Lord, I saw them lights

402
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,100
Well, I was a fool to wander and stray

403
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,880
From the main highway that faithful lay

404
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,700
Now all that I know is that I don't know what is right

405
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,560
Praise the Lord, I saw them lights

406
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,240
I saw them lights, I saw them lights

407
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,920
They came for me in the middle of the night

408
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,580
Up in the sky, Lord, shining so bright

409
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:23,760
Praise the Lord, I saw them lights

410
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,780
I saw them lights by Hank Floyd and the Swerving Headlights

411
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,260
from Interstellar Cattle Drive CD.

412
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,980
Hank Floyd and the Swerving Headlights, swervingheadlights.com.

413
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,120
Before that, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Chaz Smith, Princess Wiardo,

414
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:52,680
and I, Stang, on WCSB Cleveland ESO Swamp Radio.

415
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,080
Before that, the attack of the Killers.

416
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,140
The Killer Collages from the Killer Lemur, Fernanda Dande.

417
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:05,820
The pretty musical Interferal Collages there are by Reverend Chief.

418
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,980
And now, a rare recording from an actual subgenius revival in Austin, Texas in 1982.

419
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,660
Listen closely and you'll hear the 26-year-old Hell Pope Huey.

420
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,820
We need a few of the initiates, please, to squat in the dirt and let us have their chairs.

421
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,080
We'll hear them.

422
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,080


423
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,360
Will someone help move the bodies of those stunned by the music back to the back by the beer?

424
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,580
The pile is out front.

425
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,040
No, back. Excuse me.

426
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,560
And for everyone, for everyone that dies tonight,

427
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,340
their body is worth approximately $12 and it's falling fast.

428
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,600
Everyone that dies tonight is thrown on a cremation pile.

429
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,160
Every subgenius that is carrying his car gets a cut of that $12.

430
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,480
We need the glands for those experiments.

431
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,060
And we're talking about the foot glands.

432
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,540
The most important one in your body next to you know what.

433
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,000
We tried to donate it to the sperm bank, but they wouldn't let us.

434
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:02,700
Praise Bob.

435
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,600
Praise Bob.

436
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:10,700
There's people here, there's people here who, you know, can't donate to the sperm bank because they're underweight.

437
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,560
Okay?

438
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,720
That's all right.

439
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:18,020
Let us just have just a few cells from underneath your skin so we can begin the cloning experiment.

440
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,580
Let us just have a chocolate.

441
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:24,140
I would like to have that young lady in the front row because I know in about 14 years she'd be so cute.

442
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,420
We bring them up right at Dobbs Town.

443
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,440
Yeah, I just think you'd have a companion.

444
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,020
If you're going to be exposed to radiation, let's go all the way.

445
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,920
You know, if you're going to do it, then just sit in front of a color TV with your legs widespread watching Mr. T cartoons.

446
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,480
And you can have a boy just like Jeter.

447
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,120
Yeah, that's right.

448
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,020
This is crazy, y'all.

449
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,720
This is crazy.

450
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:46,040
The most difficult thing I've ever tried to do is to clear the mind.

451
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,540
Let us see.

452
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,140
Let us see.

453
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,300
Let us see.

454
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,460
Let us see.

455
00:25:59,580 --> 00:25:59,580


456
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,500
Let us see.

457
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:01,980
Let us see.

458
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,800
This Friday and Saturday.

459
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,120
People are rarely gregarious when constipated.

460
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:29,420
Oh,

461
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:33,800
wow.

462
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,380
I guess I'll just have to blow up the planet Earth.

463
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:44,600
In Chicago, another life is about to be changed by a plastic child.

464
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,140
She's got a big plastic ear for a plastic surgeon.

465
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:54,800
But how do you make a living human child one which won't be rejected by the real?

466
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,600
The real thing and look just like a human plastic child's ear.

467
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,660
We are programmed to function as human females.

468
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,160
Lord, you are.

469
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,040
Yes, my Lord.

470
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,860
Harry Mudd programmed.

471
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,100
You?

472
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,000
Yes, my Lord.

473
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,600
That unprincipled, evil minded, lecherous kulak Harry Mudd program you?

474
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,380
Yes, my Lord.

475
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,540
This place is even better.

476
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,380
Are you the next American Idol, Dave?

477
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,480
I'm the next atonal recital.

478
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,780
I'm the next beautiful, beautiful bag of pus.

479
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,500
Look at that big old brain cell.

480
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,460
Look at that big old brain cell.

481
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:35,100
It's a big old ugly bag of water held up by a bunch of sticks.

482
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:35,980
Sticks.

483
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,680
That's a very romantic portrait.

484
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,120
It is.

485
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,480
Painted of the human race.

486
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:40,880
Sticks.

487
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,460
Saline solution and a flaky...

488
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,740
I told my class the other day.

489
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,800
To the aliens looking in from outer space,

490
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:52,160
you're just an ugly bag of water held up by a bunch of white sticks.

491
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,380
Sticks.

492
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,720
If some babe goes, oh, I love your eyes.

493
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,460
I think it is, yeah.

494
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,040
I don't remember.

495
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,180
Price Bob, that's right.

496
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,100
See if some babe says, oh, I love your eyes or something.

497
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:04,960
Well, the bag of ugly water is actually an old Star Trek thing.

498
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,360
From the original episode, I think there was some entity that came from outer space

499
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,220
and kept calling them ugly bags of water.

500
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,280
No.

501
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,180
See, I think Landry makes more sense now than the ugly bags of water.

502
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,100
But then I added the held up by sticks.

503
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,040
Held up by sticks.

504
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,860
Do you remember what Landry said?

505
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,620
Before festival?

506
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:24,780
Landu.

507
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,460
Landru.

508
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,160
Landru?

509
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,100
That's the way they're behaving now.

510
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,140
I didn't go to the last Trekkie convention, Mr. Dave.

511
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,080
Well, you were just talking about sticks and bags.

512
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,340
I thought it would contribute the only one I remembered.

513
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,620
You know, rock and...

514
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,240
Landru.

515
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,060
Did you get a bag with a lot of sticks?

516
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,060
Of course.

517
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,440
Oh, that's a rip.

518
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:42,860
They don't...

519
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,560
Well, they never put anything but the sticks in it.

520
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,580
I can remember in high school, we would clean a pound of pot

521
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,800
and then take all the sticks and take them to school.

522
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,880
That's a criminal act.

523
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:52,860
And take them to school.

524
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,660
Well, you're allowed to clean it.

525
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,140
It was 1974.

526
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:54,980
Right.

527
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,220
So that was decriminalized.

528
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,040
And you are allowed to shampoo it and give it a shave.

529
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,220
You just can't smoke it.

530
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,140
Decriminalized.

531
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,460
Cleaning it.

532
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,140
Anyway, we would take the stems and put them in a big baggie

533
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,220
and sell them to the dweebs and tell them...

534
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,000
We told them they were Peruvian stems.

535
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,880
Are you the guy that sold me those sticks?

536
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,280
You son of a bitch!

537
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,540
That's the son of a bitch right there.

538
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,060
Oh, my God.

539
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,720
I've been waiting for this for 25 years.

540
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,420
And the little geeks were off in the woods trying to smoke the stems

541
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,400
of the pound we cleaned up.

542
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:21,660
Yeah.

543
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,420
I'm telling you, if you're a little geek,

544
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,940
if you're a little bag of water held up by sticks,

545
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,300
you can get off on sticks.

546
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:27,760
That's true.

547
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,000
All you need is rock and stick.

548
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,000
Rock and stick.

549
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
The first preacher said it, and it's true.

550
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,740
Rock and...

551
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,280
Everything's made of rock and stick.

552
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:35,960
That was cruel.

553
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,060
My shit was cruel.

554
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,460
This is a ton of rock.

555
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,760
This here is made of stick.

556
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,680
The seeds are like little rocks in the sticks.

557
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,120
Made of sticks.

558
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,360
This is a bag of water.

559
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,360
A hot-looking bag of water.

560
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,460
A hot-looking hydrocephalic bag of water.

561
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,240
Man, he's been going on about it.

562
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,780
They must have just done it out in the car coming up here or something.

563
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,720
Well, they were trying to.

564
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,260
Yeah.

565
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,140
But the police...

566
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,400
The policeman was knocking on the door.

567
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,400
He's got them all excited now.

568
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,540
Sir, sir, sir.

569
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,560
The Red Rocket.

570
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,080
Red Rocket.

571
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,660
We're excited.

572
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,000
Look out.

573
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,140
There stangs Red Rocket.

574
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:02,620
We're excited.

575
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,200
Always excited.

576
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,680
We're excited about the blessings of J.R. Bob Dobbs on the world.

577
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,260
On the toilet.

578
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:08,740
Beware.

579
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,560
The blastings.

580
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,260
The leavings of the...

581
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:11,800
Beware.

582
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,400
The encyclical poet.

583
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,240
Red Rocket.

584
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,020
And rap rosure of his time.

585
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,540
Beware of the Red Rocket of Ivan Stank.

586
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,940
Because it will smell like Rocket.

587
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,040
But pardon me.

588
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,460
That's on a sub-brasa level.

589
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,700
We don't want to...

590
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,140
You know, this is not a public thing we're talking about.

591
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,200
This is very sub-brasa.

592
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,460
Okay, we're going to make fun of someone else.

593
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,500
Someone that's not here.

594
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,120
Or a...

595
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,960
Why do we have to signify like baboons and chimpanzees?

596
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:41,720
Can't we just lend our own legendary smokage to the overall buttress?

597
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,680
No, there ain't no thing like that.

598
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,620
Hello, you're on American Idol.

599
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,640
Hello.

600
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,400
Hello.

601
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,920
I'm going to go on.

602
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,580
I'm tired.

603
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,380
I'm tired of happiness.

604
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,780
I'm tired of comfort and pleasure already.

605
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,580
Kill me.

606
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,600
Kill me.

607
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,320
He had too much happiness.

608
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,600
But now he's happier.

609
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,120
He's dead.

610
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,340
And we'll miss him.

611
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,920
Let us hear it for our poor dead friend.

612
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,700
Mars.

613
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:21,180
The one planet we know is capable of sustaining killer vegetation.

614
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,520
And enemy Martians.

615
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:28,460
How can you or anybody on this particular world know what it's like in that unhuman place called Mars?

616
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,480
Mars.

617
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,240
The nightmare planet.

618
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,100
Mars.

619
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,060
The rotten apple planet.

620
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:43,700
I hate it.

621
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,240
Hate it.

622
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:44,800
Mars.

623
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,120
The rotten nightmare planet.

624
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,560
Mars.

625
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:51,900
Darling.

626
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,580
Darling.

627
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:53,700
Darling.

628
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,000
Darling.

629
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,440
Mars.

630
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,220
Mars.

631
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:55,700
Mars.

632
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,340
Darling, you can't go on like this.

633
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,880
Fighting the Martians in your memories.

634
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,000
Yeah, you're probably right.

635
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,860
I just feel conservative right now.

636
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:07,860
I know.

637
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,620
What a fright.

638
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,400
That was groovy.

639
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,320
I know.

640
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,960
That was early kinescope.

641
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,340
What did you get that?

642
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,780
Here we go, children.

643
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,080
Tasty.

644
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,960
So good.

645
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,560
Real good.

646
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,500
I'm going to be enjoying the rest of this.

647
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,560
Human race.

648
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,600
I'm free.

649
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,900
The plaza is falling apart.

650
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,080
Will you hit the osmolap?

651
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,060
Will you wander through the wilderness apart?

652
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,160
Uh-huh.

653
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:38,420
Will you climb a mountaintop and jump right off into the frat?

654
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,180
Will you?

655
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:39,780
Will you?

656
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,860
On July 5th, this year.

657
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,360
So long.

658
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,280
So far.

659
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,740
You're far away.

660
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,160
Uh-huh.

661
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,580
Like that.

662
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,760
That way.

663
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,160
That way.

664
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,000
I have a good idea of everything.

665
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,920
I have a good idea of everything.

666
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:56,900
I have a good idea of everything.

667
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,720
I have a good idea of everything.

668
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:58,900
Yeah.

669
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:03,380
Astral intercourse and universal force.

670
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,260
Astral intercourse with the horse nebula, you know?

671
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,540
They're all there.

672
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,340
They're you.

673
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,060
They're there for you.

674
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:18,340
Give you the balls to see.

675
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,160
See it through.

676
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,640
Yeah.

677
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:28,280
And light the pipe of truth.

678
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,820
Yeah, that's right.

679
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,460
Smoking.

680
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,920
Selfie in real time, because here we go.

681
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,900
Lesson one, astral intercourse.

682
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:44,900
Prepare the astral sexual device three days in advance to make sure locomotion is secure and fun.

683
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,320
Also, prepare the back of the neck.

684
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,500
The vesicles expand during extra sexual.

685
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:56,160
Activity's causing the corpus callosum to explode in some rare occurrences.

686
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:01,140
For those of you with weak knees, there is a standard brace.

687
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:08,060
For those with too many braces on their teeth, there's a standard documentary referendum.

688
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,560
I am sleeping now.

689
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,760
And so.

690
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,460
Every day is when you have a good.

691
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,700
You know, you've got to.

692
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,020
Yeah.

693
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:20,460
You would.

694
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,100
If you have a gun.

695
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:21,400
You can.

696
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,380
Make your own reality.

697
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,640
Probe into their lives and really.

698
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,600
And so let's go into their own reality.

699
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,200
Armed and humorous.

700
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:28,580
People, yeah.

701
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,820
We march into the future.

702
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,660
A hundred years from now.

703
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,240
But we have safe guns.

704
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,620
We have to shoot rubber bullets.

705
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,000
We have to sell them all kinds of important things later.

706
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,640
The guns laugh instead of making shot sounds.

707
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,000
Yes.

708
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,220
And the bullets, when they hit you, they tickle you.

709
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,440
You've got to figure out what they want, what they like, what they don't like.

710
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,680
It's going to be a wonderful future.

711
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,740
This is random nonsense.

712
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,720
Church reform.

713
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,740
The next hundred years.

714
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,400
Take it.

715
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:51,900
Okay.

716
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:52,700
Church reform.

717
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,640
What are we going to do for the next 100 years?

718
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,560
You are on the board.

719
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,580
You for 250.

720
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,260
You have.

721
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,440
Once again, the gay paris.

722
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,200
Gay.

723
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:01,740
Well, gay.

724
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,400
You see politics.

725
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,860
Gay is the underlying word here, I think.

726
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,260
I'm sure.

727
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:05,600
500.

728
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,740
How do you keep them busy?

729
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,580
How do you keep them gay when they're down on the farm?

730
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,700
How do you keep them on the farm when they're gay?

731
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,500
That's right.

732
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:15,660
Well, how can you improve upon a church that has done so much for so little?

733
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,380
You know?

734
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:16,960
For so few.

735
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,840
Look at the numbers.

736
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,320
Never have so few.

737
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,080
From the output.

738
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:20,760
From so many.

739
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,220
Just output.

740
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,500
That's so much.

741
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:27,960
Well, if you look around, almost every member of the church of the subgenius is in this

742
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,160
radio studio right now.

743
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,580
Right now.

744
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:33,440
I mean, it's like if there was an atom bomb to go off right now, not that there should

745
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:33,760
be.

746
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,600
There were a couple of subgeniuses who were out there.

747
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,520
Clam chow.

748
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,000
Yeah.

749
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,040
Free speech.

750
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:39,960
Or FBI.

751
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,100
It's all screwed.

752
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:41,700
That's right.

753
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,060
The church is screwed.

754
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:43,740
CIA.

755
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:51,320
If the bastion of free speech gets nipped right now by Al Qaeda, there's a three or four

756
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:51,560
major.

757
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:51,780
That's right.

758
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,200
Major religion.

759
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:52,620
That's right.

760
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,320
This is the Vatican of alternative religion right now.

761
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:56,560
Yeah.

762
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,060
As we see it.

763
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:57,620
Well, at least.

764
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,120
At least.

765
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:58,580
That's right.

766
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,620
They're going down.

767
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:04,720
If the church of the subgenius goes down, civilization goes.

768
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,360
Safety.

769
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,220
Hit the pipes.

770
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:06,640
Sidewall.

771
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,280
Smoking.

772
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,460
I would say it was the edict of the mountain.

773
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:09,900
Stupid.

774
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,680
Four cents.

775
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,320
You owe me four cents.

776
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,140
I own the rights to the world.

777
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:13,940
Go to hell.

778
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:14,840
Go to hell.

779
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,240
This is it.

780
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,180
Four cents.

781
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,060
Four cents.

782
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,740
This will decide the fate of the world.

783
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:19,560
Stupid.

784
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:19,880
What?

785
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:20,620
Accusation.

786
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,060
Stupid.

787
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:21,180
Stupid.

788
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:21,280
Stupid.

789
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:21,460
Stupid.

790
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:21,540


791
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:21,560


792
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,720
I own the rights to the word stupid.

793
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,820
The entire universe is about to be discussed now.

794
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:25,840
I got trademark rights on that.

795
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,280
What say you fellows?

796
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:30,420
Destroy or leave alone?

797
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,120
Is it broken?

798
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:33,800
Rototill.

799
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,720
All of reality.

800
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,000
I went to our guest call.

801
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,160
She was around here screaming.

802
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,400
If it's not broken, I think we should go to the bathroom now.

803
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,040
Reverend Stang.

804
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,300
Rototill.

805
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,160
All of reality.

806
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:43,620
She's going.

807
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,300
If it's not broken, I say we go in there and fix the day.

808
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,220
Fix it.

809
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,020
Fix the problem.

810
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,300
Fix the hell out of it.

811
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,260
We're going to have a $50 million.

812
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,660
Fix the freaking hell out of it.

813
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,020
Broke or unbroke.

814
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,240
You're a brisker.

815
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,220
If you are, you are.

816
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,500
You have to come to me for $25 million.

817
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,940
Just fix it.

818
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:01,680
Tamper.

819
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,040
That's our motto.

820
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,000
Tamper.

821
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,420
If you don't work, you got to fix it.

822
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,300
I got a contest.

823
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,120
Semper tamper.

824
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,180
So what kind of launch pads are you guys planning for X day?

825
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,820
It sounds like the plotting and planning is going to start.

826
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,800
I just jump up and down.

827
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,560
You know how I do.

828
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,840
I'm waiting for my cranium to shake.

829
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,780
And then I have the visions.

830
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,380
Chazville.

831
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,620
You don't need to get up for X day.

832
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,420
None of you guys.

833
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,640
Do you guys always sleep through the 7 a.m. ritual?

834
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,740
I've never gotten up before 7 a.m.

835
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,600
How many times do I have to see Christ nailed to the crotch?

836
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,640
I mean, Christ on a stick.

837
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:34,840
I'm pooped, man.

838
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,400
I just talked to Dr. Legume not two hours ago.

839
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,340
And this very evening, he purchased himself a brand new hot tub.

840
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,440
Yeah, he's installing it in his garage.

841
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,780
Yeah, in the rocket motor.

842
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:50,600
And he's making a little piece of his own little piece.

843
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,040
The brushwood in his garage.

844
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,080
Our country is about to go to war.

845
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,440
And Dr. Legume is spending his money and time on a hot tub.

846
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,240
Is the tub alive?

847
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,880
Wait, wait, wait.

848
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,740
He's not spending his money and time on a hot tub.

849
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,100
You know, man, this is when he installed his hot tub in a garage.

850
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,400
Well, like they fixed cars there, too, at the same time.

851
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,940
I think it would be interesting to watch.

852
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:16,040
If you're having your rims done, you could watch someone tubbing it up.

853
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:20,160
The hot tub in your garage is the only place you can get a rim job.

854
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:50,820
The sun does not shine here.

855
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:50,820


856
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:50,820


857
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:50,820


858
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:50,820


859
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:50,820


860
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:50,820


861
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:50,820


862
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:50,820


863
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:50,820


864
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:50,820


865
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:55,040
Comes a-shinin' back so sweep, sweep, sweep away the gloom

866
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,580
To the boogie rhythm of the new broom

867
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,440
To the boogie rhythm of the new broom

868
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,380
To the boogie rhythm of the new broom

869
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:22,900
To the boogie rhythm of the new broom

870
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,280
I believe I landed in the wrong place

871
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,720
They've come to take me back to space

872
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,860
Some say it's the water

873
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,420
Others think it's the wind

874
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,080
But me, I like to think

875
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,980
They're my long-lost friends

876
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,800
I wish you'd hurry get me out of here

877
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,560
It's lookin' like the end is near

878
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,060
My nerves are wrecked, they're startin' to shake

879
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,720
If this is a joke, it's more than I can tell

880
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,320
You've had your fun with this hide-and-seek

881
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,900
I mean it, this time come after me

882
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,700
Done all I wanna do, seen all I wanna see

883
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,840
Before the big one blows, hope you rest

884
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,360
And then I'll see you next time

885
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,440
Some say it's the water

886
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,040
Others think it's the wind

887
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,720
But me, I like to think

888
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,440
You're my long-lost friend

889
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:31,300
I believe I landed in the wrong place

890
00:41:31,300 --> 00:42:00,340
Some say it's the water

891
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,280
Others think it's the wind

892
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,220
But me, I like to think

893
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:02,220


894
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:02,220


895
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:02,220


896
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:02,220


897
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,440
And I'm thrifty, too

898
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,360
Land of light

899
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:11,860
The army of darkness shall sweep down

900
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:17,300
They are gathered like a horde of avengers

901
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,060
Life within life

902
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,980
The power that summons

903
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,260
Come back old ones

904
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:31,260


905
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:31,260


906
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,020
Princes of darkness

907
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,280
And repossess the earth

908
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:49,080
Uh, young man, I, an old one, must, uh, hereby repossess your car

909
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:53,200
We're workin' on the whole earth, but we're gonna start with your car, sonny

910
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,500
Well, but my axle's fucked up, can't you hear it?

911
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,000
Listen, when I turn, try to turn left

912
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,240
Y'all, I'm not gonna let you get away with this

913
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:01,240


914
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,160
Tuff-off is the gate whereby the spheres meet

915
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:09,640
And with the gate open, the old ones shall be

916
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,960
Man rules now where they ruled once

917
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,700
They wait, patient and potent

918
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,520
For here they shall reign again

919
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,440
And rule where they once walked

920
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,620
The old ones broke through of old

921
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:30,320
And they shall break through again

922
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:34,720
God!

923
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,040
Stop that!

924
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:37,780
God!

925
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,400
Stop that!

926
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:58,380
Then at evening, after the bowls of blood are set out for the ghosts to drink, by the flight of bats we can see the secret openings or entrances that allow us to go below the surface of the ground and commune with our sacred ancestors.

927
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,300
It is there that we may be able to see the secret openings or entrances that allow us to go below the surface of the ground and commune with our sacred ancestors.

928
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:04,460
It is there that we may be able to see the secret openings or entrances that allow us to go below the surface of the ground and commune with our sacred ancestors.

929
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:09,240
it is there that we may be able to see the secret openings or entrances that allow us to go below the surface of the ground and commune with our sacred ancestors.

930
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:13,660
It is those companies that previously lived here, That are the secret openings of the stronghold games, for which we know no ending yet from the very beginning.

931

LadyALLAAF

932
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:14,980

933

LadyALLAAF

934
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,000
LadyALLAAF

935
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,380
LadyALLAAF

936
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:18,380


937
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:18,380


938
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,240
LadyALLAAF

939
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:20,920
LadyALLAAF

940
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,440
LadyALLAAF

941
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:21,480
LadyALLAAF

942
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:21,700
LadyALLAAF

943
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,380
LadyALLAAF

944
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:22,540
LadyALLAAF

945
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,680
LadyALLAAF

946
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,880
LadyALLAAF

947
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,920
LadyALLAAF

948
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,720
LadyALLAAF

949
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,300
LadyALLAAF

950
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:30,740
poet says.

951
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:33,180
Oh, yeah.

952
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,840
What about Doctor Strange?

953
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,560
Did you ever read Doctor Strange?

954
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,460
All the time.

955
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,540
Sure, sure did.

956
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:38,920
Okay.

957
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:44,020
And he had his problems with the equivalent of the night gaunts and chug-offs and stuff.

958
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,680
Hell, I do.

959
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:47,300
Every night.

960
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,240
I do myself.

961
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,280
Yeah, every night.

962
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:50,140
Exactly.

963
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:52,800
I have to fight them off before I can make up the bed.

964
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:53,540
Yep.

965
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:58,320
And then I push the feathers over to one side, the side I'm going to sleep on, and lay on

966
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,080
top of those.

967
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:04,000
You have to keep kicking off the blankets and pulling them back on to get the proper

968
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:04,500
balance.

969
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,000
Yeah.

970
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:05,960
It's cold and heat.

971
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:13,680
Yeah, it's like I have one leg and the opposite arm out, and then I switch about every 12

972
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:18,320
But when the blankets are kicked off and your body is cold, you dream faster and wake up

973
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:23,960
more, so you tend to remember your dreams more, and they tend to have a more vivid

974
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,480
structure.

975
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,260
I don't care about that.

976
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,120
I would prefer a more deeper sleep.

977
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,860
I don't want to remember my dreams.

978
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,160
My dreams are full of murderous content.

979
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:33,420
Some are.

980
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,440
Some are of pleasant places that it's fun.

981
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,380
Your dreams, maybe.

982
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:39,900
Oh, people's dreams.

983
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,380
My dreams are like places I want to escape and never go back to.

984
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,240
Oh, I dream of those horrible things, too, of course.

985
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,760
But then you can also communicate with the dead in the dream world.

986
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,100
Yeah, that is true.

987
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:52,900
You can communicate with the dead.

988
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,260
You can live in the past.

989
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,880
You can live in the future.

990
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:58,100
So, if you kick off the blankets, you can live in the future.

991
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:58,100


992
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,940
You can kick off the covers, then you wake up more frequently, and when you wake up

993
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:03,060
more frequently, you remember your dreams more frequently.

994
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:08,980
But then you can interrupt those really good long dreams that are well developed.

995
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:09,920
Alas, that's the unfortunate aspect of you.

996
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,340
Great plot lines that you've got going.

997
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:13,000
You have to interrupt them in order to remember them.

998
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:13,700
Too bad.

999
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:18,680
And you've got these massive plot lines like they're 15-chapter dreams, and you want to...

1000
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,940
A hole in the plot, you can throw a new foundling down.

1001
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:24,840
And then you hear those bells, and you sort of like those little, you know, eastern chime

1002
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,380
things.

1003
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,140
What a tale of terror.

1004
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:30,300
Sort of makes you realize that you won't remember them anyway.

1005
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:34,160
So, while you're having them, you're thinking, this is a great dream.

1006
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,700
This dream is so robust.

1007
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:37,940
It's so plush.

1008
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:38,380
It's so full.

1009
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:39,780
It's rich.

1010
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:40,280
So round.

1011
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:40,780
So firm.

1012
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,600
So fully packed.

1013
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:42,660
It's so rich.

1014
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,120
It's just full of everything.

1015
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:44,980
There's color.

1016
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,240
There's vibrancy.

1017
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,280
There's people.

1018
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,320
There's relationships.

1019
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,380
There's carpeting.

1020
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,380
There's rugs.

1021
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,360
And there's couches with like special, like, little things.

1022
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:55,360


1023
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:55,360


1024
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,600
You know, upholstery.

1025
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,780
And I just can't believe it!

1026
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,780
The marvels of earth, sea, and sky.

1027
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:09,560
The wonders of earth, the planet of our birth.

1028
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:14,700
But in that one terrible instant, I realize I'm not even going to remember this later.

1029
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:17,920
I'm not even going to remember it.

1030
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:18,840
So what's the point?

1031
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,100
You're right.

1032
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,340
I should just wake up more often, Reverend Hal.

1033
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:23,860
I'll sleep cooler.

1034
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:25,560
Wake up more often.

1035
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:29,620
Remember my more frequent, shorter dreams more readily.

1036
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:34,840
And then I'll write them down in a book and make a lot of money.

1037
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,840
You could write them down in a book, yes.

1038
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,100
And you just have the book and the pencil nearby.

1039
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:40,160
That's right.

1040
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:41,600
I've heard of people that do that.

1041
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,940
That somebody did that.

1042
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,040
He wrote something down.

1043
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:47,660
And then the next morning when he'd read it, it didn't make a damn bit of sense to him.

1044
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:48,180
But he'd still do it.

1045
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:52,180
You have to make sure that you really are holding the pencil and you really are writing in the book.

1046
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,840
That you're not thinking about it.

1047
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:56,200
I'm thinking you're doing that while you're really urinating in the bed.

1048
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,180
Yeah, well, you know, you have to...

1049
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:59,180
That's how you learn.

1050
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:02,600
If the fool will persist in his folly, then he will become wise.

1051
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:03,980
Or wet.

1052
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,920
And is it a bad dream or a wet dream or...

1053
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,320
Is it some sort of fervid fantasy?

1054
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:14,860
It is a simulacrum of a dream.

1055
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,020
Life, what is it but a dream?

1056
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:21,600
Life is like a dream, only more real.

1057
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:22,140
Shaboom.

1058
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:24,420
Yes, which one?

1059
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,140
And more painful.

1060
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,280
White. White people.

1061
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,420
I've been hurt in my dreams and it didn't really hurt.

1062
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:34,160
I can remember like impacting the ground after flying and it not really hurting.

1063
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,320
Now you've done some fun things in your dreams.

1064
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,380
I mean really fun.

1065
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,800
Oh yeah, you know, I had a...

1066
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,400
For a long time I can remember I had this recurring dream.

1067
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,840
I haven't had it in a long time.

1068
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:50,280
But I had a recurring dream where I would be able to like bound.

1069
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,780
I could bound upwards.

1070
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,340
With my feet.

1071
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,900
Say to the height of 10, 11, 12 feet.

1072
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:11,580
Which would be just enough to sort of eject me beyond the pull of Earth's gravity where my arms through simple, simple like kicking and flapping motions I could then propel myself forward like flying.

1073
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:16,500
It's a trick and each time you start doing it again you think, oh yeah, I forgot I could do this.

1074
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,420
How easy it is.

1075
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,420
Yeah, did you do that too?

1076
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,660
Yeah, and I...

1077
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:20,560
Oh, I love it.

1078
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,120
It's wonderful.

1079
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:21,840
I love those dreams.

1080
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:28,980
And one thing, you can hover about 12 feet up in the air, you know, fairly close to the ground.

1081
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:32,060
And people like, you can hover over people and stuff.

1082
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,660
They can just above it so they can't reach you.

1083
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:39,040
They can't reach you, they jump up for you and like they're kind of hacked off that you can do that over them.

1084
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:43,600
But have you ever discovered that then there are some other ones there who can also fly?

1085
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:44,920
That's never happened to me.

1086
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:45,840
And they're menacing.

1087
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,600
I've never encountered anyone else flying.

1088
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:48,960
Oh, wow.

1089
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,100
Okay, well good for you then.

1090
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,840
It's only been me and my dreams.

1091
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:53,560
But you know, I haven't had that dream in a while.

1092
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,680
I think I'm going to like program myself tonight.

1093
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:57,060
Just kick off the covers.

1094
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,160
When I get home, I'm going to kick off the covers.

1095
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,680
I'm going to freeze to death but at least I'll have that dream one more time in my life.

1096
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:04,840
In your life.

1097
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:05,660
Before I die.

1098
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,300
When I die.

1099
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,660
I'll have a dream about.

1100
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,100
Place me on the grace of God.

1101
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,200
Place me flying in hell, dream over people.

1102
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:16,340
So high.

1103
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:16,900
So high.

1104
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,020
All that is.

1105
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:20,080
It's a dream about sex with God.

1106
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:23,700
I'm the elder gods and I'm hovering over people.

1107
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,360
They can't reach me.

1108
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:31,480
But you know, I could get up like higher than telephone pole level.

1109
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:32,680
Oh, I can do that too.

1110
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,740
I can go way up there.

1111
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:38,320
I can get up like, you know, actually up like just below like airplane level.

1112
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,060
I never got much higher than that.

1113
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:42,520
Probably could have.

1114
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:46,620
So you did not then achieve escape velocity and shoot out into space.

1115
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:47,720
No, had you done that?

1116
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,540
I think I've been there once or twice.

1117
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:53,000
Oh man, your dreams are more vivid than mine.

1118
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,520
You're actually farther out there than me.

1119
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,640
You're kind of a far out guy.

1120
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,740
Just once or twice I say.

1121
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:04,800
Okay, well you're sort of a wannabe far out guy.

1122
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:05,700
Actually.

1123
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,140
But I'm a down to earth guy.

1124
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,500
I kind of come down eventually.

1125
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:13,100
And I have nothing to come down from.

1126
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:17,700
That was Dr. Philo Drummond and Dr. Hal Robbins on the Puzzle.

1127
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,080
And you're listening to the show KPFA Berkeley.

1128
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:24,060
They selected a beautiful girl like you.

1129
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,800
Have you ever seen what a man pees with honey?

1130
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,180
Let me show you something.

1131
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:33,980
Gathered around to observe and to relish the nakedness.

1132
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,640
And then they waited.

1133
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:42,620
They waited for the moment when she would allow the power of darkness to enter.

1134
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:47,680
The moment when the gate would open.

1135
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,380
And the old ones would come through.

1136
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:56,900
And a strange chant echoed in the night.

1137
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,440
God! Stop!

1138
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:05,900
How many more times do we have to listen?

1139
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:12,700
How many more times do we have to hear the worst song ever?

1140
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,140
This band is terrible too.

1141
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,360
They just want to fall asleep.

1142
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:23,700
Yeah, the audience is going in every different direction possible.

1143
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,140
They're sick of them.

1144
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:33,340
They're sick of the Cafe Depresso.

1145
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,780
Yeah, they're sick of everything here.

1146
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:40,100
They only know three chords.

1147
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,360
But you're only going to see them play one.

1148
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,160
Wow.

1149
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:48,000
I'm so tired of these guys.

1150
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,160
This band's bad.

1151
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:51,820
It's no surprise.

1152
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:56,240
I wish they'd just pack it up and go away.

1153
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:07,520
Well, how many times do we have to play this same song over and over and over again?

1154
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:09,680
How many more times?

1155
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:15,020
Well, how many times do we have to play these same fools?

1156
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:18,160
I'm going to play four notes over and over again.

1157
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:27,440
When I came out of this nightclub, I thought things would be a little bit different.

1158
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,440
But it's just the same old band.

1159
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,780
In the same stupid shirts.

1160
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,980
In the same stupid bleak hair.

1161
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,020
You'd think they could do something new after all these years.

1162
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,400
But they just play that same song.

1163
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:48,280
They just play that song all that long.

1164
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:59,680
Well, how many more times do we have to play this same song over and over again?

1165
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,060
This party's been spartan.

1166
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:03,640
So if you're sick of us,

1167
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:09,800
Well, it's one chord up, one chord down.

1168
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,100
Rotam music's got me down.

1169
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,820
I played in this band.

1170
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,140
For ten hours or so.

1171
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,820
I ain't seen my check.

1172
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:21,200
Where's my check?

1173
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,680
Oh, where's my check?

1174
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:34,820
Well, how many times do we have to ask for this same check over and over again?

1175
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:35,860
This party's been spartan.

1176
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,740
So if you're sick of us,

1177
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Well, how many more times do we have to play this same song over and over and over again?

1178
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,540
Over and over and over and over and over and over again.

1179
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,180
This party's been spartan.

1180
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,620
This sure is a bad band.

1181
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,580
They really won't make any money.

1182
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,160
I don't even know why they're playing here.

1183
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:02,140
Nobody likes them.

1184
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,860
Everybody wants them to play quiet.

1185
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:05,460
Yeah.

1186
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:09,100
Well, I just don't know about this band.

1187
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,760
I just don't know why they do it.

1188
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,860
Well, I guess they're supposed to be on the radio tonight.

1189
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,420
But I sure wouldn't know if I listened to this crap.

1190
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:22,260
I hope somebody out there is listening.

1191
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,460
I hope somebody can hear this band.

1192
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:29,000
It's at the international signal of distress.

1193
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,360
The poor Rotam band.

1194
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,040
These guys.

1195
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:37,880
They came all this way.

1196
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,800
Nobody wants to hear them.

1197
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:47,520
Well, how many more times do we have to play this band, Mom?

1198
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,400
Here I am.

1199
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:50,800
Stop that.

1200
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:02,860
What caused it?

1201
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:03,920
I wish I knew.

1202
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:09,580
Uh-oh.

1203
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:10,380
She died.

1204
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:12,520
Doctors from Bob must have got her sold.

1205
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:25,580
They received the handling order.

1206
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,160
That's the thing.

1207
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,180
Erik's sore lower possible ofивает the

1208
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:42,180


1209
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:42,740
I can assure you I have to do it a couple of times.

1210
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:42,740


1211
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:44,860
he got in, but I know that at some point

1212
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,960
Bob was in there later on.

1213
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,220
He was

1214
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:50,340
kicked out, but

1215
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:52,420
he moved up, you might say.

1216
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,040
Yeah, of course, you could call it moving up.

1217
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:55,760
Yeah, right.

1218
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:58,700
Or getting a

1219
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,760
priapism, you know, an erection that won't

1220
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:01,180
go away.

1221
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:04,800
There's no established date for any of those,

1222
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:06,760
you know. I think Bob's probably going to

1223
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,880
show up someplace right in the middle of one of those

1224
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,380
meetings at the tombs.

1225
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:11,900
Bob will show up.

1226
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,220
All the old bones men will all be around.

1227
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,520
Bob will show up to deal with the men from

1228
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,560
Planet X on July 5th, 1998.

1229
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:20,360
The original bones men, yeah.

1230
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:22,660
That's right. I'm marking them now

1231
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:24,520
in the little book. July

1232
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,420
5th, you're saying? As a

1233
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:28,600
janitor working in a

1234
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,440
future time control lab, I

1235
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,420
assure you that Bob

1236
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:34,660
will arrive on July 5th, 1998.

1237
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,420
For he cometh prematurely

1238
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,480
into a time which is more

1239
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,500
than night.

1240
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,560
I say this to ensure

1241
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,600
disbelief.

1242
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:45,820
Disbelief well noted

1243
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:46,720
and enacted.

1244
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:47,940
You must believe.

1245
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:49,220
Believe

1246
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,180
me out of it.

1247
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,720
Bob said.

1248
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,500
Keep your pipe on tight.

1249
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:59,880
I just can't understand what you're

1250
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:00,980
talking about. Keep your back to the wind.

1251
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:03,120
You're just always babbling and babbling

1252
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:03,940
about bodily.

1253
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:07,080
And you're sacking the Sibian.

1254
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:08,540
And then you get out in my house.

1255
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:19,720
And then you get out in my house.

1256
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,780
You are listening to the Hour of Slack

1257
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:44,040
from the Church of the Subgenius.

1258
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,160
For details, see

1259
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,240
The Book of the Subgenius

1260
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,340
in better bookstores everywhere or

www.subgenius.com

1262
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:55,480
This music in the background

1263
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,060
is by Doctors for Bob.

1264
