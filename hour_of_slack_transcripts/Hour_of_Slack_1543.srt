1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
I got to thinking about something.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,420
Yes, dear?

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,240
A new and wondrous thing.

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,700
The finest dignity and elegance.

5
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,560
What is it?

6
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,040
The subgenius power of watching.

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,720
What a wonderful idea.

8
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:14,240
Oh.

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:14,780
Oh.

10
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:15,440
Uh.

11
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,620
Uh, Bob.

12
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,260
Oh, yes.

13
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:19,860
Right.

14
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:21,740
Test.

15
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,060
Whoa.

16
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,860
Test, test, test.

17
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,720
Test, test, test, test, test, test, test, test.

18
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,320
Oh, I have to start the CD.

19
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,060
Chuck, chuck, chuck.

20
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,380
450 B.C.

21
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,740
Testicles, the tautologist.

22
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,880
Testicles!

23
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:40,980
Testicles!

24
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:41,600
Testicles!

25
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,820
Yes, the undescended.

26
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,460
Ah, yes.

27
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:48,820
Dear friends.

28
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,220
He that feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh

29
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:58,040
and made his servants and cattle free in the house.

30
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,700
Yes, he loved them.

31
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:58,700


32
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,220
He let cattle into his house.

33
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,640
He was a disturbed individual.

34
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,240
And that's why you're here.

35
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,760
He was an animal husbandry.

36
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,240
For Hour of Slack radio show number 1,500 and something.

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,760
Once again, that's Wisteria.

38
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,000
Community campground.

39
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,940
Caffeine's Cosmic Cafe.

40
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,720
Dr. Philodrum is with us this afternoon.

41
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,020
And Dr. Owlet Owl.

42
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,360
Hey, back at you.

43
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,740
At Subgenius Mind Control Experiment number 2203

44
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,940
at Exist Harvest Point on Ex Day Eve.

45
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:43,840
And I don't know about you, but I'm pretty excited about all those benefits we're going to receive.

46
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,080
Yes, friends.

47
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,460
We've done so many of the traditional activities.

48
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:58,220
We just got back from the baptism, which was much more successful than I had.

49
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:58,340
Yes.

50
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,840
We got back from the baptism, which was much more successful than I had anticipated.

51
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:04,420
Because normally, most subgeniuses are scared to go into the woods,

52
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,320
much less into that strange water full of life.

53
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,260
But they did.

54
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,020
And coated with walnut oil, which has not left some of us,

55
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,660
if indeed that is what it is.

56
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,100
There's still argument as to what that strange substance is on the surface of the water,

57
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,520
which is there even before the baptism.

58
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,480
Well, we'll find out if it changes us.

59
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,260
Mm-hmm.

60
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:28,260


61
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:34,760
Or tomorrow, because tomorrow we all have to get up at 6 in the morning or stay up all night.

62
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,840
We meet at the stone circle down the road, which is the circle made of stone.

63
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,200
Also known as the landing field.

64
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,200
And the turtle mound.

65
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,220
Well, the turtle mound is over there to honor old Sequel,

66
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,260
but it's not where we're going to assemble.

67
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,340
Stang is just throwing that in to be complete.

68
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,160
Yes, there is the giant turtle mound signified,

69
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,260
the nearby presence of a giant turtle.

70
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,900
But he, too, will be seized up in the rupture of X-Day

71
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:10,780
and ascend like a sparking, flying Gamera to the Empyrean.

72
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,720
As will all of us, or we'll die trying.

73
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,840
I am so ready. Aren't you guys ready for this?

74
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,940
Well, I hope to be safe inside the vessel

75
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,180
and not subjected to explosive decompression outside.

76
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,440
That would be no pleasant X-Day ascension.

77
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,880
I have a saucer built for 15.

78
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,380
I'm ready to see my whole comic book collection in one place at the same time.

79
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,360
That could happen.

80
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,420
Including all the ones you lost, right?

81
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,600
Including all the ones I lost, because they'll be waiting for me on the pleasure saucers.

82
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,900
But compressed into subatomic space.

83
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,320
That's in the boilerplate.

84
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,620
No, you put water on them and they, you know, expand into...

85
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,480
I understood it was something like that.

86
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,420
They can be reformed, they say.

87
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,060
I don't like that compressed into subatomic space.

88
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:07,900
Well, they're carrying the equivalent of many planets of cargo in these things

89
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,120
and that's the way they deal with it.

90
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,400
I thought they were really planets.

91
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,200
So deal with it.

92
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,880
They are, but they, you know, they've got a lot of stuff

93
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,420
and they'll have a lot more when they leave this junket.

94
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,940
Aren't you taking the Grand Canyon and so forth and so on?

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,500
Among other things.

96
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,140
All that stuff has to be in there.

97
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,840
there also. And when I say I'm taking the Grand Canyon, that doesn't mean I'm taking the hole

98
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,780
in the earth. That means I have to take a very large chunk of earth with it to display the

99
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,820
grandeur. You have to get the headwaters of the Colorado in there, the little Colorado.

100
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:50,500
Can I make a suggestion? Please do. That's what it's all about. I'll just put it like this.

101
00:04:51,260 --> 00:05:00,200
Bottle City of Kandor. I was just thinking of that. You see, Superman, the capital of the

102
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:08,080
planet Krypton in Superman's parents' time was Kandor, a mighty city. But the evil robot Brainiac

103
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:15,000
shrunk it down to lower and smaller than model train tabletop size. Superman kept the city,

104
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:20,480
still viable, in his Fortress of Solitude. But what not everybody knows is...

105
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:28,300
In some later on labyrinth of the eternally unreeling, inane Superman story, he restored the

106
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:35,420
city to its full size on a different planet. So there was again a planet of Kryptonians in the

107
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:40,800
universe. And Superman and Supergirl, who was also of Kryptonian origin, used to go there for a

108
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:48,960
vacation. But then an unfortunate thing happened. Shot from some hack writer's loaded quid, the

109
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,480
reconstitution...

110
00:05:50,500 --> 00:06:02,980
The reconstituted city of Kandor slipped into another dimension where it is now irretrievable. And the Bottle City of Kandor in Superman's Fortress of Solitude is a replica.

111
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,320
What?

112
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,700
It is...

113
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,240
That's sacrilege.

114
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,760
It's in the top comic in the stack of your comics that we brought to sell at the Bulldata auction.

115
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,500
Yeah, I was going to point out to you that there's a Superman comic there.

116
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,740
You can buy that issue, folks, when we do the Bulldata auction. But that's just a preview.

117
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,440
It'll be a fabulous interest to come.

118
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,340
I knew there was some tie-in later on.

119
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,680
Well...

120
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,600
What comes around...

121
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,640
One would think so.

122
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,560
The web of synchronicity draws ever tighter.

123
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:43,580
We're going to have to combine the Bulldata auction with the long duration marriage, the short duration marriage, the taco filling pot party, the pot party, the taco party...

124
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,000
No one would stand for that.

125
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:45,620
And the...

126
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,840
What's something else? Oh, the costume ball.

127
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,720
The costume ball.

128
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:49,720


129
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:49,720


130
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,280
For which the theme is spies.

131
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,400
Yes.

132
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,160
And if you didn't bring a costume, see me.

133
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:55,900
Smart spy.

134
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:01,040
Because I have costumes for a dozen people. Sort of spy.

135
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,660
Spy outfits you have?

136
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,620
Well, if there's a dozen people wearing them, then yeah, that will be a spy outfit.

137
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,140
Well, you'll see.

138
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:10,320
You'll see.

139
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,640
A secret spy, because nobody...

140
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,040
You won't...

141
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,520
Only those dozen people will know.

142
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,260
How will they know to come to me to get them? Because I'll have this disguise on, see.

143
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:31,200
Whatever disguise there's more than one of, ask one of those. And one of them will be me. Or at least it's not a Bob mask. That would be creepy.

144
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,040
We've done the very first...

145
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,420
We had that, though.

146
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:49,700
...subgenius convention. We made paper Bob masks and about 20 or 30 subgeniuses went to Dealey Plaza, because it happened to be Kennedy Day, November 22nd, when all the conspiracy buffs and theorists, let's call them, were there.

147
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:49,700


148
00:07:49,700 --> 00:08:02,340
We're down at Dealey Plaza, and there's always lots of cameras. There's a camera crew covering subgenius, Showtime, What's Up America. The only decent TV report ever done on us, the very first one.

149
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:15,600
And friends, it's a creepy, horrifying sight to watch a city street filled with people wearing Bob masks. It's creepy, I tell you, creepy. I still have nightmares about it.

150
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,480
In addition to the full over-the-head Bob mask, we also have...

151
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:26,340
We have available the Mitt Romney mask, which looks sort of like Bob, and especially if you stick a pipe in there.

152
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,500
Yeah, it looks like a loser trying to look like Bob.

153
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,780
Well, nonetheless, we have it. And so, come see Ivan about...

154
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:41,400
I don't see any of those in the audience. Usually there's at least one well-dressed guy with a straight haircut and a pipe who wants to kind of look like Bob.

155
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,380
Well...

156
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,580
It was Reverend Dapper a few times.

157
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,480
Yeah, Reverend Dapper.

158
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,400
What happened to that guy?

159
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,460
He didn't seem to have any hair.

160
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:49,460


161
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,260
He was in Jamaica this year.

162
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,860
Oh, I wish his mom would come back. She was hot.

163
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,920
His mom also was here?

164
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,580
Yeah, I liked...

165
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,040
He brought his mom with him?

166
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,240
His parents brought him. He's really young.

167
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,780
Now I understand many things.

168
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,060
They had a good time. It was an educational festival.

169
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,280
It was. It's educational for me, I'll have to say, each time.

170
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,520
They were doing the conspiracy thing, right?

171
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,960
What do you mean?

172
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,980
Checking out all the various conspiracies I understand from...

173
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,340
Reverend Nicky, that that's a new...

174
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,940
A new...

175
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,020
A field of study.

176
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,900
A new course of study.

177
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,980
Oh, well, yeah, she's a professional...

178
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:34,060
She's the one that separates the real conspiracies from the fake conspiracies.

179
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:45,720
It took a subgenius to make conspiracy crackpot study into a legitimate college academic butchery juror.

180
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,300
I'm going to put a weight on that.

181
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:53,860
Reverend Lee Cipher managed to get a... to pull one over on the pink eyes of the pink-eyed pinks.

182
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,040
Yeah, that is shocking.

183
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,300
And the University of something in Virginia.

184
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:03,500
And he got a doctorate to talk... using big fancy words to talk about churches and subgenius.

185
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,500
I never thought I'd see the day.

186
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,060
Never seen anything like it.

187
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,620
I couldn't understand half what he said.

188
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,740
And his doctorate... they don't spell doctor with a K either.

189
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,060
Well, that's a different kind of doctor.

190
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,820
They're the kind that get paid.

191
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,980
You know, you can analyze something out of existence.

192
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,880
Just meant to be pure entertainment.

193
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,380
There's my progeny.

194
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:35,860
Yeah, I could hear her with that strange horn off in the woods.

195
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,500
It's called a vuvuzela.

196
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,600
You know, they went down to the pond...

197
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,340
Eight-year-old Lily Drummond and her mom went down to the pond early...

198
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,280
so that they wouldn't see the Bob Tinsley.

199
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,380
And so they could stir up all that walnut oil.

200
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,980
Because I had said, well, you know, there may be a bunch of...

201
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,120
there may be a few naked fat guys down there.

202
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,120
And Lily said, Russ.

203
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,220
Well, you missed the naked fat guy-a-thon.

204
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,160
Oh, the Field of House of Fairy pile.

205
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,120
There are fairies.

206
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,140
There are fairies.

207
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:09,940
She saw fairies?

208
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,460
Just on the other side of the water.

209
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,680
Real fairies?

210
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,260
Yes, you go there and they've got stuff all over the tree.

211
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:17,260


212
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,700
They're all over the trees, fastening it together.

213
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,720
Filmy, magical...

214
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,240
You'll have to show me later, you know.

215
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,600
Well, I'm not sure...

216
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,260
I was never sure whether I was supposed to be there.

217
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,760
Well, she had the butterfly net, right?

218
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,920
Did she catch any?

219
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,280
I forgot the butterfly net.

220
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,220
Oh, I was hoping for a pixie on a stick.

221
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,760
She took the vuvuzela instead.

222
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,240
It's one of my favorite meals.

223
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,600
The horns of Elfland.

224
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,240
Oh, that's an interesting thing to...

225
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,800
A little-bottled butterfly.

226
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,460
A blue-bottled butterfly.

227
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,220
Do those taste good?

228
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,540
You can make coffee out of them.

229
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

230
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,880
They're good.

231
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,320
I have to ask that.

232
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:47,940
I'm not sure.

233
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,460
I'm okay.

234
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,160
I've heard the fairies are pretty good when they're barbecued.

235
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,180
You can meet them.

236
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,840
You can meet them, Stang.

237
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,780
You can go over there.

238
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,080
I have encountered them.

239
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,360
I'm scared to death of supernatural beings.

240
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,720
They use the pond, too.

241
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,140
I got in trouble because I said they weren't real.

242
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:08,920
So...

243
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,860
I've encountered them.

244
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,440
They are there.

245
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,600
Their encampment lies just beyond the pond on the other side.

246
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,520
I confess my sin.

247
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,820
I do now believe I have been brought into the fold.

248
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,200
You and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

249
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:23,600
Right.

250
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,180
Yeah, that guy believed damn near anything, apparently.

251
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,140
Me and the monkey.

252
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:33,020
I think that the guy that wrote Sherlock Holmes would have a little bit more of a skeptical bone in his body.

253
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,680
By Jove, Holmes, how the deuce do you deduce such fantastic deductions?

254
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,860
Well, it's like...

255
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,020
Hadn't he ever heard of Photoshop?

256
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,720
He'd look at the pictures of fairies.

257
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,860
They were just cut-out pictures of fairies.

258
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,840
They were just pictures of girls with wings, plainly glued onto another scene.

259
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,400
Or maybe...

260
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,760
The guy who wrote Sherlock Holmes thought that was real.

261
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,560
Had he not ever heard of Photoshop?

262
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,540
Well, you know, editing...

263
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:02,380
Maybe when fairies manifest in our world, they look like two-dimensional cut-outs mounted in the grass on sticks.

264
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,600
The editing anomalies...

265
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,340
It's just part of their protective coloration, so you won't give them any credence.

266
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,580
Nature has given them this ability.

267
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:15,280
Back in those days, you know, they were willing to accept a higher level of editing anomalies in there.

268
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,660
That's why I used the

269
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:24,700
Is that why you can only see those entities called the orbs on pictures?

270
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,980
The orbs?

271
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,840
You never see them in your eyesight?

272
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,160
Unless you're a jet pilot.

273
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,140
You take a picture in a dusty place at night.

274
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,980
God, there's all these angels shaped like dust loads.

275
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,440
Dusty place? Yeah, dust.

276
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,680
They disguised themselves as dust particles lit by a flash.

277
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,140
Do you remember Roswell rods?

278
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,960
Only the New Agers.

279
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,500
Oh, I see what I'm missing.

280
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,960
Oh, yeah, the rods.

281
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,220
I had a friend who told me about them.

282
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,340
He should have known better because he was a videographer.

283
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,340
Every now and then, a frame of videotape, you'll get this odd little black.

284
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,220
It's just an artifact.

285
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,340
It's an electronic.

286
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,080
Nothing supernatural about it.

287
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,820
Well, apparently those are rods caught.

288
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,580
These rods, I don't know, are they from another dimension?

289
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,600
No, they move at a certain speed that can only be caught on video.

290
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:20,520
And they wiggle at a certain frequency that is only caught in strange ways

291
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,760
when the video is shooting into deep holes or something.

292
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,640
Those superstitious dummies.

293
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,080
But the whole time, there's something much more impressive going on.

294
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,140
Every bit of grain of the film is actually a tiny dog set.

295
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:33,480
Yeah.

296
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,800
If you look at it with an electron microscope.

297
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,880
So there's much more of our type of supernatural crap going on than theirs.

298
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,120
I have close-ups of those Dobbs heads.

299
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,100
Actually, I have close-ups of them around here.

300
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,100
I think we've all seen the footage.

301
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,380
No, they're in stickers.

302
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,720
I have stickers out there.

303
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,320
Oh, right. That's right.

304
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,020
Little stickers. Those are close-ups.

305
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,000
Weren't you going to pass those out to the people after they pass out?

306
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,000
Yeah, after they pass out, I'll give you each a sticker.

307
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,720
I also have...

308
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,320
People have been giving me gifts.

309
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,920
But I have some gifts for the musicians here

310
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,920
that are on the new Bob Song albums,

311
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,200
which so far only exist online.

312
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,840
Except for right here.

313
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:19,720
I have hand-labeled copies of Bob Song 7 and Bob Songs 8.

314
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,200
I need to give them to people like...

315
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,000
Are you going to offer those in the Bulldada auction?

316
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,220
And you, because they're swinging love courses.

317
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,580
No, they're for the participants.

318
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,760
I will auction off...

319
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,560
Three sets.

320
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,340
Okay.

321
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,780
If we get around to that.

322
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,000
That's going to be a crowd-pleaser, I can tell.

323
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,320
Well, look at them.

324
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,080
They're going nuts.

325
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,420
They're absolutely...

326
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:43,960
Oh, my God.

327
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,820
I better turn the volume down.

328
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,500
The applause is so loud.

329
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,200
The laughter.

330
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,340
I'm going...

331
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:49,900
I'm deafened.

332
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,900
Yes, you swing the camera over the crowd a few times and say,

333
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,740
Now we want applause.

334
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,620
Now we want applause and the laughter.

335
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:58,620
Okay.

336
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,760
Hey, what do you call it when you put your selfie stick on backwards?

337
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,600
Uh, you've got me, Doc.

338
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,540
It's unselfie, right?

339
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,080
Is that...

340
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,900
Look at that bird that just flew in.

341
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,020
That doesn't look real.

342
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,080
It looks like a robot.

343
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,820
My friend was telling me that all the birds were really NSA robots.

344
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,340
The new droid bot.

345
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:17,980
I don't think...

346
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,360
Hey, be careful what you say.

347
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,660
I'm not sure that's a real bird.

348
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,940
It's hovering in a strange way in that metallic sheen on its feathers.

349
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,080
It must be the NSA.

350
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:28,720
Exactly.

351
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,640
That's what my friend...

352
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,100
I thought she was crazy when she told me that.

353
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,380
But now I see...

354
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,400
I know what she was talking about.

355
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,300
That's not really a bald-headed eagle.

356
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,460
The National Sales Academy?

357
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,920
Well, I'm used to being followed...

358
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,540
Bald-headed eagles don't hover like that.

359
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:41,980
That's...

360
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,920
The puzzling evidence drone...

361
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,340
That's got to be...

362
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,860
Obama must be behind that.

363
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,640
...is what I'm used to being followed by.

364
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,480
Or Obabo.

365
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,040
Obama.

366
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,760
Yeah, no.

367
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,060
What?

368
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,820
The puzzling evidence?

369
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,180
The puzzling evidence drone that...

370
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,740
But it makes a sound.

371
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,720
It sounds like a hive of insects nearby.

372
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,940
Oh, did he finally get one of those?

373
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,440
Yes.

374
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,080
It went with us on our camping trip.

375
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,140
I meant to bring it down here today.

376
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:03,600
And...

377
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,680
Northern California and Southern Oregon.

378
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,600
On the saucers, of course.

379
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,380
And it's in the station when we do the show.

380
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,440
Shrieking and buzzing and flying around.

381
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,240
It's a drone with a camera on it?

382
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:17,600
Yeah.

383
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,880
Well, that's going to be pretty unimpressive on a giant flying saucer.

384
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,160
Well, it's just...

385
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,280
What would be the point?

386
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,320
Irresistible.

387
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,520
You can't help fooling...

388
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,780
You just got to keep the people...

389
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,140
Keep the people busy.

390
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,360
Keep the people busy.

391
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,040
And it's your new favorite toy.

392
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:34,860
Right.

393
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,580
Maybe it has hidden functions.

394
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,320
There's also that possibility.

395
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,200
You can spy on the other floors, the other decks, you know, so to speak.

396
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,920
We'll call them decks on a saucer.

397
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,100
You know, we don't call them floors.

398
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,140
There's a lot of them.

399
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,900
Several dozen of them.

400
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,080
We're about to get into another doctrinal argument about whether it's saucers or planets

401
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,020
and whether there's just one or everybody gets their own.

402
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,820
But all will be made plain within 24 hours.

403
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,940
We won't get into the argument.

404
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,760
If we each get a different escape vessel, there's going to be a gunfight over the Grand Canyon.

405
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,820
I know that for sure.

406
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:12,760
Just the fact that I said I wanted it, that means there's going to be five subgeniuses

407
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,440
trying to beat me to it no matter what.

408
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,440
Well, I won't be one of them.

409
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,540
And I've also got to pick up the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.

410
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,300
Right.

411
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,000
Smithsonian, blah, blah, woof, woof.

412
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,920
You've seen the list.

413
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,360
It's printed on the brochure.

414
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,040
So there won't be any arguments.

415
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,260
Have you ever thought about maybe they'll just be there for you when you get there?

416
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,280
That's what's supposed to happen, yeah.

417
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,800
You don't actually have to.

418
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,020
You know, worry about it.

419
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,120
That's what's supposed to happen, yeah.

420
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,040
After they've been reconsulted.

421
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:45,240
There's all kinds of stuff that was supposed to happen and that I've had faith about for, oh, let's see now, about 18 years.

422
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,720
Well, just keep the faith, brother.

423
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,620
Yeah.

424
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,780
That's right, Stan.

425
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,280
We're all looking to you to keep us from backsliding.

426
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,240
We'll be here tomorrow.

427
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,780
Just a few hours.

428
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,060
Reverend Chris Lee, I thought he was dead.

429
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:01,820
I normally destroy my wife.

430
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,800
Oh, my God.

431
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,700
He rises again.

432
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,640
Reverend Chris Lee has returned from the grave.

433
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,580
Look, he's got, what are you carrying on that?

434
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,000
There can be more Dracula movies and Lord of the Rings movies now.

435
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,240
Look, he's got light cream.

436
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,300
Thank you.

437
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,140
He's got other cream.

438
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,080
And I have a measuring cup.

439
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,180
Oh, here, Stan, right.

440
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:23,740
There you go.

441
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,660
The show hosts have been delivered.

442
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,080
Wow.

443
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,540
Getting show coffee.

444
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,960
Oh, I see.

445
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,560
Fine metal camp.

446
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:36,580
Bugs.

447
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,680
Oh, no, this light cream will be just fine.

448
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,580
Light cream will be okay.

449
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,740
No need to open that 40 gallon bag.

450
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,880
So this is what we call the coffee break portion of the show.

451
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:45,220
Right.

452
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:49,380
This is the best show that you'll ever see.

453
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,240
Yeah, this is the reward we get.

454
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,460
Man, thank you so much.

455
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,220
I was needing that.

456
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,000
I wasn't eating it as much as that food you gave us.

457
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,360
Nice hat, Susie.

458
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:01,920
Thank you.

459
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,740
You're still a little bit lighter.

460
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,220
Yeah, that's like a 49 bladed windbreaker.

461
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:09,580
That hat, you stand next to her, you'll stay cool as long as the wind's blowing.

462
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,860
You'll be cool as long as you're standing next to her.

463
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,440
That's right.

464
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,500
That's all it takes.

465
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,460
She's making hand signals.

466
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,440
She's making hand signals.

467
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,980
Wrap it up.

468
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,460
It's slowed down.

469
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,100
Is that the wrap it up, this louder and funnier?

470
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:29,940
No, she's dancing to the jazz music here at the Freeform Club at Wisteria.

471
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,400
More now.

472
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,200
Yeah.

473
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,540
She's dancing to the jazz music.

474
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,020
By the way-

475
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:34,660
Everything now.

476
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:43,420
The jazz music in the background happens to be the Monster Hunter game themes done

477
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,420
in big band jazz style.

478
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,760
Isn't that precious, ladies and gentlemen?

479
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,680
I brainwash you people so heavily.

480
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,100
And you know I haven't gotten to play Monster Hunter once this whole time.

481
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,020
There's three other hunters here.

482
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,960
Coincidence or conspiracy?

483
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,760
I haven't had a single chance, but maybe tonight while the bands are playing-

484
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,440
Something's wrong.

485
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,680
Something's really, really wrong.

486
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,440
Something's terribly wrong.

487
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,300
Something's happening here.

488
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,260
Something has happened to her headphones.

489
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,580
I don't have headphones on.

490
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,760
I just noticed that.

491
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,200
Well, you need to put them on, Sarge.

492
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,760
Oh, that's because the other- can you hand me that green bag?

493
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,580
The sock.

494
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,940
I knew something wasn't right.

495
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,220
Something just didn't seem right.

496
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,540
You couldn't hear the- it took you a while to notice, didn't it?

497
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,600
Well, you started talking about the background music and I realized I didn't hear any.

498
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,400
So then I-

499
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:31,900
And I thought-

500
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:31,900


501
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:31,900


502
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:31,900


503
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:31,900


504
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:31,900


505
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:31,900


506
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:31,900


507
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:31,900


508
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:31,900


509
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:31,900


510
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,560
Nobody else does either.

511
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,360
Our audience can't hear it either because he turns it down so low.

512
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,140
Well, you have a monitor.

513
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:38,960
Oh, you can hear it.

514
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,260
It's not that low.

515
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:39,920
Oh, okay.

516
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,800
It's not that low.

517
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,640
I check this every night.

518
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,160
I retract it.

519
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,780
Stand corrected.

520
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:50,200
My excellent hearing, I check it and if I can hear the music, anybody can hear anything.

521
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,820
Now I- I don't know.

522
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:51,720
That's right.

523
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,480
What's this- what's this channel thing you talk about, you speak of?

524
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,440
A different channel.

525
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,800
So like have a mic in the house that you- on a separate track that you could like-

526
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,340
Well, why don't you set that up?

527
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:01,800
A house mic?

528
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,600
We have the input here and we'll be-

529
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,160
A house mic?

530
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,080
There's not one.

531
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,580
Don't worry.

532
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,000
It's- we've been through this.

533
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:12,660
Believe it or not, we thought of it ourselves 25 years ago and sometimes we have the ambient

534
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,880
mic and sometimes we don't.

535
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:13,900
A house mic.

536
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,100
I knew a guy in the house named Mike once.

537
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,200
But most of the time, we don't want to hear you.

538
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,160
A many- a slip twixt the cup and lip-

539
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,100
That's the- is that what's-

540
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,740
That's why we wear the headphones, man.

541
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,400
It's so we can't hear anything but ourselves.

542
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,100
But it shows great minds run in the same track or crack.

543
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,060
They run in circles.

544
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:31,860
Oh, well, they do.

545
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,340
They do that too.

546
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,000
Great minds run in a crack.

547
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,220
Well, great man run in circles.

548
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:35,380
A groove.

549
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,520
How's that, man?

550
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,100
A groove.

551
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,680
A man's mind's run in a groove.

552
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,480
So, uh-

553
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,440
You see the file of how I remember your clever science?

554
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:42,960
There's plenty of business there today.

555
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,480
Like that, man run in circles.

556
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,360
I use stuff like that.

557
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:45,820
I can remember that.

558
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,420
I can remember that.

559
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,540
Beautiful summer weather at the Wisteria site.

560
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,040
That part of my brain is still intact.

561
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,860
What was that about the weather?

562
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,640
The weather, it couldn't be better.

563
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,720
Staying with, uh, sun and, uh, plenty of life-giving warmth.

564
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,880
After much squishy, wet, and dry weather, we're back in the house.

565
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:01,880


566
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:01,880


567
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,540
Soggy rain and soggy mud.

568
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,220
Now it seems that, uh, events are rocketing to their storied conclusion.

569
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,480
Climate change.

570
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,280
Climate change.

571
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,200
I got news for you.

572
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:12,660
Guess what?

573
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,720
It gets cold in winter and hot in summer.

574
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,240
Yeah, climate change is duh.

575
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,740
Who cares about climate change, you know?

576
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:18,960
Well, that's an alternate opinion.

577
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:26,720
We're gonna have some serious climate change between 6.59 a.m. tomorrow and 7.01.

578
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,980
Yes, this may be the-

579
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,860
It will go from, oh, 64 degrees and a little bit muggy.

580
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,800
To 7,000 degrees.

581
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,040
150,000 degrees and pure magma eruptions.

582
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,480
Nah, just kidding.

583
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,660
I think that would be jumping the guns.

584
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:43,780
Excessive.

585
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,220
That's one-

586
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,720
Killing them's too good for them.

587
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,480
That's just one course of action.

588
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,020
We'll track it out.

589
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,820
You gotta, you know, satisfy all the ones that will be left to fry.

590
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,360
But it's true.

591
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,440
The old order will pass away.

592
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,160
You don't wanna fry them too fast, you know?

593
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,440
You wanna stew them and cook them slowly over a roasting pit if possible.

594
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:01,860
Some, some of them are gonna be cooked.

595
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:01,860


596
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:01,860


597
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:01,860


598
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:01,860


599
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:01,860


600
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:01,860


601
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,780
Some subgeniuses are really just into it for the revenge.

602
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,260
And I'll get around to that.

603
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,080
Uh, yeah.

604
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:12,140
We do have more gorilla and demon forms here that have been filled out.

605
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:12,320
Oh, yeah.

606
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,860
Philo's never gotten to read one of those.

607
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,880
Philo should read all of them when we get to that.

608
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,480
Or maybe you'd like to do it now, Philo.

609
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,360
But, uh, these were turned in.

610
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,480
They are, are how you challenge your-

611
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,560
Why are you taking that out?

612
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,640
Oh, I've had that one before.

613
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,940
These are, are not, have not been-

614
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,120
Oh, that's the schedule in folder right there.

615
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,460
Okay, I'll take a look at these.

616
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,420
Yes, sir.

617
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,900
These are the gorillas and demons in your life-

618
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,240
In us all.

619
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,520
That make you feel bad.

620
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:41,860
I suspect that these were done by elementary schools to see, maybe bring out who's getting molested.

621
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:45,160
And there's a bad demon in grandpa's pants.

622
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,560
He touches me there.

623
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,280
That kind of thing.

624
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,520
Oh, these are, these are very interesting.

625
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,520
Well, you have to do the gorilla in a gorilla voice and the demon in a demon voice.

626
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,200
Okay.

627
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,720
Just for a hint, the gorilla sounds like legumes.

628
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,400
It's, it's-

629
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,680
It looks and sounds the same.

630
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,020
I call the one above.

631
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,240
Okay, so I should work these in now or just sort of as we go?

632
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,800
I don't have to just, just read a, a gorilla, a gorilla.

633
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,740
Well, they'll, uh, should we set this thing up?

634
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,540
There's a gorilla and a demon.

635
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,160
Yes, we just did.

636
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,300
He just explained the entire setup, so you're now free to-

637
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:22,440
Okay, I'm a little slow.

638
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,780
I just woke up from a nap.

639
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,200
Yes.

640
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,800
After, this, I might add, it was a-

641
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,900
Your interpretation will, uh-

642
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,200
Bloody Mary induced nap.

643
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,760
So, I'm putting it all back together at this point.

644
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,020
Why don't you, why don't you transform into the overman so you'll be, you know, super intelligent and everything.

645
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:36,580
Okay.

646
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,420
He never does that when it would make sense.

647
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,560
He does it when he, at parties.

648
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,560
Takes a lot of effort.

649
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,740
It takes a lot of effort.

650
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,440
Yeah.

651
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:48,200
And right now, I'm just, like I said, waking up from a nap and so my brain is reconnecting.

652
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:52,000
But the gorillas and demons in your life, this person-

653
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,320
This is in somebody's life.

654
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,060
This was in somebody's life and this is what the gorilla said.

655
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,180
What light through your eyes?

656
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:06,980
The thunder window breaks for it is the dawn and your existential is the bread of your unmaking.

657
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,700
Yeah, it's quite gorilla-like there.

658
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:21,160
Fear not, bleak of heart, for the lung batter you spit forth will clean your lackadaisical palate and you will be set free on the wings of the dark, darkest of midnights.

659
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:27,340
Weep for your soul for freedom is just another word for nothing left to loose.

660
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,040
That's-

661
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,640
To loosen.

662
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,680
To loose.

663
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,180
Like a tight collar button.

664
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,600
Yes, freedom can always be made more free.

665
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,300
That's very profound.

666
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,180
I have to admit, that's really profound.

667
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,260
That's the kind of thing somebody's inner gorilla is always telling them.

668
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,480
You see, gorillas come to good conclusions.

669
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,720
It just takes them a long, longer time to formulate them.

670
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,080
Now, here's what the demon says.

671
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:49,480
Thank you so much.

672
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:49,480


673
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,800
And I'm supposed to use a different voice on this one, okay?

674
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,580
So-

675
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,660
All right.

676
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,900
I appreciate that.

677
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,500
Thank you.

678
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,580
Demons sound sort of like witches.

679
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,020
Hey, what?

680
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,020


681
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,020


682
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,020


683
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,020


684
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,020


685
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,020


686
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,020


687
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,960
Hey, wife beaters and neck tattoos are cool.

688
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:06,840
Your dreams are the cast off awful of consumerism.

689
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:11,160
Politics are the only answer and Sith Lords are cooler than Jedi.

690
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,540
They don't love you.

691
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:19,760
They just want to eat your toast and slowly drag you down into the incestuous pits of

692
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,480
mediocrity.

693
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,020
Vince McMahon is who really runs the show with his Scientology regime.

694
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,080
That's-

695
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,040
That's a troubled individual.

696
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,260
That's a troubled individual.

697
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,180
That's the demon.

698
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:32,960
I think we're going to try to psych this person out.

699
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,960
I hate to have something like that, those kind of thoughts running through my head.

700
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:43,080
We should apply some acubating or something on that person's soul, that portion of the

701
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,480
soul that's visible in waking hours.

702
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:51,740
Okay, now this one, here we have a gorilla and the gorilla is saying, thanks for saving

703
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,320
the company.

704
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,320
I don't know what we'd do without you.

705
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,800
They must be talking about me.

706
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,060
That was what they were saying.

707
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,180
They were supposed to tell me.

708
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,360
I was suspecting that was Pisces gorilla.

709
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,580
That's what they were supposed to tell me when I left, but they never got around to

710
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:05,700
it.

711
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,360
She was here again, wasn't she?

712
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,520
Yeah.

713
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,680
There she is ignoring us now.

714
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:11,740
What?

715
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:12,800
What?

716
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,760
I think we saw the gorilla inside your head.

717
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,920
Now, here's what the demon is saying inside this person's head.

718
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:27,360
We know we have you by the balls because you're too pussy to leave.

719
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,380
Those are work-oriented inner gorillas and demons, obviously.

720
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:32,940
Yeah, obviously.

721
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,140
Poor bastard must have a job or bastardess.

722
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:38,280
Someone who's not retired or hasn't slacked off and quit their job yet.

723
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,780
You have to remember, it's not always a bastard.

724
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,460
It could be a bastarda.

725
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:49,720
Now, this one has a gorilla that speaks to his or her life in very short, succinct ways.

726
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:56,360
This one says, never have I seen such a goddamn penis biter.

727
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,360
In all my life.

728
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,220
That's what your inner gorilla says?

729
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,360
I can see why these are anonymous.

730
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:10,700
Now, this one, there's a sick, this really reveals the true depth of the sickness and

731
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,480
depravity.

732
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,820
You know by this next phrase who this person is.

733
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,200
This is what their demon is telling them.

734
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:26,480
When I masturbate, I like to think Ernest Borgnine is doing it too in his great, great

735
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:26,860
grave.

736
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,660
Rudy Schwartz, Rudy Schwartz Project.

737
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,600
There you go.

738
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,400
Rudy Schwartz Project.

739
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,920
Yeah, Ernest Borgnine.

740
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,800
He's got an Ernest Borgnine obsession.

741
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,960
I didn't know he was here.

742
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,780
I really regret this, folks.

743
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,000
I really regret this.

744
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:47,640
We only have one more of these beautiful missiles of faith to reveal.

745
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,060
More may be turned in at any time, Philo.

746
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,420
You don't have to have the gorilla drawing or the demon drawing on it.

747
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:53,960
It helps.

748
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,040
It does help, though.

749
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,420
to have the word balloon.

750
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,080
It limits your screed to

751
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,540
no longer than that very first one you read.

752
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:01,940
Right.

753
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,940
Someone is having faith problems.

754
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,640
Some poor soul is in distress.

755
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,200
They're having trouble with their faith.

756
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,360
We must minister to them.

757
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,200
We will have to administer acubating.

758
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,520
Sickening, glanscaping.

759
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,400
Acubating, sickening.

760
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,440
Glanscaping.

761
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:22,740
Glanscaping and nostril.

762
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,420
This is a weird gorilla.

763
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,760
Okay, here's what this person,

764
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,900
this poor person is thinking,

765
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,940
the gorilla in their life is thinking,

766
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,040
I got tattooed on a drunk guy's arm one night.

767
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,600
He thought it looked tough.

768
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,980
I guess he's talking about his gorilla self.

769
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,460
It would look tough.

770
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,920
I haven't seen a gorilla tattooed to someone's arm.

771
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,260
But his demon says,

772
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,040
Oh boo hoo.

773
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,360
I got tattooed on a porn star's butthole.

774
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,860
Well, there's an idea.

775
00:30:55,040 --> 00:31:01,200
You get one of these crude drawings of a gorilla and a demon tattooed on your arm and your butthole.

776
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,460
And have your own statement there.

777
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,380
That's what that statement would look like.

778
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,980
And then regret it for the rest of your life.

779
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,220
Imagine this face on your butthole for the rest of your life.

780
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,720
Winking and leering.

781
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:20,300
Well, that part you'll have to activate yourself through your own skills.

782
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,280
Your skills on your butthole.

783
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,020
Wow.

784
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,000
Well, we've heard from the gorillas and demons.

785
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,080
But that's just to clear the air.

786
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:33,620
And now these negative thoughts, having been freely expressed, may float away.

787
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:37,540
Leaving behind our more robust satisfaction.

788
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,680
If you find one of these, you can never understand how truly good you'll feel.

789
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:47,280
Once you reveal these horrible, horrible things about yourself.

790
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,520
And have someone like me read it in front of everyone else.

791
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,700
Someone like you read it is the ultimate balm of the oil.

792
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:55,740
And troubled waters.

793
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,040
Is there an extra one in there that I forgot?

794
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:58,900
Walnut oil.

795
00:31:59,020 --> 00:31:59,240
No.

796
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,140
Well, we have some from yesterday.

797
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,660
Anything we can do to prolong this segment.

798
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,280
Which were already interpreted.

799
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,080
But we didn't get Dr. Drummond's interpretation of them.

800
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:11,760
These are yesterday's day old, but still somewhat fresh, gorilla and demon forms.

801
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,080
And not everyone who is here now was here yesterday.

802
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,060
So please enlighten us.

803
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,580
Oh, we're going to do a repeat?

804
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,920
No, these are new.

805
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,700
These are the very first ones.

806
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,040
They were done yesterday, but not by Dr. Drummond, you see.

807
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,840
And not everybody here was here yesterday.

808
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,780
I don't care.

809
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,620
They're all going to hear it on the hour slack later.

810
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:33,460
Nobody usually listens to these things when we do them live in the first place.

811
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,880
I can't believe there's this many people here.

812
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,820
Of course, most of them are playing Magic the Gathering or looking at their phones.

813
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,520
They might hear a word or two when they're momentarily distracted.

814
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,460
The Phone Lookers.

815
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,920
That would make a good new band.

816
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,380
New band name.

817
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,320
The Phone Lookers.

818
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:52,000
Well, now there speaks a former employee of the phone company.

819
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,200
What are they going to do when I'm gone?

820
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,080
Man, they're so sad.

821
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,580
The phones will stop working.

822
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,020
I feel sorry for you people.

823
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,500
The phone system is going to fall apart.

824
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:09,880
Philo used to engineer the entire conspiracy by himself, but now he's retired and he's moving in this direction.

825
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,620
I'm leaving it up to the next generation.

826
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:18,340
Well, you know, when Princess Wee left weather control and retired, that's when the weather went crazy.

827
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:23,900
I hate to tell you, but she was the only person in that office who could read and write.

828
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,260
I wish I was joking, too.

829
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,040
But, yeah, if you see what happens now on the web, huh?

830
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,240
That'd be sad if you could read but not write.

831
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,480
Like Tarzan of the Apes.

832
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,900
Only, wait a minute, he could write.

833
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,220
He just couldn't talk.

834
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:46,180
Well, or like modern day kids who can read and write in text form but not cursive.

835
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,420
Oh, we already covered that horrible sign of the end time.

836
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:53,040
There are internet millionaires who can't write their own name.

837
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:53,760
Oh, I've got something.

838
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,420
There's something actually interesting here.

839
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,300
This is this week's Athens News.

840
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,180
Thursday, July 2nd, weekend edition.

841
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,480
It's a slow news day here in Wisteria, folks.

842
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:11,520
Their big headline was about X day three years ago here.

843
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,320
Yeah, they couldn't.

844
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,940
Intolerable combination of stormy weather and intense heat.

845
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:16,220
DiRaccio.

846
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,220
DiRaccio struck three years ago.

847
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,660
Athens Countians.

848
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,860
That's a new one.

849
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:28,800
Athens Countians recalled tribulations of massive windstorm heat wave.

850
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:29,960
And it's true.

851
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:36,300
The first X day that we happen to have here at Wisteria and also I hate that phrase first X day.

852
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,140
Anyway.

853
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,860
Drill.

854
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:42,340
We were cursed but the whole Midwest had this terrible heat wave.

855
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,240
The first X day.

856
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:49,000
The power was out all in Cincinnati, Columbus and so forth.

857
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,840
Pisces says this was the second X day.

858
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:58,540
Drill that we had here that had this terrible destruction.

859
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,320
Wasn't the first.

860
00:34:59,360 --> 00:34:59,980
Three years ago.

861
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:09,660
Both the first one and the second X day drill here were beset by freak high temperatures and bad weather.

862
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:13,020
There's a power outages and so forth.

863
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,660
And storms of giant insects.

864
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:19,160
Of course, everybody got on Facebook and said, don't ever go.

865
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,480
Boy, they were so stupid.

866
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,820
They left brushwood just because Stan got butt hurt by a storm.

867
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:22,820


868
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:28,700
And they're dumb because they went to Wisteria and it's always 104 degrees every day.

869
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,060
Forever.

870
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:29,820
Forever.

871
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,600
Forever.

872
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,800
That is a minority opinion.

873
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,200
It's hotter than Texas.

874
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:34,760
Forever.

875
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,080
Well it was indeed true that it was that hot.

876
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:44,580
It was so hot and so freakish that it made newspaper headlines three years ago just because they were so.

877
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,720
Well, it was also that hot in Texas too.

878
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,920
It was twice as hot in Texas.

879
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,720
Give me a break.

880
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,220
Inside.

881
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,160
It's always that way in Texas.

882
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:52,800
That's why people are so afraid.

883
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:52,800


884
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:52,800


885
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:52,800


886
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:52,800


887
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:52,800


888
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:52,800


889
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:52,800


890
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:59,140
we're not in Texas. Inside this same newspaper, there are testimonies from many old parties about

891
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:05,040
their terrible experience when the power went out for 30 hours, then it was fixed, people bought

892
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:11,040
food, put it in their freezers, then it went out for 30 more hours. But the one place that was,

893
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:17,860
the power was not cut off, was right here, the Wisteria campground. Strange but true. There was,

894
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:23,320
there wasn't power in Athens, Cincinnati, Columbus. Nobody could get on the internet.

895
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:31,780
And ice was being sold for $50 a bag. But not here. We could get, it was not a good internet

896
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:37,560
connection, but you could still get out to the outside world and we had ice. And we were told,

897
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:44,020
don't tell anybody in town that we have ice or they'll come and kill us all for it. So we did.

898
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,200
And they did. Yeah, well, how...

899
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,840
And that's why we...

900
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,040
We're all ghosts now.

901
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,900
Now you tell me.

902
00:36:53,520 --> 00:37:00,860
So, yeah, so count your blessings, friends, and tell the world it's not always 104 degrees

903
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,860
with earthquakes at Wisteria.

904
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,820
There is testimony.

905
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,560
Last year and this year, it's been quite pleasant.

906
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,820
People's individual accounts are in here. It can make you blanch with horror to read these accounts.

907
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:17,780
I was miserable. The subgeniuses were inside that stockade and you could just see them,

908
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,300
rolling around on ice.

909
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,480
The stockade.

910
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:27,120
And we couldn't get through. We machine gunned them. We rioted, but they wouldn't give us any ice.

911
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,360
Just one bag of ice, Bob. Just one bag of ice.

912
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,520
There were people out there dying, children suffering.

913
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,700
So we were caught.

914
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,940
We won't forget this, subgeniuses.

915
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,920
I couldn't stand on Facebook.

916
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,120
Yes.

917
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,700
Well, there was a lot of ire and bile left over from...

918
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,580
Yeah.

919
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,820
And people felt they were treated unfairly.

920
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:54,860
And we're still dealing with these troubled souls one at a time.

921
00:37:55,060 --> 00:38:00,100
Well, we were treated unfairly by Wotan himself, hurling thunderbolts.

922
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,640
There was a lightning strike right out there while we were trying to do this show.

923
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:11,560
And the lightning crashed and smashed its way down the dell into the current setup of the grindhouse.

924
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,920
Yeah, look. Watch this. It's so promising.

925
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:15,760
And then...

926
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,140
Holy shit.

927
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,180
Don't worry, folks.

928
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,460
I know how that thing feels.

929
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,280
So sad.

930
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,120
I know exactly how that thing feels.

931
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:30,720
So sad.

932
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,920
And so...

933
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,160
His hopes were so high.

934
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,460
If you live long enough...

935
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:39,420
If you're lucky enough to live that long, you'll see what it's like.

936
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:46,320
His thoughts were just as messed up as the next guy's.

937
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,560
But it just wasn't enough.

938
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:47,940
Enough.

939
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,280
Philo is playing with the microphone.

940
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,400
It's got a...

941
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:01,140
The mic stand has kind of a limp brace to it where it's flexible.

942
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,020
It's not stiff enough.

943
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,140
Oh, yeah. This doesn't come through on the radio.

944
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,380
Well, that's just the sort of thing that we do back home.

945
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,060
I have a good visual gag, though.

946
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:14,040
On our other shows back at home, Philo is known for his manipulation of the microphone.

947
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,560
And other things that I'd rather not mention.

948
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,080
Self-manipulating.

949
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,220
As is Michael Pepe.

950
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,620
Manipulative fellow that he is.

951
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,300
Another microphone manipulator.

952
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,220
He's just like a monkey.

953
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:28,600
You see, when a mic is hot, as we say in the recording trade,

954
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,200
when you're handling it and bumping it around,

955
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:37,060
it translates into a whole bunch of sounds which you'd rather not have on your program

956
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,880
because they're a distraction and incomprehensibility factor.

957
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:47,060
Or you can add sound effects in post, as we usually do.

958
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:51,880
I can tell I accidentally left this on automatic volume level.

959
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,120
What does that imply?

960
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:57,840
When I hit this thing and made a lot of noise, everything else went real quiet for a second.

961
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,300
Oh, I wondered about that.

962
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:07,560
Normally, I use it at a manual recording level so that when something's too loud, it just destroys the sound completely.

963
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:14,420
I thought all this palaver about power outages had given us a jinx and we were being momentarily subjected to one.

964
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,720
No, no.

965
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,560
That was me illustrating.

966
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:23,340
At any rate, there will be power for all tomorrow when the saucers descend.

967
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:30,560
And this may be the last bag of all-natural tortilla chips in the world.

968
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,760
I think we better do it now.

969
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,200
We'll do that bag now.

970
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,700
It's for the taco party.

971
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,460
But go ahead.

972
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,220
Rip it open.

973
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,580
Oh, yeah, the taco party.

974
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,260
Let joy be unconfined.

975
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,840
What about the taco party?

976
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,060
That happens in half an hour or so.

977
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,200
It's a coming, folks.

978
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,760
There's going to be a taco.

979
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:52,600
I think the thing about this is the stuff you put in the taco.

980
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,140
That's the variability in this.

981
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:57,620
You bring your own taco filling and improvise.

982
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:03,560
I was going to bring my famous octopus taco filling, but I didn't get time to prepare it.

983
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,300
Who kept you back?

984
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,840
We're doing this stupid show.

985
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,920
That's what kept me back.

986
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:08,360
Damn it.

987
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:16,580
Send a speedy messenger in a golf cart up to gather all the taco fittings.

988
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,400
Taco fittings.

989
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,820
Well, here's the other problem.

990
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:26,840
While that is going on, there's also a wedding and then the Bobby Awards and so forth.

991
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,160
Hey, this has a coming.

992
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:35,620
I'll just curl up and rip open my can of pulpo and eat it all by myself.

993
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:42,940
Staying with the salty tentacle juice dripping down from his jaws and the tears dripping down from above

994
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:46,820
as he contemplates the evils of an unforgiving world.

995
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:47,880
But her.

996
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,700
I didn't grow enough butt cheeks last year.

997
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,520
I need more butt cheeks grown.

998
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,880
Now, it has been announced that there was going to be an Ask Dr. Hal show, but I guess there is not.

999
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:58,640
Well, no.

1000
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,520
We were going to do Ask Dr. Hal for people who didn't get a chance to ask you yesterday.

1001
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,300
Oh, okay.

1002
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,200
Well, we can do that.

1003
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:04,940
Hold on.

1004
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,080
We didn't want to.

1005
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,120
We got Philo here.

1006
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,560
I was too tricked.

1007
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:08,880
I was.

1008
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:09,660
What?

1009
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:09,860
Huh?

1010
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,120
What?

1011
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:17,300
But we are going to do the Bulldog auction in a limited fashion to take up the slack up to the.

1012
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,320
Hold on.

1013
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,340
Let me just get the Dr. Hal slips.

1014
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,500
The special Dr. Hal slips.

1015
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,240
See if anybody has a question.

1016
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,620
Yeah, yeah.

1017
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,520
You got to have a question.

1018
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:26,900
A question.

1019
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,640
Are we doing an Ask Dr. Hal minute?

1020
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,180
Yeah.

1021
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,100
A minute would probably be.

1022
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:36,240
An Ask Dr. Hal minute injected into this portion of the show.

1023
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:40,980
In the show back at home, we at the end come something like this called the speed round

1024
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:47,080
where they play this music and then I have to give instant answers in a few seconds to questions.

1025
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:47,300
Questions.

1026
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:47,380
But.

1027
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:50,900
I don't think we're going to do that here.

1028
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,380
Still didn't answer that question of mine.

1029
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,080
Everyone's too tired.

1030
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,600
And what question of that was that, Philo?

1031
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,700
What does a booger smell like?

1032
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,140
I mean, it's already in your nose.

1033
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:01,740
What?

1034
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,140
You know, I mean, what is it?

1035
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,500
How are you going to smell it?

1036
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,420
It smells like everything else that passes into your nose air for most people.

1037
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:13,980
Somebody handed me something that smelled so good a little while ago that I wanted to keep it in my nose.

1038
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,240
Oh, yeah.

1039
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,200
It's interesting that wherever you go.

1040
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:26,900
In this great land of ours, the consistency of your booger is different depending on your geographic location.

1041
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:36,560
I've noticed that since I've been here in southern Ohio that the consistency has shifted into a different realm.

1042
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,200
Chewier.

1043
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:45,760
Not everybody got to ask Dr. Hal yesterday, but most people did.

1044
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,180
We had a lot of questions.

1045
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:47,400
We had a lot of questions.

1046
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,600
Went on for over an hour.

1047
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:52,940
I'm not going to baby you people or enable you anymore.

1048
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,600
So, and I'm not going to come around and say, do you want a piece of paper?

1049
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:11,940
You come up here, get the piece of paper, write your name down, and stick it up here with a tip, and you will get an answer commensurate with the cleverness of your question.

1050
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,900
Yes, we love big tips here.

1051
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,080
The great big tip.

1052
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,980
Well, look at the stampede.

1053
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,400
I guess they all had their questions.

1054
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,740
They've all asked Dr. Hal a lot of times.

1055
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:26,880
They had their questions that they thought about their whole lives.

1056
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,500
Not everyone, Philo.

1057
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,320
There are still some who failed to do that.

1058
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,760
Some people don't have any questions.

1059
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,180
You know, they just go through life.

1060
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,280
They think they already know it.

1061
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,420
They already know it.

1062
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:36,800
Or they don't.

1063
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,260
If they didn't already know it, it must not be cool.

1064
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:38,720
They're just not curious.

1065
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,600
They're just not curious.

1066
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:44,080
There's nothing about the world that has ever interested their curiosity.

1067
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,160
I don't need to know about that because if it was cool, I would already know.

1068
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:47,600
I know about it.

1069
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,020
Mm-hmm.

1070
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:48,620
Yeah.

1071
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,040
I'm going to give me one of those slips of paper.

1072
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,240
I'm going to write a question.

1073
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:53,560
Philo himself.

1074
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:54,820
Dr. Hal.

1075
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,500
Is my eyeball on straight?

1076
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,760
I want, yes, that's the kind of question you only get at X-Day.

1077
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,840
Is my eyeball on straight?

1078
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,980
A perfectly reasonable statement in context.

1079
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,520
And I would have said, which one?

1080
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,120
He would have said, my real eyeball.

1081
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:16,420
Yes.

1082
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,000
Okay.

1083
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:17,320
Okay.

1084
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:20,440
You've there given the question and the answer.

1085
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,680
I mean, put a broom in my mouth and I'll sweep the floor for you.

1086
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:31,900
One fine X-Day morn, I asked Dr. Hal a question just off the top of my head and he goes, I don't know.

1087
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,380
Now, wait a minute.

1088
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,600
I went, ah, I've got it.

1089
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,420
Write it down.

1090
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,900
So later on, I wrote it down and I handed it to him again.

1091
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:42,360
Oh, he had a long, drawn-out answer for it then.

1092
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,960
We at Ask Dr. Hal always promise to deliver an answer.

1093
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,680
It doesn't have to be the right one.

1094
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,800
That's the purpose of the whole show.

1095
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,540
You ask me a question and I give you an answer.

1096
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:53,820
That's how he tricks you.

1097
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,420
There's no trick involved.

1098
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,400
It's 100% guarantee, but it may not necessarily correlate properly.

1099
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,000
No complicated machinery to buy.

1100
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,900
No complicated facts to memorize.

1101
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,880
Your questions need not be cute or fabricated with difficulty.

1102
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:10,800
It's up to me, Dr. Hal, to make them entertaining.

1103
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:14,680
I think we should try something a little different.

1104
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:15,780
What do you mean?

1105
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,000
I think this should be...

1106
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:21,260
Give Dr. Hal the answer and he'll tell you what the question was.

1107
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:22,520
Oh, that's too hard.

1108
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:23,220
It's hot.

1109
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,920
I'm not in a mood.

1110
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:25,660
Not in a temper.

1111
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,740
Not in a giving vein for such an inversion.

1112
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,220
It's so easy.

1113
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:32,440
I mean, I could just say anything.

1114
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:34,080
I'd say peanut butter.

1115
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,720
Well, I'll tell you, dude.

1116
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:36,220
And that's the answer.

1117
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:41,220
We can make it Ask Dr. Philo and then you can see how easy it is.

1118
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,100
Yeah, that's right.

1119
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:42,700
Philo.

1120
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,100
I don't know.

1121
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:45,720
I'm scared.

1122
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,920
I don't know if I can take the question.

1123
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,520
We can play ping pong, table tennis.

1124
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:55,160
And a question that I can fling at you, you can also provide your answer, too.

1125
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,560
We can give you two answers for the price of one.

1126
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,760
First, the Hal answer, then the Philo answer.

1127
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:01,360
How's that?

1128
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,620
That would be interesting.

1129
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,280
You want to try that?

1130
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:05,960
That has never, ever been attempted before.

1131
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,420
I don't know if I can do that.

1132
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:08,260
In the entire history of...

1133
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:09,360
Well, we can try it.

1134
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,320
That will challenge my brain thinking skills to be equal to yours.

1135
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:16,720
But you already have heard the answer, so you can correct it or amend it.

1136
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:16,800
Well, that's true.

1137
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,120
Or create an alternate answer that...

1138
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:20,660
That's true.

1139
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:24,420
...ads and adumbrates and shadows with delicacy.

1140
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,580
And I'll give the dollar to whichever answer I like best.

1141
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:32,740
Oh, now you see it's actually a competitive game and a sport and far more interesting than it ever was before.

1142
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:33,280
Oh, man.

1143
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:33,920
Here's a good one.

1144
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:34,980
Here it comes.

1145
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,220
Here's the pitch.

1146
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:36,780
We'll ask Dr. Hal first.

1147
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:37,640
All right.

1148
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:38,200
I'm ready.

1149
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,100
This is going to be a good one for Philo, too.

1150
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:40,720
Here it comes.

1151
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:40,860
Okay.

1152
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:46,900
If Dr. Hal asked Dr. Hal, what would Dr. Hal say?

1153
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,360
If Dr. Hal asked Dr. Hal.

1154
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,560
It's kind of like if a woodchuck could chuck wood.

1155
00:47:55,780 --> 00:48:00,320
Well, we know that, or at least you would know that if you read my monograph on the subject,

1156
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,260
Coordinated Casting Motions in Marmotus Monax, about how much wood and so forth.

1157
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:16,120
But if Dr. Hal, which is me, the party of the first part, asked Dr. Hal, too lazy to write it twice, they put hash marks,

1158
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:20,220
what would Dr. Hal ask Dr. Hal?

1159
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,120
And it's signed Dr.

1160
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,460
Oh, good heavens.

1161
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:34,360
You see, the involuted spiral of this postmodern structure is intriguing because it suggests, like Edgar Allan Poe in Confronted by the Raven,

1162
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:40,640
that the raven was his all along and was just coming home to sit where it usually did.

1163
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:46,020
But I assure you, I did not originate this question.

1164
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,380
Someone else did.

1165
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:55,060
So I would ask, who asked this question, knowing that it was myself?

1166
00:48:55,260 --> 00:49:04,680
Because there is no greater or more deliberately important duty in all of philosophical discourse than to know thyself

1167
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:12,340
and to ask thyself the questions which otherwise go unasked and therefore unanswered.

1168
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,140
Philo?

1169
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:14,880
I see, I see.

1170
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:15,240
Okay.

1171
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,320
Okay, so the question is, what would...

1172
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:17,980
Here's the script.

1173
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:21,820
If Dr. Hal asked Dr. Hal, what would Dr. Hal ask Dr. Hal?

1174
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,220
And since I'm not Dr. Hal...

1175
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,920
Yes, you have an insight that I lack.

1176
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,620
I first have to do another little step here.

1177
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,820
I have to pretend like I'm Dr. Hal.

1178
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:30,640
Pretend like.

1179
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,520
Yeah.

1180
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,800
You pretend like you're me.

1181
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:39,920
I have to imagine what it would be like to have a brain so prodigious that no matter what the question,

1182
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:42,220
you could provide an answer.

1183
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,940
An answer that may not necessarily...

1184
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:49,900
They correlate perfectly to the question that's asked, but is an answer nonetheless.

1185
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:54,040
By the time he's finished giving it, you'll have forgotten what the question was.

1186
00:49:54,680 --> 00:50:01,700
So if, indeed, I was Dr. Hal, which I'm not, and this is going to be an even further leap of faith

1187
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:06,060
for me to imagine the concept of thinking like Dr. Hal,

1188
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:11,040
I would say, if I was Dr. Hal and I was doing the thinking,

1189
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:15,080
I would ask myself, what would I ask myself?

1190
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:22,340
And then I would be in like a circular conundrum that I couldn't get out of.

1191
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:31,080
It would be, I would have to be looking for a rescue rope somehow or another to get me out of this conundrum.

1192
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:31,640
It's a...

1193
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:40,480
Dr. Hal would probably, let's see, what would Dr. Hal ask himself besides the rhetorical question itself?

1194
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:44,980
What would I ask me if I was Dr. Hal, which I am?

1195
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,940
Because I'm asking myself the question.

1196
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,080
You have assumed the persona for the purpose of giving this answer.

1197
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:54,380
So far, this dollar is moving closer and closer to Dr. Hal because...

1198
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:56,100
But who is the real Dr. Hal now?

1199
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:58,960
Who is the real Dr. Hal?

1200
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:00,160
Well, I...

1201
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:00,760
Sure.

1202
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:02,320
The guy with the eyeball hat.

1203
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,640
Yeah, I got the uniform.

1204
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:06,600
Okay, so you got the eyeball hat, so you get the dollar.

1205
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:09,660
I don't have to even get to an answer.

1206
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:12,340
The doctor is going to get the dollar.

1207
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,200
So I get ripped off.

1208
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,220
Just because I...

1209
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,500
Here's a lesson we can take from this sad addendum.

1210
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,840
This is a trick question.

1211
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:21,980
You are what you pretend to be.

1212
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,440
So be careful what you pretend to be.

1213
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:29,660
The bottom line is, if you're not Dr. Hal, you can't really get the dollar for this question.

1214
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,100
I mean, answer this question.

1215
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:33,100
Right?

1216
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,220
See?

1217
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:39,960
But it is not addressed to you, Dr. Hal, but to a second person, Dr. Hal.

1218
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,480
Should I tear this in half and give you each a half?

1219
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,760
I demand a half a dollar.

1220
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,120
Just for fairness.

1221
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,000
You know?

1222
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:49,020
I'm entitled to half that because I'm American.

1223
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,560
I got two bits in here, a bus change.

1224
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,160
I should get half that.

1225
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,200
I don't have anything.

1226
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,120
I don't carry loose change into combat.

1227
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,680
I was born in America just like you, Hal.

1228
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,760
So we should each get half.

1229
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:04,880
Yes, you, like me, should breathe the fertile air of freedom.

1230
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:05,500
But don't.

1231
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:09,980
Don't be like Solomon and just cut that baby in half.

1232
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,440
Like, you know, you could cut it in a...

1233
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,700
Or like Alexander the Great slashing the Gordon.

1234
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:18,500
You could cut its vital parts in half and then neither one of us could cash it.

1235
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,640
I think there has to be like...

1236
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,940
Here, I'll settle this.

1237
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,200
Here, you take this dollar and you take this dollar.

1238
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,760
Dr. Hal, why is Philo the way he is?

1239
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,900
You gave him my dollar.

1240
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,340
Well, uh...

1241
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,760
That's the question I was going to ask.

1242
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:32,580
Oh, really?

1243
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:33,520
Why am I like I am?

1244
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,300
Well, you can.

1245
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:35,660
You're still good.

1246
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,300
Just entrust it to paper.

1247
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:41,360
Put it in the magic of orthography and I'll give it my usual interpretation.

1248
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,960
Or I could, uh, spiel it out now.

1249
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:44,600
It's in satire.

1250
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:44,680


1251
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:44,680


1252
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:45,300
Time grows short.

1253
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:50,900
And we have weddings, healings, sickenings, a taco meat party.

1254
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:51,660
Bobby Awards.

1255
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:52,860
The Bobby Awards.

1256
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:56,580
Yes, the coveted Bobby Awards will be given out from this stage.

1257
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,360
What was that?

1258
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:05,160
After the Bulldada auction, which also needs to be shoehorned in with a king-sized shoehorn.

1259
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:10,060
Well, in about seven minutes, this hour will be up.

1260
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:12,200
And then we will switch over to the auction.

1261
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:12,860
How's that?

1262
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,080
Oh, here's a question.

1263
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:14,840
And a dollar.

1264
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:15,420
Thank you.

1265
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,180
From Philo.

1266
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:18,520
Uh, why am I me?

1267
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,360
Well, you know, um...

1268
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,480
I'm going to take my dollar back.

1269
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,000
But, but that leaves me with only...

1270
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:25,640
Go ahead.

1271
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,080
All right.

1272
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:27,540
Here.

1273
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:33,080
Let's, let's, you know, do this simply, clearly, succinctly, as it deserves.

1274
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:34,520
You are you.

1275
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,700
Because, of course, you could be no one else.

1276
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:44,060
The universe consists of an odd amalgam of farmers, rutabagas, hubcaps, uh, and, uh,

1277
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:47,440
electric can openers, and other miscellaneous, mysterious objects.

1278
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:53,140
All are odd when initially encountered, but have purposes and stories which brought them

1279
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:55,060
to that state of being.

1280
00:53:55,400 --> 00:54:01,700
You, even you, the overman, Dr. Philo Drummond, are no different in the teleology of your

1281
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:02,100
development.

1282
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:08,420
So, uh, you should not only appreciate that you are you because, ethologically speaking,

1283
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:12,520
you couldn't be anyone else, but because it is better that way.

1284
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,060
You want someone else.

1285
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:18,840
You want someone else to receive the benefits and benisons which, uh, uh, eternal fate appointed

1286
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,380
to you.

1287
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,040
I say forbid it, almighty Bob.

1288
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:24,800
Philo should always be Philo.

1289
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:25,880
I have spoken.

1290
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,680
Well, I guess I got my dollar's worth.

1291
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:30,260
Yeah, yeah.

1292
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,680
We aim to please here.

1293
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,120
Offer satisfaction.

1294
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:39,460
But that seems to be the end of the questions for the Ask Dr. Hal period, so thanks all

1295
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:43,820
for, uh, playing, at least by being the audience, Ask Dr. Hal.

1296
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:49,860
We have many question slips left over, but what we don't have is time to continue this

1297
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:51,000
part of the program.

1298
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,820
Time is a thing of dragons, angels.

1299
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,640
Dragonflies and angels.

1300
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:57,160
I know.

1301
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,380
The former live too little and the latter live too long.

1302
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:03,480
I've, I've, I've heard these shows so many times.

1303
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:04,460
Oh, time.

1304
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:04,720
Yeah.

1305
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:07,260
Every time somebody says time, you have to say that all over again.

1306
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:10,540
Like a radar-activated robot known as Roger.

1307
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:14,060
Well, friends, we're going to wrap up.

1308
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:19,020
This hour of slack, because I know it's going to take another five minutes just to do that

1309
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:19,260
part.

1310
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,760
Yes, we have to clear the table.

1311
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:26,280
Then, uh, we have to think very hard about the weddings, bulldada auctions and other

1312
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,500
things, but nobody else has to do anything hard.

1313
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:34,660
Everybody relax and just enjoy whatever slow motion train wreck happens to be up here at

1314
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:35,380
any given time.

1315
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,100
Don't panic.

1316
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,260
Stop panicking.

1317
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:38,820
Yes.

1318
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:39,480
Calm yourself.

1319
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:42,980
Everything is fine and it's going to be all right.

1320
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:43,760
All right.

1321
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:43,760


1322
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,180
I assure you it's going to be just.

1323
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:46,920
Everything's okay.

1324
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:49,300
We're recording.

1325
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:50,500
Everything's fine.

1326
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,400
The moon is made of green cheese.

1327
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,100
Bring you back some of that green cheese.

1328
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,100
Poor, poor thing.

1329
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:57,540
Everything will be fine.

1330
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,380
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

1331
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,800
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

1332
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:03,500
Yeah.

1333
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,140
I mentioned the green cheese already.

1334
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:05,960
What are the odds?

1335
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:07,600
Yeah.

1336
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:12,880
There was a time when I collected head, uh, newspaper articles about criminals with my

1337
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,060
same name.

1338
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,580
Funny how there are so many criminals with just that name.

1339
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:17,860
Yeah.

1340
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,100
They, they stacked up.

1341
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,120
There were too many of them.

1342
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,200
It just got depressing.

1343
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:24,980
Well, especially since the, all the articles were about the same guy.

1344
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:25,320
Yeah.

1345
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:25,900
Doug Smith.

1346
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:29,140
Once he finds out his name, he turns into a criminal.

1347
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:35,920
How come there's never a King Smith or a president Smith considering how common Smith's

1348
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:41,640
because Smith's derive from yeomanry from the brawny black Smith under the spreading

1349
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:42,220
chestnut.

1350
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:42,740
There's never.

1351
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:43,100
Yeah.

1352
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,740
His arms are like an iron man.

1353
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:45,820
Right.

1354
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,000
There's, there was that one Smith in the matrix.

1355
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,420
And didn't you feel good about that?

1356
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,160
Agent Smith.

1357
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:51,940
Yeah, sure.

1358
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,800
That should have made you feel really good.

1359
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:54,400
Blot.

1360
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,160
And, uh, since there was more of him than anybody else in that movie.

1361
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:01,520
And he could beat anyone except Neo.

1362
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:03,420
Yeah.

1363
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:07,420
Do you know that series started out so promising and just, Oh God.

1364
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,100
Well, there's always one guy.

1365
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,580
One guy who fouls everything.

1366
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,060
And then you have to pick up that one guy, Neo.

1367
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,700
Uh, but that's the way things are.

1368
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:20,080
It's an accurate representation.

1369
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,620
Now you're supposed to somebody going to get married or something.

1370
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:23,200
Yes.

1371
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:25,420
Two people are going to get married this time.

1372
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:28,700
Finally, a subgenius found somebody who would marry it.

1373
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:29,620
Yes.

1374
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:38,420
You know that because we both of that couple in the, in the pond this morning, we baptized

1375
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:40,080
them all at once.

1376
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:42,240
And they fell backward into it.

1377
00:57:48,300 --> 00:58:00,200
We found that, we bought one, they, you know, in our week, kind of a total failure of that

1378
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:00,200


1379
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:00,200


1380
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:10,860
And until a wedding company got an aquarium final 있어서 the Janitor to make money

1381
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:12,220
at some point, you know, I thought that would be a great thing to have him to try and keep

1382
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:12,220


1383
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:14,100
Hard beak composed of keratin.

1384
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,660
A hard, sharp...

1385
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,460
Remember that one?

1386
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:18,060
Huh?

1387
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:21,480
We were on the beach because we were cool?

1388
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:22,560
Oh, yeah.

1389
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:24,380
We were kids in a sandbox.

1390
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,580
They're not paying any attention to each other.

1391
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:27,600
Just chattering away.

1392
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:29,520
La, la, la, la.

1393
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:30,600
La, la, la, la, la.

1394
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,920
I'm glad I'm so deaf I can't understand any of it.

1395
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:35,360
Many don't realize that...

1396
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:35,600
I'm just guessing.

1397
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,140
Well, that's what we do on the show.

1398
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:38,100
It's actually an acronym.

1399
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:42,060
A fellow's name is something like John Edward Bush or something like that.

1400
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:42,260
Who's that?

1401
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:42,960
Jeb?

1402
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:43,720
Jeb Bush.

1403
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:46,640
This is the news part.

1404
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:47,560
Is this a new guy?

1405
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:48,620
Yes.

1406
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,960
John Ellis Bush Bush is his name.

1407
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,120
And he's running for president.

1408
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,740
Can't you just feel the Jeb-mentum?

1409
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:58,780
No, I can't.

1410
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:00,720
Not to mention the Jeb-citement.

1411
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:05,680
I just can't believe there's like 320 million people in this country.

1412
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,120
And somebody...

1413
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:11,100
And that name pops up again and again.

1414
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,040
Well, you...

1415
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:15,040
Well, you're not simply tingling with Jeb-ticipation then.

1416
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:20,600
See, I promised it would take five minutes to shut this show down.

1417
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:24,580
I would tingle when they shut the government down.

1418
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:25,080
Anything, thing.

1419
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:26,800
Shut it down, turn it on.

1420
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:28,140
We are here at your pleasure.

1421
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,800
I like the idea of bankruptcy.

1422
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:35,520
This is time control where we end another hour of slack.

1423
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,180
And yet another begins immediately.

1424
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,960
Only it'll be an auctioneering kind of hour.

1425
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:41,500
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1426
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:41,980
Because we're...

1427
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:42,380
Is that right?

1428
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:42,900
Right.

1429
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:43,620
Bulldog auction.

1430
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:44,300
Thank you.

1431
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:47,000
Thank you so much for this hour of slack.

1432
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,060
Yes, exactly.

1433
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,480
Ack, ack, ack, ack.

1434
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,140
There's that ack, ack gun one more time.

1435
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:54,020
Well, it's been fun, folks.

1436
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,520
And I have to tell you...

1437
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:55,940
It's been great.

1438
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,420
This is all going to be...

1439
00:59:57,420 --> 00:59:58,200
Every fun-filled minute.

1440
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,480
...sizzered up into tiny snippets of radio,

1441
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:03,580
which will be heard into the indefinite future.

1442
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:04,900
The show next week.

1443
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,380
They usually last through October.

1444
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:07,640
Right.

1445
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:11,040
But we're talking about entering a timeless realm as of tomorrow.

1446
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:11,840
So we will...

1447
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:15,120
We will never be free of the utterances we make today.

1448
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:18,900
Hours and weeks will be meaningless in a few minutes.

1449
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:19,600
Exactly.

1450
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:23,340
And the part of you that can't stand an eternal existence

1451
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:26,140
will be burned away and sloughed off,

1452
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:30,000
leaving only that part which is able to go on

1453
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,900
rather than the part that deserves to go on.

1454
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,300
I will leave you with that happy thought.

1455
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:36,420
Good night.

1456
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,440
Praise God.

1457
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,960
