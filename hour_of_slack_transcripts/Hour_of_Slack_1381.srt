1
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,060
You're not going to sedate me anymore.

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,760
Who are you?

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,840
The Self Genius Hour of Swagging

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,120
I seem to be in a timeless space void.

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,300
Neither light nor dark.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,980
I have awareness but not mind but no memory.

7
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,920
That should hold her till we get her home.

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:57,500
What do you mean?

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,960
Yes, I get them.

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,180
Well, that's why I'm slowing down.

11
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,960
Well, that's why everybody else is too, so it's all relative.

12
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:05,380
Oh.

13
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,280
It was just one big sun-bleached hangover.

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,420
I have to be really careful.

15
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,280
People just sit out there and watch you take a nap, right?

16
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,780
They themselves are in a state beyond slumber.

17
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,940
They take a nap while you take a nap.

18
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,260
Their eyes are open but their sense is shut.

19
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,780
We have a nap competition.

20
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,580
We can probably sell this episode of Hour of Slugging.

21
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:28,640
Look.

22
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,580
The power of Dr. Codini.

23
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,620
I got me one of them.

24
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,980
Hell, got him an ice cream.

25
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:34,620
Yeah.

26
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:35,600
All right.

27
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,320
I bet you he doesn't share that either.

28
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,300
First Drummond, now Dr. Howell.

29
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:47,320
Now, we were talking earlier about using those as, well, rectally as like a, whatchamacallit.

30
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,480
Well, that would really cool you down in a hurry, I think.

31
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:49,980
Yeah.

32
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,240
Are you going to apply it rectally or orally, Dr. Howell?

33
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,520
Cool you down real quick.

34
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,060
Dr. Howell has gone for the oral option.

35
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,480
No.

36
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,120
Seriously, do you think we could sell this episode as a sleeping aid?

37
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,800
You know, the...

38
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,020
Like white noise in the background.

39
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,300
Yeah, like this white noise tapes would just be...

40
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,340
Yeah.

41
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,160
Or we could get Philo up here and give him a cup of coffee and he could almost sit in my car with the air conditioning.

42
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,520
...drained overseas to lunge viciously and bite.

43
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,880
What dead air?

44
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,820
Listen to this dead air.

45
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,520
There's so much dead air here.

46
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,180
I'm getting...

47
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,340
I think I might die.

48
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,020
Stop complaining.

49
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,940
When you got...

50
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,340
When you...

51
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:26,640
When...

52
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,880
When you talk at the same time as somebody else...

53
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,380
I'd listen to the other person, just so you know.

54
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,620
I can only listen to one at a time.

55
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,500
And so, uh...

56
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,620
I'm taking advantage of the headphones.

57
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,440
This is the first time I've been able to hear Howell.

58
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,500
In the beginning was the three-pointed star.

59
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,340
I'll listen to what you have to say later.

60
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,260
A smile of light across the empty face.

61
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,620
That is the cause of several world wars.

62
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,160
A bow of bone against the routing air.

63
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,640
The substance fork that marrowed the first sun.

64
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,080
And burning ciphers on the round of space.

65
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,580
Heaven and hell mixed as they spun.

66
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,180
In the beginning was the pale signature.

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,440
Three-syllabled and starry as the smile.

68
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,040
And after came the imprint on the waters.

69
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,940
Stamp of the minted face upon the moon.

70
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,420
The blood that touched the cross tree in the grail.

71
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,100
Touched the first cloud.

72
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,020
And left a sign.

73
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,960
In the beginning was the mounting fire.

74
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,760
That set alight the weathers from a spark.

75
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
A three-eyed...

76
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,340
Red-eyed...

77
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:30,840
Spark.

78
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,000
Blunt as a flower.

79
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,580
Life rose and spouted from the rolling seas.

80
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,320
Burst from the roots.

81
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,520
Pumped from the earth and rock.

82
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,960
The secret oils that drive the grass.

83
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,120
In the beginning was the word.

84
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,280
The word that from the solid bases of the light abstracted all the letters of the void.

85
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,200
And from the cloudy bases of the breath.

86
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,980
The word flowed up.

87
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,800
Translating to the heart.

88
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,740
First characters of birth and death.

89
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,060
In the beginning was the secret brain.

90
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,640
The brain was selled and soldered in the thought.

91
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,200
Before the pitch was forking to a sun.

92
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,720
Before the veins were shaking in their sieve.

93
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,220
Blood shot and scattered to the winds of light.

94
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,920
The ribbed original of love.

95
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,220
Before the

96
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,840
It's Bulldada!

97
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,960
It's Bulldada!

98
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:56,740
It's Bulldada!

99
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,260
They pat themselves on the back.

100
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,580
I posted a funny link.

101
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,080
I guess that makes me an artist.

102
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:09,080
I have a problem with the concept of DJs in a similar way.

103
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:09,380
An EJ?

104
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:10,940
DJs.

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,840
They seem to believe that choosing music in a certain order is some sort of art form.

106
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,440
Now, since I'm deaf, maybe I'm missing something.

107
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,300
You mean just guys who play other people's music?

108
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,840
Yeah, people who play other people's music are artists now.

109
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:36,080
You make a playlist on your YouTube collection of other people's stuff.

110
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,520
You're an artist.

111
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,720
No, I never heard the term.

112
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,460
A good EJ susses out the mood of the room and pays attention to what people are doing,

113
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,880
so he pipes in carefully added music.

114
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,820
What about the robot march the other night?

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,160
Doesn't that take skill to find?

116
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,380
And play at the right time?

117
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,980
I guess so.

118
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,360
Like I said, I'm deaf.

119
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,380
I'm just guessing.

120
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,420
I'm just guessing what you just said.

121
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,440
You can't hear the music.

122
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,860
He wasn't actually talking.

123
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,960
That was a voice inside your head.

124
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,260
Dr. Drummond, you're an expert on young people's music.

125
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,080
Don't they have a guy who stands at the back while the others are jumping around

126
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,540
and waving their crotches who twiddles knobs and makes sounds and everything?

127
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,060
Don't they call him a DJ too?

128
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,380
I mean, he's not playing records.

129
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,080
He's just making electronic sounds.

130
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,160
I may.

131
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,480
I can make techno music.

132
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,660
I could open up this little box right here.

133
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,340
I could be playing techno music.

134
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,720
You'd think I was a musician.

135
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,520
Well, you should do that then.

136
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,660
But actually, I'm not going to because it's too stupid.

137
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,740
A little kid can make techno music.

138
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,460
I personally like it.

139
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,860
In fact, if I put that thing on random loop selection,

140
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,920
it'll sound just like anything Moby's getting paid millions of dollars for.

141
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,160
Go ahead and do so.

142
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,580
I like that artist.

143
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,380
I like that artist named Random.

144
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,680
That's a good artist.

145
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,380
Yes.

146
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,460
Like Roderick Random.

147
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:02,520
I think Random serves you well, particularly if you have a very, very large library.

148
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,140
As long as it's a large library of everything that you already like in the first place.

149
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,460
And everything is highly juxtaposed.

150
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,260
That's what it is about to me.

151
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,600
It's about the juxtaposition.

152
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,560
Of what?

153
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,700
Well, the beauty of it is that part of the juxtaposition will work no matter what.

154
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,060
Just the same as if you're showing a film and you play any music.

155
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,900
Now you're talking.

156
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,300
That film and music are wed as one.

157
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,000
Not a bad idea.

158
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:34,080
And it can be the same with some music that you are playing at random.

159
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,840
Could be like that guy that did Tubular Bells.

160
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,100
They call this principal co-expressibility.

161
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,080
Oh, is that the name of it?

162
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,300
Like when you run Wizard of Oz and Pink Floyd at the same time.

163
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,380
They sync up perfectly.

164
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,480
Well, you can run anything and it appears to be the soundtrack.

165
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,680
But some things work better than others.

166
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,940
I thought it was called being high as a kite.

167
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,000
It helps.

168
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,320
But you always should anyway when you approach art.

169
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,720
You shouldn't be hanging back.

170
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,020
I just saw Avatar with a pink Floyd soundtrack.

171
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,720
And being ginger about it, you should be throwing yourself at it.

172
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,720
Because only then can you find out whether it's any good.

173
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,000
I think Finney did it.

174
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,140
It was Finney.

175
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:11,720
It was good.

176
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,240
I enjoyed it.

177
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,160
Much better than the original.

178
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:18,380
Well, there's a lot of movies that are much better if you just turn the sound off.

179
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,220
If you can't hear what they're saying.

180
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,620
This show, for example, is a whole lot more understandable.

181
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,360
Or the music.

182
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,120
Just turn the radio off.

183
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,840
Just turn it off and everything will be made perfectly clear.

184
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,620
Because all we're going to do is confuse you.

185
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,100
I got news for you, man.

186
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,800
They turned us off ten minutes ago.

187
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:36,920
Good.

188
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,620
Now I can get back in my air-conditioned car.

189
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,080
Hey, look.

190
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:44,980
There's people here.

191
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,600
Holy crap.

192
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,820
Ladies and gentlemen, we're starting tonight's chain of unfortunate events.

193
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,100
With Amoeba Knievel.

194
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,080
Hello, everybody.

195
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,960
We are Amoeba Knievel.

196
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,260
And welcome to X Day.

197
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:13,360
I'm going to start off things singing my ballad.

198
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,620
I am Tommy Amoeba.

199
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,640
And this is my theme song.

200
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,100
It's called The Ballad of Tommy Amoeba.

201
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,780
And these are my backup singers for this song.

202
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,060
It goes like this.

203
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,180
He was formed in primordial ooze.

204
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,740
When chemicals merged and something grew.

205
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,740
He split in two and then in four.

206
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,720
So now today there's a whole lot more.

207
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:49,860
Viva Amoeba, the lowest form of life.

208
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,880
Tommy Amoeba.

209
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,460
He'll make it all right.

210
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,560
Others evolved to higher forms.

211
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,500
The dodo bird and the dinosaur.

212
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,080
The human being.

213
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,820
And cockapoo.

214
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,700
Tommy remained to himself true.

215
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:31,580
Viva Amoeba, the lowest form of life.

216
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,580
Tommy Amoeba.

217
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,160
He'll make it all right.

218
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,300
Viva Amoeba.

219
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,980
Viva Amoeba.

220
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,040
Tommy Amoeba.

221
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,680
And the spa.

222
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,800
I thought the best for it.

223
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,880
Marsia.

224
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,700
Marsia Fair.

225
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,500
It makes sense.

226
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:05,920
Pages.

227
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,080
And then it Gone wasn't gone.

228
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,080


229
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:12,120

I'm always wild

234

She's a low-key so I be quiet

235
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,080
But I need more iron in my diet

236
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,340
The world goes round in circles as time slides reel to reel

237
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,420
I listen to the music keeping me in a hurry and feel

238
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,780
Guitars coming all shapes and sizes on my skydivers

This is the way the world ends

242
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,080
This is the way the world ends

243
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,020
Like a broken record

244
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,620
Woo!

245
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,920
However obnoxious young punk

246
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,100
Give me anarchy or give me lunch

247
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,080
Then we'll safely assume he's forgotten

248
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,280
The king of all Memphis is back

249
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,400
On his point of being lonely and fat

250
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,580
Silent TV is coming

251
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,780
The world goes round in circles as time slides reel to reel

252
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,920
I listen to the music keeping me in a hurry and feel

253

This is the way the world ends

This is the way the world ends

258
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,480
Like a broken record

259
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,520
Another man waiting to break

260
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,640
Pop the clutch as they jam on the brake

261
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,300
Can't always make me a good man

262
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,940
The rest of the family are the worst

263
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,060
One more time

00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:54,060


267
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:54,060


268
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,920
Like a fence to the tip of a sword

269
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,140
It looks like I caught one of their pigeons

270
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,860
The world goes round in circles as time slides by

271
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,440
I listen to the music, keeping time to how I feel

272
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,680
The cars come to all the shits inside the summer's dry blood

273

00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:35,460
This is the way the world ends

285
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,640
I was always mind horrified...

286
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,280
... when I saw how I couldn't find the lyrics

287
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:43,280


288
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:43,280


289
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,180
When I saw the lyrics I felt like this was the end of the world

290
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:51,960
This is the way the world ends

291
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,620

292
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:53,580
gem

293
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,480
The way the world has to, the way the world has to.

294
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,120
Hey, come on now.

295
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,460
We can't ignore our fans.

296
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,360
That one right there is running tight.

297
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,520
I have a job to do.

298
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,860
We've got one of our fans up there.

299
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,760
Who cares?

300
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,400
I feel sorry for all these people sitting around looking at us,

301
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,960
but the fans still have ice cream.

302
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:31,740
They still have ice cream.

303
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,840
So, take it advisedly.

304
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,320
Eat ice cream.

305
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,220
Ice cream is available.

306
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,260
It's good for you.

307
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:42,960
No, it's not.

308
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,160
It's organic.

309
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,740
It saves trees.

310
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,900
It will make a brighter, greener future.

311
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,120
For the children.

312
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,000
Every time you purchase another ice cream bar.

313
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,160
But when you don't purchase an ice cream bar,

314
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,640
a child goes hungry.

315
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,700
Please.

316
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,100
You must.

317
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,040
Even if you just throw it away.

318
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,100
You, through the act of your loving purchase,

319
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,820
increase the chances of these young children surviving for another hour.

320
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,340
You could be a commie.

321
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,400
You could be a commie.

322
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,280
Or,

323
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:26,940
whatever is the political persuasion of your favorite hatred.

324
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,200
Cold fresh fruit.

325
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,980
Cold fresh fruit.

326
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,920
It's just as good as ice cream for saving the children.

327
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:41,240
Or you could even mix the ice cream and the cold fresh fruit together.

328
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,260
Be exceptionally inventive.

329
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:49,120
Just remember, someone goes hungry when you don't purchase food to eat.

330
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,380
Well,

331
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,260
so much for today.

332
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,260
So much for the PSA.

333
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:57,680
From PR News in Washington, I'm sunbathing at a relative's private French chateau.

334
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,860
PR News.

335
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:06,360
Japan is one crucial step closer to phoned-in bomb threats and offshore wind farms.

336
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,360
Prosecutors say this is PR News.

337
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:15,400
This hour, President Obama disregarded police orders during a protest on the Brooklyn Bridge.

338
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,360
His mission is to promote an angry mob and religious flags,

339
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,140
then set them on fire.

340
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:26,180
The ceremony is being held over the next three decades on the Brooklyn Bridge.

341
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,200
The Federal Reserve is reporting a 1.2% decline in industrial PR news.

342
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,680
Any better?

343
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,140
After 14 years of audio collage and sound effects,

344
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,460
Evolution Control Committee are starting to make some serious waves.

345
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,680
In January 2000, Evolution Control Committee received legal threats from CBS.

346
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,660
What is this?

347
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,460
This is the CBS Evening News.

348
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,160
Concerning the band's release, Rock by Rape.

349
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,020
Rock.

350
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:56,980
Rock.

351
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:57,940
Rock.

352
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,520
Rock by Rape.

353
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,680
Rock.

354
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,400
Rock by Rape.

355
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:01,400


356
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:01,400


357
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:01,860
Rock.

358
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,280
Rock.

359
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:02,740
Rock by Rape.

360
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:02,940
Rock.

361
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:02,940


362
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:02,940


363
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:02,940


364
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:02,940


365
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,140
A critique of violence in network TV news,

366
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,760
created from samples of Dan Rather's news commentary and his well-known shock phrases.

367
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,980
With Dan Rather reporting from CBS, CBS, CBS.

368
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,660
As the band faced a possible legal battle with the media giant,

369
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,640
they turned to the public for support by creating a video.

370
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:20,640


371
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,400
The band's name was the Naps for Bonds.

372
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:27,520
MP3s of the Rocked by Rape song were disguised as unheard songs by popular artists.

373
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,940
Since then, they have appeared several times in Spin and Bizarre magazine,

374
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,000
as well as NPR's All Things Considered.

375
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,420
There is a song circulating on the internet that CBS does not endorse,

376
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,580
does not want sold, and does not want heard.

377
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,380
So what are Evolution Control Committee up to now,

378
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,360
and what do these sound pirates have in store for us next?

379
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,800
Copyright Violation for the National.

380
00:17:52,800 --> 00:18:05,560
Copyright naturalization violation has been our motto for the last 20-some odd years.

381
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,460
This is the Evolution Control Committee,

382
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:15,420
welcoming you to this Norwegian Cruise Line's special Ex Day Cruise to the Universe.

383
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,520
Welcome aboard the party saucers.

384
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,580
I hope you're enjoying yourselves.

385
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,640
Unauthorizedash Watching.

386
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,000
for the environmental controls.

387
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,060
They were set for Venusian passengers

388
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,980
that we had earlier,

389
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,140
and we haven't been able to correct this yet.

390
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,640
I'm sure that we'll be having this fixed shortly.

391
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,260
Meanwhile, I hope you'll enjoy

392
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,820
tonight's entertainment here

393
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,960
with the Evolution Control Committee.

394
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,140
And, of course, I can see a grand audience there

395
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,880
of great patriotic people

396
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,860
who have come out on this July 4th event

397
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,000
to celebrate their heritage.

398
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,780
And I hope you'll all join me

399
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,300
in singing our great nation's national anthem

400
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,400
as we begin this show.

401
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,920
Of course, as you know,

402
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,280
the United States government

403
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,140
has fallen on some difficult financial times.

404
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,540
They've had to start accepting sponsorship

405
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,380
for the national anthem.

406
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,540
Today's sponsor is the Oscar Mayer Wiener Company,

407
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,320
who I'm sure you're familiar with

408
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,840
their meat and meat-like products.

409
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,600
Great array thereof

410
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,740
that we can celebrate

411
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,160
with the most famous jingle of theirs

412
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,760
by singing that to the national anthem.

413
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,800
So if everyone would please rise

414
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,880
and put your hands over your hearts

415
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,080
and sing along with me.

416
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,100
Oh, I wish I were

417
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,080
an Oscar Mayer Wiener

418
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,200
That is what

419
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,640
I'd truly like to be

420
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,280
Because if

421
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,760
I were you

422
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:48,760


423
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:48,760


424
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:48,760


425
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:48,760


426
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:48,760


427
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:48,760


428
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:48,760


429
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:48,760


430
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,520
I'd be the world's

431
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,800
the world's

432
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,100
Oscar Mayer Wiener

433
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,080
Everyone would be

434
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,540
in love with me

435
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:05,340
My baloney has a first name

436
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:09,140
It's O-S-C-A-R

437
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:14,020
My baloney has a second name

438
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,140
It's M-A-Y-E-R

439
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,060
The world's best

440
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:24,500
Oh I'd love to eat it every day

441
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,700
And if you ask me why

442
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,880
I'll say

443
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:34,460
I'm Oscar Mayer as a way

444
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:40,720
With P-O-L-O-G-A

445
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,620
Okay.

446
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,620
Give yourselves a round of applause, ladies and gentlemen.

447
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,520
That was excellent.

448
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,220
How are you?

449
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:48,780


450
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:48,940


451
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:48,940


452
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:49,960
Yeah.

453
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,200
Thank you, Kevin.

454
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:52,260
Thank you, gera.

455
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,240
Listen, we're a hot rod band.

456
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,120
You keep saying this, but you're not driving a car right now.

457
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:58,300
Pete, please.

458
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,420
No, not right now, but I do have a couple of them.

459
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,060
Now sang a couple of the diferenteyzones promise

460
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:04,060


461
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:04,060


462
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:04,940
The poo hyena produce, famous nowadays, is skin of Peeoo Lee.

463
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,300
He is so fussy about not causing you trouble.

464
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:06,300


465
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:11,000
He d 🎵 toÊ

466
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:18,760
A bunch of jobs you acquired together.

467
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:18,760


468
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:18,760


469
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:26,180
Thank you.

470
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:58,440
Thank you.

471
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,580
Thank you.

472
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:41,900
From Detroit, dear friends, hatched from amino acid eggs,

473
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,180
that was the Slot Rods, live at 50 next day.

474
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,700
Before that,

475
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,400
the first five minutes of the Evolution Control Committee,

476
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,220
also live at 50 next day.

477
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,440
Another triumphant performance under Dobbs-approved auspices.

478
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,800
More to come in future hours of Slot.

479
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:05,840
Thanks also to Lemur for the fine collages and PR news,

480
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:11,200
and to Tommy Amoeba and band for Amoeba Knievel at X Day,

481
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,400
which we now hear in the background.

482
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,600
But now, back to Wisteria Campground,

483
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,840
for Hour of Slack, before a live, if sleeping, audience.

484
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,620
What is that movie with Karen Black in it that's about Mormons?

485
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,180
Harold Harlan did the music to Pahooli.

486
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,000
There's like a Mormon science fiction comedy.

487
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,140
Dima Sumac was in it.

488
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,300
Tin Pan Alley Tunes Myth.

489
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,780
The last one I saw her in was when she had a doll, a Zuni doll or something.

490
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,920
The great hit, You Too Can Be a Puppet.

491
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,240
No? You don't remember?

492
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,760
It comes out flaming.

493
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,420
Oh, I remember that.

494
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,000
But she ends up like...

495
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,140
You Too Can Be a Puppet.

496
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,060
Okay, okay, okay.

497
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,480
We're not talking about two different movies that no one else remembers.

498
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,800
And what movies are those?

499
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,080
That's what I can't figure out.

500
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,840
What movies no one remembers?

501
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,960
Talk about them all at the same time.

502
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:11,020
There's a very bizarre Mormon science fiction comedy starring Karen Black,

503
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,480
in which she sings.

504
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,420
She sings Home Sweet Kolob.

505
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,240
Princess Wee probably knows the words to it.

506
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,500
But Karen Black is not a very good singer, really.

507
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,340
You said this is a Mormon science...

508
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,380
Butterheart's in the right place.

509
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,920
It's a Mormon comedy science fiction low-budget movie.

510
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,900
That's Mormon science fiction.

511
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,240
That's an oxymoron.

512
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,260
Well, it's a guy who lives in Salt Lake City.

513
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:36,720
Moroni.

514
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,500
Moroni.

515
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,460
Yeah, that's the book of Moroni.

516
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:39,920
Yeah, right.

517
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,480
Moroni.

518
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,640
Because he's a Mori.

519
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,320
He's Holy Moroni.

520
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,920
They call themselves morons, so they have to call themselves Mormons.

521
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,660
Holy Moroni.

522
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,680
But they take their names...

523
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:47,680


524
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:47,680


525
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,060
It came from the book from the angel Moroni.

526
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,380
Bonnie Moroni.

527
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,740
Yeah, what was he thinking?

528
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,600
What was my great-uncle Joseph thinking when he made up that idiotic name Moroni?

529
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,520
Yeah.

530
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,620
I mean, was that like his little...

531
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,520
I think he was laughing.

532
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,280
Come on, you guys.

533
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:06,960
It's a joke.

534
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,000
I think he was laughing his ass off.

535
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,120
I often...

536
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,000
I'm pretty sure that Alistair Crowley was.

537
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,160
He was laughing his ass off.

538
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:15,920
You know, the...

539
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,640
The Rosa Cruz...

540
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:24,480
The entire Rosicrucian movement, which more or less became what we call the New Age,

541
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,120
started out as a silly pamphlet.

542
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:28,640
Yeah, exactly.

543
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:33,920
A couple of silly pamphlets starring a clip art guy named Christian Rosenkranz.

544
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,240
They probably looked just like this.

545
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:44,860
It was like two smartasses in Texas, Europe, or France or someplace,

546
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,500
made these silly pamphlets that were...

547
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:52,060
takeoffs on the occult trends of their day.

548
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,480
I love the greasy Mimeo feel.

549
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,420
The intellectual types.

550
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,700
Not Elmer Fudd, but somebody with a name like that.

551
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,020
Mud.

552
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,480
Flood.

553
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,280
Yeah, Flood.

554
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,460
But people...

555
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,260
They read these pamphlets and thought,

556
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,680
this has the ring of truth.

557
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:14,600
Surely they have buried this secret, true occult teachings

558
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,140
in this guise of ridiculousness.

559
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:17,140


560
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,160
This is a ridiculousness comedy.

561
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,480
In order to hide it from those who are unworthy.

562
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,440
Exactly.

563
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,380
And the guys who wrote it were going,

564
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,480
no, no, we were just high.

565
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,020
It was just a joke.

566
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,600
No, seriously.

567
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,500
It's just a joke.

568
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,060
And meanwhile, yes, we hear you.

569
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,820
The Messiah always denies that he is the Messiah.

570
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,360
You know, that same routine.

571
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,260
Well, that's pretty much the Illuminati.

572
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,920
And as Adam Weishaupt, he was just making stuff up, you know.

573
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,980
Well, it works.

574
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,700
Of course.

575
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,260
I know people...

576
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,000
Sure, yeah.

577
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,780
...that have probably memorized the Protocols of the Elders of Zion,

578
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:57,820
which is another, you know, completely made-up joke pamphlet.

579
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,600
How about the Voynich Manuscript?

580
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,260
I've never been able to locate that shunned text.

581
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,980
I used to have it.

582
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,920
I have a copy of it.

583
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,700
I don't have a copy of it anymore.

584
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,460
I had a copy of the so-called Voynich Manuscript.

585
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,160
Right.

586
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,440
Once carved into ancient stone temples, now a PDF.

587
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,360
I used to have it.

588
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,480
And it's only 17 kilobytes.

589
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,480
I think I left it behind in Arizona.

590
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:31,560
It took those Egyptians 400 slaves and an entire year to move that calendar from just across the room.

591
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,440
And now you can email it.

592
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,820
It's just something just not right.

593
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,700
But for the next thousand years, they'll be back to using the slaves.

594
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,100
The Voynich Manuscript is supposed to be the basis for the legendary...

595
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:54,020
or semi-legendary Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred.

596
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,580
And is...

597
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,680
There's another one.

598
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,100
This is the real...

599
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,740
I do have a PDF file of it.

600
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,020
Seriously.

601
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,240
We don't like being called mad, Dr. Howell.

602
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,220
It is very...

603
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,280
We prefer the term differently saying.

604
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,920
It's a very interesting...

605
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,060
It's at best a...

606
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,380
Most scholars think it's a very, very elaborate...

607
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,380
17th century hoax.

608
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:20,540
No!

609
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,200
Not another hoax!

610
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:29,440
The next thing you know, you're going to tell me the Bible's all made up by a bunch of old desert tribesmen.

611
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:33,600
It looks like if it was a hoax, then it had to be made by an insane person.

612
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,540
I mean, if...

613
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,440
The script doesn't change the...

614
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,680
Those Christians aren't real.

615
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,040
That means Jesus might not be real.

616
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,700
And what does this indicate about...

617
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,000
Oh, no.

618
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,760
Dare I say it?

619
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,560
J.R. Bob Dobbs himself.

620
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,240
The godly say God is everywhere all at the same time.

621
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:59,320
Well, what if you're omnipresent and don't want to be someplace?

622
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,100
There's no place you can go where you aren't already there.

623
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,560
And one thing you can't do if you're God is leave.

624
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:24,080
If I was trying to find God, the last place I'd look would be any of the churches I was raised in.

625
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:30,920
Not less I figured him for a tongue-speaking, snake-handling, frothing-at-the-mouth holy roller from the Ozarks.

626
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,080
One of my people.

627
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,540
And though...

628
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,320
I haven't been a regular churchgoer in some time.

629
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,040
And...

630
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,620
I will explain the holy rolling fundamental.

631
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,380
For those who haven't experienced it firsthand.

632
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:56,220
And for those who have, we'll just hope this little jog down the old memory trail

633
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,160
didn't cause you to have some sort of...

634
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,140
post-traumatic flashback.

635
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,100
For the singletons,

636
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,700
what passed for church was a lot of times just somebody's front room.

637
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,620
Or basement.

638
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,340
A storefront

639
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:16,980
was virtually...

640
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,600
purging on ostentation.

641
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,340
Formal worship was divided between revivals in their various forms.

642
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,900
And church proper.

643
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,560
Which convened not just on Sunday morning, but on Sunday, Wednesday, and Friday night.

644
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,840
The church revival had a guest preacher

645
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,140
in services every night for a week.

646
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,260
There were also traveling evangelists

647
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,580
that held meetings and everything from the giant tents

648
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,780
that A.A. Allen and Oral Robert

649
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,940
hauled around in fleets and semis

650
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,680
to ratty old theaters or halls

651
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,220
rented by the bottom feeders of the proselytizing trade.

652
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,260
And when we lived out in the country, we went to brush arbor meetings.

653
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,860
That's where somebody throws up a makeshift tabernacle

654
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,640
out of discarded road signs and scrap lumber

655
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,980
and commends...

656
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,180
to revivalize in the yokels.

657
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,980
Though the various holy roley congregations of my youth

658
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,420
often differed on particular points of doctrine,

659
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,560
whether to baptize in this or this name or that,

660
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,160
whether there was a trinity,

661
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,360
whether the Bible commanded them to take up serpents,

662
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:45,660
they were all of one mind and one accord when it came to speaking in tongues

663
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,980
as tongues,

664
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,940
tumbling around and falling all over the place.

665
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,800
And tongue speaking came in more than one form.

666
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,200
There was the everyday variety.

667
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,420
It went along with praying.

668
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,200
It was just kind of embarrassing to be around.

669
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,880
And we thank thee, Jesus, for the victory.

670
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,520
We hundle a shundi.

671
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:15,140
But the worst for me were the tongues and interpretations and prophecies.

672
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,100
Here, I'll give you four instances.

673
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:25,700
Brother Wagstaff jumps up and commences to give the congregation the Holy Ghost goddamn hell.

674
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,680
A good goddamn piece of the Holy Ghost mind.

675
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,820
The only thing was he'd be speaking gibberish.

676
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,740
Chocolata, mama, yoko, chocolata, dun, dun, da, ferka, da, morga, da, lay, hummus, chota, lay, shambu, bardi, baba, ash, cocky, baba, wah.

677
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,740
Now, it sounds silly when I tell it.

678
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,820
But all the grown-ups acted like it was deadly serious.

679
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:59,440
Exactly as if the Holy Ghost got him a shotgun and busted in like he was robbing a place.

680
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:04,640
And don't nobody stir until somebody interprets.

681
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:11,700
And what the interpreter says is just as baffling as the message in tongues.

682
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,300
Sister Fredonia,

683
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,160
Lo, saith the Lord thy God,

684
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,760
Turn not away from the way that is narrow.

685
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,440
You have turned your eyes blind.

686
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,960
You have blinded your eyes to the blood.

687
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,580
Lo, lo, I say,

688
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,240
Turn not your blind eyes away from the way that is narrow.

689
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,840
And the blood.

690
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,540
And the flesh and the eye.

691
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,460
And you could never tell what had been eating the Holy Ghost.

692
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,020
The Holy Ghost never had any good news.

693
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,460
The Holy Ghost never once got anybody to jump up and say,

694
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,320
Boy, y'all are some Christian sons of bitches.

695
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,520
Way to fucking go.

696
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,380
That never happened.

697
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,840
Sometimes instead of going through an interpreter,

698
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,820
the Holy Ghost talked to the people through prophecy.

699
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,500
And no matter whose mouth he hijacked,

700
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,660
he always spoke in something like a hillbilly's idea of the King James English.

701
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,380
Brother Bartholomew,

702
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,440
he just springs to his feet right in the middle of the sermon.

703
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:27,080
The more dramatic the interruption, the greater their profundity.

704
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,580
And his eyes are closed.

705
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,780
Their eyes are always closed.

706
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,420
He just goes off.

707
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,280
Off the top of his lungs.

708
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,920
I am the Lord God Jehovah.

709
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:41,700
And lo, my yoke is easy and my burden is light.

710
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,260
But come not to me through the works of man.

711
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,660
For thou hast trespassed unto Babylon.

712
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:54,180
Verily I say that the hour is short and the time is nigh.

713
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,280
And like always happens,

714
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:04,060
he sits back down like he hadn't even been there when he said all that stuff.

715
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:05,900
But he's not afraid of the Lord.

716
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,760
Sure scared the shit out of me.

717
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,660
It was weird.

718
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,360
Everybody took it seriously.

719
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,660
And as I say,

720
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,080
I'd always scared every damn bit of the shit right out of me.

721
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:23,200
I don't know if you've ever been in the middle of an old-fashioned Pentecostal church service

722
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,300
when the Spirit is moving.

723
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,720
But you need to find you one and check it out.

724
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,380
Admissions free.

725
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,700
Think of it like a field trip.

726
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,200
Better yet, take a hit of acid first.

727
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:50,120
Now everything I've told you about till now is all mainstream by holy roller standards.

728
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,180
But my people were snake handlers too.

729
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,580
We were in the minority.

730
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,920
My grandpa, John Clark Singleton, everybody called him Pap.

731
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,700
Preached that,

732
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,780
well, you could go to hell for drinking whiskey or beer.

733
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,720
Speaking of which, could somebody hand me a...

734
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,280
You could go to hell for drinking whiskey or beer right there on that post.

735
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,300
You could go to hell for drinking whiskey or beer,

736
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,280
but he himself drank strychnine and bleach.

737
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,400
He said he was going to hell.

738
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:34,520
He was going to hell.

739
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,900
He was going by the gospel according to Mark.

740
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:41,540
In my name shall they cast out devils.

741
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,320
They shall speak with new tongues.

742
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,860
And if they drink any...

743
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,800
They shall take up serpents.

744
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:52,400
And if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them.

745
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:57,060
They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.

746
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,400
They shall recover.

747
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,100
They laid hands on Pap with a cotton mouth.

748
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,320
Water mock us and bit him in the right eye.

749
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,960
Uncle John Travis stomped that snake to butter.

750
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,660
Neither Pap nor the snake recovered.

751
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,440
A cotton mouth is not a church-going snake by nature.

752
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,300
Rattle snakes and copperheads are about as much serpent

753
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,280
as your average holy roller can abide.

754
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,120
Plenty enough to satisfy the letter of the gospel.

755
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,540
Now, I don't know if you've ever watched your own grandpa

756
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:44,400
get bit in the eye by water moccasin',

757
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,480
die, pukin', pissin', shittin',

758
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,320
cryin' like a little girl,

759
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,760
rollin' on the floor of a flea-bit little church

760
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,160
way back in a holler in the middle of the night

761
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,320
while half of everybody you know is prayin' for him

762
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,400
so loud you'd think that God was deaf.

763
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,320
And the other half are singin' and clappin' their hands

764
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,640
and beatin' on tambourines.

765
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,320
But if you weren't scared of God before,

766
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,740
you would be now.

767
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,540
This was not somebody any little boy

768
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,960
wanted to be fuckin' with.

769
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,020
And you'd think

770
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,560
nothin' could be more terrifying

771
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,660
and damaging to a child's psyche

772
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,380
than a little boy's life.

773
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:33,380


774
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:33,380


775
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:33,380


776
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:33,380


777
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:33,380


778
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,940
Than witnessin' the sorrowful demise

779
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,260
of his own grandpa

780
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,920
to say nothin'

781
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,600
of bein' thrown into a small room

782
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,880
with venomous snakes and unhinged holy rollers.

783
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,040
But scary-wise,

784
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,060
that came in way behind

785
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,640
watchin' my mama and daddy

786
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,680
give up their very personalities

787
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,260
and become people I couldn't recognize.

788
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,160
Let alone,

789
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,760
count on to look after me.

790
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,880
The lake of fire,

791
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,700
the grave,

792
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,340
hell,

793
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,760
being cut off from the love of God,

794
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,360
the rapture,

795
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,800
the great tribulation,

796
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,760
all the stuff I was supposed to be scared of,

797
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,000
I was.

798
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,020
Add the snakes

799
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,000
and the faith healers

800
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,280
and my folks losing their minds

801
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,460
every time they got around God.

802
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,160
And there was still the realization

803
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,740
that everything I thought I had learned

804
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,540
about compassion,

805
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:39,640
patience,

806
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,520
kindness, humility,

807
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,180
they didn't apply to God.

808
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,940
We were supposed to be like Him.

809
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,660
Didn't make sense.

810
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,720
Wasn't supposed to make sense.

811
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,540
I was wrong for tryin' to make it make sense.

812
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,560
If you can find somethin' worse than that,

813
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,980
I don't wanna hear about it.

814
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,420
So the day after Pap got snake bit and died,

815
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,380
because nobody take him to the hospital,

816
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,260
I asked my mother why God just stood there

817
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,120
and let that happen

818
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,780
without doin' anything.

819
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,160
She referred me to chapter two, verse four

820
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,900
of Paul's first letter to the Corinthians.

821
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,460
But the natural man receiveth not the things

822
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,600
of the Spirit of God,

823
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,180
for they are foolishness to him.

824
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,180
Neither can he know them

825
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:30,840
because they are spiritually discerned.

826
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,380
. . .

827
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,840
See, people been makin' excuses for God

828
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,540
ever since Abraham first concocted Him

829
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,300
out of such other gods as were handy

830
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,580
in that part of the Mid-East 4,000 years ago.

831
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,640
Look at the number of books that purport to explain

832
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,420
why God allows bad things to happen.

833
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,480
And it's been goin' on since day one.

834
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,500
We can't hope to understand

835
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,380
except through spiritual discernment.

836
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,080
So God really has a plan.

837
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,160
We just don't get how God and His great,

838
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,160
great wisdom operates.

839
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,420
All the most horrific stuff you can imagine,

840
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,640
it's all part of the plan.

841
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,020
So relax.

842
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,500
God's on top of it.

843
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,620
That shit was thin when I was a boy.

844
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,460
And it is plum wore out now.

845
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,460
I do know the feelin'.

846
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:32,260
From 50 Next Day, that was Sam Singleton,

847
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,960
atheist evangelist.

848
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,620
We had enough preachin' last night, I think.

849
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,200
That's the longest sermon I've sat through in 25 years.

850
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,900
Oh, the anti-preaching preacher?

851
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,040
The atheist preacher we had.

852
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,020
Is he here still?

853
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,040
The atheist evangelist.

854
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,740
Is he still here?

855
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,600
I think I scared him away.

856
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,480
He's not here anymore?

857
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,060
I wanted to shake his hand.

858
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,420
His presentation went over very well, I thought.

859
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,180
Well, as Pisces pointed out,

860
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:02,200
it was the first time we'd ever seen subgeniuses be quiet for so long.

861
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,880
Except for G. Gordon Gordon.

862
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,800
It's genetic, I can't help it.

863
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,120
Yeah, he can't help it.

864
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,560
I'm English.

865
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:12,460
Yeah, I never heard somebody preach so hard against preachin'.

866
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,340
Kinda makes you wonder, doesn't it?

867
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,960
It was the preachiest anti-religion thing I ever heard.

868
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,500
I felt like I was in church and I couldn't get out.

869
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,260
I felt like I was in front of a crowd and bullshitted them this year.

870
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:27,740
I used to, well, there have been, in the past,

871
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,980
there were times when I would stand there and monologue guys for 90 minutes,

872
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:36,280
but I always had pornography or something playing behind me,

873
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:39,340
and music, so it'd be something to look at and listen to.

874
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,540
Not me.

875
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,140
They drug me into church.

876
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:49,320
The guy's sermon reminded me a little bit of my youth

877
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:53,060
when I got dragged into church, time after time,

878
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,840
week after week, year after year.

879
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:01,960
I did perfect the art of sleeping exactly the length of the book.

880
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:01,960


881
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,380
I did the sermon.

882
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,360
Did you paint little eyes on your eyelids?

883
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,040
No, but I had a certain way.

884
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,860
The pew was such that if I sat in the corner,

885
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,360
there was a certain way I could put my elbow on the top of the pew

886
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:20,640
and then lock it under my jaw in a certain way that I could just conk out,

887
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:25,420
and I wouldn't be afraid of falling over, no matter what happened,

888
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,400
even if I started snoring or whatever.

889
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,920
Not like my grandfather.

890
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,320
Somebody did.

891
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,640
Everybody was snoring in church.

892
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,520
Dr. Howell and other ice cream bars.

893
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,260
Everybody knew he was sleeping.

894
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,440
Primitive subterfuges of the age of faith.

895
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,480
I remember one time we were passing the collection plate,

896
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,380
and it was full of money, just full of money.

897
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,220
That's what we're forgetting.

898
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,560
And my grandfather was like where G. Gordon is,

899
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:56,480
and I'm passing the plate to him, and he's asleep, you know,

900
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,020
and I'm kind of doing this to him, and he,

901
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,240
kicks the plate up in the air,

902
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,540
and all the money just flies like over six or eight rows.

903
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:07,440
Dr. Flies?

904
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:08,920
You mean it didn't just go clean?

905
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,540
You Drummonds have been tricky for generations, I see.

906
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,720
And a lot of it landed in his shirt pocket, I bet.

907
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,140
It was hilarious.

908
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:17,980
Dr. Now that's what's missing.

909
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,720
It was absolutely hilarious.

910
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,480
Dr. Where's our collection plate?

911
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,540
Where's our collection paper plate?

912
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,400
Where's our what?

913
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,000
Dr. Yeah, where is it?

914
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:27,180
That was a good concept that we didn't implement fully, I don't think.

915
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,860
The whole plate collection.

916
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:29,740
The whole collection passing thing.

917
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,880
Dr. Well, we used to.

918
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,800
The wicker baskets, you know.

919
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,620
Dr. Yeah, people would put turds in it, spin it, you know, subgenius.

920
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:39,020
Little girls, we'd try to get little girls to give us a penny, you know,

921
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:43,140
old ladies to give us their, tear into their mattresses.

922
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,660
Dr. Well, in church, that's supposed to be for missionary work,

923
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,700
and in the Catholic church, there's a second plate,

924
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,880
which is just for the administration of the church.

925
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,940
Dr. Howell, your mic is off.

926
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,360
Dr. We send the whole shebang running.

927
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,060
More lizard in the monitor.

928
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:06,560
Dr. All right, now this is the part of the show where you get to indulge yourself

929
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,780
in some pain as I play my songs at you.

930
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:18,300
This is a song that's very appropriate for a day like today when it's a hundred and fuck degrees.

931
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:26,260
This is my climate change song, and it's all about cashing in, and man, I couldn't be prouder.

932
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,200
I couldn't be prouder to see you.

933
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:33,620
I couldn't be prouder to see the U.S. pushing up records in a month in and month out,

934
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,500
and warming the planet fucking over and over again,

935
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,800
because this is gonna turn out fucking great...

936
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,120
for me.

937
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:55,340
I got a big plan to make some money.

938
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,880
Just give me a chance.

939
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,360
At first it might seem funny.

940
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,300
Got me a plow of kinds of seeds.

941
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,740
I'm leaving now.

942
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,300
I got everything I need.

943
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,220
I bought some land for a tenth of what it's worth.

944
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,260
I understand it's the finest dirt on earth.

945
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:16,220
It's under ice, but the ice won't last.

946
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,720
Go ahead, look twice.

947
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,460
You see it's melting fast.

948
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,420
And my friends, I'm gonna farm green land, and I'm gonna get rich.

949
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,060
Gonna work my big plan.

950
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,260
One of the big brains, bitch.

951
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:28,700
I've arrived at sea levels.

952
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,060
But what do they do?

953
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,780
They just keep pumping out that CO2.

954
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:41,380
I bet you like eating, but the Midwest just gets drier.

955
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,380
Potatoes take a beating when Idaho's on fire.

956
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,260
I'll be the man when the food supply is slipping.

957
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,200
I'll gladly meet demand with a modest cost for shipping.

958
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,120
I'll grow Bing cherries, fresh berries, black, straw, and blue.

959
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,900
Green beans, pintos, limas, soy, and kidney too.

960
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,240
I'll grow cotton, fennel, corn, and corn.

961
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,820
Corn and lanos, garlic, sage, and parsley.

962
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,660
Green tomatoes, sweet potatoes, oats, peas, beans, and barley.

963
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,340
And maybe some bok choy.

964
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:06,820
I'm gonna farm green land, and I'm gonna get rich.

965
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,360
Gonna work my big plan.

966
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,540
One of the big brains, bitch.

967
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,100
I've arrived at sea levels.

968
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,280
But what do they do?

969
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,880
They just keep pumping out that CO2.

970
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,820
I'm gonna farm green land.

971
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,040
Gonna make a huge pile.

972
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,740
Gonna build a mansion where I live in style.

973
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,540
But I will need your help to make my dreams come true.

974
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,160
Just keep on pumping out that CO2.

975
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,680
I'll buy stock in a company that makes a pill for allergies.

976
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,560
Everyone will choke and sneeze on pollen dripping from the trees.

977
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:54,600
Lads and lasses on their knees.

978
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,480
All the masses beg us please.

979
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,840
Ozz will be their one relief once we have killed off all the bees.

980
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:06,980
Climate change is short to pay for those of us who find a way.

981
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:10,720
I'm brainstorming every day to come out on top of what may.

982
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,580
Yo, I just found out yesterday I got the zoning boards okay.

983
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,380
To build on what will be the bay of Beach Resort in Santa Fe.

984
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:24,780
Yes, the world's first oceanfront casino and hotel in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

985
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,460
Food, fun, and then beer.

986
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,320
And a chance to win big on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean.

987
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,540
Because the ski resorts up in Alaska will close their doors and then

988
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:40,140
your granddaughter may ask your papa, what's a penguin?

989
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,380
But there's still lots to do each year from spring ride on through winter.

990
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,220
Just need a boat and scuba gear to visit Epcot Center.

991
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,900
Still charging $21.95 to get in though.

992
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,940
We all know that you like your air conditioned.

993
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,980
And that tank you drive won't go just by sitting there and wishing.

994
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:56,780
Blind consumption keeps it pumping.

995
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:57,780
Let's all use some more.

996
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,480
Convenience rules, so just be cool.

997
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,560
Don't listen till I'll go.

998
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,160
What does he know anyway, man?

999
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,600
I'm gonna farm Greenland and I'm gonna get rich.

1000
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,300
Gonna work my big plan on the big rains bitch.

1001
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,980
I'm a runaway greenhouse, ooh, but what do they do?

1002
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,600
Ooh, they just keep pumping out that CO2.

1003
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,700
I'm gonna farm Greenland, gonna make a huge pile.

1004
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,420
Let the air in my tires cover a thousand miles.

1005
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,200
Leave the fridge door open, whatever I can do.

1006
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,880
To keep on pumping out that CO2.

1007
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,880
Thank you.

1008
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,840
Try that at home.

1009
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:40,680
Try it.

1010
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,260
Try St. Andrew the Impaled live at 50 next day off the sound board.

1011
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:49,220
Andrew's whole act is just amazing.

1012
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:52,180
And that one man band song we just heard is the title.

1013
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:58,060
The tiniest hint of his intense weirdness, truthiness, and his excellent microphone.

1014
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,540
I don't hear Dr. Hal's mic.

1015
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,480
Dr. Hal, turn your mic off.

1016
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:03,060
It's not on?

1017
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:05,120
How about now?

1018
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,600
Now, that, now I hear you.

1019
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,780
It's got a bad connection there.

1020
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,500
A bad connection.

1021
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Friends, how many of us have bad connections?

1022
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:14,660
Check, check, check.

1023
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,080
Slightly shaky wiring in our heads.

1024
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:17,680
I'll just hold it.

1025
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,620
I forgot what I was being asked.

1026
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:22,140
For one minute you're feeling normal and fine, or...

1027
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:24,040
Weird and fine, or whatever, and...

1028
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:27,020
Some little wire goes loose, and...

1029
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:27,900
What was it?

1030
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,540
Normal and fine, or weird and fine?

1031
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:33,580
Suddenly you're smashing in car windshields with a big log.

1032
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:35,340
Normally weird and fine.

1033
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:37,620
But that wire might grow back.

1034
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:40,680
Human brain cells don't grow back, do they?

1035
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,040
Contrary.

1036
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,860
Or it might be re-rooted.

1037
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,560
Right, they do re-root.

1038
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,360
I know that that's...

1039
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,420
I've had to do that dozens of times.

1040
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,600
But they never stop making connections.

1041
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:55,460
Yeah, they don't necessarily make correct connections.

1042
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,400
That's where...

1043
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,440
Those are the ones we call the kooks,

1044
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,060
who are the subgeniuses we don't agree with, basically.

1045
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:07,300
They see connections and correspondences

1046
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,600
that are there for them,

1047
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,980
but they're not really there.

1048
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,480
It's just a human conceit.

1049
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:17,720
Hence correspondence magic, you know.

1050
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:21,200
If this acorn looks like somebody's head,

1051
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,780
then maybe eating the acorn will cure my headache.

1052
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:26,480
Or make your head look like an acorn.

1053
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:26,900
Right.

1054
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,360
And in some cases it works.

1055
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,980
You know, every now and then it just happens to work fine.

1056
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:34,780
But I don't swallow any of the silly superstition.

1057
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:37,140
Bad luck with swallowing acorns.

1058
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:40,880
I just believe in Bob's path of least resistance.

1059
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,480
The keys of magic...

1060
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,740
Actually, we have the...

1061
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,020
You have to do a lot of work to make an acorn edible,

1062
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,440
Reverend Stang.

1063
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,840
The secret of life...

1064
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:54,840
Indians used to have to, like, boil them six times.

1065
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,180
Not being a chipmunk, that is.

1066
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,400
Before they made bread out of them.

1067
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,560
Giant incisors.

1068
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,280
Yeah, that's true.

1069
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:01,720
Big giant incisors.

1070
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,640
And cheek pouches.

1071
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:05,360
You're gonna have a digestion issue.

1072
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,160
I'm going to sleep here.

1073
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,720
Yes, a short intestine, but it does the job.

1074
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:11,640
Dr. Drummond, wake me up.

1075
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,120
Wake you up when it's time?

1076
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,100
When do you have to go?

1077
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,420
No, no, no, it's not...

1078
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:18,920
I mean, tell me something now, so I'll stay awake.

1079
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,240
What are you searching for?

1080
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,300
The most boring show I've ever been on.

1081
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:27,080
What happened to that old-timey band, the Psychoskeletons?

1082
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,380
So far in the sky at night I wonder

1083
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:49,240
Do my tales of loving...

1084
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,920
...something in the sun?

1085
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:59,640
She's got a simple universe called gravity

1086
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,500
All the color of the moon

1087
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:08,000
Pretends everything's right

1088
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,300
An anemia

1089
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:13,040
I can just ignore an anemia

1090
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,220
An anemia

1091
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:19,640
I can just ignore an anemia

1092
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:20,540
Ah

1093
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:33,420
Faster than the speed of light she's riding

1094
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:36,740
Trying to remember

1095
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,840
Where it all began

1096
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,800
She's got a simple interface whatever

1097
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,220
Waiting for the being to come

1098
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,400
Time will

1099
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,420
show me as

1100
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:54,060
one

1101
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,460
And I feel

1102
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:59,400
like I just got

1103
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,180
on and I'm down

1104
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,440
And I feel

1105
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,300
like I just got

1106
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,760
on and I'm down

1107
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:19,060
And I feel

1108
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:20,220
like I just got

1109
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:25,480
on and I'm down

1110
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:29,220
And I feel

1111
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:33,100
like I just got

1112
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,900
on and I'm down

1113
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,560
Like I just got

1114
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:37,560


1115
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:37,820
gives me

1116
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:38,640
느�报

1117
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,560
and I've

1118
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:39,560


1119
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:39,560


1120
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,920
relaxed

1121
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:46,520
And I Wasser

1122
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:46,840
I Wasser

1123
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:46,880
We're

1124
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,440
Of

1125
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,900
We're

1126
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:49,220
Of

1127
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:50,200


1128
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:50,200


1129
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:50,200


1130
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:50,200


1131
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:50,200


1132
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:52,220
Bye.

1133
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:27,460
Look, I did in fact have the secrets of life or the keys.

1134
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:29,960
This is the key.

1135
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:31,760
An educational aid.

1136
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:32,520
Right.

1137
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:34,180
I'll do them like this.

1138
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,540
These are King Bob's keys to magic.

1139
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:45,880
This is a takeoff on Maslow's hierarchy of need, I can tell.

1140
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,000
I thought it was the food.

1141
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,800
It's in the order of importance there.

1142
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:50,200
Well, education.

1143
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,420
Save the post-show analysis.

1144
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:55,940
There's a precedence that starts at the bottom, proceeding all the way to the top.

1145
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:56,860
Right.

1146
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,560
The first rule of magic, get off your ass.

1147
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,160
The second one, bust your ass.

1148
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,320
Get others to bust your ass for you.

1149
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:06,880
I've finally achieved that myself.

1150
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,300
What about bust your ass?

1151
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:11,160
Next, I'm going to learn how to watch my ass.

1152
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:15,120
And someday, I'll learn how to wash my ass.

1153
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,300
And then I'll have slack.

1154
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,680
Wash your ass, though.

1155
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,200
Meanwhile, here's the...

1156
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:22,660
I'm going to read you a list of what's important in life.

1157
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,260
And notice that Bob is only number 12.

1158
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,840
Although he does come before taxes and after sex.

1159
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:34,440
But sex comes after your back not hurting.

1160
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:38,620
Now, some of you out there are just going, oh, ha ha, that's very funny.

1161
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:39,880
You'll find out.

1162
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:47,440
If you're lucky, if you are lucky and live long enough for your back to hurt too much

1163
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,640
for you to have sex.

1164
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,420
I always found it was a good excuse.

1165
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:51,660
Or in case you're in a bad car wreck.

1166
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:52,420
But get to the frop.

1167
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,040
Yeah.

1168
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,260
Get to the frop.

1169
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:58,100
Yeah, the frop is more important than having your back not hurting.

1170
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:00,940
But it's not as important as money.

1171
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:04,140
We gave this a lot of thought.

1172
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,780
You know what's missing from this?

1173
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:11,160
Number zero, a physical corporate universe in which to exist.

1174
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:12,700
Nenslow pointed that out.

1175
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:17,640
And what about a zero, a minus .1 that would be an existence?

1176
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:18,620
Yeah.

1177
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,900
An actual existence.

1178
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:20,940
Time.

1179
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:26,240
No, a physical entity existing within a time and space.

1180
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:26,780
Well, personally.

1181
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:29,100
That was what zero was meant to be.

1182
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,340
We just assumed that.

1183
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:31,260
We just assumed that.

1184
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,260
That was my mistake.

1185
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:33,360
I assumed that.

1186
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,180
Nine and seven.

1187
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:34,860
You know what?

1188
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:35,260
You know what?

1189
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:37,380
Assume what happens when you assume things.

1190
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:37,960
I'm sorry.

1191
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:38,460
If there's no.

1192
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,220
You don't have that on there.

1193
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:43,380
So all the numbers will have to be pooched over and made longer.

1194
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:43,680
That's true.

1195
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,080
You'll have to renumber this thing, Reverend Stang.

1196
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:48,060
It's just like a skeleton.

1197
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,620
So many organs, key organs missing.

1198
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:52,500
A project for a rainy hour.

1199
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,880
Well, you can't go very long without air.

1200
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:59,060
You can go maybe a day and a half without water.

1201
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:00,360
But you don't have planet on there.

1202
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,960
You need to have planet on there.

1203
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:04,560
You have to have a planet before you can actually.

1204
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,460
Well, that's the thing.

1205
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,220
We assumed.

1206
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,440
There were certain assumptions.

1207
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:13,340
If we were more religious people, we'd probably appreciate stuff like that.

1208
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:15,340
We'd say we have to have God first.

1209
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,440
God's got to be up there.

1210
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:21,360
We were religious people, but we'd say, I don't know.

1211
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:23,740
That's why we put Bob at number 12.

1212
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:26,120
Name one of these things that you can quit.

1213
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:29,160
Dr. Drummond, I have lived without God most of my life and I'm still here.

1214
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,480
You're addicted to oil.

1215
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:30,900
Where's oil?

1216
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:32,380
Isn't oil on there somewhere?

1217
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,680
Aren't we addicted to oil?

1218
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,480
That's on page 20.

1219
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:37,340
Where's the car?

1220
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:39,100
These are things that you can't not do.

1221
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:40,740
Where's the flat screen TV?

1222
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,700
How long can you go without peeing?

1223
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:43,440
I'm going to ask you.

1224
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:44,340
I tried to quit.

1225
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,720
I can go about 80 minutes.

1226
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:46,880
I tried to quit.

1227
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:50,200
If it's beer, I can go about 30 seconds.

1228
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,360
What happened to the guy on stage?

1229
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,160
I had to go pee.

1230
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:55,740
He wore out my bladder.

1231
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,060
I know it's a bad habit.

1232
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:02,840
The average bladder needs to be emptied every 80 minutes.

1233
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:09,320
Maybe if they came out with patches or some kind of chewing gum that helped you to break the peeing habit.

1234
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:11,120
Just a valve.

1235
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,360
You should pee freely.

1236
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,280
You need to be drinking.

1237
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,540
You need to hydrate.

1238
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:16,360
Hydrate for heavy peeing action.

1239
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:18,560
Pee clear.

1240
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:19,380
Pee clear.

1241
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,640
Do we have to stop being funny?

1242
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:29,980

1245
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,980
Praise Bob.

1246
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:04,560
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show.

1247
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:09,360
We're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going

1248
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,820

01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:15,340


1251
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:15,340


1252
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:15,340


1253
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:15,340


1254
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:15,340


1255
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:15,340


1256
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:15,340

01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:15,340


1259
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:22,980

1260
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:29,880
you should go to subgenius.com front page or especially the radio page or the catalog store

1261
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:37,140
pages and help out financially as best you can. Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink

1262
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:43,200
of total poverty and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse. But some of

1263
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:50,100
you still have jobs. Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month

1264
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:54,040
from enough of you. Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1265
01:00:55,540 --> 01:01:02,500
All we're saying is that blowjobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay dogs.

1266
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:12,120
We also take checks and money orders to subgenius foundation. P.O. Box 181
