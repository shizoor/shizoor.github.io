I never lie.
Stay tuned. We'll have more right after this.
It's time for the Watchman Bulletin, a radio ministry of Watchman Fellowship.
The Watchman Bulletin is designed to give today's Christian the latest news and vital information on cults in America.
And now, for today's bulletin, your host, Bob.
You are about to participate in a great adventure.
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius.
Our host, the Watch.
Open up that bottle of slack and pour out a big old glass.
Sit back and listen to the priest chanting.
Messages from outer space? Oh, sure.
Radio show? Sure.
Oh, sure.
Oh, sure.
What is that stuff? Echo? Sure.
Wow, there's echo.
Oh, my God.
Don't crash the car, Dr. Tix.
Too much echoes.
Must reach.
Must reach.
Cancel button.
Must reach.
Fake phone call.
I'll get it.
By the way, how does the Church of the Subgenius survive financially?
Oh, we're doing great right now.
Mm-hmm.
You know, especially since...
Swagger came over.
Listen to this.
Listen to this.
Listen to this.
Listen to this.
What I'm going to tell you now may shock some of you, but it's the truth.
I was in the rock music scene.
I was a part of it for years.
I was a musician.
I was a singer.
Singing about what the kids want to hear.
Speed and pop.
Sex outside of marriage.
Said old masochistic sexual technique.
Said old masochistic sexual technique.

Did it cause any problems.
Lost both sex.



It's still working.





Money stinks in the stinch and the filth and the rod and the bondage and the darkness.
Listen to this.
One of the greatest days of my life
This particular night I was there with crowd control
That coliseum was packed to capacity with tens of thousands of people
Thousands, thousands, thousands, thousands, thousands there that night
The air was heavily laden with marijuana
Marijuana smokes were thick
And it was so thick
You could get high by just being in the place
You would even get high walking through it
And the scene was straight out of Danny's Inferno
It was like animals, it was like dogs sponsoring this huge
Travaganza will be
Some of the mightiest corporations in the United States of America
I would give my body to this group until it was black and blue
I mean it
I'd get down on my hands and knees
I'd give them anything they wanted
They're like God
They're even better than God
Listen to this
To be blunt
You will, after the show is over
You'll go backstage and
You'll go backstage and
You'll go backstage and
Let these animals do about anything they want to do to you
So what?
It would be worth it to me
Listen to this
Listen to this
Listen to this
I awakened on the couch to the flaring reverberation of a monstrous stereo that had played all night long
A little stale cigarette set up to attempt to focus on my immediate surroundings
Garbage, garbage, cigarette butt, cigarette butt
Garbage, garbage, cigarette butt, cigarette butt
Dope trays, dope trays
Needles and albums were strung about with clothes ankle-deep on the floor
I reached forward to begin consuming one of the leftover untouched drinks when I noticed the television set was on
I almost turned it off
But something said watch it
I looked at my life
It means nothing anymore
Do you hear me?
It means nothing anymore
I sat there transfixed
Battling with myself
And the world
And the devil
Whether to make an altar right there in front of that TV set
Finally I declared to myself that I couldn't make it on my own
I had to turn to somebody bigger than me
My previous dope dealer
Listen to this
Listen to this
Listen to this
God has told me that your parents or anyone else who tells you what to do is the devil and you ought to shout right back at them
No I'm not a Christian! I'm not a Christian!
I don't have anything to do with that! I'm not a Christian!
I'm not a Christian!
I won't just say it so plain that a two year old child will understand me
Be vocal, be loud, be concise and be clear
I don't care who you are
You ought to shout right back at them
It's a cover up, it's a sham, it's a facade
There is no God, man is God
Yes I know!
Yes I know!
There is no God, man is God
Yes I know! Yes I know!
Yes I know!
No I'm not a Christian! I'm not a Christian!
No!
Christian, a Christian, a Christian
Held up to the American public as that which is good and noble
When in reality it is dirty, degrading, filthy and rotten
You better take a strong look mister at where you're going to church

I have sinned against you my lord
And I beg your forgiveness.
I do not call it a mistake.
I do not call it a mendacity.
I call it sin.
I call it sin.
I want to address my own sin.
I want to address myself as best as I know how
to those that I have wronged, that I have sinned against.
First of all, my wife, Frances.
God never gave a man a better helpmate and companion
to stand beside him.
I have sinned against you.
And I beg your forgiveness.
I have sinned against you.
God could never give a man a father, a minister of the gospel,
a finer son.
That he has given me and his mother.
Donny and Debbie,
I have sinned against you.
And I beg you to forgive me.
I have sinned against you.
I know that so many would ask, why?
Why?
I have asked myself that 10,000 times, through 10,000 tears.
Why?
Why?
I call it sin.
I have sinned against you, my Lord.
And I would ask that your precious blood would wash and cleanse every stain.
Until it is in me.
The seas of God's forgetfulness.
Never to be remembered against me anymore.
It doesn't work. The natives aren't scared off by this.
Look, those naked women are dancing.
Hey, get closer. Get the camera.
Get the camera out.
Yeah, let's go do that.
Okay, ready?
Okay.
And we'll go to Dr. Drummond?
Dr. Drummond, Reverend Howell wants to tell you about President Reagan's operation.
Oh, okay, the new one? His latest and greatest operation?
You know, he's had many operations throughout his long checkerboard career as the executive key squancher.
But in fact, this latest Reagan atrocity tops them all.
The burr hole in the head, I understand.
That's right, they are called burr holes in his old burr head.
They had to give him a burr haircut, but I understand he was really, that wasn't bothering him.
He'd been thinking about it anyway.
Although Reagan has not experienced any other symptoms, doctors advised caution, the spokesperson said.
The surgeons made a small burr hole with a jackhammer, then a low-speed pneumatic drill in the ex-president's skull,
and drained a collection of correction fluid.
The procedure, which was performed under a gibbous paleolithic moon by which doctors waving crude obsidian knives,
lasted slightly over a year.
The procedure lasted for 36 hours, and was without serious complications.
Oh, they're already finished.
Dr. Bo Weinberg said he did not know how long Reagan would be hospitalized.
What about Dr., what did Bo Heine say?
He will go home when the physicians say he's good and ready, he said.
Torquemada Clinic physicians said the former president is in excellent health.
Weinberg said earlier, Reagan's wife, Nancy, just say no, Reagan, also underwent routine tests
and was found to be shriveled up like a prune, but otherwise,
in excellent health as well, he said.
I understand that Bo Hondas, Dr. Bo Hondas, when standing at the operating table after they had made the burr hole
and were leaking the viscous, horrible fluids from the president, the ex-president's brain,
commented on the viscosity of those fluids.
Dr. Bo Hondas described the president's problem as a subdural hematoma caused by President Reagan
being thrown by a bucking syphilitic horse in Death Valley days of July,
indicating the fluid had collected.
The blood had collected underneath the dura, a membrane that covers the brain inside the skull.
A hematoma is a pool of blood as in a bruise.
The blood had collected on the top of the right side of the brain, Weinberg said,
causing the former president to operate from the left or liberal side of the brain.
That's right.
Before the operation, Reagan had advocated unilateral disarmament, nudism, the Equal Rights Amendment,
eating oat bran, giving in to communism, legalizing drugs and turning the country upside down,
scraping the crud off it and giving it back to the infrastructure.
But the president was not the only one who was involved.
President George Bush tried unsuccessfully to contact the former chief executive from his command post aboard Air Force One,
but was impotent to abort Reagan's tirade.
I understand there's a group in San Francisco now that's organized to put the stuff back in Reagan's brain campaign
to try to get him to think the other way, maybe to influence Bush a little bit.
But like Kennedy's brain, the brain fluid disappeared mysteriously.
The Reagans arrived in Balaponga on Wednesday and checked into the clinic Thursday.
They left the clinic Friday morning and he later checked into St. Nowhere,
said a hospital spokeswoman who would not be identified.
Reagan, an accomplished rider, was thrown from a frenzied rabid bucking horse July 4th
while visiting the ranch of William Wellman, a friend near Los Barrachos, Mexico,
about 30 miles south of the Arizona border.
He was flown by ornithopter to an army hospital in Arizona and kept about four hours.
.

What was Reagan doing out there alone with that horse?
I'll tell you one thing.
He was out shooting buffalo gratuitously.
Did he run them down and shoot them again and again?
And when they got up, he'd shoot them again?
President Reagan dancing in the world.
Not only did he shoot those beefalos, but he jumped down and he buffed them a lot.
I mean, he jumped off his horse and swirled.
He's so happy with the buffalo.
Oops, he's bumped his head against the horse.
I think there's a bubble of water swelling.
Oh, my God.
President's head is eight times its normal size.
Oh, it's aqueous and...
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh, sorry.
Aqueous and what?
I get so excited.
Well, the president's head, you know.
Well, I understand he just got back from another trip
where they'd been hunting the great black rhinoceros down on the plains so dry and hot.
I didn't know he was doing that, but I'm not kidding that the ranch owned by William Wellman that was in the news...
They shot him down and took his horn and left the rest behind.
It's a ranch in Mexico where they have deliberately gathered buffalo
for rich people to shoot.
That's right.
And that's where the Reagans were.
I'm not making that up.
It's true, but people think these things are made up.
It's the show.
No, it's not the show.
It really is true.
It's a captive buffalo ranch, which wouldn't be legal in the United States where they can go and blast away the buffalo
just the way their capitalistic precursors and forebears did in the last century.
I understand they take those rhinoceros horns and sell them to the Taiwanese...
They sell them to...
...who make medicines out of them.
...quickly impotent businessmen.
...who make medicines out of them.
...quickly impotent businessmen.
...quickly impotent businessmen.
The men you...
The men you...

Yes, just because of the look of the thing, it's sympathetic magic.
But to me, it's not that sympathetic.
Yeah, I think...
Wow, look at that thing.
I think it's rather sad.
That they kill...
That they kill a gigantic animal for such a small thing.
Even if they killed a tiny animal for a big thing, it would be the same thing.
Or a big animal for...
No, you already said that.
No, I...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
How many ways does this work?
If they killed a tiny thing for a big animal, now that's good.
Yeah, that would be very different.
I don't know. Everything's relative. It depends on who's who.
Well, you know what time it almost is.
Yes, so let's wind up this.
Oh, man, cut that out. That's not...
It's time to go for the show.
Dr. Howell, there really kind of hurts, you know.
But yeah, in five minutes, all of us will disappear.
Well, I'd like to thank all of your callers tonight.
I really enjoyed speaking with them today or whenever you refer to the time period in those quarters.
But thanks for inviting me on your show.
And I hope we can do this again sometime in the near future.
I love talking to the audience and answering their questions
and engaging their attitudes, their positive stances on different common issues.
Issues and gesundheits and answers.
That's right.
And once again, thank you so much from Missouri via the call forwarding services of the International Telephone.
And we're going to do it again real soon.
Here to...
Uh...
Doppestown, Malaysia.
Torquemada physicians also...
Are we still on?
Yeah.
Oh, okay.
That was for a fact.
And then that's where we splice in all the cheering and all that, you know, stuff like that.
But in the meantime, hold on, and I'll find out what these callers want.
The wine base.
Yeah, well, it was good asking questions, Dr. Farrow.
The most obnoxious caller called back to wish Dr. Farrow a happy journey into the great luminous beyond.
Thank you.
All personnel not immediately needed.
During this operation...
Okay, caller, you're one of the personnel needed.
So go ahead with your question to Dr. Farrow Drummond.
Oh, this is my question.
Do you prefer red, brown, black, or gold beef curtains?
The question is, do you prefer red, brown, black, or gold beef curtains?
Does that make any sense or sent out post to you?
Yeah, well, the question was, do you...
Do you prefer any black, brown...
No, it was green.
Silver, green, or pink?
No, wait, it was...
Not pink.
No, no, I mean...
Red, brown, no...
Yeah, do you prefer...
Uh-oh, look out there.
Emmett's rocket's taking off.
The system is melting down everywhere.
Ruined in the cave.
It's crumbling away.
There are beams pulled out on nylon ropes.
The ancient custom of beef curtains and your preference in their color.
Yeah, Dr. Beef Curtain was never a good act, I always thought.
It's some stupid call.
It's a dollar joke, and they're trying...
You know, they think of these things, and they want to get it on the air,
and they use it on their own show,
but then they transfer that show to here.
Do you prefer red, black, brown, or yellow beef curtains is the question.
I like the brown one.
Brown is the answer.
Caller, I hope you're still tuned in.
Obnoxious?
Well, you know, Bob Dobbs is obnoxious, so...
Yeah, but he's him, and you're you.
Well, there was one of the wiser callers realizing,
trying to share with us the truth that Bob Dobbs is obnoxious,
but of course we all know that,
and it's time probably to go away from the rocket show now
and fly high away.
So, Dr. Doman, thanks for talking to us.
We'll talk to you again soon.
All right.
For all the rest of the callers, well, it's time.
Based on the Torquemada Clinic statement,
Victor Frankenstein,
who was a surgeon at Ingleside University Hospital in Geneva,
characterized the operation as a...
Oh, yeah, the characterization.
Hey, could you do it?
Give me a picture of your head.
And it's eternal salvation, or triple your money back.
Now, I would love to see any other church offer that.
In other words, if you go to hell as a result of buying a $20 subgenius membership,
we will send you a check for $60.
Well, how can any...
Anybody object to that?
What an incredible deal.
Yeah, or your money back.
Let's go back to the telephone with the Reverend Ivan Stang
from the Immortal Church of the Subgenius.
Good morning, Brandon in North Dallas.
Hi, Kevin, how you doing?
Peachy.
Oh, I just had a question.
I heard him say a moment ago that the end of the world
was going to come about on July 5th, 1998.
That is correct.
That happens to be my 35th birthday,
and I was wondering what kind of divine intuition
or guidance or anything you could give me.
What significance does that have to me?
Well, basically it means it's your birthday?
That's my 35th birthday.
Well, then join the party.
We've got 10 years to plan the biggest party Dallas has ever seen.
Now, where we're going to do it, I'm not sure.
In fact, we may not even be in Dallas.
We may end up doing the main party in Antarctica or someplace.
Or Sherman Denison.
Yeah, someplace safe.
So how's this thing going to come about?
Well, the men from Planet X will arrive on that morning,
and it can go either of two ways.
They're going to, these godlike beings from space will arrive at Earth,
and they'll be faced with the same choice that you would have
if you saw a dog who'd just been hit by a car on the side of the highway.
You know, do you leave it alone, do you put it to sleep,
or do you take it to the vet?
That all depends on how many dues paying,
subgeni there are on this planet when those creatures arrive here.
And whether Bob is their spokesman,
or whether the conspiracy uses a false Bob.
There are as many false Bobs running around as false Jesuses.
I mean, think how many Bobs you know.
There's a bunch.
And not all of them will cut you slack.
Oh, will you cut me some slack?
Yeah, well, yeah.
Well, of course, to a certain extent,
slack is something that one must cut oneself.
Yeah.
Oh, really?
Yeah, so, you know, not unlike the famous cheese of legend.
Bob delivers slack to those who are willing to take the slack.
Brandon, we thank you for calling.
Could you go on a little bit more, Reverend Stang,
about exactly what slack is and how important it is in the Church of the Subgeni?
Well, as the Hell's Angels used to say,
if you have to ask, you'll never know.
You know, those who know don't say,
and those who say don't know.
And I realize that didn't help a whole lot.
Yes.
You either get it, you know, either you know what it means or you don't.
Many have said that slack makes happiness feel like having your eyes gouged out,
by comparison.
That slack makes the nirvana of the Zen Buddhist monk seem like being buried up to your neck
in the desert and covered with honey for the ants to get you, by comparison.
Slack is awesome.
We were all born with original slack.
But from the moment that that doctor spanked you behind to make you cry,
the conspiracy has begun to take it away, insidiously stealing it away.
And they continue doing that by mean elementary school teachers,
through the IRS, you know, through nasty bosses, rude clerks.
The city council.
Bad TV shows.
Yep, there you go.
Yeah, yeah.
So, I mean, it's quite, like I say, it's so insidious that the conspiracy itself does
not even know it's a conspiracy, because it is a conspiracy of normality.
Oh, no.
It's a consensus agreement on what's normal and what's not.
And most people are not really born normal, and they should be able to exploit their abnormality
to generate good news.
I think that's what's so interesting about that, is that there's greater slack in their time span,
you know, in their brief passage here on earth, before they go back to the before life.
The Reverend Ivan Stang from the Church of the Subgenius could...
Yeah, well, now, slack is not exactly like money, but having money can help get slack.
That's why Bob wants to cut people slack.
I mean, he's out to make a buck, and at least he admits it.
We...
That's why he has a little more slack, say, than I do.
Now, let's see.
Now, Kevin, I recently asked you a question.
Yes, Church Lady Mother?
Yes.
Now, just what...
Just what would possess you to have someone like this on your show?
Hmm.
I'm hoping the closer I can come to being involved with someone like the Reverend Stang
and J.R. Bob Dobbs, that maybe someday Jessica Hahn or Fawn Hall or Deborah Price or whoever
she was...
Yes.

...will come to my house.
Maybe they'll come to my house.
Hey, you know who the best one is?
Who?
Tammy Faye.
Oh, yeah.
Tammy, if you're listening out there, I'll never forget that night, baby.
I love you.
Well, I just want to say that I think it might be Satan.
Might be what?
Satan.
Satan?
Yeah.
Oh, who?
Who might be Satan?
Perhaps maybe Satan is possessed by Kevin to bring you on the show.

Oh.
Well, they might have made a deal or something.
I doubt if Kevin was possessed.
Yeah.
Oh, well, I...
I keep my payments up, Church Lady.
Oh, well, very good.
I want to ask a question.
Where can I buy my indulgence at?
Oh, now, the indulgences are available from the Catholic Church, which is a fairly large
mystical fellowship you may have heard of.
Oh, yes.
They're a minor rival of ours.
Well, I'm a Luthitarian.
A what?
A Luthitarian.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And it's an interesting church, too.
Yes, we would have to have you come out and do an evangelistic service for us.
Pay if the price is right, no problem.
Well, I'm sure we can arrange something.
Carl, thank you very much for calling.
Well, God bless.
Bye-bye.
And good morning, Norman.
Norman.
What's the reason?
Ooh.
Oh, yeah.
That one's followed you around, I bet.
Well, if he's saying maybe you won't play, huh?
Pardon me?
If he's saying maybe you won't play that, uh, or you won't attempt to...
Yeah, that's kind of like our psychic coming up in the next hour.
The end of the world is coming, but he can tell us who's going to be president between now and then.
Well, did the Reverend ever explain to you what subgenius meant?
Uh...
As far as their connotations are concerned?
No, we didn't get into that today.
I was just wondering.
You know, I just kind of always took it on his face value.
Uh-huh.
Well, if you joined it, you would be subgenius, wouldn't you?
I believe so.
What is he going to be when he wakes up and starts breathing?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Tell you what.
I'm not going to turn...
I'm not going to turn my radio on Friday morning no more.
Because I thought the little imbibing I'd done last night would pass,
but I ran it back into a nightmare when the radio came on.
Stuff happens.
Thank you, Kevin.
Thanks very much for calling, Norman.
Yes, well, the slight man just reminded me of...
Yeah, people that send money in for no apparent reason.
Yes.
Okay, we don't want this part in here.
It gets up to some real...
Think of the balls you'll have.
You're too young to think about that, Bula balls.
Bells.
Okay, okay.
Now we've got to get to the parkway to have this amazing vision.
And it just blew me away.
I literally was just floored.
You know, after that thing, we were outside just buzzing
because the supreme artistic activity.
It's stuff like that that makes me feel bad about Wotan and junk.
I mean, I like Wotan because it assaults, hopefully,
and insults the normal majority.
But when I see stuff like that, that's what real show should be.
Yo, ha, ha!
I don't know where you'd start this tape.
I think this will be side one, even though it's actually probably side two.
Some old tape by Jacques de Mangegal.
What I'm going to do is inspect the, uh,
mucilus structure for some sheared, uh, donut balls, Sam.
So Hal marches away with the body of Hardy Chester.
Jim Herbst, the music plays now.
Here it is.
We're doing the Ed Holm show in Life in the Water.
We would like the first church and the last lad to present.
Let's get it.
Present.
We present you with this check for $1,000.
Yes.
$1,000 right there.
$1,000.
And this is for you for services, rent.
You notice right there, it's all signed and everything.
And you're all here in Northland.
There's 10% that goes for the agent's fee.
Oh, here.
Okay.
But, uh, we want to present you with what's left.
I get some, too, don't I?
What's left?
Shake it.
We want to present you with what's left of this check.
But, of course, there's the, uh, the traveling fee, which, of course, is enough.
But we'd like to present you with what's left of this check.
Oh, well, thank you.
You're doing such a good job of working your ass off.
But, of course, there's a little mic cut for doing it.
And then there's graphic charges.
And then there's the audio thing.
And this, you redeem this, and you can get a donut.
Oh.
Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.
Yes, I had my pits pointed and my points pitted.
At the end home show.
And my ingrown hubcaps retooled.
And a lot of automotive work done on the old one.
Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Show, show, show, show.
And I noticed that someone took the protective, um...
Oh, my God.
Here, I'll just put it back.
Put that condom, show condom back on.
Oh, the smell of rubber.
Yes, in order to...
It's exciting, all the little colors.
Have safe sex, like the subgenius sex.
You've got to keep these tips on the, uh, microphones here.
Well, it's going to be your parade this year,
because I'm not going to be there.
Okay.
My face is on fire.
Oh, hey, stop raining on that parade.
That's obscene.
They saved Hitler's mustache.
Starring Ronald Coleman and Vincent Price.
Wow, look at that mustache.
I'm a bum.
I'm a bum.
I'm a bum.
I'm a bum.
I'm a bum.


Noonday sun.
Yes, this mustache is all that's left
of a different way of life.
Look as it rises and expands.
It's moving.
Pretend to make it two, right?
Look at it against the sun,
that broken cross shining down upon the Bay Area.
I've never seen anything like it.
I met Fantasy Caller in an earlier life,
by the blue waters of the Nile.
And then her name was...
P-O-P-I-K-A-N-T...
��� Wid WHOLE ROIN-TON...
The
Andissant who is...
Like covert.
East into the were Department ofяти which meant, out-nial.

What's the...
After that I was very sure that using drugs was a sin.
Note to true subgenii, we could not show this material to full-blood humans.
The humiliation of finding out that truth would be too much for their pathetic human minds, or even worse, they may actually believe that THEY are subgenia!
Note to humans, why the hell are you even bothering reading this?
Why are you?
Well, if you don't get it, it seems obnoxious. You think it's stupid.
Why bother reading this?
Well, anyway, you think it's stupid, because although we understand how you think all too well, you can't for the life of you understand how WE think!
Hey, stop it. Hey, somebody, help me.
Okay.
Oh, he's beyond help now.
He's now?
He's pragmatized in little-collar hell.
Put him on the enlarge-o-scope.
That's right, there are three of them.
That's right here, the one-pole is here.
Are you ready to hunt them?
Here we go.
I remember how the humiliation of reading this was in my brain, how it sounded as it began to stop.
And I put my arms around my neck.
Then your flesh begins to sizzle, and your nose drops into your shirtbox.
Endless cigarette dough.
You should just get one of those 120-foot long ones.
Because I wouldn't think...
Roll it out there and have it come in a little...
I didn't buy an inflatable fallout shelter.
I couldn't.
I was the inflated American.
And then you can buy it in a reel.
And then you hear it.
Wow.
Even the robes of the church...
Sugar and dough.
They smell bad.
Listen everybody, the smell of burning...
Oh, burning flesh.
Every time I buy a doughnut, I don't understand.
Listen everybody.
Then it hits you, the smell of burning phlegm.
Phlegm, yeah, that's right, burning phlegm.
Listen everybody.
Early in the morning.
Doesn't anybody remember the smell of the burning phlegm?
Listen to me.
Beep, beep, beep.
Everybody please listen to me.
Who in the world could find this entertaining?
What a garbled mish-mash of mush.
I'm turning in my license.
Listen everybody, immediately, you.
And there he goes.
Call our savior.
Hey, hey, Dr. Hell, wait.
Don't, don't turn in your license.
It's too late, it's too heavy, I can't stop it.
You're not the way the great danger you are here.
Still don't.
We don't have the time.
Well, never mind that.
We've got the five mat here, and dominatrix will pin you down to that mat, if you can
answer our special question.
Okay, I already owe ten dollars.
You do?
Well, send it post-paste.
Hmm, yes.
Force it.
Then the monster with arms akimbo, who just killed that caller, will come back.
Hmm, yes.
So I'm ready for the test quiz or whatever I have to do.
All right, here's your question, buddy, listen well.
Who is the eighth avtar of Vishnu?
Hmm, who or Falk?
Falk.
Falk is sticking.
All right.
You have twenty seconds to respond.
Is there anything that you can give me to improvise the answer?
Yeah, here, catch this.
Yes.
Two, seven.
You know what I've learned from your show is that who is the most powerful?


Who's in broads or life?
I think that's what I've learned.
Who's in broads?
Yeah, right.
Who's in broads in the Mickey Spillane show of the second?
See, the answer to this question, folks, is the word live spelled backwards is evil, okay?
Okay, let's smoke some crack, and then we can have a heart attack and explode and catch
on fire.
Okay, okay.
And we can burn down some churches, too.
We heard your quizzes, what about your testes?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
Something happened to my microphone once again.
I can't say what exactly, but a dense pot seem to have fallen over the stadium.
That crowd looks ugly.
I'm glad I'm not here.
That crowd looks ugly.
I'm glad I'm not here.
And with that, I'll...
So there.
Would you like to see...
a few words before leaving.
I'd be scared.
I'd be scared if Hal said that to you.
...toward the callers.
Now, I want some consideration
on your part toward the callers.
Okay, I'm sorry.
That last caller, you just blew him up.
You didn't let him even say any more.
What?
I think your people are sick,
laughing at poor callers.
Well, I'm sick.
I'm going to send you a bomb.
I'm coming down to the station with my gun.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You're talking about the packages
already here, remember?
Oh, okay.
The package I already gave you.
Yeah, the package I already gave you.
I didn't even look at it.
It's like that.
Okay, well, you practice.
We'll be back.
Come on.
We're going to be here.
...invacuate the building temporarily
owing to a bomb.
Why?
Oh, just because you got chosen.
You pressed your little collar,
your button head, and here you are.
But why do you listen to this show?
I mean, I must have something
to do at 5 a.m.
I'll buy that for a dollar.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Oh!
This organization, started in 1889,
is part of what was known at that time
as the Minescience Religions.
Charles Fillmore was a crippled real estate sales man
who witnessed his wife Myrtle be miraculously healed
from the dreaded killer, tuberculosis.
This supposed cure was obtained through
mental healing and good quality treatment.
techniques. Myrtle Fillmore was heavily influenced by Christian science and the
writings of Mary Baker Eddy, particularly the book Science and Health with Key to
the Scriptures. The Fillmores taught, as did Eddy, that sickness, disease, and sin
were all an illusion and through proper thinking they would never materialize.
The Fillmores added a new belief to those of Eddy, the doctrine of
reincarnation. This false doctrine became a cornerstone of Unity teachings and
Unity, headquartered near Lee Summit, Missouri, became a forerunner of the
modern New Age movement. Most Christians who learn of Unity through their vast
mail-order materials or short radio spots are unaware that it is based on
false doctrine. The Watchman Bulletin is a radio ministry of...
He said, number one, they're real. Too many competent witnesses. We've had an entire
SWAT team see these things, I think on two occasions.
We've had a number of witnesses who have been in the same room with him for a long time.
They've been chased by fighter pilots, airline pilots. We've tracked them on
radar. So in spite of all the the kooks who may have thought, you know, they saw
something, there is a core of hard data. Number two, he says they're not physical.
Now, he's a materialistic scientist, an agnostic. He says they're not physical.
Well, you say, how could that be? They leave impressions. I mean, you've checked it out
with engineers and they could tell you how heavy the object had to be to
compact the earth to this extent and they left me with a lot of questions. Well, that's what we're doing.
That was a brilliant...
A brilliant original statement.

story of a person who's just out, destroyer,
yellow and black.
Because of the red evening, you start to turn around and then the red person


A yellow, a black, a rectangular.
A rectangular, yes.
And a what else?
Well, yellow, a black, a rectangular.
A rectangular, yes.
What else?
Well, doctor, it has kind of black, a yellow, a black, a rectangular.
A yellow, a black, a rectangular.
A yellow, a black, a rectangular.
A yellow, a black, a rectangular.
Yay!
So say it.
Say it.
Stupid!
Yes, it's time for a big cargo load early in the morning back to C-141.
Wake up and think, where are we going today?
I set the clock at 200 meters.
It is in the tree line.
Big pop, Rob.
We had to call away the...
Wrong patriotism this morning.
We're supposed to be behind all these guys now.
Okay, now we're on the ground.
We're advancing across a schoolyard.
It's like a video game.
I see a guy over there taking an RPG round.
Inside the building here, he might have wounded.
And we've got friendlies on the wire.
So you have to be careful of the way you lay around.
You can't just be zooming all over the show.
I don't know.
You're dropping the targets.
They're down here.
Who's down there?
Good guys?
Bad guys.
You have people here, right?
Right.
Go work it out of hell, or don't go bring a chopper, they get.
Let's go, engineer!
Let's go, engineer!
Say it.
Say it.
Stupid.
The following story is true.
All the voices you will hear today are from the people who are in the building.

All the people here in the phone calls are the actual people involved in the unfolding of this bizarre tale.
Other portions of this story are told through dramatic recreations.
But all these scenes actually happened to me.
But I'm getting ahead of myself.
Let me begin at the beginning.
December 15th, 1982.
With Christmas only ten days away,
this cassette was far from complete.
I was in a state of isolation.
As I walked down Bleaker Street in Greenwich Village,
I tried to figure out what I could do to fill the remaining 20 minutes or so of the tape.
Even so, I knew there was a good chance many people would actually receive this tape after December 25th.
I was at my wit's end when I spotted the small record shop.
Then and there, I decided that I would go in and find some really awful record and put it on the tape as a gag.
Thus started a chain of events,
and I was able to do it.
Unlike anything else that's ever happened to me.
Hello there, my good-looking and probably very prosperous fellow.
How may I be of service to you today?
Well, I have kind of an unusual request.
This is the home of a hundred thousand albums.
Unusual we got, regular we got.
You see my diploma on the wall?
Master of recordology, vinyl callologist.
You name it, we got it.
Even you don't name it, we got it.
I would like to buy the worst record in the store.
You want to buy the what?
I want you to sell me the absolute worst record in the whole store.
The most god-awful thing you've ever heard.
I want it.
What's the matter with regular awful?
We got records by Kiss.
We got terrible Andy Williams.
We got a vent guard classical that sounds like static from the radio.
I want you to rack your brain and find the one album out of all these here in the store that is truly the most revolting.
My brain, he wants I should rack.
Okay, let me rack for a minute.
Wait a minute, I just thought of it.
The one I use for the prop up the short leg on the breakfast nook table.
For you, I get it.
Look at the schmutz on this thing here.
There you go my friend, the worst thing I ever heard.
The shags.
The shags.
He handed me an album with three young blonde girls pictured on the cover.
The liner notes said, the shags are real, pure, unaffected by outside influences.
Their music is different.
It's theirs alone.
They will not change their music or style to meet the needs of a frustrated world.
I looked back at the shop down there.
Of course, the shags.
Look at these three girls.
Sixes from the suburbs with hundred dollar guitars but they don't know how they're playing.
I guarantee this album is the one for you.
Could you play me just a little bit?
I'd like to hear it.
You want I should drive away my customers?
Just a little bit.
You drive a hard bung.
Here look, you play the record.
Just wait till I get out in the other room.
Okay, my fingers I'm putting in the ears.
Listen, but please not for too long.
It was then, for the first time, that I actually encountered the music of the shags.
One of them, Ahound.
Well this is the first one.


Yeah, you gotta be fucking serious that.
Pretty let's play that way.
Eh, sorry.
Yeah.
My pal's name is Footfoot, he always likes to roam
My pal's name is Footfoot, I never find him home
I go to his house, knock at his door
People come out and say, Footfoot, don't live here no more
My pal Footfoot, always likes to roam
My pal Footfoot, he has no home
Where will Footfoot go?
What will Footfoot do?
Oh, Footfoot, I wish I could find you
Quite frankly, I was intrigued. It was awful, all right.
But how did it ever get on a record? And who were the Shags?
I had to find out.
My next stop was just around the corner where my friend Steve lived.
He's a musical connoisseur, very knowledgeable.
When I showed him the album,
he thought it was a put-on, a joke.
When I played him a song called
That Little Sports Car,
he was convinced.
There was a sports car on the road
I thought I knew the fella that drove
That little sports car was slippery like an oyster
Following the bus like riding on a roller coaster
On a roller coaster
On a roller coaster
On a roller coaster
On a roller coaster
On a roller coaster





Oh, God, it was the most incredible thing I'd ever heard.
It was so bad, I was positive the whole thing was a put-on.
And I told my name, he said he thought it was for real
and that these really were just some kids who couldn't play so good.
Well, we argued about it a bit, but it didn't get anywhere,
so I let it drop.
Little did I know at the time
that the Shags were to become an obsession with noise.
Well, you see, he had to play.




He had to find out who they were
and what the truth of the matter was.
It was all ridiculous.
I listened to the Shags' music all through that night,
which passed in a haze.
The next thing I remember is some cop
trying to talk me down off a well-known Manhattan bridge.
Well, maybe that part of the story isn't quite true.
But then began an endless series of phone calls.
Where were the Shags?
Had this record died in obscurity
or were others similarly afflicted by its music?
I found nothing.
Then,
something I had overlooked leapt out at me.
A list of thank yous on the record's jacket
and, among them, a newspaper.
The Exeter, New Hampshire newsletter.
It was a slim chance, but I was clutching at straws now.
With trembling hands,
my lanky fingers pressed out the phone number.
Good afternoon, newsletter.
Yes, I'm wondering if somebody there can help me.
I'm trying to track down a musical group
named the Shags.
Okay, just a moment.
Okay.
Mary Kroener speaking.
Yes.
These are three young girls or girls.
Yes.
In the back of my mind, this is all very familiar,
why it's familiar.
And I don't think that this is real recent,
but they were around this area
and they're a local family, I think.
Uh-huh.
But more than that,
is there something about Wiggin on there?
Wiggin, it was produced by an Austin Wiggin Jr.
and the three members of the group
are Betty, Helen, and Dorothy Wiggin.
And if you'd heard their music,
I don't think you would have ever forgotten it.
Well, the only...
And what's the name of the other...
The group is called the Shags.
Yeah, I know that.
That's Wiggin.
Mm-hmm.
But you say you do vaguely remember them?
I do, but I can't...
That's all I do is vaguely.
I don't know why I remember or what...
I can't remember who I was talking to about.
I don't remember these people
because I don't feel like it was like
more than six to eight months ago
and I don't know why.
Uh-huh.
It's just, it really,
it's a complete blank at this point.
Okay, and the only other names
on the back of the album here
are Kathy and Bob Olive,
Gene, Sebulkin,
Ernest Hatzis,
Charles Nuddings,
Ben...
Boy, that's a tough one to pronounce.
Swiznicki or something like that.
Swiznicki.
I know who...
I know exactly how it all comes through to me.
Call Ben's Photoshop in Exeter.
Ben's?
Yep.
Photoshop.
That's exactly what's all...
I know exactly what it is now.
What was it exactly?
I, that's, I mean,
I know that he was the one
that was talking about him
and, um, he knows all about him.
I managed to strike the chord.
How ironic.
Something the Shags
have never been able to do.
I called Ben's Photoshop.
Good afternoon, Ben's Photo.
Yes, is, uh, Ben Szczynski there, please?
Sure, just a minute, please.
Hello?
Yes, uh, Ben?
Yeah.
Uh, I'm trying to get some information
about a musical group called the Shags.
I took the only thing I had involved with them,
I took, uh, four photographs
while they're, uh,
they're on stage here in Exeter.
I could tell he was scared.
Are they coming back?
I don't know.
I think they were,
they're promoting their, uh,
their, uh,
record or recordings that they made.
They, uh, you know,
originated their own music and everything.
Uh-huh.
You know,
they were, uh,
quite the threesome.
They didn't know whether
they were ahead of their time
or what,
where they fitted into the picture
with the music that they had,
but the girls, uh,
the girl,
one of the,
one of the girls,
the one I'm thinking about now
is married,
her name is Semprini.
So,
hiding out under an assumed name,
but would Ben,
the friendly photographer,
be able to lead me to her?
And we're checking
the phone number now.
Do you have any other
recollections of them
when they were,
when they were,

were performing?
Were they a local hit or?
Well,
they were well-known in the area
and, uh,
their father,
he was their manager
and they did get around
and, uh,
yes,
they were well-liked
and, uh,
have you played the record at all?
Yes, I have.
Uh-huh.
It's, it's, uh,
very different
and very unusual.
Yeah.
The odd part of it is,
you know,
they gave me one of the first
pressings they had.
Oh, yeah?
We ought to hang on to it.
It's probably a collector's item.
And I'm not even in the,
you know,
I'm not really musically minded.
I'm a photographer.
Uh-huh.
I don't have time to look at pictures.
I don't have time to look at,
so anyhow,
listen to records.
But anyhow,
uh,
I remember they gave me
one of the first ones
and I remember seeing the jacket on it
and I filed that away somewhere.
Yeah.
Did you ever listen to the record?
Uh,
I think I did when I first got it.
And do you recall
what your impressions were?
Well,
like you say,
it's different
and I have to think of,
uh,
as I think of the girls
and, uh,
listen to the music,
uh,
I couldn't figure out
whether it was country music
or whatever.
They're pretty girls, too.
I remember the chubby one
was the one behind the drums.
Yeah.
I said,
now,
if I'm going to take your picture
from this angle,
I think what you better do
is rearrange yourself
a little bit.
So I was just saying
that she felt very comfortable
but I thought her knees
should be a little closer together.
Uh-huh.
That's the part I remember
because she was a little
on the chubby side.
It's an odd thing to remember,
but anyhow.
Well,
I tell you,
we seem to have mislaid that.
Oh, no.
Yeah,
but that's all right.
I think we can get it.
Do you know which,
which of the...
Oh, wait a second.
She's got it.
At last,
it appeared my quest
was nearing an end.
But my newfound friend,
Ben,
still had an incredible revelation
up his sleeve.
It seemed that
I was not the first
to seek out the shags.
Uh-huh.
And had you called
about this before?
No.
Because there have been
other people calling
in the past.
The,
who was it,
the Rolling Stones
magazine,
this was a couple
years ago.
Rolling Stone magazine?
This was a rumor
I had to check out
for myself.
Rolling Stone?
Yes,
I'm calling up
to see if perhaps
anyone there
could give me
some information
about an obscure
rock and roll group
that might have been
written up in Rolling Stone,
I don't know,
maybe a year or two ago.
Uh-huh.
It's a group called
The Shags.
Oh, yeah.
All girl groups.
Right.
Uh-huh.
You're familiar with them?
Yeah.
Did the magazine
write them up at some point?
Maybe, hang on.
Chris,
are you familiar
with any piece
we've done on the shags?
Did we do one
last year?
Yeah, we did one
last year
on the Dolly Parton issue.
Available at my
local library.
I don't know,
it depends about
your library,
but we have
back issues here on,
too.
Have you ever
heard this group?
No, I've never
heard them, no.
They are,
uh,
you have to hear them.
I know, I've heard
a lot of good things
about them.
Have you?
What have you heard?
What's the talk
there been?
Well, what I've heard
is simply that
they're different,
but after you listen
to them a while,
you understand that
there's a lot more
going on than you realize.
But I have yet
to hear them,
so I don't know.
Uh-huh.
I picked up a copy
of the album
down at Village Oldies
when I walked in
and said to them,
what's the worst album
that you have
in the store?
Oh, my God.
I got it.
Yeah.
He gave you that?
And he gave me
the shags, yeah.
Well, they're supposed,
well, it's obscure.
It's obscure
and perhaps deservedly so.
Well, I, like I said,
I've never heard them,
but I...
But there's somebody
there who's,
who's obviously
dug into their music,
which upon first hearing
is pretty horrendous.
Yeah?
I would say
leaning toward the hideous
and, and, and
pulled something
out of it
that in all probability
is not really there,
as Rolling Stone
is wont to do
from,
from time to time.
I'd love to speak
to whoever it was
who wrote this article.
Hang on, Chris,
you know who wrote the piece?
Oh, hang on.
Okay.
Hello?
Chris?
Yes.
I'm calling about the shags.
Mm-hmm.
Did you write up the group
for Rolling Stone?
Yes, I did.
You know,
it was brought to my attention
by my editor at the time,
who was Mark Kirkaby,
who,
I mean,
the record soon became a legend.
It wasn't,
it didn't take long
until people were playing it
in the office
and marveling at it.
So we decided
we had to do a story on it
and I got assigned to do it.
Uh-huh.
And what's your opinion
of the album?
Oh, I think it's,
it's so bad,
it's terrific.
Uh-huh.
Okay, now we're,
now we're down to,
to cases.
It's so bad,
it's terrific.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
And what was the,
I mean,
did you actually
say this record
is so bad
that it's good?
I said it was unique.
Unique?
Yeah.
So in other words,
you sort of couched
your phrases
when you,
when you spoke
to the members,
the ex-members
of the band,
I assume they were.
More or less, yes.
Yeah.
Are,
are they aware
of the true nature
of their musical talents?
I'm not sure.
I mean,
it's,
it's very,
it's very entertaining music.
You think so?
Yeah.
I mean,
I always have a great time
when I listen to it.
And it's,
I mean,
it's just.
Are you taking chemicals
into your body
at this time?

I mean,
it's,
in rock and roll,
rock and roll
was never really
about instrumental proficiency.
Well,
actually,
it was a legend
even before we,
we did something on it.
You're kidding.
No,
it got,
it was so bad,
it got a lot of attention.
At the time?
Right off,
yeah.
Yeah,
I was even surprised
it didn't show up
on the top 200 chart
because a lot of people
in the press
were talking about it.
I mean,
they got a lot of attention.
This was a record
that could not be passed up.
So,
they're famous.
For a moment.
They had their 15 minutes,
let's put it that way.
Uh-huh,
right.
I think they passed
into obscurity.
My understanding
is that there is
another record of theirs
coming out very soon,
though.
Another collection
of old songs
called
The Shag Zone Thing,
which will feature
cover versions
of Michelle
by the Beatles.
It boggles the mind.
It does boggle the mind.
It does boggle the mind.
I've been,
I've been counting
the minutes,
you know.
Yeah.
There's still time
to get a visa
to leave the country.
Well,
we can,
it gives us something
to live for,
though.
It does,
it does.
It really does.
There isn't much more
to say,
except all I can tell you
is that they're all
living in trailer homes now,
and they're all married.
Yeah.
They're happier
than the average
rock and roll musician,
so good for them.
The time had come
to get the story
from the horse's mouth.
With trembling hands,
I placed a call
to Dot Wiggins,
alias Semprini.
Hello?
Uh, hello.
Is this Dot speaking?
Yes.
I'm calling because
of the shags.
Uh-huh.
I thought maybe you could
give me a little information
on it.
Oh, sure.
Do you ever get together
and play anymore?
No,
we still have
all the instruments,
but everybody kind of
drifted away,
and, you know,
we all have
our own individual lives.
We used to play
for volunteers,
for patients,
like at a county home,
nursing home,
but we haven't even done that.
We haven't done nothing
for, well,
at least two years.
Yeah, you know,
it was just something
that we did at the time,
and it never went anywhere,
and we never
did anything with it,
so we thought
that would be the end of it.
We'd never hear of it again.
So it was really a surprise.
Did you have
a lot of musical training,
or...?
Yeah, we took
guitar lessons
for,
I don't know,
it seemed like forever
at the time.
We did our high school
at home
through mail
so that we would have time
to also do
our music lessons.
We had singing lessons
and music lessons.
We went,
one night a week
we went to Manchester
for guitar lessons,
and then another night a week
we went to Manchester
for voice lessons.
I know the second album
as far as songs go
are better than the first album.
Oh, yeah?
Because we knew more
of what we were doing.
Yeah.
So it should sell better.
I guess you sold
a lot of these records
right in the local area there.
I don't know.
We didn't,
like I said,
we recorded the album.
My father got a box of them
from the record recording company
and they were supposed
to distribute the others
and I guess they did
but we assumed they didn't
because we never heard
a word from anybody
until like two years ago.
So to my knowledge
they weren't sold at all.
The man that my father
dealt with
we just thought
he was a crook
and he took my father's money
and gave us one box of albums
and ran
because he was supposed
to distribute them
and, you know,
keep us informed
and we never heard
a word from him.
We tried to contact him.
We got lawyers after.
Nobody could find him
so I don't know what happened.
I guess there was
two or three other people
looking for him too.
Yeah.
I just figured
he split the country.
Well, you've got the last laugh,
that's for sure.
That's true.
And it is true too.
The way the case had turned out
had surprised me, kind of.
I'd wandered into
that record store
looking for something awful,
something laughable
and I found it.
But I found much more.
I found a story
that was at once
hilarious and poignant.
It wasn't,
it wasn't just about
some deluded kids
who thought they had talent.
It's about something
that's both funny
and admirable
in the human spirit.
It's about a father,
now gone,
who so wanted to believe
in his daughters
that he listened
to their music
with his heart,
a tone-deaf organ
if there ever was one.
And it's about
the faded and slightly
tattered dreams
of some kids
who had the whole world
before them,
kids that were
struggling through high school
about the same time I was,
grown-up kids
who've seen a thousand dreams
come and go
and still find
true happiness
in a trailer
in New Hampshire.
And yet I found
some sort of crazy triumph
in all this for them.
An album review
in Rolling Stone,
music that might have
been snickered at
but was still being heard,
music that was
in some lunatic way
