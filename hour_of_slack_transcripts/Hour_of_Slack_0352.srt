1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,460
They're here!

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:04,900
A minute.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,180
It's showtime.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,220
Time for the subgenius hour and a half.

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,900
The show that dare not even exist.

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,560
Join us now as we rocket away out of normal time into showtime.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,200
With your favorite horrifying horror host, Mobius Rex.

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,720
And you'll hear the voices of puzzling evidence,

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,740
Gary Gaboran, lies in a cast of thousands more.

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:33,280
Or, it's mysterious, evil, spooky, eerie, creepy, wacky, kooky, fun.

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,480
The subgenius hour of swag.

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,220
And here we got the brains of the whole operation.

13
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,880
Faster signal goes out from here to the satellite.

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,720
We pump it out all over the world.

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,380
Pretty fancy, huh?

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,600
Not too familiar with it, myself.

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,040
Okay.

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,640
Pedigree.

19
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:55,500
Support.

20
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,280
Don't satellite program.

21
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,700
Don't satellite program.

22
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,200
Ah.

23
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,560
You're buying time.

24
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,540
Time, friends.

25
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:05,880
Time.

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,760
Because Mr. Moneybags.

27
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,860
Mr. Moneybags.

28
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,940
Come on, now.

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,180
He's paying a salary.

30
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,000
It is a pledge drive.

31
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,360
Salary.

32
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,120
He throws in a hundred bucks a week,

33
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,440
and consequently I can't preach against drinking

34
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,760
because his ass box is full of beer.

35
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,980
I hope he's talking about you, my friend.

36
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,520
Pay us not to preach about beer.

37
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,800
Because they all smoke.

38
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,120
For me.

39
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,540
I have to let them out for 15 minutes

40
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,840
between Sunday school and worship service

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,980
so they can go out and light up a Chesterfield

42
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,320
or something or the end of it.

43
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,380
And what kind did Jesus smoke, friends?

44
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,600
It's time to open your heart,

45
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,480
close your mind, unzip your lips,

46
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,620
and bend over

47
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,160
because you're about to receive

48
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,760
the word of Bob.

49
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,500
And pull out that wallet, friends,

50
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,960
because it is pledge drive.

51
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,420
Yes, yes, yes.

52
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:57,720
Yes.

53
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,200
Even though it is pledge drive night

54
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,160
for the originating hour of Slack Station

55
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,640
here in Dallas, friends.

56
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,160
And we will be intermittently demanding

57
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,480
that you phone in and pledge your hard-earned money.

58
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,840
I just have to spend a big part of this show

59
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,380
telling you about my latest adventures

60
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:26,500
at the Starwood Festival in rural New York.

61
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,380
Last week.

62
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,980
The Starwood Festival

63
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,620
sponsored by ACE.

64
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,480
A-C-E.

65
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,360
The Association of Consciousness Exploration

66
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,900
there in Cleveland.

67
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,820
And on top of that,

68
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,680
I have so much new tape

69
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,120
from all over the country

70
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,620
that I want to play for you.

71
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,440
I don't know how I can fit it all into one hour

72
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,180
and grub for the money, too.

73
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,680
So I guess I'll plan to talk about Starwood this time

74
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,480
and then run to the next one.

75
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,280
I'll get some tapes from it in future shows

76
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,980
as the recordings come in

77
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,780
and as we have time to edit them.

78
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,140
But, uh, dear friends,

79
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,020
don't you forget for a minute

80
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,520
it is pledge drive time.

81
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,220
Yeah, I don't know what it is, friends,

82
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,520
but during the last month I've been traveling

83
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,300
and our magic post office box,

84
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,060
the whole of Bob,

85
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,520
has been crammed.

86
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,820
Just, just...

87
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,400
cram-packed with tape contributions.

88
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,620
Bob's songs,

89
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,800
rants,

90
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,120
media barrages,

91
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,520
music collections,

92
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,000
new subgenius radio.

93
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,840
And on top of that,

94
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,940
I have all manner of suppressed information

95
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,820
about, uh,

96
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,060
things like AIDS

97
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,840
and all sorts of really bizarre news clippings.

98
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,540
Why, our cup runneth over

99
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,060
and we thank you loyal listeners

100
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,180
and supporters

101
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,360
who send us these tapes.

102
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,820
And we assure you that we shall indeed

103
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,240
be previewing them and running very best

104
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,580
and the very weirdest

105
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,540
here on this oh so lovely

106
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,740
Hour of Slack.

107
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,900
Oh yes, it's a short hour,

108
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,780
but such a...

109
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,220
a sweet hour.

110
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,940
Oh, Hour of Slack.

111
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,120
Sweet Hour of Slack.

112
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,280
I record...

113
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:26,700
more...

114
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,780
did you once...

115
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,540
and then...

116
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,180
play you back.

117
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,760
Ah, but oh yeah, man.

118
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,080
I was...

119
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,240
What I was gonna do...

120
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,620
is brag about how much fun I had

121
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,400
and that you could have had

122
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,220
at this Starwood thing in, uh, New York.

123
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,940
And all my fellow ministers

124
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,440
who took my word for it and had the money and went

125
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,260
will tell you the same.

126
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,280
Same thing that I am.

127
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,580
That it is just about the coolest damn party you ever saw.

128
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,060
Every man and woman is a star.

129
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,980
As above, so below.

130
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:11,680
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.

131
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,920
And too much is always better than not enough.

132
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,120
And at this point you're thinking,

133
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,260
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, them witches have put a spell

134
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,800
on old Reverend Stang and brainwashed him.

135
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,920
Actually, it's the other way around.

136
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,660
But, uh, I digress.

137
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,320
Actually, of course, the Starwood festivals

138
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,980
are most informative.

139
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,660
I mean, there's all these workshops

140
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,080
and celebrity weirdo speakers

141
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,460
and, quote, networking and all that.

142
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,980
Especially if you're interested in, oh, like,

143
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,120
alternative religions, realities, and real estate.

144
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,300
Like, real estate from the other dimensions.

145
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,900
Uh, the...

146
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,740
The ACE gang in Cleveland originally planned these whole things

147
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,760
as sort of an outdoor yearly college of weirdness.

148
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,900
A Mondo 2000 sort of cyberspace-y general gathering of,

149
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,320
well, not conspiracy outcasts,

150
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,520
but more like conspiracy dropouts.

151
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,180
Because the neo-pagan scene is so well entrenched

152
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,760
in that area up there that, uh, Starwood,

153
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,900
as its corny name implies,

154
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,420
is also a major focus for that scene.

155
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,680
And, in fact, it's the largest, quote,

156
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,640
pagan, unquote, gathering in...

157
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,220
the U.S.

158
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,780
Uh, now to, uh, some subgeniuses, I'm sure.

159
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,740
The, uh, term pagan conjures up these humorless

160
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,920
Wiccans and Druids and Crystal Heads and astrologers

161
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,920
with names like Star...

162
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,160
Uh, Starchild and Hawkfire.

163
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,700
You know, real conspiracy duke positive thinking religious nuts.

164
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,680
The boring kind.

165
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,400
And there are some of those,

166
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,860
but that's exactly why ACE

167
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,220
started sponsoring subgenius devivals

168
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,580
as part of the programming.

169
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,680
Now, if you're the kind of subgenius

170
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,320
who can't stomach any kind of peace-love hippie throwback stuff,

171
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,120
then Starwood would probably not be for you.

172
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,020
But these are like the 90s hippies.

173
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,080
Or the Zippies, as they say in England.

174
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,720
And, you know, I mean,

175
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,740
what's so funny about peace, love, and understanding?

176
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,420
They go real well with froth and sex and rock and roll,

177
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,080
and they really disturb the pinks.

178
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,760
That's the main thing.

179
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,560
And Starwood is the kind of event that would indeed

180
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,760
freak the pink.

181
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:52,100
Uh, cause you see the ACE core group there in Cleveland,

182
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,240
the Chameleon Club,

183
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,080
and the various Ohio...

184
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,240
Ohio, New York subgenius pagans.

185
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,560
They're like a massive force of major new doctor blood.

186
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,760
A legendary style clench.

187
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,900
A mighty clench of legend.

188
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,380
Like unto Doctors for Bob of Little Rock

189
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,700
or the San Francisco Show Band.

190
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,120
Or the Swingin' Love Corpses of Missouri

191
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,880
and the Bolivian Dobstown Clench.

192
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,320
I should mention that all the Chameleons are subgenius.

193
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,600
But not all the subgenii are Chameleons.

194
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,000
It's a very select group.

195
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,120
But, friends, they are a force to be reckoned with.

196
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,920
And if you know what a proud Texan I am,

197
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,480
then you should appreciate what I'm saying there.

198
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:46,820
They know how to attract and radiate slack majorly.

199
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,600
Majorly.

200
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,580
Speaking of which, I saw this phrase spray-painted

201
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,060
in, uh,

202
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,500
several places, both in Cleveland and around Starwood,

203
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,920
that said, and I quote, in rough handwritten letters,

204
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:04,260
quote,

205
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,180
LDS rules, with a Z.

206
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,560
Majorly.

207
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,760
Or magerly.

208
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,600
That's majorly with a G, I guess.

209
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,920
LDS rules magerly.

210
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,900
Now, uh,

211
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,500
that must tell you something.

212
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,460
Now, before I describe the subgenius events in specific

213
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,080
that happened at the Starwood thing,

214
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,820
and also tell you about the upcoming events

215
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,800
that you can go to,

216
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,320
I just want to sort of set the scene.

217
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,760
Um,

218
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,380
I don't go to these Starwood things just to preach

219
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,680
and to, uh, sell baubles.

220
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,440
I go for what happens aside from the subgenius stuff.

221
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,840
It's in tents around this place at night.

222
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,900
It's a well-equipped campground on privately owned land,

223
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,460
and there's about a thousand adults all camped out with tents and teepees

224
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,960
and domes,

225
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:18,480
and a lot of them sell New Age trinkets and gee-gaws and stuff during the day,

226
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,700
and there's body paint,

227
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,840
and painting booths,

228
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,960
and gorgeous body painted people walking around,

229
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,580
oh yes,

230
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,520
and tattooing booths and jewelry,

231
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,660
and you name it.

232
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,400
There's that and all these workshops on drumming and magic

233
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,440
with a K and computers and stuff going on.

234
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,380
That's during the day.

235
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,740
But at night,

236
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,580
the, uh, the drumming starts.

237
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,460
And, uh, it's drumming around this bonfire.

238
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,920
A lot of drums, dear friends,

239
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,300
and a very big bonfire.

240
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,440
And on Saturday night, the last night of the festival,

241
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,520
it's the hugest bonfire you ever saw,

242
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,680
with this big lighting ceremony and so forth,

243
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,060
and this sort of frenzied trance dancing starts up,

244
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,580
and boy howdy,

245
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,560
if you've never heard of it,

246
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,820
if you've never been to one of these things,

247
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,480
it is something to behold.

248
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,480
You get used to the nudity pretty quick,

249
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,880
but it's the, uh, the vibes,

250
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,420
it's the energies that start up.

251
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,860
And you can feel that.

252
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,820
It transcends any misgivings you might have

253
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,120
about the gross superstition and pop New Age religion

254
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,540
of some of the folks.

255
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,580
Uh, it hits you right at your core,

256
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,280
because human beings,

257
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,900
all human beings,

258
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,340
have been dancing naked to drums around fires

259
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,060
a lot longer than they've been watching TV

260
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,420
or listening to radios.

261
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,400
And when you see it again,

262
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,260
you know it's true.

263
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,720
And it is a gas.

264
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,100
It is a gas.

265
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:09,920
What can I say?

266
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,720
But it's a gas.

267
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,860
I personally am still just a little too inhibited, maybe,

268
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,100
hm,

269
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,400
to get out and do that thing myself.

270
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,100
Maybe next time, but...

271
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,540
Whoa!

272
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,340
Uh...

273
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:28,060
Uh, the fact that the very air itself at this place is,

274
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,280
shall we say, electric,

275
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,920
as are a lot of the people,

276
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,020
kind of adds to the grokking of just what it is

277
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,520
that you're seeing and doing.

278
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,080
I mean, these people are tapping into the old fertility world

279
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,640
and the new religion.

280
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,400
And there's kind of a steaminess to the whole atmosphere

281
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,780
that gets to your core,

282
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,520
to your...

283
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,420
your...

284
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,680
center.

285
00:12:53,700 --> 00:13:01,000
And I actually espied some not entirely unpublic fornication

286
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,040
occurring in the shadows by the trail near the fire this time.

287
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,880
And it was a beautiful thing.

288
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,100
And the drums,

289
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,420
which are ever-present at Starwood,

290
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,280
and the whole past dawn all over the whole area,

291
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,720
they're sort of conducive to this whole thing.

292
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,980
And there's a lot of romance happening.

293
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,540
A lot of people sort of match up.

294
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:24,820
And I...

295
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,300
I mean, this is a place where there are folks

296
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,760
skilled in tantric practices

297
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,340
and, uh, steeped in tantric lore.

298
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,420
And if you don't know what tantra is,

299
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,220
go to the library,

300
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,460
because I can't go into that kind of detail

301
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,540
on the radio.

302
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,500
But it's Pan and the Goddess having a party, dear friends.

303
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,120
And Pan is a yeti,

304
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,160
and the Goddess is an angel.

305
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,660
A bad angel.

306
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,900
A bad, bad angel.

307
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,920
But an angel nonetheless.

308
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:58,960
And you know, friends,

309
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,400
I can't express how proud I am

310
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,880
that the Church of the Subgenius

311
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,340
is able to contribute to that steamy atmosphere.

312
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,100
Not so much by me, although I do my best,

313
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,600
but mainly by way of the new lady,

314
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,040
subgenius preachers

315
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,300
who have come along

316
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,240
and who are...

317
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,860
who were at Starwood.

318
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,260
And regular...

319
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,040
I'm gonna be playing that coming up

320
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,620
if you call in your pledges.

321
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,460
So far nobody's calling.

322
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,320
Oh, okay.

323
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,580
So much for that.

324
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,460
Um...

325
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,960
Wouldn't you have loved

326
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,020
to have heard the snippets

327
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,660
of the steamy preaching of Cleveland's

328
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,280
Sister Mary Squared Alcontrere

329
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,520
and Reverend Gobi

330
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,040
and the Connie channeling

331
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,120
of Sister Velveteen Sly,

332
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,220
of Madison,

333
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,620
who gets guys to suck

334
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,840
the chocolate-flavored

335
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,280
dental-dam-covered banana on stage?

336
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,980
Imagine this.

337
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,680
Okay?

338
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,820
Here's this bonfire.

339
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,640
These pagans are cavorting me.

340
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,840
I'm naked around it.

341
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,360
These drums are throbbing.

342
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,980
And Sister Mary Squared,

343
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,260
your subgenius sister,

344
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,540
is there in her birthday suit,

345
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,140
embellished with arcane body-paint symbology,

346
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,760
sort of like the Illustrated Man,

347
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,640
and wearing a garland of vines

348
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,940
around her head like a fertility sprite.

349
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,600
And she's 21 years old,

350
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,460
and she's on knockout,

351
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,820
and she's scampering up to couples

352
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,740
with this bag of honey dust,

353
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:45,680
saying,

354
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,180
on the honey dust ferry,

355
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,340
where would you like to be licked by your honey?

356
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,140
And she dusts them

357
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,460
with this edible honey dust

358
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,700
wherever they say they want it.

359
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
You know, they get embarrassed,

360
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,300
like, oh gosh, my neck,

361
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,640
all over my face,

362
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,620
or down my pants.

363
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,580
And so she dusts each of the couple,

364
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,500
and they would then proceed

365
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,040
to lick off

366
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,400
the honey dust from each other.

367
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,440
It's a lascivious thing, dear friends.

368
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,380
Praise Bob, and hail Connie,

369
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,780
and Connie's star is rising,

370
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,660
I can tell you that.

371
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,520
And then, of course,

372
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,240
there's the short-duration marriages

373
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,260
and the lascivious preaching.

374
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,880
I must have married about a hundred couples,

375
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,200
groups, individuals, mammals,

376
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,580
you name it.

377
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,040
I mean, people marry their dog.

378
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,040
If they don't have a sweetie with them,

379
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,320
they marry their wallet, their whatever.

380
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,420
And although that subgenius marriage

381
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,740
may last only 24 hours,

382
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,400
you better believe me when I say

383
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,780
these young folks take advantage of it,

384
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,920
friends, to the hilt.

385
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,420
To the hilt.

386
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,380
Ah, yes, yes.

387
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,260
True love can exist

388
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,540
even in the age of paranoia.

389
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,640
And drugs.

390
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,960
You want to know about the drugs, I know.

391
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,680
Well, one of the guests there was Timothy,

392
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,320
Dr. Timothy Leary,

393
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,200
Dr. Tim, who did a fantastic couple of lectures.

394
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,020
And...

395
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,620
Anybody who puts down Dr. Tim

396
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,820
hasn't seen him lately, that's all I can say.

397
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,380
He's a very funny guy,

398
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,860
a true mutant.

399
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,780
But after the fireworks show,

400
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,380
heard in the background here,

401
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,240
the multimedia electric performance art,

402
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,580
mega psychedelic light show,

403
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,140
industrial music,

404
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,540
extravaganza by Reverend St. Ron Slade.

405
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,280
And you'd have to see my videos of this to believe it.

406
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,680
After this giant outdoor spectacular,

407
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,560
this subgenius comes up to me.

408
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,280
And he hands me a bag of marijuana.

409
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,540
Common street marijuana.

410
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,300
And he says,

411
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,420
Reverend Stang, I was gonna give it to Tim Leary,

412
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,900
but he's not here, so well, I figured I'd give it to you.

413
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,020
And I really appreciated that sentiment.

414
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,520
But when I got off and smelled it,

415
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,860
I realized what it was.

416
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,740
It was this illegal substance,

417
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,500
and not a particularly odorous strain of it,

418
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,480
to tell the truth.

419
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,740
And, uh...

420
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,080
You know, of course I threw it away,

421
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,500
because none of us ever break the law.

422
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,940
And besides,

423
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,620
I had FROP to smoke.

424
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,960
Real HabaFROP Zipulops grown in Tibet,

425
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,260
and not, I repeat, not an illegal drug.

426
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,100
Now, there were a lot of people there,

427
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,900
heard in the background,

428
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,360
uh, who I suspect may have been making

429
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,960
responsible adult use of certain chemical and vegetable sacraments,

430
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,420
but you know me, I'm Mr. Straight.

431
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,600
I'm high on Bob.

432
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,320
Well, FROP, that's something different.

433
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,000
You can't, you can't come down from...

434
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,860
FROP or Bob.

435
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,880
But what I thought was most impressive,

436
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,620
really a lot more impressive than any of that,

437
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,740
was when I passed a homemade stand

438
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,960
by the campfire,

439
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,660
where a lot of little,

440
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,780
actually just a couple of little ten-year-old girls

441
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,100
were giving out free s'mores.

442
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,400
You know, the graham crackers with chocolate and toasted marshmallows.

443
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,980
They were the greatest s'mores in the world.

444
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,940
The s'mores you ever tasted.

445
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,240
These little girls were putting everything they had

446
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,900
into cooking them up right,

447
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,740
and they were giving them away

448
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,340
to anybody who came by.

449
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,080
For free, dear friends, for free!

450
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:54,280
Now, I later discovered that their parents ran the coffee stand

451
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,680
at the altar to the goddess Caffeina,

452
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,160
at which I worshipped a lot.

453
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,560
But it was just so cute.

454
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,200
And you know what else was cute at this thing?

455
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,400
The subgenius event.

456
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Well, it was all kind of intertwined,

457
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,240
but there were these pure subgenius periods

458
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,580
around the Big Tent.

459
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,160
Reverend Velveteen Sly did this

460
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,340
Connie channeling performance one night

461
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,780
that was both ultra-sexy and ultra-feminist.

462
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,940
That is sort of truly Connie-istic.

463
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,720
And you know, dear friends,

464
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,700
subgenius feminism blows other feminism out of the water,

465
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,680
because it's so much more feminine.

466
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,020
And another practitioner of this art

467
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,460
is of course the new superstar of subgenius,

468
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,340
church preacher, Sister Mary Squared.

469
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,180
And now, in our first D-Vival,

470
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,020
I had given this discourse on

471
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,600
premutantian yeti biology and culture.

472
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,600
Sort of a scientifically lewd description of yeti sex,

473
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,160
which I can never play on the radio.

474
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,940
But I was totally upstaged

475
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,420
when Sister Mary came out

476
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,660
completely stark, raving, nude,

477
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:17,140
and delivered a startling rant on just about everything.

478
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,980
And excerpts will be covered in upcoming shows

479
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,960
if we ever get enough pledges from you cheapskates

480
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,760
to continue those shows.

481
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,260
And you'll stand up to attention

482
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,680
when you hear this stuff, friends.

483
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,940
And women will be inspired to grab their slack

484
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,460
and the guys will be inspired to help out whenever possible.

485
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:38,960
Huuuh!

486
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,240
And we got at Starwood,

487
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,200
we discovered that we're about to have

488
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,560
a lot more homosexual representation.

489
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,120
There was this one gay subgenius member,

490
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,080
so to speak,

491
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,080
who's working on the brag of the queer subgenius.

492
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,160
Now I'm really looking forward to that.

493
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,800
Anyway, it was all just astounding, dear friends.

494
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,240
It was astounding.

495
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,900
It was so much fun.

496
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,000
For me to be in this place

497
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,380
with all this pure fun going on

498
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:12,400
in the company of such other subgenius

499
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,160
and hour of slack illuminaries

500
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,880
as Reverend Gleepo Abernathy

501
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,760
and Reverend Gobi

502
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,200
and so many others.

503
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,340
And the devil girls who danced in red body paint

504
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,020
and just about nothing else

505
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,040
left over from our MTV shoot

506
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,260
did their thing again around the bonfire.

507
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,180
And it had rained and there was mud everywhere.

508
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,480
Woodstock style.

509
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,320
And at one point the naked bonfire dancers

510
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,960
had groveled in the mud

511
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,980
and were dancing around like mud men and mad men.

512
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,300
And at some point,

513
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,520
Dr. Legume,

514
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,020
a fine Pennsylvania subgenius doctor

515
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,860
whose first Starwood this was,

516
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,440
came up to me and said,

517
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,120
you know, this is pretty impressive,

518
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,560
but from where I come from,

519
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,180
we worship plastic and electrical appliances.

520
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,400
And so,

521
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,100
some of this didn't make a lick of sense to me.

522
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,400
And we usually danced naked around the microwave

523
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,320
or the food processor or the dishwasher or something.

524
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,080
And I used the TV myself to do that.

525
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:24,420
I heard the coolest subgenius line

526
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,420
at Starwood.

527
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,380
Now I don't know who it originally came from,

528
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,320
but it was this.

529
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,840
And it applies,

530
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,980
to why you're not calling in with your pledge money.

531
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,840
That excuse is so lame,

532
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,040
not even Bob could make it walk.

533
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,100
And Sister Mary Squared added the punchline,

534
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,040
no, but Connie sure could.

535
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,740
Huh!

536
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,400
And after it was all over

537
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,800
and starting to close down,

538
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,680
Reverend Gobi and I were talking about this and that

539
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,200
and how totally amazing the whole festival was.

540
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:19,900
And she said,

541
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,300
Reverend Stang, do you believe in magic now?

542
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,640
And I said to her, somewhat haughtily,

543
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,640
Reverend Gobi,

544
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,720
I believe in that which leads to the path of least resistance.

545
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,620
I practice no mind and break thinking.

546
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,060
I follow the hints and the synchronicities in my life.

547
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,560
And I tithe to Bob.

548
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,620
So does that answer your question?

549
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,020
Magic? Hell no, I'm a rationalist.

550
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,560
I'm no religious nut.

551
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,740
It's the magic of Bob, friends.

552
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,060
Bob and Connie.

553
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,740
You can't have one without the other.

554
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,880
Well, actually, you can't have Bob,

555
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,700
but you can have,

556
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,480
you can have Connie without Bob,

557
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,880
but you can't have Bob without Connie.

558
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,900
Because he won't have it.

559
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,920
Well, I probably ought to quit talking about the Starwood thing

560
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,500
and play some tapes from it.

561
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,820
I do have tapes from it coming up.

562
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,600
But in the meantime,

563
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,460
happy Llamas to you pagans who might be listening.

564
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,620
As far as I can tell, there are none in Texas.

565
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,640
Today is the day

566
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,580
of the Druid holiday of Llamas,

567
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,620
when they burn the Wicker Man.

568
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,560
And that's what my friends in Cleveland are doing right now.

569
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,380
The person they like the least in their little tribe

570
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,040
is being burned alive in a giant wicker basket

571
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,480
shaped like a man.

572
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,460
And all the pagan-affiliated subgenius radio ministers

573
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,780
who played this show specifically told me to say hi to y'all

574
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:56,800
from Reverend Sly, Reverend Gopi, and Reverend Bleepo.

575
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,620
Oh, and I have one last thing to say.

576
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:03,320
If anybody listening happened to pick up my bright red psychedelic notebook

577
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,080
full of new subgenius book notes

578
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,380
from the Starwood stage,

579
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,760
please return it to the subgenius P.O. box.

580
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,520
Just the handwritten notes. That's all we need.

581
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,480
Oh, yes.

582
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,060
And this music that's playing in the background

583
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,660
is, in fact...

584
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,900
Well, I'm gonna stop it right here and say what it is.

585
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,580
It's, I guess, a band and or album

586
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,240
called Collapse

587
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,340
by Reverend Geno Side

588
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,500
in Virginia Beach.

589
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,420
Virginia.

590
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,060
Yes, yes.

591
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:49,400
And, uh, well, I know what I'm gonna be playing in the background from now on.

592
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,180
It's a beautiful thing.

593
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,300
I'm gonna go ahead and run some tape

594
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,780
of Starwood.

595
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,720
Here are, uh, coming up

596
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,600
some brief moments, uh, that I'm gonna play.

597
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,840
I happen to catch from tape

598
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,540
from the Starwood preaching.

599
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,200
We do appreciate those of you who have called in your pledges.

600
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,860
You're the only ones that these people are speaking to.

601
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,320
You're the only ones that this music has done for.

602
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,600
This, uh, Collapse music by Reverend Geno Side.

603
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,720
And you're the one that Reverend Velveteen Sly

604
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:25,900
and that, uh, uh, Sister Mary Squared Alcontrera

605
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,440
are speaking to

606
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,020
in these, uh,

607
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,760
amazing, authentic revival tapes.

608
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,420
Ah, yes, and praise Bob.

609
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,680
Women think it's another baseball team.

610
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,480
And those old men in power holding tight

611
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:46,220
the binding structures of class, race, and sex.

612
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,260
Those men cry treason and treachery.

613
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,340
Nothing is worse than your mates who let you down.

614
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,440
And those men who let you down.

615
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:00,440


616
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:00,440


617
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:00,440


618
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,160
Oh, my God.

619
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,760
Jesus did?

620
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,060
Yeah, he did a jamming version.

621
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,540
In 32?

622
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,600
Back in 32.

623
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,420
Not in 1932.

624
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,620
Them was some lean years.

625
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,120
His was some lean years.

626
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,680
I was on the Mideast tour with him.

627
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,820
One day I found him dead on the crapper,

628
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,700
just like Elvis.

629
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,460
And I had to take him off.

630
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,260
He'd wipe to death on his own vomit.

631
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,460
I had to wash his beard.

632
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,500
You're the guy who did death for Jesus?

633
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,640
And I had to, yeah, because he was already croaked, you know.

634
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,940
And I had to take him out and nail him up on the cross myself

635
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,980
because I knew what was going to happen, you know,

636
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,440
once he was dead, all his fans were going to get together.

637
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,700
And I bought his contract real cheap from his manager

638
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,500
and sold it to the Christians afterwards.

639
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
See, I had to nail him up because if not,

640
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,600
all these Catholics, they'd be going in the Catholic church,

641
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,180
but instead of going like this, they'd be squatting and grunting, you know.

642
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,380
And that's a little bit too close to experimentation for me.

643
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,720
But, you know, after I sold him,

644
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,320
I don't get any royalties either out of them using Jesus.

645
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,820
Oh, I have no wonder you feel guilty.

646
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,680
I just feel stupid.

647
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,780
No, actually, I just kind of feel guilty

648
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,360
that I sold him the contract in the first place.

649
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,460
Well, it's not pornography, officer.

650
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,760
It's empowerment.

651
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,640
That's right.

652
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,280
You're just empowering these people.

653
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,480
We'll be back with the answer after these messages.

654
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,080
These messages.

655
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:25,860
How did you...

656
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,260
How did you...

657
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,960
How did you get that little implant in your throat?

658
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,200
How much did that cost?

659
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,740
It was very expensive.

660
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,840
That little sampler you got in there.

661
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,540
I didn't have to pay for it.

662
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,120
The government grants that you...

663
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,820
The job, the radio station paid for it?

664
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:46,560
No, I think I learned it from the aliens when they picked me up.

665
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:47,540
Oh.

666
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,300
As a child.

667
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,900
Oh, you hadn't told me that story.

668
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,260
I figured there was probably something like that.

669
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,720
I figured there was something about aliens and sonar.

670
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:56,720


671
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:56,720


672
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:56,720


673
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:56,720


674
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:56,720


675
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:56,720


676
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:56,720


677
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,180
It's funny how many sub-geniuses have things inserted in them by the aliens.

678
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,940
Yeah, I don't know what I've got inserted in me.

679
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,520
Well, that voice synthesizer.

680
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,880
That's one of them.

681
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,720
There's other things, too.

682
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,400
Several different kinds of...

683
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:09,420
I like the...

684
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:13,840
Do that eight track trick where you can sing the songs in eight different voices at once.

685
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,800
Oh, no, that would scare people too much, I hope you get...

686
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,060
Spontaneously.

687
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,220
It's a pretty damn paleo one.

688
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:23,240


689
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:23,240


690
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:23,240


691
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:23,240


692
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:31,040
It's got to die so I can live again.

693
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,900
I got to die so I can live again.

694
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:46,760
If we let this go on now and everybody condones it,

695
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,720
how long is it before everybody is stark naked?

696
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,240
It's a mystery. It's a mystery.

697
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:56,360


698
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,820
It's a mystery.

699
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:17,000
Sorry about that premature immaculate conception a minute ago.

700
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,200
There was a little confusion backstage here.

701
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,940
Reverend Velveteen Sly,

702
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:22,360
uh,

703
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,760
is a radio,

704
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:24,700
uh,

705
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,460
minister from Madison,

706
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,180
Wisconsin.

707
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:30,880
Yeah.

708
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,300
One of them hippie towns.

709
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,560
But tonight she's,

710
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:34,640
uh,

711
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,800
going to tell you,

712
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:37,500
well,

713
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:43,080
she's going to do the cry of the little Connie.

714
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:43,980
Oh.

715
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,340
Reverend Velveteen Sly.

716
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,300
Praise Bob.

717
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:48,780
Yeah.

718
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,520
Hey,

719
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,260
little Connie.

720
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,340
Hey.

721
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:52,440
I said,

722
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,100
God.

723
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,280
But are you crazy?

724
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,080
Hey,

725
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,080


726
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,120
confronting you or something like that?

727
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,540
rup

728
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:27,760
me, no, don't do those things little boys do. Don't play that way with little boys.

729
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:35,780
Why can't I sit with my legs apart? Why can't I touch myself down here? Why are you always

730
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:41,300
telling me no? Why are you telling me no? When I grow up, I'm going to say yes. I'm

731
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:49,940
going to say yes all the time. Whenever I can, I'm going to say yes. Why do I have to

732
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:55,640
wear this silly dress? It makes me look like such a girl. I don't want to be a girl. I'm

733
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:04,500
a town girl. I'm daddy's little girl. I help daddy all the time. But I'll never be daddy's

734
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:09,800
little boy. I want to do the thing that boys get to do. I want to climb the trees. I don't

735
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:14,860
want this stupid dress. I want to take my shirt off and roll in the mud. Why can't I

736
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:19,920
do it? The boys get to do it. Why is it bad? Why are you telling me it's bad? Why are you

737
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:25,360
telling me it's bad? I want it. I want it. I want it. I want more. I want all of it.

738
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:30,320
I want it. I want it. I want to cry if I want to.

739
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:40,920
Well, who cares what the boys can do? Who cares what the boys can do? When I grow up

740
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:48,460
and I get bigger and I get older, I can do a lot of things the boys can't do. You just

741
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,000
wait.

742
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:49,920
You just wait.

743
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:57,680
I can do it. I can do it. Because I'm going to show you, I'm going to grow up to be a

744
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:07,540
Connie. To start like this. Under my little Catholic girl skirt. Yeah, I'm going to grow

745
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:12,020
up to be a Connie. I'm going to be a big girl. I'm going to grow up and I'm going to grow

746
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:19,900
out. I'm going to be a well-rounded woman. I won't be like my mother. I'm going to be

747
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:30,640
strong and I'll be good looking. I can bleed and not die. And I'm going to make you cry.

748
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:44,380
I can have multiple orgasms. I can keep you up all night. I want it. I want it. I want

749
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:49,540
more. I want more. I want it all and I want it now. And I'm going to get it.

750
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:55,800
Because I'm a Connie. No one's going to tell me no anymore. I'm going to say yes. I'm going

751
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:01,420
to say yes as much as I want. I'm going to say yes anytime I feel like it. And I always

752
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,660
feel like it.

753
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,180
So, you want to play?

754
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,120
I'm looking for a real doctor.

755
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,520
But,

756
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,440
that big boy,

757
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,360
with that long,

758
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,340
hot, hard,

759
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,280
slack-inch long, blood-filled

760
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:27,680
thermometer,

761
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,620
will do.

762
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,640
Thanks.

763
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,400
Oh, thank you,

764
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,720
Sister Velveteen Sly.

765
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,500
Uh-huh.

766
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,620
We are not mainstream people.

767
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,720
We are...

768
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,220
Of course, this is our

769
00:35:49,780 --> 00:36:00,140
temple here. I'm honored and again inspired to be here in this particular turf.

770
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,780
This is in Western New York State.

771
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:11,360
I'm sure you know that for the last 300 years or 200 years, Western New York State was one

772
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:17,360
of the great launching out spots for the Movement-

773
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,500
Well, one of these Googles are good.

774
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:18,500


775
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:18,500


776
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:18,500


777
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:24,580
Outward and westward, we'll trust, into the 21st century.

778
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,860
You know, we're coming up with a millennium in seven of these decades.

779
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,020
I have tried to be anachronistic.

780
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,860
That's where I was born.

781
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:43,260
I checked it back, and I was conceived on the day that alcohol was made an illegal drug in this country.

782
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,180
Praise Dr. Taylor.

783
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,400
I consider that an omen.

784
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,500
Dick Dobbs, the anti-Bob.

785
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:05,540
And that's something that the conspiracy has stuck in to our little world to confuse us.

786
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,040
Because every girl always wanted to have a dick.

787
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,260
Because the guys could get away with murder in this little world.

788
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,040
But the conspiracy...

789
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,080
The conspiracy is set up.

790
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,600
So we would always run around and go,

791
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,740
Well, I want my dick.

792
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,920
I want to play around in the mud.

793
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,060
Why can't I go out and have my hairy G.I. Joe and have him get together with my Barbie doll?

794
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:34,600
Why can't I have a Barbie doll that can run around and have a gun?

795
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,800
And they confused us.

796
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,460
And that's what I want to talk about.

797
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:44,540
I want to talk about the initiation into the church of the subgenius.

798
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,620
I'm the Reverend Mary Squared, au contraire.

799
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:57,600
And as soon as I can get this microphone in mind, I'll come around and talk to you all.

800
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,860
With my hole.

801
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:08,960
So I want to talk about the initiation into the church of the subgenius,

802
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:13,500
which is all about recovering the true yetis within ourselves.

803
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,060
They're in there.

804
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:15,160
They're in there.

805
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,000
And I know somewhere there is such a thing as genetic memory.

806
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,220
And we are genetic supremacists.

807
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:23,320
So we better start thinking while we can.

808
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,260
There's a Bob Dobbs and there's a Dick Dobbs.

809
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,000
And the two are one in the same but kind of separate.

810
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,560
And you've got to watch out for the dicks, ladies.

811
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,080
They'll get you every time.

812
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,260
My name is Mary.

813
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,020
This is my hole.

814
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,960
It comes fully.

815
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,160
It comes fully.

816
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:45,160


817
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:45,400
It comes fully.

818
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:45,400


819
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:45,400


820
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:45,400


821
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:45,400


822
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:45,400


823
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,580
It's equipped with a brain that can think for itself

824
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:50,280
and knows when to squeeze at the right time.

825
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,740
Thank you very much.

826
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,460
Hail, Connie.

827
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,040
Hail, Connie.

828
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,840
Dick's the kind of guy that'll try and trap you into a relationship

829
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,560
and tell you that he wants to be with you forever

830
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:08,920
and wants you to get down on your knees and bark for him like a dog.

831
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,100
I'd love to tell you all about this story.

832
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:14,720
We're going to have a down-home religious devival.

833
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:15,260
We're going to have a fun day.

834
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,700
We're going to be casting out of false prophets.

835
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,880
Is everybody ready to be saved?

836
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,900
Is everybody ready to be healed?

837
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,260
All right.

838
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,060
Well, I guess I'll begin with this story.

839
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,160
I really don't have a rant prepared.

840
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:37,460
Normally I'm the kind of ranner that has everything down to a tee nice

841
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:40,220
and squared away so I've got myself covered.

842
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,420
But this time I'm uncovering everything.

843
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:48,260
It's time to pull the wool over our own eyes and rip the veil down. Don't you think?

844
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,900
So I brought a bunch of props I don't like using a podium I like to talk with my whole body

845
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:01,220
Kind of puts the emphasis in all the right places just like the yetis

846
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:10,080
So I came to Starwood because I've been busy doing this show the marriage of Bob and Connie

847
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,720
Which some of you may have seen?

848
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:20,000
Yeah, I decided that I wanted to be in the magic community and learn all about magic, but I

849
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:25,920
Didn't really go into the Namby Pamby wiccans. I don't get offended

850
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,720
I've learned a lot from all of you wiccan people out there and all of you thelemites

851
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:38,220
But I decided to invent my own magic techno magic time plus money equals slack

852
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:47,320
It's a real easy concept to get except that the conspiracy is always trying to cover that up

853
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:52,020
You see you can't avoid the noise, but you can

854
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,760
Annoy the void

855
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,720
So I set up this altar at my campground because I wanted to banish

856
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,060
unhealthy male sexuality

857
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,720
Choke my chicken no

858
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,260
Choke your chicken. Thank you very much

859
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,840
Because it's time to get rid of our chickens and to start acting like we're true yetis

860
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,720
They say that myths aren't made anymore. Well all

861
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:25,880
contraire

862
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:33,000
There are myths and stories and heroes right among us now and everybody has their own million dollars to make

863
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,080
And when you start remembering that you're true yetis, you'll start really living

864
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:43,080
And then you'll have a story to tell and if you have any Bob or Connie in you

865
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:48,240
You'll start writing it down so you can make that million dollars. I

866
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,200
was inspired

867
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,960
by the word of J.R. Bob Dobbs

868
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:05,840
This piece is by sister melodious chops and her choir of prehensile membrane and

869
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:11,860
And we did this this thing this whole like extravaganza sort of thing

870
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:15,940
the marriage of Bob and Connie and

871
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:21,720
as that was the rant and rave and as that was in rehearsal these these I

872
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,840
don't know these songs the Bob just like, you know, just fall out of my head and

873
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,160
This is one of them

874
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,640
I

875
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,620
Will I used to be a sinner cuz I truly did believe

876
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:58,700
That the Virgin Mary Jesus and me worth the gas thief and he's to give my dough to tell

877
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:05,760
evangelistic snob, but then the light it's shown upon me and I found J.R. Bob Dobbs and now

878
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,560
my wallet

879
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,960
belongs to Bob

880
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,820
Yes my wallet belongs to Bob

881
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:19,760
Well, my heart is for my honey and my brain is for my job

882
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,660
But my wallet belongs to Bob

883
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,820
Well Bobby goes a-frappin' every chance that he can get

884
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:40,920
He can outperform the biggest without even breaking sweat

885
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:48,180
So I gave him all my money reverend stank that it was right and for only $20

886
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,500
He did save my soul tonight

887
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,580
So my wallet belongs to Bob

888
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:59,180
Yes my wallet belongs to Bob

889
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,000
No more can the conspiracy my lowly wages rob

890
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:05,680
my

891
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,260
My wallet belongs to Bob.

892
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:21,640
Well, Bobby's got a sweetie, and Connie is her name.

893
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:26,440
And her ways could put the sacred whore of Babylon to shame.

894
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:31,060
She reaches in Bob's pocket, feels around for something hard,

895
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:35,880
then pulls her hand out holding on to his mighty credit card.

896
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:39,660
So my wallet belongs to Bob.

897
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,640
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob.

898
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:50,260
And I never have to fear, because I know Connie's on the job.

899
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:54,560
And my wallet belongs to Bob.

900
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:07,220
Well, you may have your lady and your horny green man, too.

901
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,740
Their elemental energy may be what's right for you.

902
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:16,980
But someday you'll grow weary of those paganistic cults

903
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:21,300
and give away your money to the one that gets results.

904
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:25,200
And then your wallet will be Bob.

905
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,000
Yes, your wallet will be for Bob.

906
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:36,440
And you will be subgenius, not another stupid slob.

907
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,100
Because your wallet will be for Bob.

908
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:51,140
Well, I believe I am much calmer.

909
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:57,240
Got the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer sitting on the dashboard of my car.

910
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:58,880
Pray.

911
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,360
Praise Bob!

912
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,240
Praise Bob!

913
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:17,780
Yeah! Enjoy the rest of the Kaisers. Thank you very much.

914
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,240
Praise Bob!

915
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,740
Please answer the show.

916
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,180
Yes, praise Bob.

917
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,220
Kill Bob!

918
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,220
Kill Bob!

919
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,500
If you meet Bob on the road, kill him.

920
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:28,960
Yeah!

921
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:34,120
Decapitate him, hurl his head into space and do whatever you want with the bleeding neck stump.

922
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,300
How was that?

923
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,140
It was beautiful.

924
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,400
It was beautiful.

925
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,740
It was beautiful.

926
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:45,640
It was beautiful.

927
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:46,000
It was beautiful.

928
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:48,900
And...

929
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:51,180
on...

930
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:54,040
For those of you out of town...

931
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,960
And especially for those of you in Chicago...

932
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:07,040
Don't forget the World Subgenius Convention coming up September 4th through 6th.

933
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:13,920
This is the closest thing to a subgenius woodstock.

934
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,580
It's, like I say, in Chicago.

935
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:22,680
And I'm about to give you the address to write to for free information.

936
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,200
Go ahead and write to us here.

937
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:31,710
Here at the Church of the Subgenius, Dallas Headquarters.

938
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:43,870
We'll send you that free information at P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

939
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:49,710
But if you're listening to one of the three stations in Chicago that play the Hour of Slack,

940
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:54,610
then just be ready to go to the Prop Theater

941
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:57,610
on September 4th.

942
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:02,030
And you will encounter Robert Shay, co-author of Illuminatus,

943
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:05,650
Sister Mary Squared Au Contrere, preaching.

944
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:09,490
Sister Velveteen Sly plans to be there.

945
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:12,290
I will be there with G. Gordon Gordon.

946
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:20,610
And above all, the swinging love corpses will be at the Chicago World Subgenius Convention

947
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:23,430
September 4th in Chicago.

948
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:29,890
We have given you every possible way to get the information you need.

949
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:34,650
And if you don't have it by now, then you probably don't deserve to be there either.

950
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:40,410
I'm really sick and tired of the number of gimme bobs and fake subgeniuses out there.

951
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:40,930
Want to be?

952
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:48,530
Oh yeah, we want to support Bob in every way as long as it doesn't slightly inconvenience us.

953
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:49,170
Yeah.

954
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:52,470
Um, but, uh...

955
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,510
Yes, the only way to do it...

956
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:57,350
Well, I'm gonna give you a phone number to call.

957
00:48:58,430 --> 00:48:58,850
In Chicago.

958
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:01,510
Got your pencil ready?

959
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:08,310
312-738-0985

960
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:15,690
That's 312-738-0985 for information about the World Subgenius Convention

961
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:22,250
with all the fanatical preaching, all the naked babes and dudes,

962
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:27,110
all the lascivious behavior that we have been discussing this evening

963
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:28,370
will be yours.

964
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:30,350
Yes, it will be yours.

965
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:39,810
And I wish I had more time to tell you all the, um, madness and truth that has happened here and to us.

966
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:44,710
I learned many amazing facts about myself at Starwood that I didn't know,

967
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:48,770
all emanating from the subgenius rumor mill of those who never met me.

968
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:51,510
It seems your pastor, Reverend Stang,

969
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:54,130
has this reputation that precedes him.

970
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:57,410
In fact, it precedes my having done any of it, but I ain't complaining.

971
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:02,990
The gays in Madison said they'd heard I liked to hit on young men.

972
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:03,710
Mm-hmm.

973
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:07,950
Somebody else said they heard I had a whole harem of girls somewhere.

974
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:12,330
In Rochester, they thought Sister Mary Squared was my new young wife.

975
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,310
And she is, but only one of them.

976
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:16,190
Some had heard I was blind.

977
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:20,550
Some expected a bloated nerd instead of a skinny hippie.

978
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:24,170
And my friends, I want you to know anything you hear from anybody about me,

979
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:25,510
it's all true.

980
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:27,670
So tell all your friends.

981
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:32,530
In fact, you can tell your Christian friends that your preacher gets more action

982
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:37,070
than Jimmy Swagger, Jim Baker, Jim Jones, and Bob Tilton all put together.

983
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:41,030
I'm the reincarnation of Rasputin, dear friends.

984
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:42,630
Bob is a sex god.

985
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:44,110
Connie is goddess.

986
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:45,530
Yo, Pan!

987
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:47,370
Yog-so-fav!

988
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:48,110
Hoo!

989
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:50,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

990
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:54,430
And for those of you who just can't seem to come up with the money,

991
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:56,670
here's what I have to say to you.

992
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:59,830
With the help of D.K. Jones and Reverend Bruce Grant,

993
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:01,770
here's what I have to say to you.

994
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:07,850
In answer to your first question, can good Bob quit you a job?

995
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:11,310
Why, hi, homie, shite, Bob the Doggy!

996
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:13,210
Or I'll be gobs of gully gosh.

997
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:17,810
You better puke your pee on full-throttle pumpkin teat.

998
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:22,710
Elsewise, your wonks'll be a wagon down on Mammy's hind nanny.

999
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:28,470
Cause there's a case of slaves and slack robbers out to chop your slobber.

1000
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:33,350
Pigs and dicks lickin' the cheeky-spinky off your tongue.

1001
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:36,070
Just when you're ripin', throw them the load.

1002
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:38,150
Slap back them and bomb out.

1003
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:41,630
They don't want your bone to be.

1004
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:45,890
And if you got the cleft in step, mommy-o,

1005
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:49,630
they'll hate your worth eight ways worse.

1006
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:53,890
So why can't you please them, proper squeeze them

1007
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:57,590
when the gushers are goin' all normal and anti-right-linin'?

1008
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:00,990
Crushin' those gangsta sets in your sneezin' chamber?

1009
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:05,110
Tastin' an empty platter in your beanbag, boy?

1010
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:07,650
Where's your rollerballs at?

1011
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:13,710
I can't drop me no love-ro on these luchu-luchu logo bands.

1012
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:15,870
They cut your check, per se.

1013
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:18,450
Water your creamery comin' and goin'.

1014
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:21,470
And the slobber to love it won't be the ewer of it.

1015
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:26,430
Cause the slacky-taps of the grinning sinners be their claw to bleed.

1016
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:29,290
They are dogs who do ya,

1017
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:32,770
but you are lettin' them bang down the barn doors.

1018
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:36,950
And your cows are gettin' it and out.

1019
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:39,150
You be gonna moon the man

1020
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:45,010
or volley him mooin' to the slashter house like good babies.

1021
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:50,970
You're gonna have to spreech English, Jake.

1022
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:54,450
Get right with your muscle snake, snub monkey.

1023
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:59,250
Quick spritz in your blizzerer, lessen it snowin' like lube juice.

1024
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:02,990
Elsewise, you're clean bleeders blowin' hot water.

1025
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:06,610
You'll co-blind or please your neater tryin' not to.

1026
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:10,250
Either way, you're gettin' up on the wrong side orbit

1027
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:13,770
to this kind of free-peed-needed side trade.

1028
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:14,970
Well?

1029
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:18,530
Or won't you gonna just stand there like a damnin' nickel slug?

1030
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:22,330
Or you gonna puss your clipperer in a righteous hargony?

1031
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:23,870
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, boy.

1032
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:27,310
You got weenie ribbers in your fluter tubes.

1033
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:31,730
A joint gumption with the true and the seed brave.

1034
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:33,770
And pee for bald man?

1035
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:35,990
It's sin, your genes.

1036
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:40,130
Buy out the gland owners with what you earn.

1037
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:43,210
With your skinny, peelin' face of pain.

1038
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:46,270
Bleeds a piece of the fine ass.

1039
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:49,090
Have a fuzzy, big bollock.

1040
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:54,890
And strut your heart-fest soft blow for the rack-oil of the rocket racket.

1041
00:53:55,150 --> 00:54:00,410
This space outer belongs to your worship and the crutch of your choice toys.

1042
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:04,990
And Ivan, fallin' in the flush-lugger appears to let him stack.

1043
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:06,350
You know who's a-comin'?

1044
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:11,430
Them kids ain't keen to hob on nobody, no sir, ma'am.

1045
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:13,170
Can you just order?

1046
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:14,250
They're breakin' the buzzer of the good.

1047
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:17,070
And they'll be scorned by your baby.

1048
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:20,130
But this has been your Re-Annunciator.

1049
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:21,270
Thank me.

1050
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:28,550
Thank me.

1051
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:33,330
Thank me.

1052
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:35,530
Thank me.

1053
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:56,490
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1054
00:54:56,790 --> 00:55:03,610
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius, send a self-addressed stamped envelope to...

1055
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:04,610
Got your pencil ready?

1056
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:11,350
Bob. Post Office Box 140306. Dallas, Texas 75214.

1057
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:18,890
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1058
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:21,930
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

1059
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:39,910
At last I have control of your radio tubes.

1060
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:41,490
And I do too.

1061
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:43,950
Good. This is Ren Hoack.

1062
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:46,990
And this is Stimson J. Catt of the Ren and Stimpy Show.

1063
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:50,930
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack on KNON.

1064
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:52,870
Keep listening, you idiots.

1065
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:54,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1066
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:56,270
Else I shall kill you.

1067
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:57,490
Star Wars.

1068
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:02,270
Star Wars.

1069
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:04,470
Star Wars.

1070
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:07,950
Star Wars.

1071
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:07,970
Star Wars.

1072
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:08,750
Star Wars.

1073
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:09,890
Star Wars.

1074
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:09,890


1075
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:09,890


1076
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:09,890


1077
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:09,890


1078
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:09,890


1079
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:09,890


1080
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:09,890


1081
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:35,830
Star Wars.

1082
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:37,950
Star Wars.

1083
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:39,390
Star Wars.

1084
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:39,890
Star Wars.

1085
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1086
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1087
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1088
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1089
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1090
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1091
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1092
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1093
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1094
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1095
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1096
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1097
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1098
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1099
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1100
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1101
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1102
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1103
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1104
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1105
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1106
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1107
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1108
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1109
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1110
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1111
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,890


1112
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:41,930
Sing along with me

1113
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:44,390
Starwood

1114
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:45,450
Starwood

1115
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:48,870
It's easy if you see

1116
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:51,250
Starwood

1117
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:53,230
Get out of Starwood

1118
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:55,990
Come and leave your worries behind

1119
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:58,110
Starwood

1120
00:56:58,110 --> 00:56:59,650
Get out of Starwood

1121
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:01,490
Come and exercise

1122
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:04,290
And microwave your mind

1123
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:06,490
Starwood

1124
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:09,730
Starwood

1125
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:09,730


1126
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:15,630
Yeah, but if you can get over Catholic Church, you can get over anything.

1127
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:18,010
The Catholic Church never had a...

1128
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,490
Maybe I'm not a...

1129
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:24,110
The Catholic Church has driven many youths into the arms of Bob.

1130
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:26,250
But I was not one of them.

1131
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:28,290
And into the arms of paganism.

1132
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:32,710
Yeah, where would the pagans and the subgenius types and weirdos be

1133
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:36,170
without the conspiracy, the Baptists, the Catholics,

1134
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:36,470
and everything else?

1135
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:38,450
Every other kind of fundamentalist.

1136
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:41,230
Including the fundamentalist witches.

1137
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:45,250
There is such a thing.

1138
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:49,470
And it's sad because I was thinking about it.

1139
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:53,430
I mean, for the most part, this is such a cool crowd.

1140
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:56,530
It's not mostly fundamentalist witches, but I...

1141
00:57:57,270 --> 00:58:00,190
Every now and then you run into some that you think...

1142
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:03,930
Now, 200 years ago, these people would have been burning witches.

1143
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,370
And now they call themselves witches.

1144
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:09,250
And anyway, they're trying to burn somebody else.

1145
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:14,630
Sometimes they want to burn me or other subgeniuses because we...

1146
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:17,970
Well, for a long time, we weren't politically correct

1147
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:20,830
because there were not enough women actively involved.

1148
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:21,550
That's right.

1149
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:23,890
And that has changed.

1150
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:29,130
And we've published a very pornographic subgenius magazine recently that...

1151
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,090
But it was not...

1152
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,470
It was more like pornography for women than for men.

1153
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:34,710
It had a lot of pictures of...

1154
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:36,210
Well, it was pretty nasty.

1155
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:37,530
Swing and meet Jesus.

1156
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:39,110
Yeah, swing and meet Jesus.

1157
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:44,750
And, boy, my friends in Berkeley, my male friends in Berkeley,

1158
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:47,090
were terribly upset and offended by it and said,

1159
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:49,330
that's going to drive all the gals out of the church.

1160
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:51,270
But they were thinking human gals.

1161
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:53,050
They weren't thinking about subgenius gals.

1162
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:54,250
That's a whole different thing.

1163
00:58:54,530 --> 00:59:00,930
And so the next issue promises to be even more disgusting and rude and sexist,

1164
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:02,390
but it's almost all by women.

1165
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:02,870
Yeah!

1166
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:06,070
Honest.

1167
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:12,550
Oh, hey, you know, the Ace people just told me that they have now counted,

1168
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:16,390
so far, 800 adults at this festival.

1169
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:17,810
800 people.

1170
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:20,070
Starwood is a free concert now.

1171
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:21,150
Tear down the fences.

1172
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:23,630
This is a city.

1173
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:26,690
The New York State Thruway is closed, man.

1174
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:31,410
So far, as far as we know, this is the largest neo-pagan gathering

1175
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:33,090
that's ever happened in the U.S.

1176
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:33,790
Ever, ever.

1177
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:39,990
Every day of the week, I'm in a different city.

1178
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:46,930
If I stay too long, the people try to pull me down.

1179
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:47,990
You don't really need me.

1180
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:50,970
We talk about it like a dog.

1181
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:53,890
We talk about the books I've read.

1182
00:59:55,130 --> 01:00:00,710
But they don't realize they're the ones who swear, baby.

1183
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:01,390
Hey!

1184
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:02,630
And that's why.

1185
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:06,190
Lord, you can't hold me.

1186
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:06,550
Yeah.

1187
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:10,250
I don't want to be tied down.

1188
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:10,910
I don't.

1189
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:12,910
I got to move on.

1190
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:14,370
Hey!

1191
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:16,210
Starbreeze.

1192
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:19,050
Yeah, it's a deal with a breeze, baby.

1193
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:20,070
Starbreeze.

1194
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:22,190
I said the ride's a breeze.

1195
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:23,650
Starbreeze.

1196
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:23,950
Yeah.

1197
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:25,690
I can't stay out.

1198
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:27,790
Nothing, nothing can win.

1199
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:29,510
Hey!

1200
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:34,050
Oh, I'm too loose, baby.

1201
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:40,090
I'm too loose, baby.

1202
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:40,090


1203
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:40,930
Listen to this woman, I said.

1204
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:45,030
Women here, women there try to keep it up.

1205
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:45,990
I said, okay.

1206
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:53,290
But they don't realize that it's so easy to break, baby.

1207
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:58,290
Yeah, but sometimes, sometimes I did lose my heart.

1208
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:00,350
Kind of getting harder.

1209
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:03,550
That's when I got to move.

1210
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:06,190
Before I get the...

1211
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:36,170
Come on.

1212
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:40,270
So relax your breath.

1213
01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:06,930
So relax your breath.
