1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
Stay tuned for the PR news, then next up, Bob and the genius, our old Spock.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,000
I never miss it.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,220
Yeah, right.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:16,860
What's your name?

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,620
Bobby.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,800
Party's moving to Bobby's house, everybody.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:21,740
Come on!

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,440
We fought it best to curtail Jimmy's altar boy activities for the moment.

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,900
Come on, he thought it was grape juice.

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,520
No, I didn't.

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,960
He doesn't know what he's saying. He's drunk. Cut us some slack.

12
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,920
I'm a nun, mister. I don't do slack.

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,020
Slack.

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,420
All right.

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:52,160
No one would have believed in the last years of the 19th century that this world was being washed keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's.

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,100
They were scrutinized and studied.

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,420
Perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinize the trenchant craft.

18
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,980
Creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.

19
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:02,860
Relution.

20
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,300
And I'm out to do.

21
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,120
No one gave a thought to the older worlds of spaces.

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,260
So should you.

23
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,740
Or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable.

24
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,880
It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days.

25
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,960
Most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars.

26
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,080
Perhaps.

27
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,340
In.

28
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,440
inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise.

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:41,600
Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish.

30
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:53,100
Intellects, vast, cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.

31
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,640
Early in the 20th century came the great disillusionment.

32
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,120
The great disillusionment.

33
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:06,040
And before we judge them too harshly, we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought.

34
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:13,580
Not only upon animals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its own inferior races.

35
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:24,920
The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by European immigrants in the space of 50 years.

36
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,120
Are we such apostles of mercy as to complain?

37
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,380
Are we such warriors of the same spirit?

38
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:44,600
During the opposition of 1894, a great light was seen on the illuminated part of the disk, first in the Lick Observatory, then by Perrotin of Nice, and then by other observers.

39
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,800
English readers put it at first in the issue of Nature, dated August 7th.

40
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,800
So bring your...

41
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,720
I'm inclined to think that this blaze may have been the casting of the huge guns.

42
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,480
So bring your...

43
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,340
The vast hits sunk into their planet from which their shots were fired.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,960
The peculiar markings and different things behind it were seen near the site of that outbreak during the next two oppositions.

45
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,500
The storm burst upon us six years ago now.

46
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:23,600
As Mars approached opposition, the veil of Java set the wires of the astral-temporal exchange palpitating with the amazing intelligence of the huge outbreak of incandescent gas upon the planet.

47
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,220
It had occurred towards midnight of the 12th.

48
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,800
The spectroscope...

49
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,320
The lights of the telescope...

50
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,140
...to which the table once resorted indicated a mass of flaming gas.

51
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:33,720
Table.

52
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,380
Uhhhh

53
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:59,320
No fishing, no swimming, no smoking, no exit, no time, no doubt, no win, no big deal, no kidding, no point, no shirt, no shoes, no service, no space, no place, no where, no care, no fault, no money, no loss, no pain, no comfort, no loss, no air...

54
00:03:59,320 --> 00:03:59,320


55
00:03:59,320 --> 00:03:59,320


56
00:03:59,320 --> 00:03:59,320


57
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:08,980
woman, no cry, no problem, no sugar, no one, nobody, no mercy, no relief, no duh, no dogs,

58
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:17,800
no cats, no pets, no glove, no love, no hope, no end, no stone unturned, no turning back,

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,520
no flash, no kidding, no shortage, no dose, no expense, no fare, no longer, no better,

60
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:32,580
no sense, no deposit, no return, no strings, no static cling, no such thing, no record,

61
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:39,500
no reserve, no fat, no cholesterol, no regrets, no remorse, no emotion, no way out, no motive,

62
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:45,560
no clue, no bargain, no deal, no contract, no honor, no justice, no cover, no limits,

63
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,900
no future, no shelter, no survivors, no word, no words, no pain, no gain, no brain, no thought,

64
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,440
no feelings, no shame, no love lost, no basis, no tomorrow.

65
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,160
No blacks, no Jews, no offense, no action, no control, no power, no idea, no talent,

66
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,860
no way, no say, no parking, no standing, no loading, no loitering, no choke, no luck,

67
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,520
no fly, no go, no fat chicks, no bones, no hope, no place, no sweat, no more, no means,

68
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,640
no, no more, nothing.

69
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,520
Thank you one and all.

70
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,980
I'm darn glad I drove from Danbury, Connecticut.

71
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,080
Thank you, people.

72
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,680
Great party.

73
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,520
All of this back and forth and debate implies that there are really choices in this country,

74
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,080
that we really have choices, freedom of choice.

75
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,800
It's an illusion.

76
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,420
It's an all-volunteer army.

77
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,460
Americans are having trouble filling the slots in this all-volunteer army.

78
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,300
I wonder why.

79
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,440
Raise the pay of the money.

80
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,180
Let me say one thing about choice.

81
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,720
There is no real choice.

82
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,380
They say freedom of choice.

83
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,080
You're given an illusion of choice.

84
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,920
Americans are meant to feel free.

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,400
Right.

86
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,620
The exercise of meaningless choices.

87
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,340
You don't have, you know what the choices are in this country?

88
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,220
Paper or plastic.

89
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,200
A file or window.

90
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,500
Smoking or non-smoking.

91
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,860
Those are your real choices.

92
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,700
You don't get to choose.

93
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,160
Thank you.

94
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,320
Thank you.

95
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:08,660
Let's go.

96
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,100
Yeah!

97
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:11,760
Yeah!

98
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:12,660


99
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,100
Yeah!

100
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,020


101
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,020


102
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:16,580
Yeah!

103
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:16,580


104
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,080
Yeah!

105
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:17,240
Yeah!

106
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,240


107
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,320
Yeah!

108
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:17,520


109
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,120
Yeah!

110
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:18,580
Yeah!

111
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:20,660
Yeah!

112
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,220
Yeah!

113
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,400
Yeah!

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,680
Yeah!

115
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,600
Yeah!

116
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:39,280


117
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:44,380
Yeah!

118
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:44,860
Yeah!

119
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:45,760
Yeah!

120
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:45,980


121
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:45,980


122
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:45,980


123
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:45,980


124
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:45,980


125
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:45,980


126
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:45,980


127
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,160
Yeah!

128
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:46,340
Yeah!

129
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:46,340


130
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,120
Yeah!

131
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,260
Yeah!

132
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah!

133
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,540
Thank you.

134
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,040
Thank you.

135
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,200
Thank you.

136
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,040
Thank you.

137
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,820
Thank you.

138
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,300
Thank you.

139
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,720
Thank you.

140
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,140
Thank you.

141
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,060
Thank you.

142
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,440
Thank you.

143
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,780
Thank you.

144
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,040
Thank you.

145
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,040


146
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,040


147
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,080
Thank you.

148
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,900
Thank you.

149
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,360
Thank you.

150
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,980
Thank you.

151
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,080
Thank you.

152
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,520
Thank you.

153
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,680
This nonsense is the Hour of Slack, episode number 1290,

154
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,880
and that business there from Dimension X was pulled and yanked

155
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,580
by our friend Reverend Sweetness McGee of the Ministry of Slack,

156
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,740
one of the other shows from the Church of the Subgenius.

157
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,240
This episode, rather than going to church like normal,

158
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,700
we're back at the Church of Devo, you might say,

159
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,960
with recordings from the annual devotional held in Cleveland,

160
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,260
a gathering of bands and weirdos influenced by Devo.

161
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,620
And that certainly includes many subgenii,

162
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,180
such as most of the members of Devo itself.

163
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,400
Anyway, before the collage, we heard the Spud Boys,

164
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,140
the world's foremost Devo emulation band,

165
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,980
performing the new traditionalist theme.

166
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,920
And before that, some George Carlin on freedom of choice

167
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,420
and the good Malcolm...

168
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,980
...content with his song No Fishing,

169
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,720
recorded at the devotional in the Beachland Ballroom in Cleveland.

170
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,060
The collages at the beginning were by The Large,

171
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,980
except for the Leonard Nimoy War of the Worlds bit,

172
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,900
which we found on the mysterious Berea, Kentucky collage tape.

173
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,000
The music in the background is by Rural War Room.

174
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,740
And next up, live at the devotional of 2010,

175
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,820
recorded by Regis Sedlock and crew,

176
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,340
the band Fartbarf, with an instrumental accent,

177
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,920
on the mental, called Hero of Time.

178
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,760
.

179
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:51,900
.

180
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,460
.

181
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,480
.

182
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:06,480


183
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:06,480


184
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:06,480


185
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:06,480


186
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:06,480


187
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,740

188
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:21,000

Thank you.

208
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,020
This must mean she ain't tryin' to wake

209
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,100
Conversate, sex on the first date

210
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,040
I state, you know what you do to me

211
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,840
She starts off when I don't usually

212
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,360
Then I whip it out, rub her no doubt

213
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,440
Step out, show me what you all about

214
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,580
Fingers in your mouth, open up your mouth

215
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,020
Pull your G-string down fast

216
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,740
Blew that back out, in the parking lot

217
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,780
Buy a tariff fee and a green drop top

218
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,760
And I don't stop, until I squirt

219
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,160
Jeans skirt, what next?

220
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,000
It all works

221
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,000
Nah, nah, we goin' till they kick this out

222
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,260
We goin' till they kick this out

223
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,940
The police shut us down, down

224
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,640
Pull me

225
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,340
Po-po-chut us down

226
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,780
I want the world, you want the pussy

227
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,760
I want the pearl, I want the life

228
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,780
I want tonight, my food to labor

229
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,640
I want them right, that's right

230
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,460
Probably my best friend, I want them all

231
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,740
Money gets back to the highest height

232
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,700
Better get your mad than science, right

233
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,720
But I want the drama, God and life

234
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,920
I want the hype, but I don't believe it

235
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,040
I want it all, but I know I don't need it

236
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,640
Man, I just want what's due

237
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,200
And I want you

238
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,080
Come on

239
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,660
Pull over and ask to keep that

240
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,740
Pull over and ask to keep that

See the clubs ain't dead

00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,080
Diggas can't crack it, they scared

263
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,260
Can't y'all take it to the head

264

The bitch need a little more breath

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,660
Kick, kick, kick, gang

266
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,640
Lookin' like it's stank, cause it's back to back

267
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,720
Count them toes, smack them heels

268
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,680
The truth of it is, bitch got a big feel

269
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,520
Pick, pick, pick, pick

270
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,240
All on the pole, on the toes

271
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,540
Swag that honey, make that money

272
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,720

Wild out, wild out

284
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,680
Wild out, wild out

285
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,900

Yeah, by the way we drunk as fuck

291
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,700

Yeah, by the way we drunk as fuck

296
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,780
Break it down and roll it up

297
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,360
Now, now come and kick it with the twister

298
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,600
Black Caddy Mac, get it done

299
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:32,600


300
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,960
I got a daddy with a hoe up in the backseat

301
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,400
With a 97 Pim Flo

302
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,920
Got a feeling when you smoke it when I flip it to a track speed

303
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,380
Talkin' about a beautiful figure, astonishing as Greek mythology

304
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,880
Body be just like a girl in the

305
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,760
What's that movie?

306
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,640
Nevermind let me enter your atmosphere as you enter my world

307
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,780
And let me touch that booty

308
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,600
I can't believe that your mama that cold

309
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,020
Her daughter got such an astonishing soul

310
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,000
You need a model to grow

311
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,080
Still a player, no you got it when you climb up from the bottom to the top of the pole

312
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,020
Plus you can pop out control

313
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,920
Your baddies all accurate when I'm smacking it

314
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,940
It's making me say what I gotta do to get with that

315
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,940
You want some media baby, you need a better man

316
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,900
He come up politics, I'mma be your weatherman

317
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,260
Cause every time I'm lookin' up, I see more pasts

318
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,800
I'mma pass the least you can in the forecast

319
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,580
This a rave, battle rave

320
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,060
I'm pickin' 5,000 words, or whatever you wanna call it

321
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,520
It's a celebration, you the champion, he is the better, better

322
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,680
Look it on the road

323
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:30,380
Walk, walk, fashion baby, work it with that bitch crazy

324
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:34,260
Walk, walk, fashion baby, work it with that bitch crazy

325
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,360
Nervous energy, yes

326
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:09,300
Um, this episode, by the way, fans, is not just devotionally oriented

327
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,240
But also collage oriented

328
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,520
And here's one from the strange and mysterious CD

329
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,640
That was sent to us, elaborately hand-labeled, Out Mouth

330
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,880
What do you say to the woman that's being raped by someone that's only half-born?

331
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,780
Now what do you say? You know what I say?

332
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,940
Call the police, don't set me up

333
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,380
I'm not a straw man, fool

334
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,360
I didn't fall off a turnip truck

335
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,860
And I didn't come here on a green banana boat

336
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,840
You may have, but I didn't

337
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,840
What do I say to a woman that's being raped?

338
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,680
Call the police, or kick the rapist in the balls

339
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,440
I'll kick you in the balls until you throw up

340
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,820
So climb your fucking river, bitch

341
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,480
It's time for Ask Dr. Stupid

342
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:24,060
One, two, three, four

343
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,560
I'll kick you in the balls

344
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,940
I'll kick you in the balls

345
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,860
I'll kick you in the balls

346
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,460
I'll kick you in the balls

347
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,460
I'll kick you in the balls

348
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,980
You be squatters in your own homes, don't you leave

349
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,660
Uh, follow the Japanese example

350
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,780
And say, I'm sorry

351
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,860
And then either do one of two things

352
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,660
Resign, or go commit suicide

353
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,140
I'm gonna go commit suicide

354
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,340
I'm gonna go kill yourself, good

355
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,360
I'm gonna go kill myself, good

356
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,660
So take the sword

357
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,180
All problems in common

358
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:05,820
Ha ha ha ha

359
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,760
Hard hard, cold, and furious

360
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,860
Falsehood, that identity

361
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,720
Sneaking in

362
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,620
Side with me

363
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,340
Solve the case

364
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,760
You got the detail

365
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,300
Leave the lines

366
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,860
And now you've memorized

367
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,200
If I know

368
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,000
You're about to start them

369
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,240
Think the same

370
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,120
Then move and play it again

371
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,340
We will know

372
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,940
When you will use it

373
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,300
Take your time

374
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,160
We know that's all you got

375
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,400
With the word

376
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,940
We can remove it

377
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,120
It's okay

378
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,140
It's not quite on the fly

379
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,580
Wake and see

380
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,340
You're not alone

381
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,700
Just the time

382
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,700
A phrase of words

383
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,760
In your mind

384
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,880
You said to me

385
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,480
You did not know

386
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,860
This seems alright

387
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,480
It starts to show

388
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,260
We got the salt

389
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,780
We got the sugar

390
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,240
Better said

391
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,240
From a pot of lye

392
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,280
What you got

393
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,340
Is not the same

394
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:30,340


395
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:30,900
What you think

396
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,320
It's a charm

397
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,120
That puts you on the spot

398
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,340
Took your lies

399
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,840
From all the seven

400
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,280
He just said

401
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,260
To reap with all the worst

402
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,340
In your brain

403
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,880
There is a message

404
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,340
Played by us

405
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,180
Because we got it first

406
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,860
You said to me

407
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,480
You did not know

408
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,840
This seems alright

409
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,400
It starts to show

410
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:58,880
That we're all in this together

411
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:58,880


412
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,440
This information is the key

413
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,540
That's why you stole it back from me

414
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,180
What do the dogs and broken heads do

415
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,280
Down the hall

416
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,940
Where you took your motion sensor

417
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,240
Up your soft feet

418
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,820
And five minutes through your head

419
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,360
You said I'm seeing your memory

420
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,740
To become a dent

421
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,900
You said to me

422
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,500
You did not know

423
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,800
This seems alright

424
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,460
It starts to show

425
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,400
This information is the key

426
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,500
That's why you stole it back from me

427
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,400
Let me tell you about where I live

428
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,320
Here in the Buckeye State

429
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,420
The wind blows fresh and the air is clear

430
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,300
And the living is really great

431
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,880
Big and busy

432
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,400
That's why I say

433
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,980
Akron, Canton

434
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,880
They're sure to love you

435
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,260
They're sure okay

436
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,400
Canton, Akron

437
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,520
That's where I'll stay

438
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:35,080
The whole darn world just rolls along

439
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,120
On the tires we send their way

440
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,300
We've got the feel of the bars of steel

441
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,180
We turn out every day

442
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,420
Derby Downs, Stadium Park

443
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,300
They're why I say

444
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,960
Akron, Canton

445
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,260

That's where I'll stay

449
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,200
Massillon, Cahoga Falls

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,160
Barberton and Stone

Kent Analyze and Portage Lakes

452
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,600
And Hello Radio

453
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,060
They're recommended for a lifetime

454
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,340
Or just a day

455
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,860
Akron, Canton

456
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,240
They're sure okay

457
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,360

00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,880
That's where I'll stay

459
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,700
Akron, Canton

460
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,220
They're sure okay

461
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:34,220

We're going to

478
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,260
We have to find

479
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:39,340
Ingo

480
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:39,360
Cross

That's where I'llN

485
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:43,620


486
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:43,620


487
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,380
Barl

488
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:44,380


489
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,660
So passenger

490
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,120
Up

491
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,260
To

492
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:47,440
Red

493
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,120
So we go

494
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,760
In the door

495
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,720
I shut the door

496
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,360
Sit down

497
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,720
Probably 12 seconds

498
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,080
Has expired

499
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,900
And I'm looking at him and he's

500
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,700
He's looking above me.

501
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,080
He's looking at the wall in back of my head.

502
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:00,240
And this is about 12 seconds between beet red and white as a sheet of paper.

503
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,980
He's white as 10,000 sheets of Xerox paper.

504
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,720
And then his shoulders drop.

505
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,560
And I thought, he's having a heart attack.

506
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,340
He's going to die on my shift.

507
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,480
I don't think this is good.

508
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,060
Or he's having a stroke or both.

509
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,720
And I start to talk and I feel this check.

510
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,980
It's almost like a hand went in front of my mouth.

511
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,260
Mike, don't say a word.

512
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,520
I'm taking care of this.

513
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,560
And so four or five minutes go by.

514
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,260
It seems like an eternity.

515
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,320
I don't say a word.

516
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:24,960
He doesn't either.

517
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,860
Then he starts to mumble.

518
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:33,100
And he says, uh, uh, we'll pay you.

519
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:37,880
And I thought, did I hear what I think I just heard?

520
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,860
And he goes, we'll pay you.

521
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,740
And then about four or five minutes later, the color comes back to his face.

522
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,660
His shoulders come up.

523
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,040
And he just looks at me for the first time, somewhat friendly.

524
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,980
And he goes, I think I'll go back to Colorado.

525
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,120
And I said, Bob, OK, those are the words.

526
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,620
The only words I said was, Bob, OK.

527
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,420
11.

528
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,220
dress

529
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,780
Say your face is a mess

530
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,720
I heard there's no

531
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,280
reason why

532
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,420
I heard that nothing

533
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,160
takes a bite

534
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,040
Let it hurt

535
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,520
I wish they

536
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,180
Let it hurt

537
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,660
It's a place

538
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,100
I live in

539
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,540
I just want to play

540
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,860
People gonna sing

541
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,200
I run the play

542
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,540
Maybe you will rain

543
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,680
Let it ride a car

544
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,660
Your total looking

545
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:45,980
bar

546
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,280
Two of these stars

547
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,020
Will have their

548
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:48,400
number one

549
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:48,980
Look up at it

550
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,520
I don't get

551
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,100
the threat

552
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,120
When you're lost

553
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:03,620
or nothing's

554
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:03,980
stolen

555
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,480
That's why I'm

556
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:05,960
trying to get

557
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,400
your man

558
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,400
Cause I couldn't

559
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:08,800
understand

560
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,540
Planet Earth

561
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,980
I'll probably

562
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,380
understand

563
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,700
Planet Earth

564
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,380
It's a place

565
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:18,780
I live in

566
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,220
I just want to play

567
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,680
People gonna sing

568
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,740
I just want to play

569
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,480
People gonna sing

570
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:23,480


571
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,180
Maybe you will rain

572
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,440
Let it ride a car

573
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,460
Your total looking

574
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:26,660
bar

575
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,080
Two of these stars

576
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,760
Will have their

577
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,100
number one

578
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,760
Look up at it

579
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:29,980
Planet Earth

580
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,760
I heard a man on a stage

581
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,580
Scream!

582
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,340
Put me back in my cage

583
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,740
I saw him hang by his thigh

584
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,140
I saw enough to make me

585
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:44,340
cry

586
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,200
Planet Earth

587
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,640
Planet Earth

588
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,360
I just want to play

589
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:48,360


590
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:48,360


591
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:48,360


592
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:48,360


593
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:48,360


594
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:48,360


595
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:48,360


596
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:48,360


597
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,360
Letting themselves go

598
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:57,060
Letting my spirits Win

599
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,460
Let yourself go

600
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,080
Let yourself go

601
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,200
muito bem

602
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,780
Don't leave your capital

603
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,260
Remember the dream

604
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,780
Won't make you again

605
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,100
Just a few glance

606
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:05,100


607
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:05,220
How much that's a dream

608
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:05,220


609
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:05,220


610
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:05,220


611
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:05,220


612
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:05,500
lavida

613
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,140
I hear a song

614
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:06,140


615
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:06,140


616
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:06,420
I feel

617
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,500
Everything's alright

618
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,360
I know

619
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:18,360


620
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,660
Ladies and gentlemen, the lovely Liz Wilson!

621
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,580
Nicely done! Nicely done!

622
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,040
On guitar, Matt 1!

623
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,700
On the guitar, Matt 2!

624
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,640
Magic Melissa on bass!

625
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,020
Bob 3 on drums!

626
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,500
My name's Hal, thanks a lot!

627
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,960
1, 2, 3, 4!

628
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,060
Thanks a lot!

629
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,840
Why do you think they don't let doctors minister to their own families?

630
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,060
Why do you think they don't let doctors minister to their own families?

631
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,700
Because they're emotionally involved, and it's the same with lawyers.

632
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:34,480
You could deal with this case standing on your head, but throw in the landscape of your youth, the genetic co-dependence of your family, the subtext of sibling rivalry, and Bob's your uncle. Or your auntie. Or your brother and father, depending on the kind of family you come from.

633
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:43,680
Or your guru and slack master, depending on what kind of religion you come from. We and the devos all worship that man Bob, and there's nothing wrong with that.

634
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,760
Nothing any of us can do about it.

635
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,080
That collage and the one before it were by The Large.

636
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:59,840
That wild cover of Devo's Planet Earth was performed at the devotional by our friend Poopy Necropondy and Cream-Based Suits.

637
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:12,880
The Akron Canton Hometown song was, well, it was accompanied on theremin by the good Reverend K.R.K. Ryden of the band-like entity Ken the Magic Corner God.

638
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,300
K.R.K. is known for the graphics he did for Devo over the centuries.

639
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:26,880
And the spy rock fast number there was called Number Seven, meaning I think 007, and that band was International Espionage.

640
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,700
To me, they sound like a cross between Devo and the Ramones.

641
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:42,640
But now, some purely subgenius music, a piece called Stop the Conspiracy, from a subgenius about whom we know very little, but from whom we have plenty of music,

642
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:48,120
which you'll be hearing he or it or she or whatever goes by the name Slack T.

643
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,460
Praise Slack T.

644
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:24,180
We have been discovering that there is plenty of musicありがとうございました .

645
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,140
This is the idea that you wanted to know and we easily do that to old enough characters to pull up there.

646
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:27,860
They often do it for entertainment purposes and this was actually done to celebrate Devo's forthcoming album.

647
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:31,580
mh eh

648
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:31,980
festive new year!

649
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:31,980


650
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,680
all

651
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,360
We'll be right back.

652
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,020
We'll be right back.

653
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,460
We'll be right back.

654
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,760
We'll be right back.

655
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,040
We'll be right back.

656
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,080
We'll be right back.

657
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,120
We'll be right back.

658
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:23,220
We'll be right back.

659
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:12,520
We'll be right back.

660
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,560
We'll be right back.

661
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:56,340
We'll be right back.

662
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,620
We'll be right back.

663
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,860
We'll be right back.

664
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,300
We'll be right back.

665
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:54,740
We'll be right back.

666
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:23,200
We'll be right back.

667
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:56,820
We'll be right back.

668
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,200
We'll be right back.

669
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:43,980
We'll be right back.

670
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,520
We'll be right back.

671
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,080
We'll be right back.

672
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:57,620
We'll be right back.

673
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:57,620


674
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:57,980
We're going to be right back.

675
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:00,500
You take two hours and play three times without fail.

676
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:09,060
They came from the Maconi Juanac RoadZone line.

677
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:09,080
They then made a camera that was aimed into the ground.

678
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,280
They made a camera that was aimed into the ground.

679
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:12,280


680
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,480
Thank you.

681
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,180
Thank you, Ohio.

682
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,200
Thank you.

683
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,600
Thank you.

684
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:43,960
Thank you.

685
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,480
Thank you.

686
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,760
Thank you.

687
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,380
Thank you.

688
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,360
Thank you.

689
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,280
Thank you.

690
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,580
Oh, you.

691
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:16,280
I loved you so much.

692
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:17,940
What's your name?

693
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,040
I loved you a lot.

694
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:20,920
I miss you.

695
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,960
Do you remember how much we loved each other?

696
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:24,720
I miss you.

697
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:25,880
All we could say was love.

698
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:27,960
With our tongues.

699
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,140
You taste delicious.

700
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:36,820
Oh, yeah.

701
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,040
That felt so good.

702
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,600
We loved each other.

703
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,080
I love you.

704
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:18,680
Oh, the world can't stop me by throwing

705
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:33,080
So very romantic.

706
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,820
That Devo song cover was by Bottle

707
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:39,100
and was lifted from the latest devotional compilation,

708
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,860
not necessarily beautiful, but mutated.

709
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:46,520
Before that, the rocking synthesizer band was Fart Barf,

710
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,400
recorded live at the devotional.

711
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:53,200
And before that, and coming up, collage by The Large.

712
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,000
Friends, if you want to know more about the devotional

713
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,140
or what Devo itself is up to now,

714
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:03,200
you might see devo-obsesso.com

715
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,280
or clubdevo.com

716
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,840
or bougieboysbasement.com

717
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,440
bougie spelled with a...

718
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,700
B-O-O-J-I

719
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,300
Those will lead you to the websites

720
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:19,040
of all the Devo-related bands we've played tonight.

721
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,880
We're not always this Devo-ish at Church of the Subgenius,

722
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:25,860
but I could hardly just sit on these recordings

723
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:27,620
because they're too spiky.

724
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:30,520
For information about the Church of the Subgenius

725
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,860
and this show, The Hour of Slack,

726
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,300
and the Subgenius books and DVDs,

727
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:38,320
you can find everything at subgenius.com.

728
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,440
And now, The Large.

729
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,960
No need for background singers and dancers.

730
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:43,720
Fuck all that.

731
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:10,900
The Large.

732
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,640
No need for background singers and dancers.

733
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:32,420
Fuck all that.

734
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:33,420
What you see, you see.

735
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,300
What you hear, you hear.

736
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,740
The Large.

737
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:36,160
The Large.

738
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,180
And now, to close,

739
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,180
recorded live at devotional

740
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:35,140
and especially cynical song

741
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:36,600
for prospective parents

742
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,500
from the one-man band

743
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,320
Nervous Energy.

744
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:59,600
We've been together

745
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,320
for more than a year

746
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,880
Been through a lot together

747
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:05,420
We all thought about you, man

748
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,580
Both bliss and fear

749
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,300
But there are some doubts

750
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,240
Doesn't mean a thing

751
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,940
Without that piece of paper

752
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,260
Or a diamond ring

753
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:15,680
Don't wanna lose you

754
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:16,900
Wanna keep you reined in

755
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,320
Don't wanna end it

756
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,240
So we better begin

757
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,500
Boom, baby, baby, boom, baby, boom maker

758
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:25,240
Oh, boom, baby, baby, boom, baby, boom maker

759
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,220
Oh, boom, baby

760
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:27,780
Oh, boom, baby, boom, maker

761
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:30,080
Oh, boom, baby, baby, boom, baby, boom

762
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,140
It's a living organism

763
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,880
Made out of your jism

764
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:39,320
It's a living organism

765
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,800
It's a mental disease

766
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,520
Does it look like me?

767
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,260
Yeah, it looks like you

768
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:50,380
Does it look like me, really, baby?

769
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,020
Yeah, it looks like you, shit

770
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,540
The good times, the bad times, the mediocrity

771
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,560
They're way too much for two

772
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,800
Honey, why should we stop at one?

773
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,920
Why don't we have a few?

774
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:07,560
Boom, baby, baby, boom, baby, boom, maker

775
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:19,140
It's a living organism

776
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:21,940
Made out of your jism

777
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,520
It's a living organism

778
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,920
It's a mental decision

779
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,460
Does it look like me?

780
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,920
Yes, it looks like you

781
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,140
Does it look like me?

782
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:33,540
Yes, it looks like you

783
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:34,760
Does it look like me?

784
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,100
Yes, it looks like you

785
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,400
Does it look like me?

786
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:38,840
Yes, it looks like you

787
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,060
Does it look like me?

788
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:40,680
Stop!

789
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:42,320


790
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:55,160
Everyone's having goddamn babies.

791
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:57,760
Sorry.

792
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,840
Maybe it's just I'm bitter because I don't get laid.

793
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:01,660
Is that it? I don't know.

794
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:02,940
I don't know.

795
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:15,300
I don't know.

796
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:16,340
Nearly 10%.

797
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:20,580
Analysts say there is still a large number of percent across the U.S.

798
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:27,100
67,000 tied up plastic garbage police say PR News used tear gas against cars and buses.

799
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:32,900
On Wall Street, 111-2-24-24, 10-57-41-75.

800
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:37,060
Police fired shots at the Pentagon building early this morning.

801
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:41,200
Authorities say the recording of a 9-1-1 call revealed muffled PR News.
