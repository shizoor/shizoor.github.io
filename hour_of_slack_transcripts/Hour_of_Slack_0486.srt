1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,680
What is that?

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,520
This fungal growth seems to have traveled all the way to the base of the spine.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,480
This basal area here is completely covered with the fungus.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,340
This whale has not died from natural causes.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,060
This whale has died from...

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,480
It appears to be...

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:28,580
The suction cup-shaped scars covering the outer epidermis of Mrs. Monstro

8
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,980
indicated that she died at the tentacles of the great kraken,

9
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,580
the so-called mythical beast of the sea,

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,380
actually based upon the giant squid.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,640
And, man, that was...

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,180
Mighty good.

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,900
Yeah, now, poor old Witterwer Dave, when he met up with that squid,

14
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:55,620
he thought, well, now, man, I've had them whales, I've had them polar bears,

15
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,040
but I've never had a kraken.

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,560
A kraken.

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,160
A kraken, or whatever, one of them giant squids with a 50-foot tentacle reach

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,740
and that ink sac.

19
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,140
Oh, yes.

20
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,140
Mmm, the inks.

21
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,700
He could smell the ink.

22
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,300
Hey, old Dave was a hound dog.

23
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,680
He was a rooster back in them days, old Dave was.

24
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,200
Oh, he'd go after anything.

25
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,160
You know, honey, you know, he liked the way his hair was bent.

26
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,440
It looked like a skyscraper.

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,320
There were three different pieces on top of his skull,

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,640
and each one was capable of taking in a different signal

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,540
and retransmitting.

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,040
He could transmit it on different frequencies and wavelengths

31
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,920
until at certain times it seemed his whole head would glow

32
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,240
and he would create a vast vortex around him.

33
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,200
No one could see but him.

34
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,480
Just like that Japanese guy with the feather on his head.

35
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,180
.

00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:17,760
I can't understand

wow

56
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,960
the most scientists were separated in their heads from the world that's just bizarre

57
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:56,120
glub glub glub and with that great drain plug came out in the center of the ocean

58
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:02,000
and the whole show went right down the drain and that was it that was the end of it

59
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,060
hell man what are we gonna do now manson's still in jail we gotta do something about charlie man

60
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:13,620
he never committed a crime all he did was let people do what they wanted to do

61
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:20,940
you know i saw that movie natural born killers let's go get a video camera and a boom box to

62
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,240
break charlie out man

63
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,180

00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,600
okay they're jamming man they've got they've got one of those wind-up monkeys in a cardboard box

66
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,040
doing that drum that drum beat it's pretty high tech in here

67

taste the rich nougat

68
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,700
chas is going to play the guitar backwards with his teeth as the nougat fills the cavities

00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,080
he's imbued with the spirit of an ancient sea creature

71
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,380

lena

76
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,580
doesn't make any sense to me either senseless

77

lena lena

78
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:42,860
my family lived on the minor island 6 000 years ago we traded bronze for small pieces of

79
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:48,000
onion skin paper which we will strip over our ear compromise on the feast days

80
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,100
well you know the the weird thing it goes on and on and on when you make an indent with people and people need a degree in science like you know we miss star�

81
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,800
on but after a while the pattern starts to form and you know it makes a weird kind of a sense

82
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,620
and you know the the only way at that point to figure out what's true is to just just keep quiet

83
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:15,120
and keep watching just keep watching and keep listening because they're going to be watching

84
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,760
and listening back at you go ahead check out those stories of the installation inside hoover dam

85
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:31,260
all those stories about the groom lake crashed saucers those are just cover stories for

86
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:38,300
activities that are going on 400 miles away stories of unusual craft entering or leaving

87
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:44,920
bodies of water bear investigating as well as organizations closely associated with aquatic

88
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:51,600
mammals john lilly's studies are worthless he quit when he was discovered

89
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:00,500
he was very bitter about it and won't discuss it but we will you can't shut us up certain fields

90
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,440
of new age literature are conduits for open distribution of symbolically coded information

91
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:14,860
related to the neptune agenda and lonesome cowboy dave's filthy perversions with those self-same

92
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,940
gigantic mammals of the briny deep

93
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,540
i'll see if you notice this fresco

94
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:28,160
here take a closer look at this fresco it's all chipping off here this is 5 000 years old you can

95
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,280
still make out a great portion of the pigment and see what the actual colors were like it's been very

96
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:40,700
little fading this character with the pipe in his mouth appears to be sitting on some crude uh

97
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:48,800
tired device and the man next to him with the huge top of his head expanded out appears to be

98
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,620
hunting for whales this is

99
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,780

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,260

channel seven's bob mckenzie introduces you to bay area entrepreneurs who started with little more

107
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,200
than a great idea and turned it into millions rags to riches you bet bob mckenzie has the secrets of

108
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,220
their success this week on channel seven news at six

109
00:07:52,960 --> 00:08:03,720
this is the piddle diddle report a five-hour in-depth report on current issues of substance

110
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:14,240
welcome back to the piddle diddle report yes so we move to the mid-pacific for another look at the

111
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:21,280
mysterious howland island here's a little piece of production i put together tomorrow about this

112
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,740
fable and i'm going to tell you a little bit about it because i'm going to tell you a little bit about it

113
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,440
because i'm going to tell you a little bit about it

114
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:30,560
island it's well let's be frank it's sort of an impressionistic little piece a few of my personal

115
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,940
perceptions objectively thrown together around this island nucleus of man's need to wonder

116
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,860
oh my man

117
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:57,820
he can really feel me guaranteed to thrill me

118
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:13,940
he can hypnotize me really mesmerize me i mean it satisfies me

119
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,060
oh that drives me out of my mind

120
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,740
yes out of my mind

121
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,640
my name is friday

122
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,420
friday i'm pleased to meet you

123
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,620
my name is friday

124
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,980
my name is friday

125
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,760
there was no sign of human habitation no sound of human voice

126
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,540
no reason to believe that the island contained any living person

127
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,960
there was only one person who could actually create this world

128
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,900
really everyone action

129
00:09:54,020 --> 00:10:00,840
i was a guano prospector riding the seas from one little island to the next all over the pacific

130
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:09,540
yeah scraping guano off rocks and hauling it back to new jersey where they used invited a ton of milk

131
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:15,620
of magnesia we'd stop at every little rock that showed itself above the surface

132
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:20,780
you gotta think like a seagull when you're out on the guano ride

133
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,320
What the hell are they doing out there?

134
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,880
Well, we stopped at Howlin' many, many times.

135
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,820
There was nothing on it.

136
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,260
Nothing at all.

137
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:52,920
All this blab about Friday and his complex nonsense.

138
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,860
Howlin' Island's just a rock.

139
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,400
Used to be an airstrip on it for a while.

140
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,780
In a small shack made out of sheet metal.

141
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,100
Nobody ever there, though.

142
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,860
No sign of anyone.

143
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,700
Believe me, I was there two dozen times.

144
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,540
There's no truth to that Friday business.

145
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,160
Amelia Earhart was on the Pacific leg of an historic round-the-world flight.

146
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,840
She disappeared over the ocean.

147
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,400
The date was July 2nd, 1937.

148
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,120
Since then, her fate has remained a mystery.

149
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,480
Previously, historians believed Earhart became lost near Howlin' Island,

150
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,240
doubled back, and landed on a Japanese helipad.

151
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:48,520
In the first place, she was in a small town called Howlin' Island,

152
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,780
where some islanders claim she was held prisoner and later died.

153
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,200
But if the new evidence is correct, this would have been impossible.

154
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:02,140
The coordinates for Howlin' Island, the tiny sandbar Earhart was aiming for when she disappeared,

155
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,840
don't agree with current charts for the island.

156
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,920
The sad thing is they thought they were there.

157
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,360
Amelia called and said she was circling.

158
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,480
Must be on you but cannot see island.

159
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,960
He thought she was there.

160
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,240
They had that new vehicle.

161
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,240


162
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,240


163
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,240


164
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,240


165
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,240


166
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,240


167
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,280
A very powerful high-frequency direction finder on Howlin'.

168
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,980
You can't pick it up without the training antennas.

169
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,120
But they can pick her up and then relay her position via the Itasca.

170
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,340
K-H-A-Q-Q. Earhart. Overcast.

171
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,080
You'll listen.

172
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,960
Hey, see Elliot Friday. See Elliot Friday.

173
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,900
You got the weatherman here. Come on.

174
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,240
In Earhart's life, the world has changed.

175
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,240


176
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,280
The world hasn't changed.

177
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,000
Doctor будет gl latency in the future.

178
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,060

00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:06,800
officer.

182
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:13,560
Howon home!, is here, tell me how, you know, how long Brian's gone.

183
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,100
IP-800.

184
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,460
What do you think was that, everybody in here?

185
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:15,580


186
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,240
I don't know.

187
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,240


188
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,240


189
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,240


190
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,120
She's not getting a thing.

191
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,780
She has an ADF.

192
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,180
She can still not get on the homing signal.

193
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,800
She's close enough.

194
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,500
She's circling.

195
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,300
We are on 5.

196
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,960
1, 5, 7 degrees.

197
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,480
And 3, 3, 7 degrees.

198
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,980
We'll repeat this message on 6, 2, 1, 0.

199
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:39,840
Wait.

200
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,560
Listening.

201
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,300
On 6, 2, 1, 0.

202
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,880
We are running north and south.

203
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,920
North and south of what?

204
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,900
Stay on 3, 1, 0, 5.

205
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,520
Long enough for me to take bearing.

206
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,300
Pine 6, 2, 1, 0.

207
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:54,660
Monitor.

208
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,120
I hear you on 3, 1, 0, 5.

209
00:13:59,220 --> 00:13:59,660
Earhart.

210
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,580
Remember Amelia Earhart's last message?

211
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,400
We're on line 1, 5, 7, 3, 3, 7.

212
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,420
Running north and south.

213
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,800
There's really nothing new.

214
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,780
If she were flying from land to island,

215
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,900
then she could have spotted this land,

216
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,940
no matter what anybody's checked out so far.

217
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
She's on a line south.

218
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,640
1, 5, 7 degrees by compass from Howland Island.

219
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,040
She could have seen.

220
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,360
Negative land signal from there.

221
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,720
I can't.

222
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,140
In the presence of a 50-year-old mystery.

223
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,720
Amelia, come in.

224
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,120
3, 1, 0, 5.

225
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,680
Landed in the lagoon and found a European observer

226
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,440
and some natives gathering gull guano.

227
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,040
Break 1-9.

228
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,220
This is the information feedback.

229
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,380
They were calling Hull Island.

230
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,180
Wingville Reef is probably where she landed.

231
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,640
That's 170 miles southeast of Howland Island.

232
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,840
The reef sticks up about 6 feet out of the water at low tide.

233
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,140
Amelia.

234
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,040
Pogo Pogo.

235
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,880
See, the Earhart plane had been equipped with a fixed-loop antenna,

236
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,700
early-model radio compass,

237
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,440
which required her to turn the entire plane

238
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,420
in order to get a fix on any radio transmission,

239
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,000
like the one they showed.

240
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,500
Just exposed that Amelia Earhart had just passed south of Howland Island

241
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,420
and had then established a fix on negative land view 2 album

242
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,080
floating in some trash just south of it.

243
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,720
Just south of Howland Island.

244
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,200
They have reason to believe that that is where

245
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,240
Amelia Earhart may have tried to make an emergency landing.

246
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,220
They've done two or three expeditions,

247
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,160
to the island.

248
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,140
The latest one, they came back with a large piece of metal,

249
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,440
they say, as part of the belly of Amelia Earhart's airplane.

250
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,460
They've also found some personal artifacts on the island

251
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,900
that they believe connect to her.

252
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,780
One was a size 7 shoe, believed to be Earhart's.

253
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,780
So the mystery of Amelia Earhart's disappearance goes on,

254
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,520
and another mystery comes up.

255
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,740
Howland where it is, or Howland where they thought it was?

256
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,220
It's an atoll, a coral reef that literally goes underground.

257
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:48,220


258
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,760
Yeah, I have done Howland construction.

259
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:05,400
Let's see, started in 48, worked out there for about a year and a half straight.

260
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,800
I've done ships, good pay.

261
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,180
Is today Friday?

262
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,420
No, I never saw Old Man Friday personally.

263
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,220
We got tape messages over the phone.

264
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:18,220


265
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,960
The loudspeakers fail irregular.

266
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,980
They put him on, and they'd be talking about their projects,

267
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,160
and how far we've gone, and underwater construction.

268
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:34,360
They never explained what all we were building out there,

269
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,540
not altogether, said it was an industrial secret.

270
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,000
Never gave us the name of the island either.

271
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,520
I figured it was Howland, though, later on,

272
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,220
after putting him on there.

273
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:48,220


274
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:48,220


275
00:16:48,240 --> 00:17:16,720
people started talking about. I spent most of my time in a diving suit underwater. I was constructing a bunch of huge tanks and pumping systems there. These were being attached to the island beneath the water line. But I don't believe myself that these were any kind of a balance system to raise or lower the island.

276
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:35,600
That's ridiculous. That's not possible. They say it's an artificial island. Well, it looks real to me. It's volcanic. It grows right out of the ocean floor. That's where I worked.

277
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:45,880
As we reach the rocky shore, the island gently bobs up and down just slightly with the waves. Now this is not something that islands usually do.

278
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,080
And in fact, this isn't an island at all.

279
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:57,980
This island weighs 700 tons. It has 120 tons of rock around the shoreline. It has 100 tons of white sand from Carmel on the beach.

280
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:03,060
We make our own electricity here. And we have our own treatment plant for sewage. We're all self-contained.

281
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:10,660
A floating tropical island. For 10 years he labored over it. Only he knows why. But it is impressive.

282
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,700
From the rocky shoreline to the live trees that rustle loudly in the brisk wind.

283
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,120
Oh dear friends.

284
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:25,420
Negative Land has taken us on a mysterious little journey there to Howland Island.

285
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:33,480
This has been a very maritime sort of show. Continued from last week's Hour of Slack show.

286
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:40,740
Yes, I don't know what it has to do with Baha'b except the movement of the island up and down.

287
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,880
But we're going to go even further south, friends.

288
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:52,720
Far south. To hear about life on the frozen ocean. Life on the ice.

289
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,760
And this...

290
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,740
The other day my kid came in and said,

291
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:09,440
There's these creatures that... they're these little hairless rat-like things that bore their way through the ice because their heads are burning hot.

292
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,200
And they tear penguins apart. And I was going, what?

293
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,040
He goes, it's in Discover Magazine.

294
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,740
I said, what?

295
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,800
And he goes, let me show it to you. I didn't think you'd believe me.

296
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,600
So, he whips it out.

297
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,560
And sure enough, here it is. Discover Magazine. April issue.

298
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,280
This story...

299
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,620
I mean, this... you're not going to want to believe this, dear friends.

300
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:39,480
It's horrifying. It's going to eat at your mind. It certainly did me.

301
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,180
April Pazot was about to call it a day when she noticed...

302
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:50,060
noticed that the penguins she was observing seemed strangely agitated.

303
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:59,540
Pazot, a wildlife biologist, was in Antarctica studying penguins at a remote, poorly explored area along the coast of the Ross Sea.

304
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:06,720
I was getting ready to release a penguin I had tagged when I heard a lot of squawking, says Pazot.

305
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,340
When I looked up, the whole flock had sort of stampeded.

306
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,680
They were waddling away faster than I'd ever seen them move.

307
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,960
Pazot waded through the panicked birds to find out what was wrong.

308
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,640
She found one penguin that hadn't fled.

309
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,040
It was sinking into the ice as if into quicksand, she says.

310
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:31,580
Somehow the ice beneath the bird had melted. The penguin was waist-deep in slush.

311
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,640
Pazot tried to help the struggling penguin. She grabbed its wings and pulled.

312
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,200
With a heave, she freed the bird.

313
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:43,100
But the penguin wasn't the only thing she hauled from the slush.

314
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:52,340
About a dozen small, hairless, pink, mole-like creatures had clamped their jaws onto the penguin's lower body.

315
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,380
Pazot managed to capture one of the creatures.

316
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,300
The others quickly released their grip and vanished into the slush.

317
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:06,160
Over the next few months, Pazot caught several of the animals and watched others in the wild.

318
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,860
She calls the strange new species, hot-headed naked ice borers.

319
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,540
They're repulsive, says Pazot.

320
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:23,240
And friends, according to this picture they've reprinted here, they are indeed among the most repulsive-looking creatures I've ever seen.

321
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:31,240
Like a hairless possum embryo, but with saber-tooth tiger fangs and a glowing skull plate.

322
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:38,040
Now get this. Adults are about six inches long, weigh a few ounces, have a very high metabolic rate,

323
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,800
their body temperature is 110 degrees,

324
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,040
and live in labyrinthine tunnels carved in the ice.

325
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,120
Perhaps their most fascinating feature is a bony plate on their forehead.

326
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,440
Innumerable blood vessels line the skin covering the plate.

327
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,120
The animals radiate a tremendous amount of body heat through their hot plates,

328
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,800
which they use to melt their tunnels in the ice to hunt their favorite prey, penguins.

329
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,540
A pack of ice borers will cluster under a penguin

330
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,400
and melt the ice and snow it's standing on.

331
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:17,000
When the hapless bird sinks into the slush, the ice borers attack,

332
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,560
dispatching it with bites of their sharp incisors.

333
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,200
They then carve it up and carry its flesh back to their burrows,

334
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,040
leaving behind only webbed feet, a beak, and some feathers.

335
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,120
They travel through the ice at surprisingly high speeds, says Pazot,

336
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,480
much faster than a penguin can waddle.

337
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,340
Pazot's discovery may also solve a long-standing,

338
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,400
Antarctic mystery.

339
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:45,340
What happened to the heroic polar explorer Philippe Poisson,

340
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,200
who disappeared in Antarctica without a trace in 1837?

341
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:56,740
I wouldn't rule out the possibility that a big pack of ice borers got him, says Pazot.

342
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,540
I've seen what these things do to emperor penguins.

343
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:04,200
It isn't pretty, and emperors can be as much as four feet tall.

344
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,020
Poisson was about five foot six.

345
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,800
To the ice borers,

346
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,680
he would have looked like a big penguin.

347
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,240
Oh, my friends.

348
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,880
Oh, my friends.

349
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:23,700
The horror of a world created by a god that would allow evolution to take such a turn

350
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,260
that these creatures would zip under the ice with their burning hot heads

351
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,600
and snatch a poor explorer or penguin,

352
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,900
uh, sinking into the...

353
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,400
Imagine! What a way to go!

354
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,400
Sinking into the slush,

355
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,520
uh, in the middle of the night,

356
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,280
not knowing what was tearing you limb from...

357
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,500
or tiny pieces of your body off.

358
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,520
Uh...

359
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,300
I can't wait to see the...

360
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:55,000
the Discovery Channel footage of the mating frenzy of the ice borers

361
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,800
and the bloody horror of them tearing a penguin apart.

362
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,360
Friends, but before we go any further,

363
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,660
I have to tell you that...

364
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,680
this is the April issue of Discover Magazine,

365
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,380
and the first words in the paragraph, uh,

366
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,360
in this news article were,

367
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,120
April Poisson.

368
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:20,980
And we have to wonder whether Italian is the language in which Poisson means fool.

369
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,160
But, uh,

370
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,460
it did that to us for a little while.

371
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,360
But, friends, I believe in the naked, hot-headed ice borer.

372
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,660
I believe in that creature!

373
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,080
I know that... that somewhere, they live.

374
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,820
Even if they haven't been discovered yet.

375
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,320
Friend, like the prairie squid,

376
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,460
and the...

377
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,740
face-raping bat.

378
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,080
Nature's wonders shall...

379
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,400
e'er be hidden from us.

380
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,060
And the Loch Ness Monster,

381
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,280
and our cousins, the full-blood yetis of the forest.

382
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,840
We know, dear friends, that they,

383
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,320
the snipe bird, and the Gaius Gudis,

384
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,140
were all created by Bob

385
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,460
to puzzle the pinks

386
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,060
and to help the subjects.

387
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,220
And the genius to believe.

388
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,900
Ah, yes.

389
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,220
This music in the background is, uh,

390
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,420
Reverend Arnold Mathis.

391
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,440
Dear friends...

392
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:28,940
Well, I'm afraid what we're gonna have to do now is go back in time

393
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,140
to WCSB in Cleveland,

394
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,620
where Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Chaz, and, uh,

395
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,340
Einstein's Secret Orchestra

396
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,660
continued on into the night,

397
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,320
trying to figure out the horrible, horrible secret!

398
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,480
Hello, Mom! I'm the one who's been looking for you all night!

399
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,420
Don't be afraid.

400
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,040
Don't be afraid.

401
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,260
Here's your red envelope.

402
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,700
Time for the Swedish whale tortillas.

403
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,960
Happy money for you, happy new year,

404
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:05,940
and good luck.

405
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,560
Oh, thank you, thank you.

406
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,740
These Swedish aborigines

407
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,760
were very, very tiny people.

408
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,920
They were able to use whale lard

409
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,920
for many, many, many household appliances

410
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,560
that we take for granted.

411
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,460
And of course the cone dance,

412
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,780
every fifth of Bob McMindle,

413
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,240
also had to do with the accumulation of clamshells in the neighborhood.

414
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,600
An excavation has shown that many of these clamshells

415
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,780
are actually capable of picking up radio signals.

416
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,520
The ancient Swedish sea-going tribes

417
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,700
were masters of harpooning and feedback.

418
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,120
Devil worshippers,

419
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,540
they were known as berserkers

420
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,220
to the neighboring tribes,

421
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,600
such as the Finns,

422
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,240
uh, the early Picts,

423
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,000
and the early Scots.

424
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,640
These, uh, Swedish savages

425
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,200
swept over the North Country,

426
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:07,320
uh, uh, spreading, wreaking havoc,

427
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,580
and spreading fertilizer.

428
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,720
And meatballs.

429
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,340
And meatballs, yes.

430
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,380
Swedish whale meatballs.

431
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,880
Oh, and warm milk, too.

432
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,480
We can't go a day without lots of warm milk.

433
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,960
They would milk the great serpents

434
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,620
of the northern waters.

435
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,380
And they would actually milk, milk,

436
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,520
the snake milk out of a man's body

437
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,780
after he digged a sea-mad.

438
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,260
And they would fix it with the spider eggs.

439
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,900
And then they would foretell the future

440
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:43,120
from that which erupted back up out of the stomack

441
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,100
of the, uh, the victim.

442
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,980
Or the, uh, Bobby or the Colt,

443
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,340
or whatever, you know.

444
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,760
It's been the same old story

445
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,040
down through the years.

446
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,980
It's snake oil, uh, totem poles, and...

447
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,760
Body branding.

448
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,620
And, uh, cargo coals.

449
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:11,280
And, uh, transportation.

450
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,180
And, uh, quick

451
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:22,200
And, uh, and, uh,

452
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,740
they've beenalt basically

453
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,140
prettyíve been dissolute,

454
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,200
ADPH like theyíre been in the

455
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,620
ünás, uh, ninth century,

456
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:31,620


457
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,640
that grassy knoll.

458
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,320
There's dozens of them

459
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,200
hanging out that six-story window.

460
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,160
There's 50 guys

461
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,000
flashing umbrellas up and down

462
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,360
to signal the gunmen

463
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,680
up in the records building.

464
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,900
And Elvis is dead.

465
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,120
So what is there left, friends?

466
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,880
Rock, rock, rock.

467
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,160
There's lots of sports enthusiasm.

468
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,180
There's love for our nation.

469
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,140
There's the love for a woman, damn you.

470
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,480
Can't you understand what a man is?

471
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,440
A man's not a highfalutin character

472
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,380
searching the stars for answers

473
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,040
one way or another.

474
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,520
A man's got to have his feet on the ground.

475
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,160
A man's got to be a man.

476
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,780
Plant those feet firmly, Reverend,

477
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,480
and you'll never stray far.

478
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,460
Forget this fine religion.

479
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,780
A man's got to do what an amoeba must.

480
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,640
I got my feet in the clouds

481
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,500
and my head on the pavement.

482
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,960
She danced with me.

483
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,420
She danced with me.

484
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,020
And I killed her for looking

485
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:29,380
at her.

486
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,040
Another woman.

487
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,860
Tonight, I'll whack you back at your feet.

488
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,040
The production was produced

489
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,660
by Space Week

490
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,820
on the third planet.

491
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,860
We are the

492
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,400
Jacques-Eve

493
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,340
and the cast

494
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,680
is directed by

495
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,300
Andrew MacGill.

496
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,800
This is sort of like a

497
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,580
what's wrong with that picture kind of scene.

498
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,660
Everything is very antique looking

499
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,140
and beautiful, and yet that chandelier

500
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,100
is swaying vehemently back and forth.

501
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,120
That shows we're floating.

502
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,620
Lots of people don't believe we're a floating island,

503
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,160
so I had to put that there.

504
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,920
That's what's so great about a floating island.

505
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,640
You can move it around.

506
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,780
If you don't like the climate,

507
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,640
you don't like your neighbors,

508
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,420
you don't like the politics,

509
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:39,980
you can move it.

510
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,420
Do you know how much it cost you altogether,

511
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,900
or do you shudder to even think?

512
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,560
It's very peaceful on the island.

513
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,280
He relaxes now,

514
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,040
gazing out through the curved glass

515
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,480
that wraps around his 17th floor office

516
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,080
in the Found Sound Foundation's Howland Tower.

517
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,080
He watches the remnants of dense, white, and black,

518
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,160
the white fog from Friday's smoke screen machines

519
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,900
drift away from the island and out across the Pacific.

520
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,680
There must have been a passing ship or plane detected.

521
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,700
He could see Friday's vintage U2

522
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,040
parked outside its hanger on the runway below.

523
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,580
They must be getting it ready for the trip to LA

524
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,860
to pick up Mr. Ginn.

525
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,640
A nice touch, he thought.

526
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,800
The dive alarm signals the end of another business day.

527
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,780
He leans back on his cushy brand cushion,

528
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,100
loosens his power brand tie,

529
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,800
and lazily gazes out the curved panorama brand window

530
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,800
at the usual blood-red sunset.

531
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,700
He casually notices that he is no longer

532
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,060
slightly apprehensive when the water level

533
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,620
of the Pacific Ocean slowly rises outside

534
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:47,160
to swirl away his 17th floor view in bubbling confusion.

535
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,620
Soon, he would be asleep in the deep.

536
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,160
They are things that are undertaken

537
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,820
because someone is moved by curiosity,

538
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,280
the love of excellence, a point of honor,

539
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,360
the compulsion to invent or to understand.

540
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:10,460
In such persons, mankind overcomes the inertia

541
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:14,100
which would keep it earthbound forever in its habitual ways.

542
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:19,040
They have in them the free, wild, and useless energy

543
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,920
with which alone man surpasses himself.

544
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:28,080
All the heroes, the saints and the seers, the explorers,

545
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,080


546
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,080


547
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,220
and the creators partake of it.

548
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:35,520
They do the useless, brave, noble, the divinely foolish,

549
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,940
and the very wisest things that are done by men.

550
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,920
And what they may prove to themselves and to others

551
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,920
is that man is no mere creature of his habits,

552
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,160
no mere cog in the collective machine,

553
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,820
but that in the dust of which he is made,

554
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,840
there is also fire.

555
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,700
Lighted now and then by great winds from the sky.

556
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,380
.

557
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:05,380


558
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,840
Break 13.

559
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,300
.

560
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,060
Cut.

561
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:24,320
Break one more time for C. Eliot Friday.

562
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,480
Are you out there? You've got the weatherman.

563
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,140
.

564
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,440
.

565
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:29,280
.

566
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:37,980
.

567
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:37,980


568
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:38,120
.

569
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,160
.

570
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,240
.

571
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,280
.

572
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:38,600
.

573
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:38,700
.

574
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,840
.

575
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,200
.

576
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:53,060
As the story goes, in 1948, famous film actor Cary Grant and his wife were visiting Howland Island as guests of Mr. Friday.

577
00:33:53,360 --> 00:34:01,040
Mr. Grant had his car, a 1944 Mercedes limousine, shipped to the island so that he and his wife could spend their holiday on the road.

578
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,200
On the Howland Road.

579
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,600
Well, a strange event happened one night while Mr. Grant and his wife were out on a drive.

580
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:17,060
Dramatically enough, this event is verified because the day before, Mr. Friday had given Mr. Grant a new product from Fridatronics to test.

581
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:20,880
It was the latest in battery-operated portable tape recorders.

582
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:28,620
And Mr. Grant, thank God, had the wits to switch this recorder on during the strange and frightening occurrence that took place that night.

583
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:32,380
Now, we present that tape in its entirety.

584
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:38,580
From the Cary Grant estate archives, the long-suppressed true recording of Mr. and his wife.

585
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:44,140
And Mrs. Cary Grant's actual encounter with the ghost of Amelia Earhart on Howland Island.

586
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,720
Or was it?

587
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,700
She's trying to get in the car!

588
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,100
Look at her face! And her hair!

589
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,400
Go away!

590
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,680
Let me in! I'm not crazy!

591
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,880
The crazy woman is after me!

592
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,620
Don't let her in!

593
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,180
Let me in!

594
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,080
I'm not going to scare her.

595
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,460
Go away! Go away!

596
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,000
We've got a gun! We'll shoot!

597
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,140
It worked. She's staring at us.

598
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,320
I'm warning you!

599
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,420
I'll shoot!

600
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,500
She's coming back!

601
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,500
Please! Don't leave me out here! Please!

602
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:15,680
Please!

603
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,580
Take your pipe. Hold it like a gun. It'll look like a gun.

604
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:20,980
Where is it?

605
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,740
It was in the glove compartment.

606
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,140
Here. Here it is.

607
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,360
Look!

608
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,200
I've got a gun!

609
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,580
I'm going to shoot!

610
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,680
She's backing away.

611
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,360
Keep going! Before I start shooting!

612
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,320
She's gone. She disappeared.

613
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,860
We can't get out now. All we can do is sit here all night and wait for help.

614
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,380
Can you see her? Where did she go?

615
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,700
I don't know. She's out there, though. Probably planning on how to get in this car.

616
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,660
What are we going to do? She's the one I know.

617
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,380
Her face is all twisted and her hair hanging down.

618
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,760
She'll kill us. She'll kill us.

619
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,400
Dorothy, stop it.

620
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,320
She'll kill us.

621
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,340
She'll kill us.

622
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:05,340


623
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:05,340


624
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:05,340


625
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:05,340


626
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:05,340


627
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:05,340


628
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,100
No!

629
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:07,600


630
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:32,180
These incubators handle a thousand babies in five minutes.

631
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,320
Nobody knows about this.

632
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:35,660
Nobody knows about this party.

633
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,900
Some of them have green fingernails.

634
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,100
Who is the super dad of all these fattened babies?

635
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,520
All these expanding children with green fingernails?

636
00:36:53,120 --> 00:37:00,100
One father of billions and billions of mutated, bald sperm?

637
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,340
The subgenius sperm bank.

638
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:08,800
The wild, bloody gene perhaps found, perhaps never will be found.

639
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:14,620
Are you thin enough to make a deposit at the subgenius sperm bank?

640
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,320
Will you?

641
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:24,720
Will you bear the genes that will make you worthy to father the 12,000 children of B-B-B-Bob?

642
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,060
We need them genes, friends.

643
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,900
We haven't received enough genes.

644
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:41,400
So send those private genetic codes out from your loins, pack them into an envelope,

645
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:51,740
and send them to Bob at Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

646
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,360
Because a good pair of genes is hard to find.

647
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,960
We need more than a pair of genes, friends.

648
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,320
We need a string of several million heretofore unknown genes.

649
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,360
That's what it's going to take to get this world out of the mess.

650
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:13,340
This hell in a handbasket that it's found itself in.

651
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,120
This runaway train heading off the edge of a cliff.

652
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,820
This useless sitcom we call life.

653
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:27,760
Did you know that we are nothing but shows to the exes?

654
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:34,200
Yes, our human lives, our lives as bipeds, as so-called intelligent mammals.

655
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:44,060
Our lives on this planet are merely the so-called radio or television shows of ultra-dimensional creatures.

656
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:49,540
They watch us as if we were their own little TV shows.

657
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,920
Some of us are comedies.

658
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,000
Some of us are murder mysteries.

659
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:01,860
Your father is in terrible horror shows.

660
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,380
I don't want you to feel guilty about this.

661
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,220
The exes watch each other's shows.

662
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,500
It's no fair.

663
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,980
Yes, you are the show of an exes.

664
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:20,820
And he is manipulating your life to make it more entertaining for his friends.

665
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,840
Sometimes I just can't stop crying, man.

666
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,960
It's like a revolving door, man.

667
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,860
I'm going in and out.

668
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:30,940
What seems like your daily life is actually scripted.

669
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,660
Come on, bud.

670
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:42,460
Moment by moment, every single thought you think, every word you say is recorded on special etheric tape created by these master aliens.

671
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:50,580
You'd better hope your life has pretty good ratings because if it doesn't, they'll just cancel that show.

672
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:59,420
Yes, you're just part of the show and there's advertisers who have to be satisfied.

673
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:00,020


674
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:03,760
You better hope your laugh track is up to snuff.

675
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,560
You know what I mean?

676
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:09,120
Better hope your background music is appropriate.

677
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:14,000
Better hope your special effects are about halfway realistic, pal.

678
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,880
You don't want to get canceled.

679
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,580
Sure, some people luck out.

680
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,020
They have sitcom live.

681
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:30,000
Then there's the others who have the best.

682
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,000


683
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,580
Lives of high drama, tragedy and irony.

684
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,720
Tough luck, ain't it?

685
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,760
Some shows have short runs.

686
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,220
Some are big hits.

687
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:57,060
And the Akashic Plain is like a liquid force field containing all of the memories, good and bad, all of the emotions of all of the inhabitants of this united place.

688
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:02,640
And if them men from Planet X don't like it, they'll just wipe it all out.

689
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:12,040
All of mankind's struggles, all the achievements of the long history of our two-legged race.

690
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,100
All for naught.

691
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,660
All for nothing.

692
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,900
Just because, what?

693
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,360
Why?

694
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,120
Because the aliens got bored.

695
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,920
They're down there before us.

696
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,860
Get rid of all that mess of trees over there.

697
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,900
Put a big little dog.

698
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,980
Put it under there and put up some little big cows.

699
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:37,640
And you know, sometimes they get bored not because it's not a good show, but because it's just over their heads.

700
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:47,300
You work so hard from cradle to grave trying to entertain those alien manipulator masters.

701
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,760
I think I'm going to go out and blow my foot off.

702
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,560
And in the end, they didn't think your jokes were all that funny.

703
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,500
They didn't think your cliffhangers were all that suspenseful.

704
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,920
You can't divorce me, no.

705
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,240
You can't divorce me, no.

706
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,520
Cancel it.

707
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,460
I'm going to be...

708
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,080
Cancel that show.

709
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:05,960
Yep.

710
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,940
Then you're nothing but a rerun.

711
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,780
Of course that's not so bad.

712
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:20,780
You're just a ghost doomed to live your life over and over and over again for those last few aliens that thought your show was slightly interesting.

713
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,040
Yep.

714
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:29,020
This is the Piddle Diddle Report.

715
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:36,520
A five-hour in-depth report on current issues of substance.

716
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,960
They're either on the island or off.

717
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,780
Welcome back. I'm Doug Piddle.

718
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,920
Do they know what's going to happen to the island?

719
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,280
Do they know we're going to blow it higher than a kite?

720
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,780
Right now, before anything else happens...

721
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,240
We're going right to our first stringer in L.A., Mr. Bud Good.

722
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:03,900
And he's had a confidential conversation with someone very close to Mr. Friday.

723
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,580
Let's go to that tape.

724
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:12,640
This man's name is Sergio Caracas, and he's a former employee of C. Eliot Friday.

725
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:17,080
We interviewed Mr. Caracas at his bungalow in L.A.

726
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,040
Okay, now you've worked on Howland with Friday.

727
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:27,780
Could you tell me what you were doing there, what it was like?

728
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:34,240
Let's see, that was in 1940.

729
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,480
I thought he was about 60 then.

730
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:50,880
I had just completed my graduate studies at Pennsylvania.

731
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,640
Pennsylvania Polypyrotechnic Institute.

732
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:04,900
And he was just finishing his last epic film in Hollywood, Frankenstein Meets Cyclops.

733
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,620
Somehow he...

734
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,900
Oh, oh, look, look, this is the good part.

735
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:31,260
Well, somehow he got word of my work with underwater alcohols.

736
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:40,140
And he invited me out to Hollywood to devise some convincing special effects for the film.

737
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:44,760
Well, that worked out fine.

738
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:50,860
I put together some subsurface arc generators in the sound system.

739
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:51,340
And I put together a little bit of a story about how I met him.

740
00:44:51,340 --> 00:45:00,060
I was in the United States tank, and when the alien pod landed in the ocean, all hell boiled forth.

741
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:11,100
Unfortunately, that film, Friday's last film, was lost.

742
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:15,200
Or perhaps destroyed.

743
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,360
Anyway, he was just testing me.

744
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:28,380
He was already developing equipment for the actual Project Cyclops at that time.

745
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:33,660
And he invited me to assist him on Howlin' Island.

746
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:39,020
Well, I never worked on that project.

747
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:50,780
As soon as I reached the island, he hatched a rather fantastic plan to shear the island off from the ocean.

748
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:56,580
I was in the middle of the ocean floor with huge underwater rock-cutting arc guns.

749
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:06,620
Well, I spent about a year on the island putting together these arc guns.

750
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,600
Oh, well.

751
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:19,200
And also the submarine carriages to hold them.

752
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:25,240
And eventually, I guess he did it.

753
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:32,580
But I had to leave when the war started.

754
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,620
What was the island like?

755
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:45,120
Oh, it was a lovely but very lonely place.

756
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:50,000
About 26 miles around its circumference.

757
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:50,840
Yes.

758
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:59,680
All laid out like a chessboard, except for the door over the laboratories and the living quarters.

759
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:07,580
There were oil wells here and there, and a road wound around the island.

760
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,980
I often took a drive on it to relax.

761
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:20,720
Incidentally, I was given a Mercedes limousine, which I was told,

762
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,940
belonged to Mr. Cary Grant, the movie actor.

763
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:26,720
Yes.

764
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:35,940
Well, he apparently left the cow on the island after an unpleasant experience of some sort.

765
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:41,720
No one would say what happened exactly.

766
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,100
This is the American Broadcasting System.

767
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:54,780
Have you ever had one of those days when you just wanted to pull the covers over your head and shut the world out?

768
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,620
To an agoraphobic, every day is like that.

769
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,880
They suffer from an inability to cope with the outside world.

770
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:06,760
On Channel 5's People Are Talking, you'll meet people who suffered from, but overcame, agoraphobia.

771
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:13,320
They'll reveal what they were afraid of and offer advice on how we can help the growing number of people affected by agoraphobia.

772
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:16,840
The...

773
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:17,580
The...

774
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:18,080
The...

775
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,760
This...

776
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:21,760


777
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,860
This...

778
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:28,860


779
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,140
...

780
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:30,220
...

781
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:48,060
My arkadaşlar удаются.

782
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:54,900
And we danced against the height of people have danced since the first man walked the

783
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:55,200
earth.

784
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,640
There's a somber place.

785
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,780
Oh, da, da, da, da.

786
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,040
I'd love to hear this when I take my getting there.

787
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,540
I can't hear the jail.

788
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:16,540
I don't know.

789
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:26,340
Yeah, if you get a little brain cavity, like Dave here, we can just fill it in with a plug

790
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:27,020
of silver.

791
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:30,860
Some people like to have a gold plug in their brain.

792
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,640
I think it's kind of tacky myself.

793
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,440
I go for the old Swiss on cork and the way my people have harvested thousands of corks.

794
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,940
I'm like, here's a simple plan.

795
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,200
I place in the information that got deep inside.

796
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:49,400
And when you use a court to plug those holes in your brain, like that, you can pull it

797
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:49,720
right out.

798
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:49,900
Right.

799
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:53,940
Oh, we're trying to cheer you in it.

800
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,240
Listen to his little brains easing out.

801
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,540
Let's set that part back in.

802
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,240
Oh, it's leaking just a little bit.

803
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:06,980
Tighten it up.

804
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:08,180
Yeah.

805
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:18,020
Let's try it out.

806
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:19,180
I'm figuring.

807
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:19,900
Dolbtown.

808
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:23,140
Hey.

809
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,600
I guess this leads us.

810
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,640
I tend to get heartworms.

811
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:27,680
Yes, it exists.

812
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,040
Well, they like that.

813
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:38,400
You give it a little boost.

814
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:38,420
Tremble your legs.

815
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:46,040
straight across the forehead and he's always smiling he's just the happiest thing we have

816
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:52,960
to keep him from putting things in his ears he's got a compulsion he likes to put things like match

817
00:50:52,960 --> 00:51:01,960
sticks and toothpicks deep into his ears but but but he's happier than he ever was before

818
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:15,460
ever since dave joined in fellowship under bob in the church of the subgenius he's been able to get

819
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:22,300
rid of those brain cells that he didn't need the useless brain cells the weak ones only the strong

820
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:30,520
survived friend yes dave died after piercing his brain with a coat hanger but he was brought back

821
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,100
to life

822
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:31,740
you

823
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:41,320
using a simple toilet paper roll and common household kitchen appliances well the question

824
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:47,260
on everyone's mind is should trepanation be legal men going at their brains with coat hangers and

825
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:52,140
bank alleys is this the way we want to uh well if they're going to make if they're going to make

826
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:57,480
trepanation and uh home brain surgery illegal that is going to mean a return to the rusty coat

827
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:01,400
hanger the eye socket yeah when i'm you know

828
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:08,360
when when uh when there it was prohibition of trepanation why back in them days uh people like

829
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:13,260
dave when they needed to calm down they'd go to one of those croakers in the back alley one of those

830
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:22,600
those seedy uh uh brain surgeons they they've used old beat up rusty equipment and so forth

831
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:30,100
and people like dave would end up with brain infections and radio shows now of course we have

832
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:30,920
to protect our

833
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:39,560
right rights the right of every person to have the front of their skull sawed open and hinged

834
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:47,480
so that bits and pieces can be taken out or replaced it's expensive sure we all but don't

835
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:54,600
we all need a little more memory to preserve those precious moments those precious memories like

836
00:52:54,600 --> 00:53:01,320
how to drive what our names are my first section where we go for work

837
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:02,840
those precious moments those precious memories like how to write

838
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:03,360
or how to read

839
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:10,980
i know i could sure use a little bit more rtiram

840
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:11,840
i know i could sure use a little bit more rtiram

841
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:15,520
rammed into the back of my brain well actually i guess that would go somewhere in the middle

842
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:23,880
it's hard to keep up these days friends every four months you gotta pry your skull open and

843
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:24,020
it's hard to keep up these days friends every four months you gotta pry your skull open and

844
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:25,540
just shovel money into it

845
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:35,600
smuggling those brain cells the cheap knockoff brain cells from taiwan of course they're you

846
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:40,440
know for the most part they work they work better than intel stuff and they shed like a disease

847
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:47,300
follicle well you do have to keep the socket clean and i tell you there's where you plug it in

848
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:53,260
yes there's an old african remedy that can work for you keeping them sockets clean is just a

849
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:59,100
matter of boiling down the proper roots you can buy in any home improvement store your ace hardware

850
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:04,780
you can buy it you can buy downstairs in the commissary and buy it from the library

851
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:10,780
well what we used to do to keep to keep the the brains from leaking out and get rid of the worms

852
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:17,020
was we'd stew up bananas we'd actually just put bananas in a pot of boiling water and stew them

853
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:22,600
for about an hour and the banana fumes would draw the worms out you'd lean over it over that pot

854
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,060
that's

855
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:32,120
steaming pot that smell like bananas and hold your skull plug closed and the worms would exit

856
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:38,900
through the nostrils they'd smell that banana fumes of banana fumes and they'd come come creeping

857
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:44,080
out your nose and the angelica that synthesizes the banana you have to have the angelica in there

858
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:50,880
is that is that what the worms respond to anyway that's how we got him out of dave and look at him

859
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:52,680
he's playing his

860
00:54:53,060 --> 00:55:00,640
scars are wormless his forehead scars are clean of worms there's nary a maggot writhing in those

861
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:01,540
creases

862
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:10,460
it's not a real prosthetic forehead yes dave's new prosthetic forehead available from the church of

863
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:22,720
the subgenus for only for only 1998. you will barely hear it running and you're gonna be a golfer with

864
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,940
guts to have your head knocked off and spitted to a vortex

865
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:37,640
a golfer with guts friends launch your head into heaven anytime you want that's right

We had some reports here that there was some scientific testing going on, highly secret.

891
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,640
Can the island really go underwater? Really?

892
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:02,940
Trans infiltration, that's the word we have. He's working on a trans infiltration device.

893
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,580
Now, is this true or not?

894
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:12,620
Uh, some of the aspects of the word we're engaging in does overlap on some of what's popularly called trans infiltration.

895
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:18,740
I see. And how far along is this project? Is he ready to actually infiltrate?

896
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:22,920
Well, our hands are somewhat forward.

897
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:24,100
We don't have a video feed!

898
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,360
What's wrong with Peter?

899
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:28,580
The dome is opening up! The dome is opening up!

900
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:31,500
Run in, Peter! Run in! Now's your chance! Run in!

901
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:35,880
I have to... my beeper is beeping something. Thank you for your...

902
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:38,240
Oh, look at that! My God, that's incredible!

903
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,520
Peter, what's happening?

904
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:44,620
They have me by the arms and they are pushing me inside!

905
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,320
Peter! Peter!

906
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:50,240
...by a black hole...

907
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,480
But now a new world was opened to him.

908
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:52,940
...a minute ago.

909
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:55,160
No problem, Peter.

910
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:03,860
And the door closes behind him. Safe.

911
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:13,300
I just talked to Peter Diddle off the air. He's on the island, of course, and he is inside the T'Cel tomb. Is that what it is?

912
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:16,000
I don't know. The console is all scrambled here.

913
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,620
Come on, read out, read out!

914
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:19,900

01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:20,880
