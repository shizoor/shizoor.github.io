1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,680
What is that?

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,520
This fungal growth seems to have traveled all the way to the base of the spine.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,480
This basal area here is completely covered with the fungus.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,340
This whale has not died from natural causes.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,060
This whale has died from...

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,480
It appears to be...

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:28,580
The suction cup-shaped scars covering the outer epidermis of Mrs. Monstro

8
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,980
indicated that she died at the tentacles of the great kraken,

9
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,580
the so-called mythical beast of the sea,

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,380
actually based upon the giant squid.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,640
And, man, that was...

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,180
Mighty good.

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,900
Yeah, now, poor old Witterwer Dave, when he met up with that squid,

14
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:55,620
he thought, well, now, man, I've had them whales, I've had them polar bears,

15
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,040
but I've never had a kraken.

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,560
A kraken.

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,160
A kraken, or whatever, one of them giant squids with a 50-foot tentacle reach

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,740
and that ink sac.

19
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,140
Oh, yes.

20
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,140
Mmm, the inks.

21
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,700
He could smell the ink.

22
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,300
Hey, old Dave was a hound dog.

23
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,680
He was a rooster back in them days, old Dave was.

24
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,200
Oh, he'd go after anything.

25
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,160
You know, honey, you know, he liked the way his hair was bent.

26
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,440
It looked like a skyscraper.

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,320
There were three different pieces on top of his skull,

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,640
and each one was capable of taking in a different signal

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,540
and retransmitting.

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,040
He could transmit it on different frequencies and wavelengths

31
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,920
until at certain times it seemed his whole head would glow

32
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,240
and he would create a vast vortex around him.

33
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,200
No one could see but him.

34
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,480
Just like that Japanese guy with the feather on his head.

35
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,180
.

47
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:17,760
I can't understand

48
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:17,760

wow

56
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,960
the most scientists were separated in their heads from the world that's just bizarre

57
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:56,120
glub glub glub and with that great drain plug came out in the center of the ocean

58
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:02,000
and the whole show went right down the drain and that was it that was the end of it

59
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,060
hell man what are we gonna do now manson's still in jail we gotta do something about charlie man

60
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:13,620
he never committed a crime all he did was let people do what they wanted to do

61
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:20,940
you know i saw that movie natural born killers let's go get a video camera and a boom box to

62
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,240
break charlie out man

63
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,180
we need to pray we need to pray

but who

65
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,600
okay they're jamming man they've got they've got one of those wind-up monkeys in a cardboard box

66
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,040
doing that drum that drum beat it's pretty high tech in here

67
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,880
taste the rich nougat

68
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,700
chas is going to play the guitar backwards with his teeth as the nougat fills the cavities

69
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,080
he's imbued with the spirit of an ancient sea creature

lena lena lena dave is now channeling an ancient sea creature

71
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,380

lena

76
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,580
doesn't make any sense to me either senseless

77
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,880
lena lena

78
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:42,860
my family lived on the minor island 6 000 years ago we traded bronze for small pieces of

79
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:48,000
onion skin paper which we will strip over our ear compromise on the feast days

80
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,100
well you know the the weird thing it goes on and on and on when you make an indent with people and people need a degree in science like you know we miss starï¿½

81
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,800
on but after a while the pattern starts to form and you know it makes a weird kind of a sense

82
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,620
and you know the the only way at that point to figure out what's true is to just just keep quiet

83
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:15,120
and keep watching just keep watching and keep listening because they're going to be watching

84
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,760
and listening back at you go ahead check out those stories of the installation inside hoover dam

85
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:31,260
all those stories about the groom lake crashed saucers those are just cover stories for

86
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:38,300
activities that are going on 400 miles away stories of unusual craft entering or leaving

87
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:44,920
bodies of water bear investigating as well as organizations closely associated with aquatic

88
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:51,600
mammals john lilly's studies are worthless he quit when he was discovered

89
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:00,500
he was very bitter about it and won't discuss it but we will you can't shut us up certain fields

90
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,440
of new age literature are conduits for open distribution of symbolically coded information

91
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:14,860
related to the neptune agenda and lonesome cowboy dave's filthy perversions with those self-same

92
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,940
gigantic mammals of the briny deep

93
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,540
i'll see if you notice this fresco

94
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:28,160
here take a closer look at this fresco it's all chipping off here this is 5 000 years old you can

95
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,280
still make out a great portion of the pigment and see what the actual colors were like it's been very

96
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:40,700
little fading this character with the pipe in his mouth appears to be sitting on some crude uh

97
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:48,800
tired device and the man next to him with the huge top of his head expanded out appears to be

98
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,620
hunting for whales this is

99
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,780

103
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,260

channel seven's bob mckenzie introduces you to bay area entrepreneurs who started with little more

107
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,200
than a great idea and turned it into millions rags to riches you bet bob mckenzie has the secrets of

108
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,220
their success this week on channel seven news at six

109
00:07:52,960 --> 00:08:03,720
this is the piddle diddle report a five-hour in-depth report on current issues of substance

110
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:14,240
welcome back to the piddle diddle report yes so we move to the mid-pacific for another look at the

111
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:21,280
mysterious howland island here's a little piece of production i put together tomorrow about this

112
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,740
fable and i'm going to tell you a little bit about it because i'm going to tell you a little bit about it

113
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,440
because i'm going to tell you a little bit about it

114
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:30,560
island it's well let's be frank it's sort of an impressionistic little piece a few of my personal

115
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,940
perceptions objectively thrown together around this island nucleus of man's need to wonder

116
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,860
oh my man

117
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:57,820
he can really feel me guaranteed to thrill me

118
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:13,940
he can hypnotize me really mesmerize me i mean it satisfies me

119
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,060
oh that drives me out of my mind

120
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,740
yes out of my mind

121
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,640
my name is friday

122
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,420
friday i'm pleased to meet you

123
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,620
my name is friday

124
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,980
my name is friday

125
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,760
there was no sign of human habitation no sound of human voice

126
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,540
no reason to believe that the island contained any living person

127
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,960
there was only one person who could actually create this world

128
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,900
really everyone action

129
00:09:54,020 --> 00:10:00,840
i was a guano prospector riding the seas from one little island to the next all over the pacific

130
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:09,540
yeah scraping guano off rocks and hauling it back to new jersey where they used invited a ton of milk

131
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:15,620
of magnesia we'd stop at every little rock that showed itself above the surface

132
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:20,780
you gotta think like a seagull when you're out on the guano ride

133
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,320
What the hell are they doing out there?

134
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,880
Well, we stopped at Howlin' many, many times.

135
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,820
There was nothing on it.

136
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,260
Nothing at all.

137
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:52,920
All this blab about Friday and his complex nonsense.

138
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,860
Howlin' Island's just a rock.

139
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,400
Used to be an airstrip on it for a while.

140
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,780
In a small shack made out of sheet metal.

141
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,100
Nobody ever there, though.

142
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,860
No sign of anyone.

143
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,700
Believe me, I was there two dozen times.

144
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,540
There's no truth to that Friday business.

145
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,160
Amelia Earhart was on the Pacific leg of an historic round-the-world flight.

146
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,840
She disappeared over the ocean.

147
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,400
The date was July 2nd, 1937.

148
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,120
Since then, her fate has remained a mystery.

149
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,480
Previously, historians believed Earhart became lost near Howlin' Island,

150
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,240
doubled back, and landed on a Japanese helipad.

151
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:48,520
In the first place, she was in a small town called Howlin' Island,

152
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,780
where some islanders claim she was held prisoner and later died.

153
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,200
But if the new evidence is correct, this would have been impossible.

154
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:02,140
The coordinates for Howlin' Island, the tiny sandbar Earhart was aiming for when she disappeared,

155
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,840
don't agree with current charts for the island.

156
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,920
The sad thing is they thought they were there.

157
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,360
Amelia called and said she was circling.

158
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,480
Must be on you but cannot see island.

159
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,960
He thought she was there.

160
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,240
They had that new vehicle.

161
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,240


162
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,240


163
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,240


164
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,240


165
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,240


166
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,240


167
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,280
A very powerful high-frequency direction finder on Howlin'.

168
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,980
You can't pick it up without the training antennas.

169
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,120
But they can pick her up and then relay her position via the Itasca.

170
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,340
K-H-A-Q-Q. Earhart. Overcast.

171
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,080
You'll listen.

172
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,960
Hey, see Elliot Friday. See Elliot Friday.

173
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,900
You got the weatherman here. Come on.

174
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,240
In Earhart's life, the world has changed.

175
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,240


176
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,280

Howon home!, is here, tell me how, you know, how long Brian's gone.

183
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,100

184
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,460
What do you think was that, everybody in here?

185
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:15,580


186
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,240
I don't know.

187
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,240


188
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,240


189
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,240


190
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,120
She's not getting a thing.

191
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,780
She has an ADF.

192
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,180
She can still not get on the homing signal.

193
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,800
She's close enough.

194
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,500
She's circling.

195
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,300
We are on 5.

196
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,960
1, 5, 7 degrees.

197
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,480
And 3, 3, 7 degrees.

198
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,980
We'll repeat this message on 6, 2, 1, 0.

199
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:39,840
Wait.

200
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,560
Listening.

201
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,300
On 6, 2, 1, 0.

202
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,880
We are running north and south.

203
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,920
North and south of what?

204
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,900
Stay on 3, 1, 0, 5.

205
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,520
Long enough for me to take bearing.

206
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,300
Pine 6, 2, 1, 0.

207
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:54,660
Monitor.

208
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,120
I hear you on 3, 1, 0, 5.

209
00:13:59,220 --> 00:13:59,660
Earhart.

210
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,580
Remember Amelia Earhart's last message?

211
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,400
We're on line 1, 5, 7, 3, 3, 7.

212
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,420
Running north and south.

213
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,800
There's really nothing new.

214
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,780
If she were flying from land to island,

215
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,900
then she could have spotted this land,

216
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,940
no matter what anybody's checked out so far.

217
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
She's on a line south.

218
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,640
1, 5, 7 degrees by compass from Howland Island.

219
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,040
She could have seen.

220
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,360
Negative land signal from there.

221
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,720
I can't.

222
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,140
In the presence of a 50-year-old mystery.

223
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,720
Amelia, come in.

224
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,120
3, 1, 0, 5.

225
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,680
Landed in the lagoon and found a European observer

226
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,440
and some natives gathering gull guano.

227
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,040
Break 1-9.

228
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,220
This is the information feedback.

229
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,380
They were calling Hull Island.

230
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,180
Wingville Reef is probably where she landed.

231
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,640
That's 170 miles southeast of Howland Island.

232
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,840
The reef sticks up about 6 feet out of the water at low tide.

233
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,140
Amelia.

234
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,040
Pogo Pogo.

235
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,880
See, the Earhart plane had been equipped with a fixed-loop antenna,

236
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,700
early-model radio compass,

237
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,440
which required her to turn the entire plane

238
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,420
in order to get a fix on any radio transmission,

239
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,000
like the one they showed.

240
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,500
Just exposed that Amelia Earhart had just passed south of Howland Island

241
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,420
and had then established a fix on negative land view 2 album

242
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,080
floating in some trash just south of it.

243
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,720
Just south of Howland Island.

244
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,200
They have reason to believe that that is where

245
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,240
Amelia Earhart may have tried to make an emergency landing.

246
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,220
They've done two or three expeditions,

247
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,160
to the island.

248
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,140
The latest one, they came back with a large piece of metal,

249
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,440
they say, as part of the belly of Amelia Earhart's airplane.

250
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,460
They've also found some personal artifacts on the island

251
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,900
that they believe connect to her.

252
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,780
One was a size 7 shoe, believed to be Earhart's.

253
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,780
So the mystery of Amelia Earhart's disappearance goes on,

254
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,520
and another mystery comes up.

255
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,740
Howland where it is, or Howland where they thought it was?

256
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,220
It's an atoll, a coral reef that literally goes underground.

257
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:48,220


258
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,760
Yeah, I have done Howland construction.

259
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:05,400
Let's see, started in 48, worked out there for about a year and a half straight.

260
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,800
I've done ships, good pay.

261
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,180
Is today Friday?

262
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,420
No, I never saw Old Man Friday personally.

263
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,220
We got tape messages over the phone.

264
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:18,220


265
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,960
The loudspeakers fail irregular.

266
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,980
They put him on, and they'd be talking about their projects,

267
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,160
and how far we've gone, and underwater construction.

268
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:34,360
They never explained what all we were building out there,

269
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,540
not altogether, said it was an industrial secret.

270
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,000
Never gave us the name of the island either.

271
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,520
I figured it was Howland, though, later on,

272
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,220
after putting him on there.

273
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:48,220


274
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:48,220


275
00:16:48,240 --> 00:17:16,720
people started talking about. I spent most of my time in a diving suit underwater. I was constructing a bunch of huge tanks and pumping systems there. These were being attached to the island beneath the water line. But I don't believe myself that these were any kind of a balance system to raise or lower the island.

276
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:35,600
That's ridiculous. That's not possible. They say it's an artificial island. Well, it looks real to me. It's volcanic. It grows right out of the ocean floor. That's where I worked.

277
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:45,880
As we reach the rocky shore, the island gently bobs up and down just slightly with the waves. Now this is not something that islands usually do.

278
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,080
And in fact, this isn't an island at all.

279
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:57,980
This island weighs 700 tons. It has 120 tons of rock around the shoreline. It has 100 tons of white sand from Carmel on the beach.

280
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:03,060
We make our own electricity here. And we have our own treatment plant for sewage. We're all self-contained.

281
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:10,660
A floating tropical island. For 10 years he labored over it. Only he knows why. But it is impressive.

282
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,700
From the rocky shoreline to the live trees that rustle loudly in the brisk wind.

283
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,120
Oh dear friends.

284
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:25,420
Negative Land has taken us on a mysterious little journey there to Howland Island.

285
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:33,480
This has been a very maritime sort of show. Continued from last week's Hour of Slack show.

286
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:40,740
Yes, I don't know what it has to do with Baha'b except the movement of the island up and down.

287
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,880
But we're going to go even further south, friends.

288
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:52,720
Far south. To hear about life on the frozen ocean. Life on the ice.

289
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,760
And this...

290
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,740
The other day my kid came in and said,

291
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:09,440
There's these creatures that... they're these little hairless rat-like things that bore their way through the ice because their heads are burning hot.

292
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,200
And they tear penguins apart. And I was going, what?

293
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,040
He goes, it's in Discover Magazine.

294
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,740
I said, what?

295
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,800
And he goes, let me show it to you. I didn't think you'd believe me.

296
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,600
So, he whips it out.

297
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,560
And sure enough, here it is. Discover Magazine. April issue.

298
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,280
This story...

299
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,620
I mean, this... you're not going to want to believe this, dear friends.

300
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:39,480
It's horrifying. It's going to eat at your mind. It certainly did me.

301
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,180
April Pazot was about to call it a day when she noticed...

302
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:50,060
noticed that the penguins she was observing seemed strangely agitated.

303
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:59,540
Pazot, a wildlife biologist, was in Antarctica studying penguins at a remote, poorly explored area along the coast of the Ross Sea.

304
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:06,720
I was getting ready to release a penguin I had tagged when I heard a lot of squawking, says Pazot.

305
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,340
When I looked up, the whole flock had sort of stampeded.

306
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,680
They were waddling away faster than I'd ever seen them move.

307
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,960
Pazot waded through the panicked birds to find out what was wrong.

308
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,640
She found one penguin that hadn't fled.

309
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,040
It was sinking into the ice as if into quicksand, she says.

310
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:31,580
Somehow the ice beneath the bird had melted. The penguin was waist-deep in slush.

311
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,640
Pazot tried to help the struggling penguin. She grabbed its wings and pulled.

312
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,200
With a heave, she freed the bird.

313
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:43,100
But the penguin wasn't the only thing she hauled from the slush.

314
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:52,340
About a dozen small, hairless, pink, mole-like creatures had clamped their jaws onto the penguin's lower body.

315
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,380
Pazot managed to capture one of the creatures.

316
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,300
The others quickly released their grip and vanished into the slush.

317
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:06,160
Over the next few months, Pazot caught several of the animals and watched others in the wild.

318
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,860
She calls the strange new species, hot-headed naked ice borers.

319
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,540
They're repulsive, says Pazot.

320
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:23,240
And friends, according to this picture they've reprinted here, they are indeed among the most repulsive-looking creatures I've ever seen.

321
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:31,240
Like a hairless possum embryo, but with saber-tooth tiger fangs and a glowing skull plate.

322
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:38,040
Now get this. Adults are about six inches long, weigh a few ounces, have a very high metabolic rate,

323
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,800
their body temperature is 110 degrees,

324
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,040
and live in labyrinthine tunnels carved in the ice.

325
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,120
Perhaps their most fascinating feature is a bony plate on their forehead.

326
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,440
Innumerable blood vessels line the skin covering the plate.

327
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,120
The animals radiate a tremendous amount of body heat through their hot plates,

328
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,800
which they use to melt their tunnels in the ice to hunt their favorite prey, penguins.

329
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,540
A pack of ice borers will cluster under a penguin

330
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,400
and melt the ice and snow it's standing on.

331
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:17,000
When the hapless bird sinks into the slush, the ice borers attack,

332
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,560
dispatching it with bites of their sharp incisors.

333
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,200
They then carve it up and carry its flesh back to their burrows,

334
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,040
leaving behind only webbed feet, a beak, and some feathers.

335
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,120
They travel through the ice at surprisingly high speeds, says Pazot,

336
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,480
much faster than a penguin can waddle.

337
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,340
Pazot's discovery may also solve a long-standing,

338
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,400
Antarctic mystery.

339
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:45,340
What happened to the heroic polar explorer Philippe Poisson,

340
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,200
who disappeared in Antarctica without a trace in 1837?

341
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:56,740
I wouldn't rule out the possibility that a big pack of ice borers got him, says Pazot.

342
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,540
I've seen what these things do to emperor penguins.

343
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:04,200
It isn't pretty, and emperors can be as much as four feet tall.

344
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,020
Poisson was about five foot six.

345
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,800
To the ice borers,

346
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,680
he would have looked like a big penguin.

347
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,240
Oh, my friends.

348
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,880
Oh, my friends.

349
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:23,700
The horror of a world created by a god that would allow evolution to take such a turn

350
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,260
that these creatures would zip under the ice with their burning hot heads

351
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,600
and snatch a poor explorer or penguin,

352
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,900
uh, sinking into the...

353
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,400
Imagine! What a way to go!

354
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,400
Sinking into the slush,

355
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,520
uh, in the middle of the night,

356
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,280
not knowing what was tearing you limb from...

357
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,500
or tiny pieces of your body off.

358
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,520
Uh...

359
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,300
I can't wait to see the...

360
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:55,000
the Discovery Channel footage of the mating frenzy of the ice borers

361
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,800
and the bloody horror of them tearing a penguin apart.

362
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,360
Friends, but before we go any further,

363
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,660
I have to tell you that...

364
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,680
this is the April issue of Discover Magazine,

365
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,380
and the first words in the paragraph, uh,

366
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,360
in this news article were,

367
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,120
April Poisson.

368
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:20,980
And we have to wonder whether Italian is the language in which Poisson means fool.

369
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,160
But, uh,

370
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,460
it did that to us for a little while.

371
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,360
But, friends, I believe in the naked, hot-headed ice borer.

372
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,660
I believe in that creature!

373
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,080
I know that... that somewhere, they live.

374
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,820
Even if they haven't been discovered yet.

375
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,320
Friend, like the prairie squid,

376
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,460
and the...

377
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,740
face-raping bat.

378
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,080
Nature's wonders shall...

379
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,400
e'er be hidden from us.

380
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,060
And the Loch Ness Monster,

381
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,280
and our cousins, the full-blood yetis of the forest.

382
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,840
We know, dear friends, that they,

383
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,320
the snipe bird, and the Gaius Gudis,

384
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,140
were all created by Bob

385
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,460
to puzzle the pinks

386
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,060
and to help the subjects.

387
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,220
And the genius to believe.

388
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,900
Ah, yes.

389
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,220
This music in the background is, uh,

390
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,420
Reverend Arnold Mathis.

391
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,440
Dear friends...

392
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:28,940
Well, I'm afraid what we're gonna have to do now is go back in time

393
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,140
to WCSB in Cleveland,

394
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,620
where Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Chaz, and, uh,

395
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,340
Einstein's Secret Orchestra

396
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,660
continued on into the night,

397
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,320
trying to figure out the horrible, horrible secret!

398
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,480
Hello, Mom! I'm the one who's been looking for you all night!

399
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,420
Don't be afraid.

400
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,040
Don't be afraid.

401
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,260
Here's your red envelope.

402
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,700
Time for the Swedish whale tortillas.

403
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,960
Happy money for you, happy new year,

404
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:05,940
and good luck.

405
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,560
Oh, thank you, thank you.

406
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,740
These Swedish aborigines

407
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,760
were very, very tiny people.

408
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,920
They were able to use whale lard

409
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,920
for many, many, many household appliances

410
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,560
that we take for granted.

411
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,460
And of course the cone dance,

412
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,780
every fifth of Bob McMindle,

413
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,240
also had to do with the accumulation of clamshells in the neighborhood.

414
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,600
An excavation has shown that many of these clamshells

415
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,780
are actually capable of picking up radio signals.

416
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,520
The ancient Swedish sea-going tribes

417
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,700
were masters of harpooning and feedback.

418
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,120
Devil worshippers,

419
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,540
they were known as berserkers

420
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,220
to the neighboring tribes,

421
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,600
such as the Finns,

422
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,240
uh, the early Picts,

423
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,000
and the early Scots.

424
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,640
These, uh, Swedish savages

425
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,200
swept over the North Country,

426
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:07,320
uh, uh, spreading, wreaking havoc,

427
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,580
and spreading fertilizer.

428
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,720
And meatballs.

429
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,340
And meatballs, yes.

430
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,380
Swedish whale meatballs.

431
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,880
Oh, and warm milk, too.

432
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,480
We can't go a day without lots of warm milk.

433
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,960
They would milk the great serpents

434
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,620
of the northern waters.

435
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,380
And they would actually milk, milk,

436
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,520
the snake milk out of a man's body

437
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,780
after he digged a sea-mad.

438
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,260
And they would fix it with the spider eggs.

439
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,900
And then they would foretell the future

440
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:43,120
from that which erupted back up out of the stomack

441
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,100
of the, uh, the victim.

442
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,980
Or the, uh, Bobby or the Colt,

443
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,340
or whatever, you know.

444
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,760
It's been the same old story

445
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,040
down through the years.

446
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,980
It's snake oil, uh, totem poles, and...

447
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,760
Body branding.

448
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,620
And, uh, cargo coals.

449
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:11,280
And, uh, transportation.

450
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,180
And, uh, quick

451
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:22,200
And, uh, and, uh,

452
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,740
they've beenalt basically

453
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,140
prettyÃ­ve been dissolute,

454
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,200
ADPH like theyÃ­re been in the

455
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,620
Ã¼nÃ¡s, uh, ninth century,

456
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:31,620


457
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,640
that grassy knoll.

458
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,320
There's dozens of them

459
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,200
hanging out that six-story window.

460
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,160
There's 50 guys

461
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,000
flashing umbrellas up and down

462
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,360
to signal the gunmen

463
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,680
up in the records building.

464
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,900
And Elvis is dead.

465
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,120
So what is there left, friends?

466
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,880
Rock, rock, rock.

467
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,160
There's lots of sports enthusiasm.

468
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,180
There's love for our nation.

469
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,140
There's the love for a woman, damn you.

470
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,480
Can't you understand what a man is?

471
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,440
A man's not a highfalutin character

472
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,380
searching the stars for answers

473
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,040
one way or another.

474
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,520
A man's got to have his feet on the ground.

475
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,160
A man's got to be a man.

476
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,780
Plant those feet firmly, Reverend,

477
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,480
and you'll never stray far.

478
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,460
Forget this fine religion.

479
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,780
A man's got to do what an amoeba must.

480
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,640
I got my feet in the clouds

481
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,500
and my head on the pavement.

482
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,960
She danced with me.

483
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,420
She danced with me.

484
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,020
And I killed her for looking

485
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:29,380
at her.

486
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,040
Another woman.

487
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,860
Tonight, I'll whack you back at your feet.

488
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,040
The production was produced

489
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,660
by Space Week

490
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,820
on the third planet.

491
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,860
We are the

492
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,400
Jacques-Eve

493
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,340
and the cast

494
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,680
is directed by

495
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,300
Andrew MacGill.

496
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,800
This is sort of like a

497
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,580
what's wrong with that picture kind of scene.

498
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,660
Everything is very antique looking

499
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,140
and beautiful, and yet that chandelier

500
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,100
is swaying vehemently back and forth.

501
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,120
That shows we're floating.

502
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,620
Lots of people don't believe we're a floating island,

503
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,160
so I had to put that there.

504
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,920
That's what's so great about a floating island.

505
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,640
You can move it around.

506
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,780
If you don't like the climate,

507
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,640
you don't like your neighbors,

508
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,420
you don't like the politics,

509
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:39,980
you can move it.

510
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,420
Do you know how much it cost you altogether,

511
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,900
or do you shudder to even think?

512
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,560
It's very peaceful on the island.

513
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,280
He relaxes now,

514
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,040
gazing out through the curved glass

515
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,480
that wraps around his 17th floor office

516
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,080
in the Found Sound Foundation's Howland Tower.

517
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,080
He watches the remnants of dense, white, and black,

518
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,160
the white fog from Friday's smoke screen machines

519
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,900
drift away from the island and out across the Pacific.

520
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,680
There must have been a passing ship or plane detected.

521
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,700
He could see Friday's vintage U2

522
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,040
parked outside its hanger on the runway below.

523
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,580
They must be getting it ready for the trip to LA

524
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,860
to pick up Mr. Ginn.

525
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,640
A nice touch, he thought.

526
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,800
The dive alarm signals the end of another business day.

527
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,780
He leans back on his cushy brand cushion,

528
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,100
loosens his power brand tie,

529
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,800
and lazily gazes out the curved panorama brand window

530
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,800
at the usual blood-red sunset.

531
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,700
He casually notices that he is no longer

532
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,060
slightly apprehensive when the water level

533
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,620
of the Pacific Ocean slowly rises outside

534
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:47,160
to swirl away his 17th floor view in bubbling confusion.

535
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,620
Soon, he would be asleep in the deep.

536
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,160
They are things that are undertaken

537
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,820
because someone is moved by curiosity,

538
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,280
the love of excellence, a point of honor,

539
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,360
the compulsion to invent or to understand.

540
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:10,460
In such persons, mankind overcomes the inertia

541
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:14,100
which would keep it earthbound forever in its habitual ways.

542
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:19,040
They have in them the free, wild, and useless energy

543
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,920
with which alone man surpasses himself.

544
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:28,080
All the heroes, the saints and the seers, the explorers,

545
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,080


546
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,080


547
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,220
and the creators partake of it.

548
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:35,520
They do the useless, brave, noble, the divinely foolish,

549
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,940
and the very wisest things that are done by men.

550
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,920
And what they may prove to themselves and to others

551
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,920
is that man is no mere creature of his habits,

552
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,160
no mere cog in the collective machine,

553
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,820
but that in the dust of which he is made,

554
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,840
there is also fire.

555
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,700
Lighted now and then by great winds from the sky.

556
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,380
.

557
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:05,380


558
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,840
Break 13.

559
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,300
.

560
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,060
Cut.

561
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:24,320
Break one more time for C. Eliot Friday.

562
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,480
Are you out there? You've got the weatherman.

563
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,140
.

564
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,440
.

565
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:29,280
.

566
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:37,980
.

567
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:37,980


568
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:38,120
.

569
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,160
.

570
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,240
.

571
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,280
.

572
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:38,600
.

573
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:38,700
.

574
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,840
.

575
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,200
.

576
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:53,060
As the story goes, in 1948, famous film actor Cary Grant and his wife were visiting Howland Island as guests of Mr. Friday.

577
00:33:53,360 --> 00:34:01,040
Mr. Grant had his car, a 1944 Mercedes limousine, shipped to the island so that he and his wife could spend their holiday on the road.

578
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,200
On the Howland Road.

579
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,600
Well, a strange event happened one night while Mr. Grant and his wife were out on a drive.

580
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:17,060
Dramatically enough, this event is verified because the day before, Mr. Friday had given Mr. Grant a new product from Fridatronics to test.

581
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:20,880
It was the latest in battery-operated portable tape recorders.

582
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:28,620
And Mr. Grant, thank God, had the wits to switch this recorder on during the strange and frightening occurrence that took place that night.

583
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:32,380
Now, we present that tape in its entirety.

584
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:38,580
From the Cary Grant estate archives, the long-suppressed true recording of Mr. and his wife.

585
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:44,140
And Mrs. Cary Grant's actual encounter with the ghost of Amelia Earhart on Howland Island.

586
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,720
Or was it?

587
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,700
She's trying to get in the car!

588
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,100
Look at her face! And her hair!

589
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,400
Go away!

590
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,680
Let me in! I'm not crazy!

591
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,880
The crazy woman is after me!

592
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,620
Don't let her in!

593
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,180
Let me in!

594
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,080
I'm not going to scare her.

595
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,460
Go away! Go away!

596
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,000
We've got a gun! We'll shoot!

597
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,140
It worked. She's staring at us.

598
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,320
I'm warning you!

599
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,420
I'll shoot!

600
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,500
She's coming back!

601
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,500
Please! Don't leave me out here! Please!

602
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:15,680
Please!

603
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,580
Take your pipe. Hold it like a gun. It'll look like a gun.

604
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:20,980
Where is it?

605
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,740
It was in the glove compartment.

606
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,140
Here. Here it is.

607
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,360
Look!

608
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,200
I've got a gun!

609
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,580
I'm going to shoot!

610
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,680
She's backing away.

611
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,360
Keep going! Before I start shooting!

612
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,320
She's gone. She disappeared.

613
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,860
We can't get out now. All we can do is sit here all night and wait for help.

614
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,380
Can you see her? Where did she go?

615
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,700
I don't know. She's out there, though. Probably planning on how to get in this car.

616
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,660
What are we going to do? She's the one I know.

617
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,380
Her face is all twisted and her hair hanging down.

618
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,760
She'll kill us. She'll kill us.

619
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,400
Dorothy, stop it.

620
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,320
She'll kill us.

621
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,340
She'll kill us.

622
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:05,340


623
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:05,340


624
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:05,340


625
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:05,340


626
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:05,340


627
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:05,340


628
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,100
No!

629
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:07,600


630
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:32,180
These incubators handle a thousand babies in five minutes.

631
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,320
Nobody knows about this.

632
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:35,660
Nobody knows about this party.

633
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,900
Some of them have green fingernails.

634
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,100
Who is the super dad of all these fattened babies?

635
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,520
All these expanding children with green fingernails?

636
00:36:53,120 --> 00:37:00,100
One father of billions and billions of mutated, bald sperm?

637
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,340
The subgenius sperm bank.

638
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:08,800
The wild, bloody gene perhaps found, perhaps never will be found.

639
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:14,620
Are you thin enough to make a deposit at the subgenius sperm bank?

640
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,320
Will you?

641
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:24,720
Will you bear the genes that will make you worthy to father the 12,000 children of B-B-B-Bob?

642
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,060
We need them genes, friends.

643
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,900
We haven't received enough genes.

644
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:41,400
So send those private genetic codes out from your loins, pack them into an envelope,

645
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:51,740
and send them to Bob at Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

646
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,360
Because a good pair of genes is hard to find.

647
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,960
We need more than a pair of genes, friends.

648
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,320
We need a string of several million heretofore unknown genes.

649
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,360
That's what it's going to take to get this world out of the mess.

650
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:13,340
This hell in a handbasket that it's found itself in.

651
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,120
This runaway train heading off the edge of a cliff.

652
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,820
This useless sitcom we call life.

653
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:27,760
Did you know that we are nothing but shows to the exes?

654
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:34,200
Yes, our human lives, our lives as bipeds, as so-called intelligent mammals.

655
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:44,060
Our lives on this planet are merely the so-called radio or television shows of ultra-dimensional creatures.

656
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:49,540
They watch us as if we were their own little TV shows.

657
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,920
Some of us are comedies.

658
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,000
Some of us are murder mysteries.

659
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:01,860
Your father is in terrible horror shows.

660
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,380
I don't want you to feel guilty about this.

661
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,220
The exes watch each other's shows.

662
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,500
It's no fair.

663
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,980
Yes, you are the show of an exes.

664
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:20,820
And he is manipulating your life to make it more entertaining for his friends.

665
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,840
Sometimes I just can't stop crying, man.

666
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,960
It's like a revolving door, man.

667
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,860
I'm going in and out.

668
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:30,940
What seems like your daily life is actually scripted.

669
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,660
Come on, bud.

670
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:42,460
Moment by moment, every single thought you think, every word you say is recorded on special etheric tape created by these master aliens.

671
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:50,580
You'd better hope your life has pretty good ratings because if it doesn't, they'll just cancel that show.

672
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:59,420
Yes, you're just part of the show and there's advertisers who have to be satisfied.

673
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:00,020


674
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:03,760
You better hope your laugh track is up to snuff.

675
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,560
You know what I mean?

676
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:09,120
Better hope your background music is appropriate.

677
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:14,000
Better hope your special effects are about halfway realistic, pal.

678
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,880
You don't want to get canceled.

679
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,580
Sure, some people luck out.

680
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,020
They have sitcom live.

681
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:30,000
Then there's the others who have the best.

682
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,000


683
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,580
Lives of high drama, tragedy and irony.

684
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,720
Tough luck, ain't it?

685
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,760
Some shows have short runs.

686
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,220
Some are big hits.

687
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:57,060
And the Akashic Plain is like a liquid force field containing all of the memories, good and bad, all of the emotions of all of the inhabitants of this united place.

688
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:02,640
And if them men from Planet X don't like it, they'll just wipe it all out.

689
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:12,040
All of mankind's struggles, all the achievements of the long history of our two-legged race.

690
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,100
All for naught.

691
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,660
All for nothing.

692
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,900
Just because, what?

693
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,360
Why?

694
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,120
Because the aliens got bored.

695
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,920
They're down there before us.

696
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,860
Get rid of all that mess of trees over there.

697
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,900
Put a big little dog.

698
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,980
Put it under there and put up some little big cows.

699
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:37,640
And you know, sometimes they get bored not because it's not a good show, but because it's just over their heads.

700
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:47,300
You work so hard from cradle to grave trying to entertain those alien manipulator masters.

701
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,760
I think I'm going to go out and blow my foot off.

702
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,560
And in the end, they didn't think your jokes were all that funny.

703
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,500
They didn't think your cliffhangers were all that suspenseful.

704
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,920
You can't divorce me, no.

705
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,240
You can't divorce me, no.

706
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,520
Cancel it.

707
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,460
I'm going to be...

708
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,080
Cancel that show.

709
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:05,960
Yep.

710
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,940
Then you're nothing but a rerun.

711
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,780
Of course that's not so bad.

712
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:20,780
You're just a ghost doomed to live your life over and over and over again for those last few aliens that thought your show was slightly interesting.

713
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,040
Yep.

714
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:29,020
This is the Piddle Diddle Report.

715
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:36,520
A five-hour in-depth report on current issues of substance.

716
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,960
They're either on the island or off.

717
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,780
Welcome back. I'm Doug Piddle.

718
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,920
Do they know what's going to happen to the island?

719
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,280
Do they know we're going to blow it higher than a kite?

720
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,780
Right now, before anything else happens...

721
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,240
We're going right to our first stringer in L.A., Mr. Bud Good.

722
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:03,900
And he's had a confidential conversation with someone very close to Mr. Friday.

723
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,580
Let's go to that tape.

724
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:12,640
This man's name is Sergio Caracas, and he's a former employee of C. Eliot Friday.

725
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:17,080
We interviewed Mr. Caracas at his bungalow in L.A.

726
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,040
Okay, now you've worked on Howland with Friday.

727
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:27,780
Could you tell me what you were doing there, what it was like?

728
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:34,240
Let's see, that was in 1940.

729
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,480
I thought he was about 60 then.

730
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:50,880
I had just completed my graduate studies at Pennsylvania.

731
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,640
Pennsylvania Polypyrotechnic Institute.

732
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:04,900
And he was just finishing his last epic film in Hollywood, Frankenstein Meets Cyclops.

733
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,620
Somehow he...

734
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,900
Oh, oh, look, look, this is the good part.

735
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:31,260
Well, somehow he got word of my work with underwater alcohols.

736
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:40,140
And he invited me out to Hollywood to devise some convincing special effects for the film.

737
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:44,760
Well, that worked out fine.

738
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:50,860
I put together some subsurface arc generators in the sound system.

739
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:51,340
And I put together a little bit of a story about how I met him.

740
00:44:51,340 --> 00:45:00,060
I was in the United States tank, and when the alien pod landed in the ocean, all hell boiled forth.

741
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:11,100
Unfortunately, that film, Friday's last film, was lost.

742
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:15,200
Or perhaps destroyed.

743
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,360
Anyway, he was just testing me.

744
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:28,380
He was already developing equipment for the actual Project Cyclops at that time.

745
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:33,660
And he invited me to assist him on Howlin' Island.

746
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:39,020
Well, I never worked on that project.

747
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:50,780
As soon as I reached the island, he hatched a rather fantastic plan to shear the island off from the ocean.

748
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:56,580
I was in the middle of the ocean floor with huge underwater rock-cutting arc guns.

749
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:06,620
Well, I spent about a year on the island putting together these arc guns.

750
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,600
Oh, well.

751
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:19,200
And also the submarine carriages to hold them.

752
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:25,240
And eventually, I guess he did it.

753
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:32,580
But I had to leave when the war started.

754
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,620
What was the island like?

755
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:45,120
Oh, it was a lovely but very lonely place.

756
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:50,000
About 26 miles around its circumference.

757
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:50,840
Yes.

758
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:59,680
All laid out like a chessboard, except for the door over the laboratories and the living quarters.

759
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:07,580
There were oil wells here and there, and a road wound around the island.

760
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,980
I often took a drive on it to relax.

761
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:20,720
Incidentally, I was given a Mercedes limousine, which I was told,

762
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,940
belonged to Mr. Cary Grant, the movie actor.

763
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:26,720
Yes.

764
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:35,940
Well, he apparently left the cow on the island after an unpleasant experience of some sort.

765
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:41,720
No one would say what happened exactly.

766
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,100
This is the American Broadcasting System.

767
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:54,780
Have you ever had one of those days when you just wanted to pull the covers over your head and shut the world out?

768
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,620
To an agoraphobic, every day is like that.

769
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,880
They suffer from an inability to cope with the outside world.

770
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:06,760
On Channel 5's People Are Talking, you'll meet people who suffered from, but overcame, agoraphobia.

771
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:13,320
They'll reveal what they were afraid of and offer advice on how we can help the growing number of people affected by agoraphobia.

772
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:16,840
The...

773
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:17,580
The...

774
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:18,080
The...

775
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,760
This...

776
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:21,760


777
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,860
This...

778
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:28,860


779
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,140
...

780
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:30,220
...

781
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:48,060
My arkadaÅlar ÑÐ´Ð°ÑÑÑÑ.

782
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:54,900
And we danced against the height of people have danced since the first man walked the

783
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:55,200
earth.

784
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,640
There's a somber place.

785
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,780
Oh, da, da, da, da.

786
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,040
I'd love to hear this when I take my getting there.

787
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,540
I can't hear the jail.

788
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:16,540
I don't know.

789
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:26,340
Yeah, if you get a little brain cavity, like Dave here, we can just fill it in with a plug

790
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:27,020
of silver.

791
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:30,860
Some people like to have a gold plug in their brain.

792
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,640
I think it's kind of tacky myself.

793
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,440
I go for the old Swiss on cork and the way my people have harvested thousands of corks.

794
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,940
I'm like, here's a simple plan.

795
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,200
I place in the information that got deep inside.

796
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:49,400
And when you use a court to plug those holes in your brain, like that, you can pull it

797
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:49,720
right out.

798
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:49,900
Right.

799
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:53,940
Oh, we're trying to cheer you in it.

800
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,240
Listen to his little brains easing out.

801
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,540
Let's set that part back in.

802
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,240
Oh, it's leaking just a little bit.

803
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:06,980
Tighten it up.

804
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:08,180
Yeah.

805
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:18,020
Let's try it out.

806
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:19,180
I'm figuring.

807
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:19,900
Dolbtown.

808
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:23,140
Hey.

809
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,600
I guess this leads us.

810
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,640
I tend to get heartworms.

811
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:27,680
Yes, it exists.

812
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,040
Well, they like that.

813
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:38,400
You give it a little boost.

814
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:38,420
Tremble your legs.

815
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:46,040
straight across the forehead and he's always smiling he's just the happiest thing we have

816
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:52,960
to keep him from putting things in his ears he's got a compulsion he likes to put things like match

817
00:50:52,960 --> 00:51:01,960
sticks and toothpicks deep into his ears but but but he's happier than he ever was before

818
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:15,460
ever since dave joined in fellowship under bob in the church of the subgenius he's been able to get

819
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:22,300
rid of those brain cells that he didn't need the useless brain cells the weak ones only the strong

820
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:30,520
survived friend yes dave died after piercing his brain with a coat hanger but he was brought back

821
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,100
to life

822
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:31,740
you

823
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:41,320
using a simple toilet paper roll and common household kitchen appliances well the question

824
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:47,260
on everyone's mind is should trepanation be legal men going at their brains with coat hangers and

825
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:52,140
bank alleys is this the way we want to uh well if they're going to make if they're going to make

826
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:57,480
trepanation and uh home brain surgery illegal that is going to mean a return to the rusty coat

827
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:01,400
hanger the eye socket yeah when i'm you know

828
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:08,360
when when uh when there it was prohibition of trepanation why back in them days uh people like

829
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:13,260
dave when they needed to calm down they'd go to one of those croakers in the back alley one of those

830
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:22,600
those seedy uh uh brain surgeons they they've used old beat up rusty equipment and so forth

831
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:30,100
and people like dave would end up with brain infections and radio shows now of course we have

832
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:30,920
to protect our

833
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:39,560
right rights the right of every person to have the front of their skull sawed open and hinged

834
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:47,480
so that bits and pieces can be taken out or replaced it's expensive sure we all but don't

835
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:54,600
we all need a little more memory to preserve those precious moments those precious memories like

836
00:52:54,600 --> 00:53:01,320
how to drive what our names are my first section where we go for work

837
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:02,840
those precious moments those precious memories like how to write

838
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:03,360
or how to read

839
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:10,980
i know i could sure use a little bit more rtiram

840
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:11,840
i know i could sure use a little bit more rtiram

841
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:15,520
rammed into the back of my brain well actually i guess that would go somewhere in the middle

842
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:23,880
it's hard to keep up these days friends every four months you gotta pry your skull open and

843
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:24,020
it's hard to keep up these days friends every four months you gotta pry your skull open and

844
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:25,540
just shovel money into it

845
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:35,600
smuggling those brain cells the cheap knockoff brain cells from taiwan of course they're you

846
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:40,440
know for the most part they work they work better than intel stuff and they shed like a disease

847
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:47,300
follicle well you do have to keep the socket clean and i tell you there's where you plug it in

848
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:53,260
yes there's an old african remedy that can work for you keeping them sockets clean is just a

849
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:59,100
matter of boiling down the proper roots you can buy in any home improvement store your ace hardware

850
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:04,780
you can buy it you can buy downstairs in the commissary and buy it from the library

851
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:10,780
well what we used to do to keep to keep the the brains from leaking out and get rid of the worms

852
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:17,020
was we'd stew up bananas we'd actually just put bananas in a pot of boiling water and stew them

853
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:22,600
for about an hour and the banana fumes would draw the worms out you'd lean over it over that pot

854
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,060
that's

855
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:32,120
steaming pot that smell like bananas and hold your skull plug closed and the worms would exit

856
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:38,900
through the nostrils they'd smell that banana fumes of banana fumes and they'd come come creeping

857
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:44,080
out your nose and the angelica that synthesizes the banana you have to have the angelica in there

858
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:50,880
is that is that what the worms respond to anyway that's how we got him out of dave and look at him

859
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:52,680
he's playing his

860
00:54:53,060 --> 00:55:00,640
scars are wormless his forehead scars are clean of worms there's nary a maggot writhing in those

861
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:01,540
creases

862
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:10,460
it's not a real prosthetic forehead yes dave's new prosthetic forehead available from the church of

863
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:22,720
the subgenus for only for only 1998. you will barely hear it running and you're gonna be a golfer with

864
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,940
guts to have your head knocked off and spitted to a vortex

865

We had some reports here that there was some scientific testing going on, highly secret.

891
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,640
Can the island really go underwater? Really?

892
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:02,940
Trans infiltration, that's the word we have. He's working on a trans infiltration device.

893
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,580
Now, is this true or not?

894
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:12,620
Uh, some of the aspects of the word we're engaging in does overlap on some of what's popularly called trans infiltration.

895
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:18,740
I see. And how far along is this project? Is he ready to actually infiltrate?

896
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:22,920
Well, our hands are somewhat forward.

897
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:24,100
We don't have a video feed!

898
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,360
What's wrong with Peter?

899
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:28,580
The dome is opening up! The dome is opening up!

900
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:31,500
Run in, Peter! Run in! Now's your chance! Run in!

901
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:35,880

Oh, look at that! My God, that's incredible!

903
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,520
Peter, what's happening?

904
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:44,620
They have me by the arms and they are pushing me inside!

905
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,320
Peter! Peter!

906
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:50,240
...by a black hole...

907
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,480
But now a new world was opened to him.

908
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:52,940
...a minute ago.

909
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:55,160
No problem, Peter.

910
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:03,860
And the door closes behind him. Safe.

911
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:13,300
I just talked to Peter Diddle off the air. He's on the island, of course, and he is inside the T'Cel tomb. Is that what it is?

912
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:16,000
I don't know. The console is all scrambled here.

913
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,620
Come on, read out, read out!

914
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:19,900
